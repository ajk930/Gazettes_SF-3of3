CHATTER L
THE press about the door of the
theater increased as the day wore
on; and many of those waiting In
the front ranks of the queue gave
place to new-comers and aban
doned their advantage. It was a" hot
day of July, and tnÂ© sun poured down
fiercely upon the torrid steps of the
Strand. Whirling dust and the-veno
mous breath of the drc-ught bore wit
ness to the enduring heat and its har
vest of flagging energies and leaden
steps. The bevy of young girls linger
ing about the Eta?e-door of the Casino
Theater envied its sisters who had
gained admission to the Bneitered ce-r
ridor, and waited thc;r turn before the
dread tribunal. Voices were to be tried
to-day; new engagements made for the
great' dramatic spectacle which should
delight London during the autumn
months. Advertisements for artists at
tracted many aspirants. From su
burban purlieus, from offices, from re
mote country parsonages, even from
the kitchen and the scullery; the,
would-be famous came. Ail types, all
conditions of girlhood and womanhood
were to be observed in the throng. Be
draggled mothers, abandoning hope
upon the threshold, tout too weak to
draw back, stood elbow -to' elbow with
stylish "foubrettcs" trained to the
business and vulgar in- their display.
Timid creatures hid -.tnelr faces and
seemed already ' asharried of their mis
sion. But here, and there, one frankly
ambitious spoke of chance and oppor
tunity, of her great desire to "appear,"
and of her belief in a vocation. But
for the most part, a tacit truce of ri
valry prevailed. Each knew that the
other's gain might -be her loss. The
battle was often for" bread. " . : .â¢
Esther Venn had arrived at the ther
ter at a quarter past ten. and flndirys
many already in the corridor bef</re
her. she took a place by the iron gajtes
and waited patiently until she m^ght
be called. Tall and countrified and
very quietly dressed, she was at *nce
the subject of remark; and the pqlodle
dc-s which sat so patiently upon, the
edge of her skirt did not escape some
pleasant comment from tha Vght
hearted girls who would have \ade
friends with him. Some said, not X"
kindly, that dogs nowadays earn more
"money upon the stage than human be
ings, while on* dark-Â«yed beauty from
Clapham expressed the opinion that if
justice were done she would be riding
in a- carriage with a King Charles
spaniel upon her knee. To these and
others Esther answered with what
kindness she could, that the dog would
never leave her: and being strange to
London she had thought it would be
,no harm .to^take hhn to the theaterâa
confession which provoked same merri
ment and not a little instructive chat

The -.retort- -amused . him, and he
stretched out a hand' to Deckon Mou

Judge of men, showed his teeth and
began. to growl. Esther held him firm

consequences.

apologetically. "I'm afraid he's given

He Indicated an open cottage piano
drawn across that corner of the' room
"which was nearest to the door, and
colrnposlng hlmiself in his chair he sat
like onÂ« resigned to, a painful ordeal.
In spite :of her ready answers, Esther
was in such a state^f nervous agita
tion that* her. hands trembled when she
tried to draw off "her "glove's, and the
â¢ few Introductory chords found her fin
gers heavy. as lead. Presently, however,
{ 8he began to sins a' dainty chansonetta
In a voice of singular freshnes* and
charm. Music was wont to carry her
out of herself, but its tpell' to-day
seemed absent, and she had no- heart
for it. Her singing was without verve
or. any depth of expression; she' knew,
its shortcomings: Perhaps an antici
pation of failure already deprived , her
of the will to make an effort. She un
derstood the consequences of refusal.
If she did not obtain an engagement
this very day, to-morrow might, find
her without a roof above her head. Sh*
said that she must do her best; and
-saving it she did her worst. The freea
ing tones in which 'she had been com
manded to sing were in some measure
responsible for this. She felt already
that she hated the perfumed and larded
man who sat at the writing-table. And
his friend, the unknown, who stood in
the shadow of the screen, what was ha
doing there? Esther believed that hÂ»
came out while she was singing and
stpod at the table. It was quite a relief
when a voice said â
"Thank you, that Is enough.**
The unknown was In the shadow*
again when she rose from tho piano.
"It's shocking. Isn't It?" she ex
claimed, with a hard laugh. "I really
think I left my voice In ExeteV." .
Otto Hemming, the manager, did not
take the same view; he was more cour
f'teousâIndeed, almost deferential when
she had ceased to sing. She knew that
she had done very badly, and could not
understand it at all. For an Instant
she really believed that the coveted en
gagement was hers. The I man was
quite polite.
' "You have a pretty voice but it needs
training." he said, in a way that sQ
felt to be not altogether unflattering.

Quite a long whin- passed, however, be

the became aware that a stranger was
standing at her side and waited to
sr>feak to her. Esther looked at the
man questioning]!-. Something in his
mantjer invited her confidence, and she
did net turn away. He was exceeding
ly well-Cressed; his clothes were fault
less; but it was the face of the man
which attracted her, not as one is at
tracted by mere good lc-okg, but by the
consciousness of force and will. Esther
had never seen a pair of eyes which
could at once express so much kindness
or so quickly win her trust. She was
not afraid, not in any way alarmed.
The musJcal voice was a pleasure to
& tn '--. Â¦
my most humble pardon for
this intrusion, iliss Venn."
She started whun she heard her own
name, and put her band upon Mouton'3
collar.
*'I do not know you, "sir," tshe said.
"But you are about to, I hope. My
name is Doctor Xuvier. I have taken

' She did not know v. bat to say, was
confused. acJ not a little embarrassed.
-The stranger, again apologizing, seated
h:n:self u:>cn the bench' and began to
speak quick!y.
"I have followed ycu from the thea
ter because I believe that I can help
you," he fcJJ. "Forgive me, I was in
the room during your interview with
Otto Hemming. I heard you sinsâ a
very pretty voice. Miss Venn; but it

TitleS fir that: you ar? ioo sensitive.
Mouton, faithful dog. pressed close to
his mistress like one who knew her
trouble, and for many minutes she sat
with his face held close to her own,
and # a!l consciousness gone of that
teething world wherein she had failed
ko supremely. Scarcely a voice of Lon
don's life spoke to her in the parks.
The whirling seagulls circled about her
vainly; a beat drifted by with laughing
passengers; there were Idlers upon the
iron bridge; but the believed herself to
be far away from the city. In the sunny
lanes of Devon, where her childhood
had known its only pleasures. How
many years had parsed Bince kjc was
a child! What dark hours she had
lived! Bow little sunshine had there
been in all thefte day* cf "poverty and
struggle. And now it must end In this!
Esther locked nt the water, and bs-
Jieved that the could sleep. She nestled
closer to Mouton ?s though for protec
tion. Yes, it would bo srood to sleep, to
rest, to drc^m. as she had dreamed in
the days of lor.?: ajro. A cense of final
surrender overpowered her; she could
do ncthirrr moi-Â«. the thought. If this
were destiny. .>,j let u ue. She had
done her best.
She was alone, utterly alone. Of all
those thousands who went hurrying
eastward, westward, of all the toilers,
all the idlers, what was her trouble to
.any one? Esther, indeed, believed tnat
this was the end of it all. the end of
those harassing years ot neglect and
slavery, in hor father's house; of the
strife, the hope, the ambition which
had carried her to London to seek her
fortune. She had but a few shillings
left in all the world. Until the rent of
her dismal garret was paid, she had no
right even to the daily bread of which
her need was so great. She was with
cmt friends or even acquaintances of
whom ehe might crave the most tri
fling hospitality. Three months j ago
.she had come to London believing that
.there, at least, pome simple employ
Â¦ment would be open to a cultured girl.
Her mother's death In the winter of
the year severed the last tie which
bound her to the cathedral city. An
unsympathetic stepfather, whose pov
erty and sloth had made her home in-
Tolerablr-, permitted her to go to Lon
don without scruple or doubt. Even at
the bitterest moment of failure, pride
lorbade her to renew that servitude.
As she had sown, so would she reap.
lii London she had suffered; if need ba
in Lundun she would end her suffering.
Ehe walked along the Strand, west
ward, toward Charing Cross and the
rarki. The heat was almost tropical;
the dust choking. She envied those
who could afford the luxury of
Â¦a penny 'bus. The memsst res
taurant, with its poor display, of
fered to her eves the menu for
a king. She had never known what
hunger was before: but to-day the
word had a new meaning for her. She
was afraid to look in the confectioners'
shops; afraid to linger near the eating
houses lest she should be tempted to
draw upon that little store, and to find
hercelf without a roof when night
came. Every step cost her an effort.
She was compelled to stand motionless,
even to rest against a befriending door
lest she should reel and fall upon the
pavement. In St. James Park she sat
at last by the water's edge and uttered
a low cry which was wrung from her
very heart.
"What shall I do? Dear God, what
shall I do?"
CHAPTER II,
Julia viewed this distress with some
alarm; but she did not try to explain
It to Esther. Seating herself at her
brother's side, she took his hand in
both" of hers and conversed with him
very rapidly in the Spanish tongue.
He heard her at first reluctantly, then
with some interest; until, at last, ha
took her suddenly in nis arms and
kissed her.
"Yes. yes." he said in English, "the
day will comeâ I am hastening It. We
will go together."
Esther viewed this little scene with
trepidation, for it suggested some new
mystery of a house which already had
been fruitful in mysteries. She was
quite wise enough, however, to feign
Indifference, and. going to the piano,
sheplryed a nocturne ptanlssimo that
the others might not be embarrassed
by her presence. When she looked up
again. Doctor Xavier had left the rcom
and she was alone with :ns sister, who
appeared anxious to apologize for him.
: "My brother I? very brave," she said;
"but these years of exile cost him
much. He was ence a great man in
Spain, my dearâ not in Spain exactly,
that is. but' In his own kingdom of
Cadi. Ths people would gladly have
him back,* but he has quarreled with
his prince, and I fear It will never b^

' Esther did not at all understand how
a young and penniless girl, whose edu
cation was her own. and who had so
little knowledge, even of her own
country, could help a stranger in such
He took up the violin again and be
gan to play an old-time Spanish dance.
The music held him as by some magic
spell he could not resist. His emotions
were transparent and easily to be read
â love of country, the patnos of exile,
the futility of regret. In the end. an
ger appeared suddenly to master him.
and he ceased abruptly and threw the
fiddle from him.
"Ah, 'my poor Spain!" he cried: "if
you will not have me living, you shall
have me dead."
Madame Julia, as all the househr.id
called her, had .insisted upon sendin.;
for Esther's luggage early in the after
noon, and she would not hear of any
one but- herself arranging with thÂ«
landlady. From the first she "play td
the part of an elder sister, who wished
to put her guest entirely at ease; in
deed, she lent Esther a pretty gown
for dinner and" laughingly declared
that at last it had found a worthy
owner.
"Do not thank me," she said; "you
look so pretty in it. Ah, my dear, what
a thing it. is not to be anxious about
your figure! Mine quarrels with my
dressmaker every time we meet; I
haven't, positively, the energy to scold
it! I am just born for an armchair
and Mudle's!" Â«â¢â¢â¢Â¦.-Â¦
She went on to say that * maid
should be engaged especially for Es
ther; but, meanwhile, Georgine* her
own girl, would do what she could. In
the bedroom, everything that a woman
of fashion might desire was laid- out.
Mirrors paneled the doors of an old
French wardrobe; little lamps, cun
ningly shaded,- flattered the plain and
enhanced the prettiness of the mora
fortunate tenants. Â¦ The brushes were
heavily wrought in silver; bottles of
essence, pots of cream, unknown prepa
rations, of which Esther had not the
smallest need, littered the table before
her glass. She dressed herself with
such simplicity as she could, combing
out that soft brown hair which was
the best of her beauty, and confefsing
to herself, perhaps, that her eyes had
already regained something of their
brightness, her cheeks of their color.
In the drawing room she found Doctor
Xavier, dressed as any civilized Eng
lishman at such an hour; and. thera
being no other guests, they went in to
dinner without delay.
The meal was simple, but served
with necessary elegance. Two of the
dishes, at least, Esther had never
tasted before; she drank but little wine;
nevertheless, she was astonished to
find that the food had stimulated her
in a way quite beyond her experience.
From a sense of doubt and mistrust
she passed gradually to one of confl
der.re and quiet mental exhilaration
Tht -desire to talk came naturally; and
shÂ» found herself, much to her own
astonishment, possessed of an elo
quence of which she had never
dreamed. The Doctor, in his turn,
seemed not a little surprised both at
her learning and her knowledge, and.
turning the subjects skillfully, he led
her from book to book with the skill
of an old diplomatist, who has a pur
pose to serve. In the drawing room
afterward Julia, sang to them, in a low
full contralto which the :onser
vatorfes both of "Leipsic and Paris had
trained*. Esther Tiad rarely heard any
one sing with such delicate phrasing
or such depth of expression: and when
Doctor Xavter himself took a violin
in his hand and began to play one of
Chopin's nocturnes, even her untrained
ear could recognize the master. - By
and by. 'the Doctor put the Instrument
down fdr a little while that he might
talk to her of the music of southern
countries, but chiefly of Spain.
"That which we call the finest music,"
he 'said, "is a matter or temperament.
I hear the Swan Song, but it does not
move me, because I am not a Saxon;
but I would not belittle It. The man
who belittles great things has no in
stinct of greatness. I admit that the
German music is great, but I would
give it all for one bolero from my own
Spain. If we are true patriots it must
always be the same. Put ah" English
man in the wilds of America and ask
him what the wandering minstrel is to
playâ shall It be the 'Song of the Even
ing Star.' or just your 'Auld Lang
Syne.' Ah. I seem to know what he
would say!"
CHAPTER IV.
Â¦pent the sunny afternoon In auch care
less talk, and at five o'clock tea was
served to them in an arbor by the
lawn. Esther did not see Doctor
Xayier again "until dinner time; and
although she looked up often to the
windows of the pavilion, the figure
which had so frightened her did not
reappear. She fell to wondering at last
if it had been merely her Imagination.
Nevertheless, the impression remained.
She knew that there was some secret
of this house she had yet to mathom
Perhaps in her heart ahe believed that
it was an awful secret.*
Eethcr said "Thank you very much,"
and drawing off her glove again, she
took the pen which he offered her and
wrote her name and address upon a
little slip of paper. Another applicant
was already in the room before Ehe hod
finished; and receiving an abrupt dis
missal she crossed the bare stage again
to the lisht of the day. The throng of
applicant* t- till pressed close in the cor
ridor; the stout lady still aired her bib
ulous grievances. No one spoke to
Esther or so much as noticed her; and
calling Mouton to her side Ehe went
out to the tropical heat of the Strand
fend knew that she was alone.
"Not the slightest. Miss Venn. I wish
â¢you better fortune. You have the
prerence '. for the stage but not the
voice. Frankly, the employment that I
.cctfld offer you is not such as you

tired. Come upstairs and let -us begin

'She would, not hear a' denial, and led
the way upstairs to a pretty bedroom,
from whose windows the garden of
roses and -the fountain- dreamily
splashing in the sunlight were more
plainly to be seen. Of other houses
there was not a trace. Esther might
have been in an old French chateau a
hundred miles from cities -. and men.
: "My brother loves beautiful things,"
Julia said, helping her to take off her
hat, "and pouring , water for- her In a
basin of the daintiest French china. 1 :

are "tired now, and there is the lunch

â¢ Musical bells chimed softly from the
halls below, "an octave deep and sonor-*
ous and pleasing, like th* chimes from
an Italian campanile. Esther. had little
preparation to make, and she tidied
herself quickly, and said that she .was
ready. She felt that she ought to be
ashamed of her shabby black gown;
but the : kindness of these people, their
simplicity and friendship, forbade any
thought of that kind, and .she went

main long in the city; and, turning to
her, he asked her how she would like
,to gro.to Spain. ; ;
"It is my country," he said, "al
though I, am 'an exile at this moment.
My English was learned in America at
Harvard Universityâ to which I owe
my education. I say education, but no
man Is educated at a university. His
education is Nature's task. She teaches
him every day while he lives. I have
asked you to my house to help me In
such' self-imposed studies. We will
charter a university together. My sis
ter shall be the bursar and feed "us."
,"It is the only merit be allows me,"
said Julia gayly. "If I wish to make
my brother angry. I ask him what he
will have for dinner. Oh, my dear." just
think what we women have, suffered
because of men's dinners! You are
lucky to.be in the' laboratory!.. I. envy
Francis his _ books sometimes."
"And yet she will not read them for
five minutes together." said the. Doctor,
not unkindly. "There are no novels
there. Miss Venn. Beautiful princes do
not. expire at the feet of languishing
damsels. I have not a single book
which bewails the loss of the baro
ness' diamonds, or extols the, gentle
man who stole them. Pity my misfor
tunes! I -told you that I was a pupil;,
it is for you to teach me."
He turned the subject with a laugh,
and went on -to ask his sister of>her
day and its programme. Would she be"
at home to dinner? "Was she going to
the theater afterward? As for Esther
she would, perhaps, be glad to rest to
day. - The Doctor suggested a ham
mock in the garden amid the roses: tea
should be served there at .five o'clock.
Esther must ask for anything she
wished; the whole house was at her
disposal. When he had suggested other
plans for her comfort, he withdrew to
his library, and left the girls together.
Julia, in spite of herself, appeared to
be more at ease in his absence; she
took Esther by the hand, and went out
into the garden with her.
It must have been three o'clock then,
and the delicious hush of the summer
afternoon was everywhere to be felt.
Esther thought the garden not less
beautiful than she v had imagined It.
The grass, she said, was the softest
she had, ever trodden upon. The masses
of roses were bewildering; rare- blooms,
some of them familiar, some unfa
miliar, shed a delicious fragrance upon
the balmy dr. The fountain cast a
spray of an unknown essence which
cooled the atmosphere and added to
its perfume. The silence was intense,
and in some way almost unnatural.
You could not hear any sound at all
from the streets around. The quaint
of the pavilion looked down
upon you from every side. It might
have been an uninhabited house; and
yet Esther quickly** discovered that it
was not. Indeed, she*, was still gazing
curiously at these oddly-shaped win
dows, when a face appeared suddenly
at one of them, and instantly arrested
her curiosity. It was the face of a
young woman, a hideous, distorted and
yet singularly pitiful face. For ah in
stant the figure appeared at the case
ment, and was then dragged back as
though by an unseen hand. Esther,
she knew not why, started at this sud
den apparition. It "was just as though
a voice had said to" her, "Beware!"
Who was this girl? "What was she do
ing in the house?
'Now,' it chanced that Julia still
wrestled with the ropes "of the ham
mock during this momentary' scene;
and so both her companion's astonish
ment and the subject of it" -were not
observed by her. Esther, â¢ troubled as
she was, had already made up her mind
to say nothing about It. A shrewd wit
told her that if she were really in dan
ger confession would not help her. She
could not imagine that such a man as
Doctor Xavier would trap a young girl
for any felonious purpose. Neverthe
less, there was something about the
house and its people which baffled her
understanding and awakened her sus
picions. Terrible as her situation had
been but an ( hour ago, she was not
quite sure that this change was for the
better, and- very greatly apprehensive
and doubtful, she listened to the merry
Julia and her gossip.
"There's one thing we're expected to"
do in this house, and that is to make
ourselves comfortable," she said, sink
ing down upon a pile of cushions and
arranging her books upon her knee.
"The Doctor believes in the art of life,
and while it gives me what I want I
am his faithful disciple. You do not
know what a clever man he is, dear.
I often read in the papers about other
scientists, and wonder if they know
half as much as Francisco Xavier.
Beautiful things have been the passion
of his life. Day and night he lives for
them. There is not any beautiful art
of which he does not know something.
Those sketches you saw in the dining
room, they were all his work. He has
written music which has been per
formed in the . theaters of Milan and
Paris. While you and I sleep here this
afternoon he will be In his laboratory
and perhaps â you never can tell â dis
covering something which might as
tonish the world to-morrow. It is my
misfortune. I try to Interest myself in
all these things, but I am just a help
less creature, and it cannot be helped.
You, I believe, will take my place; I
know he wishes it. A woman can help
sometimes where a man is useless."
"I shall do what I can to be useful,"
said Esther, a little eagerly. "It was
very kind of Doctor Xavier to offer me
this engagement, and I am only too
desirous to prove myself grateful. But,
you see. he has never asked me what
I can do, and I fear I'm not as clever
as he thinks me. My eaucation has
been all my own. I taught myself In
the library which my stepfather used
to keep at Exeter. Except for this
visit to London, I have never been any
where or seen anything. Of course. I
could write Doctor Xavier*s letters
and, perhaps, help him with his books;
but I really have no talents, Miss Julia.
I am not a clever girl."
"The Doctor doesn't want a clever
girl; he wants a willing" one. Your
only duty is to obey him, my dear.
Whatever he asks you, obey > him al
ways. He Is very kind and good; but
I never wish you to see him angry.
Remember, when he Is cross, that he
has suffered much. â¢ His own country
has not treated him well. I do not
think he will ever go back there. Tou
and I must make his home happy in
England. I am sur.e we c^an do that If
we try."
Esther had hoped that she would
speak mbre of the Doctor, and par
ticularly of her own duties; but Julia
Xavier could never talk for more than
five minutes together on any one sub
ject; and now she went rambling off
to speak of theaters and singers and of
the world of ; restless fashion wherein
her own part was so well played. They
riage door, surprised her by.antlci
,patlng' tHe^questionr^ *
""You afe wondering' why I have no
windows" he asked, with a laugh.
"Well, come : inside and . I will show
you." / .
He held out his' hand, and she en
tered the house with him. An elderly
butler, English' and well trained, took
his master's hat and cane and ; asked
him if he. had lunched. Esther heard
the carriage driving away on the,
gravel path and then the, heavy oaken
door .was shut with. a clang behind her.
She trembled a little at the sound, for
she had never, seen so curious a hall as
that in which she now stood; the
vision of the garden . beyond was like
that of fairyland.
: "You are anxious about my win
dows," said the doctor, lightly; , "well,
you see,. AveUke an eastern light, Miss
Venn, and make one. It is not pleasant
to have neighbors who count the days
when your curtains go to the wash!;
Observe! you have never seen the' sun-'
. ligl\t shine i so softlyâ is it not' beauti
ful?" , .-..-.-
Esther perceived now that the. house
was ' built in Â»the Italian styleâ a. qua
drangle about a spacious garden. Two
great windows lighted the hall; but
.they were upllke any windows she. had.
ever, seen or read of. An exquisite
glass ; of the faintest roseate hue per
mitted the rays of light to stream
down through a device of crystal and
green leaves, â¢ so cunningly placed that
the whole apartment glowed with the
gentle radiance of the softest tints,
more restful to the eye, more pleasing
than "any light that could be imagined.
Elsewhere all was fantastic and sur- 1
prising. Masterpieces of art caught

ty ,to.-day. They multiply _and spread;'
the city thrusts out Its" arms"; "the
woods, the rivers, the pastures perish.
In time this England will be one stif
ling city. Those who love solitude will
find It after many days. . 'A thousand
years ago a forest thrived on. this very
spot. You could have built a hut and
lived" a week without seeing a'man.
Nowadays, there are twenty families in
the hut and a man must go far afield

We shall make the journey together
and study as we i go. I will show you
solitudes of mountain and valley which
years of travel and labor have pur
chased. The book of nature is In many
volumes, Miss Venn;-, few* read it
through. We should be all" the better
if we did. We should not write such
stuff as that â we should.despise.it!"
He took a yellow-backed volume
from the leather-case before him and
turned its pages scornfully. It was a
work upon the decadence of the cen
tury; the triumph of a gloomy German.
"This fellow has gone to the letter
B.l^the stranger went on; "he writes of
the human swamp. He should have

"I am not a doctor â I am a pupil.
My page is not in the written book, it
is in the life, the light, the humanity
about us. The earth is my school, the
heavens are my university. *.I.do not
study men's bodies; I seek to know
their minds. All that the field of na
ture can give for the happiness of
mankind, that is my subject. No, I am
not a doctor. Miss Venn â I am a child,
groping blindly for the light which is
hidden."
"And you think that I could be of
service to you in your studies, sir?" :
"I am sure of it. That is why I am
here. Consider, you are familiar with
books â boc-ks are meat and drink to
me You like beautiful thingsâ I can
not live without them. You are cast

business? Let us begin with . that.
Business first and friendship after
ward, yes. it must be friendship after
ward. Miss Venn."
He laid a gentle hand upon her arm
.->.s though to bid her follow him. When
Esther looked up, she beheld a pair of
kindly oyes which seemed to say, "I
have need of you." Mouton, her dog,
laid his shaggy head upon the strang
er's knee and began to make friends
with him. She accepted the omen and
made up her mind without further de
lay.
"I will go and see your sister," she
said.

trivialities of life. ,. Your success will' be
made another way; it will be in an

to offer.lt to youâ In my service, in that
also of my sister. You are wise enough'
and clever enough not to regard this
as an impertinent intrusion, j I am sure
you will permit me to continue.",
He waited for her to speak; but ahe
did not know what answer to make to
him. Conflicting emotions of surprise
and joy forbade her to express herself
as she wished to do. She sat with
heightened color and beating heart, un
able to thank him or even to say
"Yes." He understood her difficulty;
he did not misconstrue it. '
"You do not answer me," he con
tinued. "I appreciate your silence.
London is a terrible city for those who
fail. Miss Venn. The successful know
little of its darker eldc; it is left to the
unsuccessful to discover it. The Ca
sino Theater could write a history
â¢which few would have the courage to
read. I heard many pitiful stories
there this mornftig. They are better
forgotten. Whatever we may do or
wish, there will always be millions of
unfortunates in the world whom we
cannot help. The pleasure of helping
even one should be a privilege. If you
decide to help me, please regard it in
that light."
She turned earnest eyes upon him;
the compliment both surprised and
pleased her.
"To help you!" she cried, amazed.
"Oh, no! it is you who are offering to
help me!"
"Not so, Miss Venn; nothing of the
kind. Your loss of a possible career will
be my gain. I am asking for all your
time, your talent, your fidelity â I do
not offer you any great reward. The
only return I can make Is the shelter
of my sister's house, a home, friend
ship, the society of cultured people. If
you consent to my proposal, the rest
will be easy. We will settle it at home
in five minutes. My carriage is over
there by the palace gates."
Esther looked toward the spot he In
dicated and perceived there an elegant
sinsle "brougham drawn by two roan
horses. She felt instinctively that she
was at some crisis in her life. She be
lieved with the religious faith of her
childhood that this encounter had been
foreordained for her salvation and se
curity. Willing to say "Yes," and to
say It from her very heart,' neverthe
less a certain prudence restrained her.
Why had this man come to her?
Whither would he lead her? There was
so much to ask him. She did not know
how to begin, fearing greatly that a
question might give offense.
"Your offer is very kind," she said.*
nervously. "Will you think me un
grateful if I ask you something?"
"You have every right to do so."
"You speak of employment in your
sister's house. What should I be ex
pected to do there?"
"You would be expected to assist a
man who is trying to do what he can
for the human race â especially for your
sex."
"You are a doctor: is It In connec
tion with your profession?"
He rested his arms upon the broad
handle of his ebony cane and looked a
little wistfully across the waters.

the rays of electric lights, cunningly
placed, and showed their finest details.
The mats were Eastern arid of sur
prising softness. Flowers stood every
where; the rarest orchids, the loveliest
blooms, so perfectly chosen, so artis
tically rriatched, that the color-scheme
was never, marred or vulgarized. Es
ther said that she had entered a won
derland. A fountain splashed in the
garden shed a delicious perfume upon
the air. Her weariness, her hunger, left
her at the door. . The very silence was
bewitching. London seemed , so far
away. When the doctor spoke again,
she started at the sound of his voice.
"I can see that you like my house,"
he said, well pleased. â¢ "Women are al
ways the children of first impressions;
and you are no exception. When we
have had lunch, I will show you some
of my curiosities; but first I must in
troduce you to my sister; she is very
much alone here, and will be glad of a
companion."
He struck a gong twice while . he
spoke, and the reverberations had
hardly died away when a well-dressed
woman descended the stairs and came
up to him with outstretched hands.
Esther, Judged that she was about 30
years old, a brunette, with a ' Spanish
type of face, an abundance of black
hair and the whitest of teeth ' which
showed a ; little prominently when she
smiled. .Her ': eyes were deep set and
dark and her manner buoyant and al
most girlish. Doctor, Xavier kissed her
affectionately and then led her for
ward to Esther.
!- "My sister JuttV he said; Vthls is
Miss Venn, Miss Esther Venn. You
must learn to know each other quickly
âyou will have so many hours to pass
together."
; Julia took Esther's hands in both her
Ah, if she had known , what days
awaited her in the Doctor's house!
. The talk was all 'of common things
during the -luncheon Hour. Doctor
Xavier ate little; and drank less; but
he had a fund of anecdote which was
inexhaustible ; and he gossiped . now of
Europe, though ; much of it was beyond
her' understanding. She gathered from
it that he had been a traveler In many
countries, and . that his residence in
England was' but accident!' which, in
some way, he lamented. He spoke of
downstairs with a confidence which
quite surprised her.* Luncheon, she
discovered, was already served in the
dining-room upon the ground floor.
The scheme of this room was entirely
white, with chairs and curtains and
carpets of the richest crimson. Here,
as in the hall, bewitching effects of
light were contrived by rantastlc win
dows. A few sketches hung upon the
walls, and each had its own lamp above
that its finer work might not be lost.
The glass was Venetian, green as a
tulip's leaf. Esther noticed how
brightly the silver shone, and how
rarely chased' was the great goblet -by
the Doctor's plate. The whole room
Impressed her with a sense of luxury
carried to the last point, but not vul
garly nor obtrusively. The wine she
drank was the golden Valdepenas; it
stimulated her flagging energy, encour
aged her sense of happiness,* and re
newed her unspoken expression of grat
itude. What had she done to deserve
this change of fortune, so sudden, so
supreme? But an ' "hour ago she be
lieved that her life had been lived; and
now a young girl's courage lifted her
up to new scenes of success and ambi
tion. How she would . work for such
friends as these! How she' would serve
them! : 4 v
Esther knew little of London, and
had lost her reckoning in the excite
ment of an experience so new; but she
was aware that- the carriage had
crossed Oxford street and thence had
driven northward toward Regent's
Park. When at last it stopped, they
were at the doors of a low-pitched
house which stood behind high walls
and was Bhut in by heavy wooden
gates. A little garden faced the door
and displayed a wealth of common
gillyflowers and. sweet-smelling. shrubs.
In shape as many dwellings round
about Esther's sharp eyes . at orice
observed in what way v the doctor's
house differed from them. It had no
windows, she said; at least the "win
dows were all bricked up. This cir
cumstance of Itself troubled her not a
little, and she could not Imagine the
reason of it. . Why should any one fear
the sunlight, 'a scientist of all others!
She was still trying to satisfy herself,
when the doctor, standing at the car-
masters. Let us help them to. come
quickly. It is possible to do so!"
Esther had never heard any one talk
like this. She did not realize at first,
perhaps, how much the personal mag
netism of the speaker attracted her, or
haw very closely she was listening to
him; but she was conscious of a desire
to listen and of a sense of mental in
feriority which she had rarely experi
enced in the presence of any other
man. Her suspicion 'that the doctor
talked merely to avoid her own curi
osity was quickly put aside; for his
earnestness convinced her, and she
co-uld not resist the spell of his voice.
For that matter, the journey, was all
too short; and when the carriage
stopped, she had quite forgotten her
doubts. It remained for the house it
self to awaken them.
"We think alike," he said, while they
drove rapidly northward toward Ox
ford street and Marylebone. "lean see
that we observe nature from the same
standpoint; It is a good, beginning and
will help us. You, at this present mo
ment, are telling yourself how beau
tiful the park Is looking; I am saying
that it would be beautiful if there were
no people in it. Heflect how men and
The carriage waited near the gates
of Buckingham Palace; and a footman,
in. a neat black livery, summoned it
when the doctor appeared. Esther waj
not accustomed to the formal and ex
aggerated politeness with which Doc
tor Xavier now treated her; indeed,
she had never ridden in such a carriage
befc-re, and her sensations were those
which she could neither describe nor
wholly enjoy. Had she been quite sure
of the wisdom of the step she was tak
ing, the experience would have been al
together pleasurable; but the offer had
come to her with such dramatic sud
denness, it was so surprising and unex
pected, that she neither realized it nor
believed altogether in Its good faith.
True, the immediate necessity, the
dreadful despair which had tormented
her an hour ago, were already of the
past and forgotten. She was going to a
home, whatever it might have in store
for her. No longer would it be neces
sary to scheme for her daily bread in
the garret which sheltered her. Grate
ful always, she was very grateful for
this respite. The excitement of the
jtrurney fascinated her and was not to
be resisted. Again and again she asked
herself, "Where are we going; what
does he really want of me?" Dortor
Xavier, on his part, said nothing to
abate this curiosity. He treated .her
from the first with a de'ference to
which she was quite unaccustomed.
The polished manners, the courteous
phrases of the born gentleman pleased
her and were not to be resisted. Her
knowledge of men hitherto had been
gained from the provincial city. This
man was unlike any other she had
known. She could not imagine her
title \o his homage and regard. He ad
dressed her as one no less learned than
himself.
CHAPTER III
2at the impression which his study made
upon her.
"I am quite ignorant of science," she
said, after a little pause. "If there is
anything that I can doâ write your let
ters or look after your books, I am sure
I should do it very willingly, is it help
of that kind you want?"
eyes did not impress her less than when
she had first looked into them. In any
assembly of men. she thought, Doctor
Xavier would have been a commanding
presence, both by right of Intellect and
natural gifts. Power the face suggest
ed and with power the will to com
mand obedience/ and to insure It, the
right to lead other men and to enjoy
their confidence. Esther was not afraid
to return . the glance of such a man,
she never doubted him. At the same
time, she did- not believe that he could
wholly win a woman's affection.
"I shall be very glad to help you.
Doctor Xavier, If I can," she began,
determined to bring him to the point
"Will you please to tell me exactly
what I am to do for you? I think it
would be better to begin that way."
He turned in his chair and rested his
chin upon his elbow.
"Yes," he said, "that Is necessary.
Let me be as brief. You are here to
assist me with scientific experiments.
Miss Venn; to benefit by them, I hope."
Esther's heart quickened a little when
she heard these ominous words. Sci
entific experiments might mean so
much. Her experience suggested, to
her that they could not be unattended
with danger.
Julia took her hand In her own and
drew her v close as though some new
bond of love already united them.
"Nonsense, nonsense!" she protested.
"Whatever my brother does is for thÂ«
good of humanity. Don't you see, you
dear little child, how much happiness
would come into the world If women
could be made more beautiful? And
you â you are the sweetest subject a
man could have! We shall be so proud
of you, Esther; you will always be re
membered as the brave girl who did
this service for your sisters. Ah. my
dear, if It is wrong to desire beautiful
things, then we are very wicked peo
ple! But I shall never believe it: I
shall always say that Francisco Xavier
is a leader among men."
Esther did not quite trust this ready
woman of the world, belie^ng her shal
low and possibly a little fickle: but tha
arguments themselves were very plaus
ible, and, indeed, a similar process of
reasoning had guided her that day.
After all, she said, if it were really
with scientific truths that the Doctor
wished to experiment, and she would
suffer no harm because of them, there
was no good cause why her consent
should be withheld. A lover of com
promise always. It occurred to Esther
that she might give a conditional ans
wer, keeping to herself the right to
withdraw It If anything were done of
which her woman's instinct might b4
ashamed. In plain words, she deter
mined to tell the Doctor that she would
try to serve him; but that the right
must remain to her to say **no" when
his experiments offended her. Never
theless, she was not prepared to con
fess as much to Julia; and she took
refuge from the argument in silence.
There had been a few light showers
eirlier In the day; but a delicious fra
grance of the later afternoon account
ed for a splendid park, and for a very
cavalcade of open carriages. London's

trudge the gravel paths by the Achilles
statue when' first she came to London,
and now she remembered how she had
admired the rich equipages and the
wc-nderf ul gowns of the great women
who looked down upon her. The
change which a day had brought In*?
'her life was almost beyond her com
prehension. Here she sat dressed as
those others whose names were on
every tongue. She, too, could now look
down on many a poor creature who
welcomed the shelter of thÂ» trees be
cause she dreaded the discoveries of
the garisn sunshine. The carriage in
which she rode had come from Paris,
and nari sent many an order i* it*
fashimablc builder. The roans had
cost Doctor Xavier seven hundred
guraTas. Esther observed that her
companion was everywhere recognized
and saluted. Women stared after the
carriage a little enviously; the men re
garded it with obvious favor. Esther
was glad that she was not compelled
to speak to any ui these people. She
was greatly afraid when the carriage
stopped by Rotten Row that some
chatting woman 'would be presented to
her, and. perhaps, ,wish to know her
story. None troubled them, however.

makes him. We are to be more than
friends now; we are to be sisters. I
shall call you Esther and you will call
me Julia. There will be so much to do
between thi3 and the end of the sea
son, and we sha'n't have a minute to
spare. Oh. my dear child. Just think of
the gowns you must buy! Here'*
Homburpr not a month off, and after
Homburg our shooting 1 party at Dou
vaine, and then the Villa Cara for the
winter; and after that â who knows. It
may even be my own dear Spain and
our palace at Cadi. And you must
have gowns for all of themâ oh, the Joy
of .it, to begin with nothing! And I
have such a wardrobe full that I could
clothe a city! * I envy you!"
Esther was a little surprised that her
consent to the Doctor's proposal should
thus be taken for granted, for she had
not said a word that would Imply con
sent: and, indeed, her answer was still
to be made. She judged, however, that
it was not the time to speak of It, and.
avoiding the subject, she endeavored
to question her companion for her own
enlightenment
"I am sure that Doctor Xavier Is both
clever and kind," she said, in a wln
ningly simple way. "What I fear, dear
Julia, is whther one is right to do as
he wishes. I have always been taught
to be afraid of vanity; and, indeed, I
am very happy as I am. Even If your
brother succeeded in his experiments,
surely I am not the best subject hs
could choose."
At five o'clock upon the same after
noon. Julia, remembering her promise,
drove out with Esther in a pretty vic
toria drawn by two roan horses; and
as they went, the loquacious creatures
had a hundred things to talk of.
Scarcely had the gates closed behind
them than she confessed that she had
seen her brother and had been delight
ed to hear t.-f Esther's asquiescence in
his plans. Of this, she said she had
been sure from the first.
CHAPTER VI
book-rack swung from a silver chain,
so close to. Esther's hand that she could
take a^book from It without rising:.
A cottage piano in satlnwood. Inlaid
and richly painted, faced her when she
entered. A flagon of the clearest crys
tal had been filled with yellow wine:
a goblet stood near It upon it3 little
table. Except for the door to the Doc
tor's study, and the long French win
dows which gave upon the lawn, Esther
could detect no other entrance to the
room. The laburnum trees by the wall
and the bushes round about forbade
her to see that side of the. house where
in the living rooms were built She
might have been in the heart of a gar
den a hundred miles ' from the city.
Birds from many countries hopped
from wreath to wreath- of the roses
above her and showed no fear at her
presence. The murmur of water fall
ing was restful to the ear and like a
lullaby. The Doctor did net fall to ob
serve its effect upon her.
"This is your room," he repeated;
"and you will be the mistress of It I
see that you would like to be alone and
to think of all I have said to you. The
morning is the friend of clear thought.
Miss Venn: to-night at dinner you shall
give me your answer â yes or no."
He quitted the room, closing the door
sharply behind him. Esther was left
alone to hear the splash of the fountain
in the marble basin, the twittering of
the birds in the silent garden.
He crossed the room, and drawing a
curtain back disclosed a paneled door
of which h^ held the key already in
his hand. Esther had started up at
the words "operating room," for she
half believed that it would justify her
evil anticipation, while, in the same
breath, she could tell herself that she
was silly to be afraid. The Doctor,
perceiving: her hesitation, threw the
door wide open and bade her enter.
"Come." he said, "it is not so very
dreadful. I am sure your courage will
be equal to it" --"'
Something In his tone reassured her;
and calling upon her courage she went
over and stood at his side. Ah, that
dreadful theater! It was smothered in
Gloire-de-Dijon roses from floor to ceil
ing. Esther's wildest dream could not
have surpassed the ' surprise of it A
fragrant perfume, rich and pungent,
came to her through. the open door, and
would have been overpowering but for
a delicious - spray, like a shower of
sweet rain, absorbed by the air almost
before the marble fountain cast it out
Gentle breezes of the summer day
stirred amid those gold-white leaves
and were sucked in by the silent fans.
Long windows, giving upon the shel
tered lawns, permitted a vista of tree
and -flower and bush, like a scene re
mote from men In a forest's heart In
deed, a wizard's hand might have cre
ated this picture for a fable of the
splendid ages. , Esther could but stand
entranced, fearing to set foot upon that
carpet of flowers of to disturb the per
fect beauty of that chamber of roses.
It was not real, it could not be, she
thought;, while the Doctor, in his turn,
did not take his eyes from her. Sur
prise and delight were written upon
her astonished eyes. She had a young
girl's ' imagination and could ' people
this quaint retreat with the figures oÂ£
a forgotten dreamland. When the Doc
tor told her that the room Was her own,
nothing. could keep back her cry of de
light ; r :',/i%
"My own roomâ mine!" she said.
He took her hand and led her into it.
"Your own â to be the mistress of It;
to come and go when you will, some
times, perhaps, to invite others; but
your own, first and foremost. Let me
see you. take possession of it Come,
this sofa is just the place to think out
a difficulty." ,.*i . ;''
He led her across the room to an
Ivory sofa, which was but a shell
smothered In roses : to such a depth
that, when Esther sat. she appeared to
sing In a very bed of leaves. Her
quick eyes were already examining
every nook and cranny of this new and
rare possession. The walls, she saw,
were paperless; but wreaths of the yel
low roses hid their nakedness. There
was no carpet but that of the glorious
flowers. A table of jasper. In the cen
ter of the room, carried a huge bouquet
of the sweetest blooms. By her side
stood an. immense lamp of silver, so
placed that the light of It must fall
upon the sleeper's face. The marble of
the fountain, which played in an alcove
near the window, was white as snow,"
unblemished in its purity. A hanging
who wishes her happiness. She will
let me carry all her burdens in distress
âif that were possible beneath my roof
âshe-will come to me, and I shall share
her most trifling doubts/ She will be
honored in this house and make it her
home. Miss Venn, may I say this of
you?" Â£*%Â£
Esther clasped, her hands upon her
knees, and regarded the Doctor with a
troubled look. The plain truth was that
while his words should have satisfied
her just doubts, that which she had
sean â and especially the face at the
windowâ were present in her mind to
perplex and distract her. Nothing that
the Doctor had proposed, she thought,
might not be undertaken by an honest
girl; but he had spoken of failure. Was
it possible that the face she had seen
from the garden was to be connected
with this!
"I should be very sorry to appear
ungrateful," she exclaimed suddenly;
"but I really do not know what to say.
I am a little frightened. Doctor, and I
cannot help It. You said something to
me about those who helped you before.
Would it be very dreadful to fall?"
He divined her difficulty instantly.
She has seen something in the house,
he thought He knew that it made it
more difficult.
"Ah." he said, "I put It clumsily. I
talk of operating rooms, and you think
of a hospital. I speak of failure, and
you imagine personal suffering â per
haps illness and disease. See how a
man who desires to be frank may mis
represe'nt himself. You believe that I
am asking much â courage" to face
dreadful things, penalties, distress. Let
me here and now assure you, as I am
a man of honor, that none of these
things exist If I fall, you will remain
with me if you wish, or go to your
friends, the same gentle young lady
that I have found you. Others have not
done so, I admit; but their own follies
were responsible for their misfortunes.
They would not submit, and they suf
fered for it. Science. Miss Venn, is not
to be trifled with. She demands all or
nothing. Those who have assisted me
would have taken the middle way. For
the time being, they are punished; but
the punishment will pass, and as they
came to me. so, at length, will they
go, neither better nor wiser. For you.
I fear no such failure. Once your mind
is made up, you will succeed. I am as
sure of it as I am of myself." .
He bent toward her and appeared to
exert all that indomitable power of his
will which few were able to resist.
Esther decided, she knew not why, that
this man would never harm her. He
compelled her already in some measure
to share .his own enthusiasm. The
quest of beautiful things, the right en
joyment of God's gifts could never, she
thought, be wrong. And yet she had
so much to ask him. She was con
vinced that she could never quite ex
press her doubts.
"I wish I could believe In myself as
you believe in me," she confessed at
last. "It is all so new, so strange. I
would like to say 'yes.' but all sorts of
Billy things prevent me. You see, Doc
tor, I have not the least Idea what you
really want me to do. How can I help
your, experiments? I have no knowl
edge except the little I have got from
my father's books; it would seem child
ish to you. If I were clever. It might
be otherwise. I should be so fright
ened of my stupidity; perhaps it would
spoil everything."
He laughed at this frank avowal, be
lieving that he had won her.
"When the flowers bud in the suns
of May," he asked, "what cleverness
of theirs helps them? When the sky at
sunset is aflame with golden arc, is it
Nature's gift or man's accomplish
ment? You can help me by submis
sion, Miss Venn; you can help me by
doing nothing. Come, I will show you
the operating room; it will frighten you
very much, but afterward you will be
braver."
hesitate to cure the leper because in
health he will be less repulsive? Ah,
no; you will never say that! Like all
young people, your judgments are im
pulsive, and the argument comes after
ward. At this moment you are telling
yourself that I am a common quack
who would sell a powder or a paint to
a credulous public. It is the poorest
compliment you could pay me; but
your young experience is sufficient
apology. Understand that. if you de
cide to be my fellow-worker, it must
be of your own free will and not upon
compulsion. I am "a servant of science
and I would make disciples. If I at
tempt to do something which 1 no sci
entist has done before, it will not be as
a charlatan 'but as a pioneer.- The smile
cf the grafted flower' is the simplest
that I can put before you. I would add
to Nature's gifts; but I would add
naturally. The beauty that I can win
from the light and the water and the
earth is to be won by a natural law
which I shall make known â¢ in due
course to other students. In my oper
ating room I believe- there are pro
found secrets. When you have thought
it over, you shall tell me If you wish
to master them with me."
Esther's face blanched when she
heard the words "operating' room"; for
it suggested to her the stone floors and
the dreaded tables which she had once
seen in a hospital. She but half rea
lized the logical sequence of the Doc
tor's argument, and ths impression that
was on the point of sleeping, when she
became aware that a face regarded her
from the open door, and that a man
with the complexion and dress of a
Moor peered in at her as she lay. Had
Esther believed that this apparition
was anything but that of a dream, she
would have fled the house upon the in
stant and never re-entered it. but a
confidence she could not explain, some
spell cf the light deprived her, for the
time being, both of me power to rise
and of tne wit to think. Surprising as
it was she did r.ot feel infany way
alarmed. The face did not frighten
hf-r, she had no fear of the man who
watched by her bedside; and telling
herself that it was all imagination, she
fell suddenly into so heavy a sleep that
all the scene was instantly blotted out,
and not one memory of it remained.
When she awoke the birds were sing
in? in the garden, and the fountain
splashed merrily. Sunlight fell upon
the western wing, and busy servants
were crossing the quadrangle. Esther
scarcely remembered that she had
dreamed, or if she did, she never
doubted that it was a dream.
She laid a little emphasis on the
words almost as one who would utter
Â« warning, and this was not lost upon
Esther. Indeed, when she went up to
her own bedroom at eleven o'clock and
found herself alone, tne whole events
of that strange day recurred to her
one by one like the papes of some ex
citing story she had read in her child
hood. How different it had been yes
terday! Then she stood upon the
brink of a woman's supreme tempta
tion. No certain Lome v.-as open to
her, no prospects in this groat heart-
Jess city. She had been driven from
door io door like an outcast whom
none would harbor. All her fine
schemes of success and advancement
in London turned to asUes. and were
b!cv.n away upon the winds of de
spair. Tlie long hours at the doors of
the theater, her rejection there, the
bitterness of failure, were of too recent
occurrence to be forgotten. She knew
that she had suffered greatly, and from
suffering had passed almost with fabu
lous swiftness to the extreme of joy.
Employment, shelter, good friends, c-f
these the Doctor had spoken when he
Invited her to his house. And was it a
true messare? Could she believe it?
This silent beautiful house appeared to
invite her to rest and forgetfulness.
Misht she trust In that appearance?
Was there nothing beyond tt which a
woman must dread? Esther did not
dar<? to deceive herself s.cr 'ar. There
must be a secr:t. she thought.
She undressed at her leisure and re
luctanll. turned out the lamp by ncr
bedside, when at last a little weariness
helped her. It was so nosolutely quiet
in the room, the summer's night fell
eo still that not a leaf seemed to stir
In the garden, nor a whisper of the
trees made itself heard. For quite a
long while she lay seeking to win sleep,
but failing: to compose herself. Once
s-he thought she heard a soft footstep
upon the landing outside, and she
started up in affright and listened in
tently for many minutes. Reassured
by the silence she laughed at herself
for such babyish alarms, and lay back
to dream again. It must have been
very late when at last she fell into a
pentle slurr.ber, and she had not been
asleep very long when she awoke
again, but without fear, and not un
willingly. Very greatly to her surprise
she discovered that her roemvwas now
liphted up by a soft mellow light,
which at first she believed to be moon
light shining down upon her bed. In
this, however, she was mistaken, and
when she had lain a. tittle time, he
w-in hed by the translucent beams, she
perceived that they fell from an aper
ture in the wall in a spreading arc of
green-white light so soft and gentle
to the eves that Esther seemed almost
to be in some dreamland, where every
thing- entranced and pleased her. Anon,
she felt' that the light compelled her to
Bleep in spite of her desire to remain
awake. She closed her eyes and
cpened them again, tossed and turned
a little restlessly, tried to wake up but
failed to do so. The Bpell was irresisti
ble. She had no will to resist it. and

plied; "he can almost break his heart

as en? who appeared unwilling.
"I am not clever; I fear the Doctor
â¢is mistaken in me," she protested. "Of

that I exn to wait, I will do as you de

"I will think -it over, willingly." she
said. "I fear I am, very, stupid, Doc
tor. But then, you see, I never thought
very much' about 1 my appearance. Do
you really believe it is possible, to make
a woman beautiful by natural means?".
"I believe it is so, I am not sure.
You are very plain with me, and I will
try to be no less honest Twice al
ready I have failed in my experiment.
You say, " perhaps,*' that I have no
right, therefore, to continue. , If J be
lieved that the failure was my own
and not that of the patient; I should
accept your view. But I do nothing of

who worked with me could not- think

Estherhad heard many times' in her
life of people who had claimed to make
women beautiful forever; . but they
were always spoken of as Impostors
and many of them, she knew, had been
justly sent to prison. , While it. was im
possible to believe altogether that Doc
tor Xavicr was such an one, neverthe
less, she was greatly frightened by his
c6nfession and this she did not attempt
to hide from him.
"Oh, but Doctor," she said with al
most childish simplicity, "how could I
help you in that?" .^ !r
He had looked for Just such an ans
wer from such a subject; indeed, it
seemed < to" please him, â¢ and with great
gentleness he continued: - -
"Pray hear me to the end, Miss-Venn,

give him limbs? Is it wrong to graft

amused at her offer.
"No," he said, "it is not help of that
kind, Miss Venn, j It is a service which,

Esther" was delighted " to listen. Her
desire to know became almost impa
tience.'
"Yes," he went on, "I am a peculiar
person, Miss Venn, principally because

have an abstruse subject. I believe
that I am on the threshold of some dis
covery which will be helpful to my fel

He threw himself Into one of the
great armchairs near to the sofa upon
which, she was sitting, and stared at
her In a wav;that she would .have re
sented from any other. For the first
time now she could analyze his fea
tures and form her own ideas of his
age and character. She said that he
would be nearlng his fortieth year. Not
a single vein of gray could be detected
In the thick black hair which fell in
natural curls about his well-shaped
head. His skin was clear and fresh,
almost like a . boy's. The wonderful
A pretty gown of French muslin had
been laid upon a chair In Esther's
dressing room while she slept, and she
found other witnesses to her maid's
industry and the forethought of those
who harbored her. Everything had
been prepared for her upon the lavish
scale which the later day art of luxury
demands in a rich man's House. Esther
was so unaccustomed to anything but
the barest necessities that this pro
sion bewildered her, and she dressed
timidly like one who is afraid of a gift
arid the price which must be paid for
It. Nor could the fail to contrast her
fortunes of to-day with those of yes
terday. Then she put on her shabby
gown in a dismal attic overlooking the
Tottenham Court road- Her neighbors
had been the poor tenants of the mean
houses, the poverty-rtricken, and the
starving. The very breezes came to
her laden with the city's grime. The
green lanes of her own Devonshire
seemed so far away. To-day she awoke
In a palace of the story books. Marble,
exquidtely white, paneled her bath
room, water ran clear as crystal in her
bath of porcelain, the fragrance of
roses perfumed the sweet air of morn
ing, the launs below ner window
t.aupht up the dancing beams of light
and hid them in a heart of emerald.
A eense of rest and happiness pos
sessed her., and was not ..part from
siatitude. What right had she to be
In such a hous*. or to enjoy such lux
uries? To what end were they offered
her? She could not answer. There
must be the- secret, she thought.
Esther had no watch, and she did
not know what time it was, nor If the
others were already about When she
had drtssed herself, and taken one last
T>cetÂ» in the glass, without any great
thought of her appearance, she went
dovn stairs a little doubtfully, half be
lieving thct it was very early, and that

CHAPTER V
she was mistaken, cs an English chub
by-faced boy-in-buttons, whom she dis
cc-vered v in the hall, hastened to assure
her. Esther could not altogether ac
count for it, but the presence of this
English lad reassured her. She asked
him who he was, and he answered lo
quaciously:
"I'm Billy, miss; I blacks the boots."
"Then please to tell me what time it
is, Billy?"
Billy wiped a very black hand* upon
a cheek scarcely whiter.
'It's ten o'clock." said he. "or eleven
â call it somewhere betwixt and be
tween, miss."
The intelligence was a little vague;
its deficiencies did not occur to Billy.
"They won't say anything to you,
'cause you're new," he went on. "I al
ways get up when I wakes, but that
ain't early enough for 'em! You'll ex
cuse me not blacking your boots, miss,
'cause they're brown. I know I ain't
done rightâ Billy never does!"
Esther assured Billy that he was a
paragon of wisdom and went on into
the dinir.g room. Madame Julia, whose
ample figure carried a dark green rid
ing habit well enough, sat already at
the table reading her letters: but Doc
tor Xavier was not there, nor had a
place been laid for him. Esther had
been prepared to apologize for her late
appearance, but Julia would not hear
of it. saying that it was Liberty Hall,
and that every one came down exactly
whÂ»n he or she pdeased.
"I never dress until I wake: that's
Irish, my dear, but true. When you
get to my aso, you'll snatch every hour
of sleep you can and be glad of it.
Imasrine it, I am thirty-three next
Mbrch, and every hair of my head is
beginning to say, 'Passe! Passe!' In
five years' time it will be somebody
else's hair, and I shall be resigned."
Esther laughed with her and felt
ereatfy relieved. Whatever her doubts
had been when she was alone in her
own room, the presence of these gentl*
people invariably banished them. '< Her*
was a woman, whom she had seen for
the first time yesterday, treating her
with greater kindness than she had
ever known in her life. The refine
ments of the household, the luxury of
her surroundings, never once troubled
Esther with any recognition of social
inferiority or dependence. She was re
ceived just like any honored guest.
Madai;.e Julia posed as a merry wo
man of the world, who had an old
friend to entertain. She talked of balls
and theaters and of the friends she
had met in the Row that morning.
She premised Esther that they should
drive together at five o'clock.
"We'll go into the Park before din
ner; and I must try and persuade the
Doctor to take us to the theater after
ward. He is dreadfully difficult, my
dear. -When you are as old as I am,
you will say that all men are. If you
will, they won't; and if you won'tâ
well, it depends upon their will! I am
one of the miserables who have to
obey. I often wonder if any one in this
world is brave enough to contradict
my brother Francisco!"
She did not know what these few
Eimple words meant to the young girl
who heard her. When that wooden
door closed upon Esther yesterday with
such a dismal clang'. It had seemed like
the door of some prison opening rarely
to the world without. But if they were
to drive in Hyde Park, if they were to
go to the theater, what possible cause
had she for alarm, Esther asked her
self. Could she not leave the house
any day, go back if she would to Lon
don's solitude and the vortex of her
misfortunes? She knew that she could.
She was half afraid of her liberty.
The remembrance of that garret was
like that of some prison cell from
which a friendly hand had delivered
her. She prayed God that she might
never go back there.
"We will meet at lunch, my dear,"
Julia continued, when breakfast was
done, and the list of the long letters
had been twice read. "You must go
to my brother this morning and see if
you cannot help him, He is waiting
for you in the laboratory. If you do
not feel equal to it/ please tell me so,
and it shall be another day. But I am
sure he would be very glad if you went
this morning."
Esther said at once that she would
be delighted to go. She had come to
the house to make herself useful, and
her habits of industry did not brook
delay. To this Julia answered that her
brother would be well pleased; and
waiting only to gather up her untidy
letters, she conducted Esther at once
across the quadrangle, and they stood
at the door of the laboratory. Esther
has confessed in later years that this
morning of waiting at the Doctor's
door was one she would never forget
to her life's end. Hitherto, she had
been unable to imagine, in any way,
the services which Doctor Xavier
claimed of her. That they were of a
'common kind, the house and its ap
pointments forbade her to believe. If
they were secretarial duties, nothing
. would have been easier than to say so
at the first interview; but deeper mat
ters were hinted at, and now they were
to be made known. Esther trembled
in spite of herself when she entered
that strange room. She knew from the
first that it was a clever man's holy of
holies; but the reality surpassed her
imagination. *. - >. a
Let us follow her to a vast apart
ment, windowless but gloriously light
ed, though the lampa which illumined
it were Invisible. A mellow radiance,
white and soft and pleasing, flowed
down through sT frieze of crystal, fan
tastically cut into shapes like those of
fabulous diamonds. Hangings of gold
green silk fell in many folds and hid
the paneled walls behind them. The
oddest statues, bizarre, fantastic, some-,
times horrible, figures brought from
the distant East, brazen gods from
Burmah, the finer .work of European
artists, filled the corners and decorated
the ledge beneath the frieze. Of the
common appurtenances of a scientist
few were visible. A microscope stood
by the Doctor's table. In : an alcove,
to which a flirht of steps led up, a
dome-shaped roof covered a great tele
scope and its machinery. There were
Eastern lamps finely wrought in silver,
whose wicks flowed In baths of per
fumed ofl. An immense circular mir
ror, swinging upon a bright steel chain,
stood close to the writing table, and
Esther perceived near by it that which
looked like a magic lantern of unusual
size. The carpet was green In tint and
very soft to the tread;, the chairs
matched It. large and luxurious and
inviting sleep. The writing table was
Chinese, oddly carved, but singularly
beautiful. Esther noticed in one of the
corners a bent figure, emblematical of
life; and this appeared to be falling
downward to the. ground with a hand
outstretched to mark the hours upon
a silver disk. This she thought to be
a clock, and she was not mistaken.
Doctor Xavier himself seemed amused
"Yes," he said, anticipating her ques
tion, "I tell the time by that.
the figure droops and sleeps, my day's
work is done. It reminds me that I
am human, and that if I ask of my
humanity too much, I shall fall as that
inanimate thing; but, unlike it, shall
not rise again. Come, Miss Venn, that's
not a bad lesson to begin with. Please
to sit in that armchair and think of it
a moment. I have a letter to write/'
Esther sat down in the chair without
saying a word. The room did not in
vite loud words. Even Madame Julia
scarcely dared to venture there; she
stood with one hand upon the knob of
the door until her brother had spoken.
Then she nodded encouragingly to Es
ther and withdrew. For many min
utes doctor and patient might have
been in ignorance cf each other's pres
ence. The silence was broken a.1 length
by the Spaniard, who turned suddenly
in his chair and asked a question.
"Well," he said, "I find an exemplary
patient. She Is full of curiosity and
she does not say a word. She sees
that this is a very strange room and
is too polite to remark it. Is not that
so. Miss Venn? You are saying that
it is an uncomfortable place?"
'"I was thinking it," replied Esther,
frankly; "it is not uncomfortable, but
peculiar."
"Exactly, peculiar. The abode of a
rnan who does not like the sunlicht.
3for quite a long time, and while Julia's
eyes were everywhere, and she nodded
continuously to her friends and named
them for this great person or that,
Esther was very willing to be a faith
ful listener, and to hide herself from
observation, if that were possible. She
had. indeed, just congratulated herself
that they would escape with the merest
recognition, when fhe observed her
companion flush suddenly, whether
with surprise or pleasure she could not
tell; and Immediately afterward a
young man, dressed as other idlers
about him, but remarkable even In
their company, stepped up to the car
riage and heM out his Hand like one
well pleased at an unexpected recog
nition.
"Mademoiselle Julia!" he cried, "is it
really Mademoiselle Julia?"
Julia had turned away for a mo
ment, as though she did not wish to'
be seen, but when the young man thus
addressed her, she turned toward him.
and answering in French she said:
"Oh, your Highness!â can it really
be you in London?"
The newcomer laughed good-humor
edly, and, leaning upon the dashboard
jf the carriage, he fixed his eyes not
upon Julia, but upon Esther by her
side. She, on her part, tried to avoid
his glance and to appear preoccupied;
but something in the face attracted
h^r. and she discovered herself, to her
;;nnoj-ance, staring at him continually.
"Yes," he went on, still in French,
but so slowly that she could under
stand him without difficulty, "yes, I
am in London, mademoiselle. You,
perhaps, will know the reason why."
Julia did not respond immediately to
this appeal. She appeared to be much
distressed, and anxious to terminate
the interview.
"I do not know the reason, Prince,"
she protested, and then she added, "I
im sure my brother Is no wiser."
The young man's face ctouded at the
words, and he could not conceal the
embarrassment which her answer put
upon him.
"I thought your brother would have
written before," he continued almost
reproachfully; "but there Is some ex
planation, no doubt. If the Doctor
would care to make it to me. I am at
Claridge's Hotel. Please take my mes
sage to him, mademoiselle: It would be
in three wordsâ 'The Prince regrets.'
Can you remember thatâ 'The Prince
regrets?' "
Julia's face regained some of its lost
color and Bhe appeared to win back
her confidence.
"You cannot regret as he regrets.
Highness. 1 am afraid It is all too late
now â the past has made the future.
But I shall deliver the message â oh.
yes. it Â¦.ould be "ust to you both."
She drew herself up with a dignity
which astonished Esther not a little;
while the Princeâ for thus he had been
addressed â hesitating for a few min
utes, turned to Esther at last and said:
"Pray present me to your charming
companion."
Julia had forgotten even that she had
a companion, and she started at the
mention of her name.
"How rude of me â how very rude!
Of course, I will present her. This is
my friend. Miss Venn â Esther, dear.
His Highness, the Prince of Cadi."
Esther had never been so troubled
In all her life. She did not know what
to say, what to do. She was not sure
â¢whether she should offer her hand or
withhold it. Very wisely, therefore,
fehe said nothing, and the Prince, after
a few commonplace remarks, bowed
and withdrew. Julia at once ordered
the coachman to return, and they drcve
away rapidly toward Regent's Park.
It was evident to Esther that her
friend was greatly troubled. The meet-
Ing had quite upset her. She admitted
as much by and by.
"This will be very unpleasant news
for the Doctor, my dear. He has
dreaded something of this kind ever
since he came to London. You must,
like a good girl, just go away to your
own room when I tell him. He and the
Prince were old friends, child. They
quarreled a year ago; I have never
known why, but I am sure my brother
â¢was not in the wrong. You can im
agine how much it grieves him. I am
trembling like a child at the thought of
telling him."
Esther saw that it was true; and she
was very glad when the carriage en
tered the drive of their house, and the
doors once more closed upon her. The
butler Bald that his master was in the
study, and Julia went there at once;
while Esther ran up to her own room,
and finding Mouton, her dog, waiting
wistfully by the window, she sat down
in a low chair and took him upon her
knees.
"Oh, my pet, what strange things
are happening to us!" 6he said, In her
childishly philosophical way. "Where
are we going to, Moutonâ what's to be
come of us? Who are these people?
Will they be our friends?â tell me, Mou
ton. tell me. teU me!"
The dog laid his paws upon her lap,
and looked up into her face as only a
dog can look. Across the court Esther
â¢ heard the sound of voices, but chiefly
that of Francisco Xavier himself, now
cious Julia at once began to satisfy
her curiosity.
"There's been a dreadful scene, my
dear, I knew there would be. Francis
believed that the Prince was in Madrid,
and he is very angry with him for
coming to London. He neglects his
country, my dear, and it will end in
ruin. I told you how they quarreled;
and I am dreadfully rrightened that
harm may come c-f it. If the Prince
should call here, I dare not think what
they would do. You must be his good
angel, Esther; you must be kind to my
brother now."
It was like the chapter of a romance
to Esther, and she was surprised at the
interest with which she found herself
listening to this candid admission.
That come mystery attended the pres
ence of the young Prince in London,
had been evident to her from the be
ginning; and these fragments of the
truth but whetted her appetite for
more. She was ashamed to tell herself
that her Interest was in the man and
not in his country, of which she knew
nothing; but fehe was aware that this
was the case, and she tried to hide it
from Julia.
"You said that Doctor Xavier and the
Prince were old friends, dear Julia,"
she answered presently. "Will they
never be reconciled? I don't under
stand it, of course; but I always think
that when people have quarreled it is
better for them to meet and speak to
each other. I am sure that your
brother would not . bear animosity
against any one."
Julia shook her head.
"The kindest of men are the slowest
to forgive, Esther. My brother has
suffered much at the Prince's hands;
he has been patientâ too patientâ for
years. I do not think he- will ever for
give him. If he does, it will be because
you ask him to."
The words astonished Esther more
than she could say.
"Because I ask him, dear Julia! How
can it concern me? Oh, I am sure that
I should never ask him!"
"Never be sure of anything, child.
I used to be sure of things a few years
ago, but I am not so rash now. Fran
cis Is hoping so much In you. He
She dressed at leisure, knowing that
she was in good time to-day. Her
work would begin after breakfast, and
her anxiety that there should be no de
lay had awakened her at an early
hour. In the garden below gardeners
were gathering the rose leaves and
watering the lawns. Esther fell to
wondering how many servants there
were in the house, and was busy with
her reckoning when some one knocked
upon her door; and believing it to v be
the maid, she said, "Come in." To
make to him. His face was unusually
pale, and there were dark rings be
neath his piercing eyes. She imagined
that he had suffered much in the few
hou.j which had passed since they re
turned to the house; but she had no
heart to answer him unkindly. For
that matter, her mind was already
made up to remain in a house where
so much k||)dness was shown her, and
she permitted the Doctor to assume
her consent, merely saying:
'I trust not; indeed, I am, quite con
fident of it. You will find me a willing
pupil, Doctor Xavier. I could never
forget what you have done for me."
"You will forget it at once," he said,
protestingly. "It is my first command.
The favor is on my side; it is I who
should say, 'Thank you.' We will dis
cuss it no more. The piano is open
sing to me, camarade; I like to hear
your voice."
Esther went to the piano obediently;
and while Â»he*sang she perceived that
the Doctor sank back upon the sofa
and closed his eyes like a man trying
to win rest. Truth to tell, a little wear
iness had fallen upon tnem all, and
when eleven o'clock came, even Julia
was ready for bed.
In spite of her new anxieties, and of
the unknown future looming before her
so mysteriously, Esther slept a dream
less sleep from which the sun of morn
ing alone awoke her. Her first thought
when she awoke was one of relief that
no silly imaginings had troubled her
sleep. The false moonlight must, after
all, have been pure imagination. The
Moor, whose face she thongnt to have
seen at her door, was surely a crea
ture of her fatigue and trouble. She
dressed this morning with greater con
fidence; and when she opened her win
dow, and the sunshine fell into the
room, and the perfume of the roses
floated up upon the sweet breeze of the
day, she confessed that it would be
difficult to find so beautiful a home, or
one in which a young girl might make
herself so happy.
Moor was a very old man. Esther
remembered the moonbeams which had
fallen upon her while she slept. It
would be natural, she thought, that
Doctor Xavier should employ strange
agents. And, he would not employ one
â¢whom he could not trust. She deter
mined to tell him the whole story di
rectly they met.
"Is it Doctor Xavier's orders that I
am to go to the bath now?" she asked,
determined that the man should not
find her afraid.
The Moor nodded and led the way
down the corridor.
"Yes, yes, now," he said; "his Excel
lency wishes it. You are to go to the
bath three times every day â his Excel
lency's order. I will conduct you."
He had turned to the right at the end
of the passage, and following another
corridor he showed her a quarter of the
house which she had not yet visited.
She was still very much perplexed by
all that had happened; but the new
scenes to which she was Introduced
quickly put it out of her mind and oc
cupied her interest. For the Moor had
descended a flight of marble steps
which brought them to a low arched
gate of bronze oddly decorated with
figures of nymphs and centaurs. Upon
this gate he knocked twice, and when
some one unseen opened to him, he
said:
"Enter, Senorita, if you please. They
wait for you."
It was evident that he was to leave
her here; and she confessed herself not
unwilling to be relieved of his pres
ence; Indeed, she counted the bath in
which she now found herself as not the
least of the many surprises of that
strange house. Esther at first believed
it to be a Turkish bath, although one
of unusual magnificence; for she had
read accounts of these in her father's
books, and had known women who had
ventured into such a bath in her own
city. Her curiosity was instantly
awakened, and she found herself impa
tient to gratify it. A rotunda of con
siderable altitude, paneled entirely with
white marble, lay just beyond, the
gates, and Esther observed with pleas
ure the clear cool water of a plunge
bath stirred into gentle ripples by a
murmuring spray, which fell from a
Cupid's wings. A luxurious couch,
heaped up with cushions, offered rest to
the bather; while little tables at its
side were littered with books and ivory
knick-knacks. The ceiling itself was
dome-shaped and gilded; windows of
rich stained glass permitted a changing
whose taste she recognized, was min
gled. Esther said that the same medi
cine, whatever it was, had been admin
istered in one of the sweets at dinner
yesterday. The flavor was not up
pleasant, and the effect of it was to in
duce a slight sense of languor and the
desire to rest. Just as at the mid-day
meal she had been stimulated, so this
morning and last night at dinner sleep
had been Invited. Indeed, the atten
dant at once led her from the gymna
sium to a low, vaulted mosque-like
apartment upon which it gave, and
here informed her that the bath was to
begin.
"There are' three processes, made
moiselle," she said: "first the vapor,
then the massage, and then the elec
tricity. Try to rest here, and to sleep
if you can. The bath do you a
great deal of good. You will be very
much refreshed afterward."
She made a sign to one of her assis
tants, and instantly the room was
filled by a soft vapor of steam, grate
ful to the lungs and pleasant to
breathe. Esther reposed upon one of
the long marble couches with a wooden
pillow beneath her head, and she now
folded her hands upon her breast, and
inhaled the refreshing steam. The ben
efit of this was both Immediate and re
markable. Esther had never known,
she thought, what it was to fill the
lungs to their utmost capacity with air
that both soothed and stimulated her.
She breathed for the very pleasure of
the act, long, satisfying drafts which
expanded her chest and sent the blood
coursing swiftly through her veins.
Her skin, at first harsh and dry, anon
became soft and pleasingly moist. She
experienced that pleasant content with
all the world which follows rest prop
erly employed. That any one should
resent such treatment as this, or deem
It to be empirical, never occurred to
her for a moment. Tne Doctor had
promised her that . she should be the
servant of science. She admitted that
he was keeping 'his promise, and she
knew already that she had to deal
with a master-mind. It was very still
and silent in the room, and the sere
nity of mind with which she could view
her past and the future she had chosen
for herself astonished Esther. She fell
to wondering what success would
mean. They had not called her pretty
at home, paying her that poor compli
ment of saying that 1 her face was
"pleasing." She knew that she had un
usually beautiful hair, and that her
skin was naturally fair and soft; but
Doctor Xavier was not at the dinner
table, nor did Julia offer any explana
tion of his absence. Esther imagined
that she did not wish to speak of it be
fore the servants, and in this she was
right: for when coffee had been served
in the white and gold boudoir, and the
exceedingly loneful-looking butler had
withdrawn from the room, the loqua-

would not hear me at all until I men
tioned your name and told him how
pleased I was that you were to stay
with us. That made him forget his
troubles. He will have something to
work for now. He will not think of
Spain all day."
She went on to say that science had
always been the Doctor's recreation.
Even when he had governed a king
dom he had given his leisure to scien
tific pursuits. Medicine owed him
much; he had discovered many new
drugs and employed them successfully.
In the medicinal use of electricity he
was a master. He hoped to confer
many benefits upon the human race be
fore he died; and he now gave his
whole time to the work .
"We shall stay in London until the
season is overâ of course I would not
leave before, dear â and then we shall
go to Homburg and the mountains.
I envy you who have never been to my
own dear South! Here, in England,
you do not know what sunshine is; it
is cold and flat, and, oh, so dull! We
live in the South; we are musicians,
artists, singers; we gather flowers in
the valleys and breathe on the hills.
This London suffocates me. If It were
not for my brother, I would go away
to-morrow. But he admires your doc
tors. He says he can study here. The
libraries help him. And now he has
youâ oh, my dear little Esther, I love
you for saying 'yes'!"
Esther, in fact, had never said "yes"
at all; but she was not courageous
enough to disturb her friend's happi
ness, and she began to see that her
own "yes" or "no" went for very little,
and that these people already took her
consent for granted. f Indeed, when
Doctor Xavier entered the boudoir at a
later hour, he at once crossed the room
to her and thanked her for that which
she had never promised.
"My sister has made me very glad
to-night," he said, laying a hand upon
Esther's shoulder and almost whisper
ing the words. "I knew that I had
found a little friend and comrade, but I
wished her to tell me so. We shall be
gin our work to-morrow morning. I
trust that you will never regret it,
camarade."
Esther scarcely knew what reply to
"We are nothing:, my dear â we have
our bread to get, Mouton, and we must
do our duty. Oh, help me, my pet, help
me to do right!"
Mouton gave her an answer in a
warm caress, pressing his shaggy face
close to her own. Together they
watched the twilight ran; and think
ing still, it came to Esther suddenly
that if she remained in the house, she
might see the Prince of Cadi again.
rising as in a hurricane of anger, anon
dying away to tremulous silence. In
the garden long shadows fell upon the
closing blooms and the restless leaves.
Esther's thoughts went hither, thither;
now to the bower of roses which was
her own to live and dream in if she
willed; anon to the momentous choice
she must make, and from that to the
stranger who had spoken to her in the
carriage. She had not seen many men
in her uneventful life, out this one she
thought she would remember, however
long she lived. It was not a mere
question of fine presence; he was so
unlike any man she had ever known.
His dignity of manner, the quiet gentle
acts, his kind and thoughtful face re
mained firmly set in lier memory. She
knew she could repeat every word he
had spoken. She saw him again with
his elbow resting upon the dashboard,
and his dark eyes searching her own,
and that indefinable something which
is the first link in the chain of a wo
man's affection. She hoped that It was
not by any right of birth that he had
thus earned a claim upon her memory.
She did not think that it was. She
knew that he would already have for
gotten her if, indeed, he ever gave her
a second thought. And this she con
fessed tb Mouton witn just a little
sadness.
light to fall upon the tessellated pave
ment. Facing the entrance, Ksther ob
served a flight of steps leading from
the frigldarium to a smaller apartment
wherein water flowed In silver basins,
and here were marble benches for the
bathers with douches and other appa
ratus. One of the attendants of the
bath, quite a young girl dressed in a
long blue wrapper, had received Es
ther at the bronze gates: and while
she spoke English it was with some
foreign accent which made her a little
difficult to understand. There were
others with her, young also and simi
larly attired; but they appeared to be
Japanese, and Esther did not hear
them speak. Her guide quickly inti
mated that which she wished her to do.
"We will have the drill first, made
moiselle, and then the vapor. The Doc
tor has prescribed this in your case.
You will please to undress and put on
your gown. Another day you can come
straight to us from your bedroom. It
is proper to rest as much as possible
in the bath. You can ask me any ques
tions; but please do not talk more than
is necessary."
Esther undressed as she was Instruct
ed, and having put on a loose robe of
muslin . and felt slippers, such as are
worn in Eastern baths, she followed the
attendant down the stairs and through
the lavatoTium to a bright open room,
which served the purpose of the Doc
tor's gymnasium. The accessories of
this were such as Esther had always
associated with gymnastic exercises;
but when she came to use them, she
observed the difference. The Indian
clubs, which the attendant now put
into her hands, were provided with
soft sponge-like grips, saturated with
some liquid which had a pungent odor.
Esther remembered the Arabian Nights
and how that a doctor had cured a
king by such an old device as this.
She did not, however, use the clubs
with any less confidence; and when
her body was in a glow, the attendant
led her to a curious swing, wherein,
seated In a wicker cradle with her feet
resting upon a second bar, she was
bidden to swing herself for a specified
time. From this she passed to a fa
tiguing exercise, where light weights
were lifted gradually from the floor
and as slowly set down again. The
grips of these also were found to be
saturated with the eame [ pungent
liquid. These exercises continued at
Intervals for some twenty minutes; and
when they were finished she was given
a glass of milk with which some drug,
this invitation, however, no one re
sponded, and when the knock was re
peated, she crossed the room quickly
and opened the door.
"Who Is It?" she asked.
A voice answered her out of the
darkened corridor:
"Senoritaâ the bath is ready."
She peered into the gloom, afraid to
credit her senses. At first glance, she
could only distinguish the long white
robe and the piercing black eyes of a
stranger; but, anon, the face took
shape. She detected a brown skin and
gleaming white teeth; and lower down,
the long, bony hands of the Arab. Es
ther knew that she had seen this man
before. His were the eyes which had
watched her while she slept. She re
cognized all too clearly the oval face
and the bronzed features â and she re
cognized them with a fear she dare not
express. Indeed, her heart beat rapid
ly, and the room seemed to swim be
fore her eyes when she said:
"What do you mean â what do you
want with me?"
It were as though this silent, threat
ening figure devoured her with a
plance. As she receded, the man ad
vanced. Esther had never been so
frightened in all her life.
"The bath Is" ready, Senorita. I am
Yussuf, his Excellency's servant. The
girl breakfastsâ I come to tell you.
Please to follow me."
For a little while Esther neither
moved nor spoke. "Why had this man
dared to enter her room last night? she
was asking herself. "Why had the Doc
tor permitted it? What reason could
he give? She was angry, dazed, and not
a little terrified. Her first idea was
that she would quit the house at once,
fly from it as from an abode of danger
which she had no right to face. Then
her simple womanly logic came to her
aid. Why should she not question the
man? ' .
"I have seen you before," she said.
"You were here last night. Why did
you take the liberty?"
The Moor showed a row of gleaming
white teeth and smiled all over his sun
bronzed face. After all, he did not look
a very dangerous person.
"Do not be atraid, Senorita. I am a
very old man. I have twenty wife in
Morocco. His Excellency wished you
to sleep. Old Yussuf must obey. He
lights the sleep-lamp. He makes the
bath, Senorita. Follow him and he
will show you where."
It was an Incoherent story, but Es
ther took heart at It. Certainly, this
she did not believe herself to be
the world would call "good-lookhÂ» v
Should the Doctor justify himself a
all, her future might be greatly
changed. Esther had always under
stood the power which beauty bestows
upon a woman. She would have been
untrue to her sex had she not wished
very much in her heart that the Doc
tor might succeed. His experiments
already interested her beyond her
hopes. Her curiosity had been awa
kened, and 6he would have been very
sorry to have drawn back.
The half of an hour passed in these
silent meditations, and at the end of
that time the attendant returned and
invited her to go to the lavatorium.
Here the Japanese girls were waiting,
and they at once took possession of
Esther; and placing her beneath a re
freshing spray of lukewarm water,
they began to massage her. Esther
had not understood until that time
what massage meant; but she quickly
became aware of Its beneficent results,
and of the skill of the operators. Nim
ble fingers chafed every muscle of her
body. Flasks of perfumed oils were
opened and rubbed gently upon her
skin. The face especially interested
those about her; and one of them, ap
parently chosen because of her greater
cleverness, eat down at Esther's side,
and bidding her shut her eyes, she en
tered upon the task like an artist who
has a picture to make. For a full
hour, at least, the work went on. Es
ther did not fret at the delay, nor find
the process tedious. Her body was
now in a warm glow, like the body of
one who has been engaged In active
and healthy exercises. She felt stronger,
capable of exertion and mentally alert.
A second glass of the milk being ad
ministered to her, she was then led to
that which her attendant called "the
chamber of lights." Here electricity
proved to be the agent of those experi
ments in which the Doctor had so
greatly interested himself. Esther per
ceived that the walls of this room were
toned to a delicate shade of green. A
single armchair, placed in the center of
the apartment, had for its neighbor
that which looked like a giant magic
lantern. From a switch-board attached
to one of the walls many electric wires
fed little lamps In shape like telescopes.
All the attendants grouped themselves
about Esther when she entered this
room, and began to fix the lamps on
iron stands and to focus their rays
upon her. Presently she sat In a very
bath of light. Beams of intense bright
ness, like those from miniature search
lights, warmed her flesh and seemed to
pierce her through. The exquisite col
ors which dazzled the eyes were in
themselves a pleasure to behold. Es
ther thought that all the hues of the
spectrum were shown to her while she
sat there. Now golden, now deep pur
ple, anon a radiant blue, bewitching
shadows of pink, the whole gamut of
the beauty of color revealed Itself to
her. When her eyes were dazzled by
the light they covered her head with a
silken veil, and so played with the
beams upon her neck and arms. She
was conscious of great warmth, but
never of a temperature that was hurt
ful. A stimulating current of elec
tricity coursed through her body and
acted upon every organ. Mentally, the
effect was bewildering in its swiftness.
Esther felt that she could face any
peril, dare any venture by the help of
that unseen force which now animated
her. Her natural timid and retiring
disposition gave place to a courage and
self-reliance most welcome to her. And
this was the remarkable thing that
these attributes did not at once pass
away when the bath was finished. Up
stairs in the frigidarium, the young
girls dressed her anew in a long morn
ing gown from Paris. They gathered
up her hair, and bound it with a gar
land of flowers. A Jeweled brooch, with
the word "remerclments" set in bril
liants, she received without question,
although she knew it was the Doctor's
morning gift to her. By what process
of reasoning It came about, she could
not say; but she began to have a great
delight in the very risks of those ex
periments. The luxury, the exhilara
tion of it all cast a spell for good or ill
upon her. The long mirror above the

never would have known. She began
to say that Doctor Xavler might yet
make good his words, and confer upon
her a gift whose price she did not carÂ©

In the frigidarium she rested for a
full hour. It was twelve o'clock when
they opened the bronze gates and told
her that the task was over. She had
not breakfasted, and was very hungry;
and she heard with pleasure her atten

"Breakfast is served "In your own
room, mademoiselle. The rest of the
day Is your own. Doctor Xavier is
away to-day â you are your own mis

Esther crossed the sunny garden,
scarcely knowing if aHe were awake
or dreaming. No one appeared, and
the absence both of the Doctor and the
loquacious Julia confirmed the attend
ant's words. In her own little room
she found a harvest of roses no less
rich than of yesterday. The fountain
still murmured and cast a refreshing
spray upon the cooling breezes. But
more welcome still was the breakfast
set out on its snowy clothâ the golden
wine, the lucious fruit, the snow-white
bread. Esther sat at the table and be
gan to eat with healthy appetite. The
scene, perhaps, was still unreal to her,
the change beyond her Imagination.
She would have been entirely happy In
it, and no longer regretted the consent
she had given, but for that silent voica
whlc"i still would ask. "Must no pricÂ«
be paid; is there indeed no secret?"
She knew not; she knew nothing
how could she? â of the terrible days
before her.

John Bassett Moore, LL D., contin

American diplomacy in Harper's Maga

Commercial Restrictions" he relates
from inside, official sources the first en
trance of our commerce into the Chi
nese, Japanese and Korean markets.
He tells how America, through Com
modore Matthew C. Perry, made the
first treaty with Japan after the most
ingenious diplomatic advances on our
part; and the first treaty the hermit
kingdom of Korea ever entered Into
with a Western nation was made with
us in 1SS2. through the admirable dip

One of the grave questions that the

The powerful Chinese Six Companies
is already at work in the interests of
its vastly lucrative traffic in Chinese
labor, and there Is every reason to be
lieve that the same lavish expenditure
of wealth will be made during the fall
that has marked the policy of this pow
erful and dangerous body in past
years. In view of this fact Dr. Charles
Frederick Holder's brilliant, exhaustive
and fascinating historical sketch of the
Chinese Six Companies, entitled "The
Dragon in America," which occupies
the place of honor in The Arena for
August, will command general atten
tion, and to citizens of California. Ore
gon and Washington it will occasion
particular satisfaction. Hitherto there
has been much heated controversy on
the Chinese question, but seldom it
ever has the true Inwardness of this
issue been so ably and so Judicially
presented as has been done by Dr.
Holder In this remarkable paper. Cer
tainly never before has the un-Ameri
can character of the traffic In Chinese
labor been so clearly pointed out.
For many years the August number
of Scribner's Magazine has been the
fiction number of the year, noted for
its selection of the best short stories
obtainable, with the most beautiful and
elaborate Illustrations in color, and In
black and white.
The Issue of this year is a remarka
ble one. It contains short stories by
Rudyard Kipling, Edith Wharton,
Thomas Nelson Page, Josephine Das
kam Bacon, and others; serials by
Robert Grant and Nelson Lloyd, and
poems by Henry Van Dyke, John Fin
ley and E. S. Martin. Certainly no
more distinguished list of writers has
appeared together in a single number
of a magazine.
Kipling's story is naturally bound to
raise comment. In this he carries the
peculiar imaginative quality displayed
in "The Brushwood Boy" to still diz
zier heights of psychological sugges
tion. It is a question whether In do
ing so he has not sacrificed clarity to
the novelty of his concept. "They" is
anything but easy of understanding at
first reading.

concerning the particular identity and

this simplicity of thought and diction

Through another and a unique fea

rhymes in his book seek to lead the
little one into an understanding of
some of the beauties of nature and a
sympathy with nature's creatures. For
example, the dainty little imaginative
verse on "The Columbine":
Five doves the 'fairies took away
To the deep, dark wood one summer day.
And they hung: them up on a slender spray â
Again this:

Very closely does Miss Barton follow
the details of the Red Cross operations
on Cuban soil from the time its shjp,
the State of Texas, anchored off Guan
tanamo before the first battle in the
hills until the last bit of relief work
was done in conquered Santiago. One
cannot but b e struck with the fact
that had it not been for the Red Cross
the mortality and suffering attending
the siege of Santiago would have been
triple what it was, for a reading of
Miss Barton's account emphasizes the
utter inadequacy of the medical staff
to cope with the situation with its mea
ger equipment: Justly did President
McKinley pay hearty meed of grati
tude to Miss Barton and the work of
the Red Cross in his message to Con
gress of December 6, 1898.
With an account of the work done
by the society at the Galveston hor
ror Miss Barton closes this record of
unselfish devotion. Considering the
hold the American Red Cross Society
has established upon the sympathies
of our people, Miss Barton need fear
no betrayal of trust when she invests
the furtherance of the good work with
us in the closing paragraph of her
book. "To youâ the people of Ameri
caâthis sacred trust is committed, in
your hands the charge Is laid. To none
will your help ever be so precious as It
has been to me, for in its proud growth
and strength none will ever so need
you." .'"Â¦-'

the tireless energy displayed by the so
ciety in the Cuban campaign and the
unmeasured good wrought by its min
istrations brought the organization for
the first time to a place of national
recognition and widespread commenda
tion. Its province on the battlefield
had never been demonstrated in our
country until the Geneva emblem flut
tering from the hospitals at Siboney
and Guantanamo, marked the work of
blessed charity that was being done
under Its folds.

The August Atlantic contains a pow
erful and instructive paper, which will
surely attract attention and create dis
cussion, upon "Unpunished Commer

In eluding the law), written by George
W. Alger, author of the recent much
talked-of Atlantic paper on "Moral
Overstrain."
Miss Barton tells first of the found
ing of the American Red Cross Society;
how, returning as a special envoy of
the Geneva Convention to press the
agreement of the United States to its
Red Cross treaty, ehe gained the in
terest of President Garfield and later
the official action of President Arthur,
ratifying the Geneva pact on the part
of the United States. This was in the
winter of 1SS0-81. The society which
Miss Barton had formed with a view
to carrying the flag of comfort to all
stricken persons, whether by war, fire
or plague, had scarce a thousand dol
lars in the treasury, and was known of
few. Yet when the devastating floods
in the Ohio River came in the winter
of 1SS4 the president of the new society
and Dr. Hubbel. the first medical di
rector. Bet bravely out on the swollen
river with the strange device of Gene
va flying from their bteamer and with
blessed relief for hundreds of naked,
starving sufferers. Thus does Miss
Barton sketch the picture of their res
cue work:
"Picture, if possible, this scene. A
Etiange ship with a strange flag steam
ing up the river. It halts, turns from
its course, and draws up to the near
est landing. Some persons disembark
and speak a few minutes with the fam
ily. Then, a half dozen strong me
chanics man a small boat laden with
all material for constructing a one
room house â floor, roof, doors, windows.
The boat returns for furniture. Within
three hours the strange ship sails
away, leaving a bewildered family in
a new and clean house with bed, bed
ding, clothing, table, chairs, dishes,
candles, a little cooking-stove with a
blazing fire, all the common quota of
cooking utensils, and meat, meal, and
groceries; a plow, rake, ax, hoe,
shovel, spade, hammer and nails. We
ask few questions. They ask none.
The whistle of the Troop is as welcome
to their ears as the flag to their eyes."
Vividly does the writer depict the ter
rible scenes attendant upon the awful
Johnstown flood in May, 1S89, and de
tail the work of succor done there by
the Red Cross Society, now grown to
wider recognition and greater strength.
Six frame buildings, known as "Red
Cross Hotels," were put up immediate
ly to furnish some protection from the
elements to the homeless survivors.
For three thousand hastily constructed
dwellings the Red Cross supplied com
plete furnishings. The society's books
showed the record of over twenty-five
thousand people served directly by its
aid. Supplies to the value of $211,000
were housed, handled and distributed
by Miss Barton and her assistants.
Equally as interesting as the re
countal of the relief work at John
town are Miss Barton's chapters on the
Russian famine in 1S91, and the relief
of the Armenians after the massacre
of '96. It Is upon the record of Red
Cross in Cuba during the Spanish war,
however, that we fix our closest atten
tion. It Is probably safe to say that
dent of that society of mercy for
nearly twenty-five years. Herein one
may read with wonderment the tale of
many an unknown succor rendered and
many a gentle benison bestowed upon
the suffering and needy by the great
society whose works are not vaunted
abroad and whose beneficent powers
are known best by those that feel them.
In thus giving to the world the record
of the charities done by the society
she has headed for these years, Clara
Barton unconsciously reveals the great
worth of the work she herself has done
for humanity. For either as director
of work abroad or in actual field serv
ice this good woman has spent the
major portion of her life in gen
tle ministrations to the afflicted,
has grown gray in the service of
humanity. So it is that her book,
designing to tell only the history of
the American Red Cross Society** many
activities, is thrice valued as the rec
ord of a strong woman's years of self
sacrificing labor.

A REVIEW OF SOME NEW BOOKSTHE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.

fr ol' man Thurman an' Tom Hendricks an' Aldy Stevenson be
fure he became a professional vice-prisidint. They thought it was
an honor, but if . ye'd read their bio-graphies to-day ye'd find at
th' end: Th' writer will pass over th' closin' years iv Mr. Thtir
mah's career hurriedly. It is enough to say iv thi^ painful
peryod that afther a lifetime iv devoted sarvice to his counthry th'
statesman's declinin' days was clouded be a gr-reat sorrow. Ho
become vice-prisidint iv th' United States. I Oh, how much bet
ther 'twere that we shtid be sawed off arly be th' gr-reat reaper
Death thin that a life iv honor shud end in ignomy.' It's a turr
ble thing. I read in th' pa-aper four years ago: 'Foul plot again
Thaydore Rosenfelt. Platt an' Hanna schame to make him vice
prisidint' I r-read th' other day: 'Attack on Joe Cannon. Odell
proposes him fr vice-prisidint. Cannon pleadin' with his frinds
' to save him.' Bimeby whin th' campatgn comity runs short iv
funds they'll raise the wind be goin' around and threatenin' plu
thrycrats with th' nommynation. Ye'll hear people say : 'That boy
will come to no good end. He will be vice-prisidint.'
"If ye say about a man that he's good prisidintial timber
he'll buy ye a dhrink. If ye say he's good vice-prisulintial tim
ber, ye mane that he isn't good enough to be cut into shingles an'
ye'd betther be careful. ; It's sthrange, too, because it's a good
job. I think a man cud put in four years comfortably in th' place
, if he was a sound sleeper. What ar-re his jooties, says yc ? Well,
durin' th' campaign he has to do a good deal iv th' rough out
side wurruk. Th' candydate fr prisidint is at home pickin' out
th' big wurruds in th' ditchnry an firin' thim at us fr'm time to
time. Th' candydate f'r th' vice-prisidincy is out in Ioway yellin'
fr'm th' back iv a car or a dhray. He goes to all th' church fairs
an' wakes an' appears at public meetin's between a cornet solo
an' a glee club. He ought to be a man good at repartee. Our
now hohored (be some) prisidint had to retort with th' very hands
that since have signed th' Pannyma canal bill to a Colorado
gintleman who accosted him with z. scantling. An' I well ray
mimber another candydate, an' a gr-rcat man, too, who replied to
a gintleman in Shelbyville who made a rude remarje be threatenin'
him as though he was an open fireplace. It was what Hogan
calls a. fine cut an' incisive reply. Yes, sir, th' candydate fr vice
prisidint has a busy time iv it durin' th' campaign, hoppin' fr'm
town to town, spcakin', shakin' hands with the popylace, who call
him Hal or Charlie, dodgin' bricks, fightin with his audjeence
an' diggin' up f r th' fi-nance coomity. He has to be a^n all-round
man. He must be a good speaker, a pleasant man with th' ladies,
a fair boxer an' rassler, something iv a liar, an' if he's a Raypub
lican campaignin' in Missouri an active sprinter. If he has all
thim qualities he may or may not receive a majority at th' pools,
an', no man will know whether they voted for him or not.
"Well, he's ilicted. Th' ilictors call on th' candydate fr prisi
dint an' hand him th'. office. They notify th' candydate fr vice
prisidint through th' personal columns iv th' pa-apers: 'If th'
tall, dark gintleman with ha'zel eyes, black coat an' white vest who
was nommynated at th' convintion fr vice-prisidint will call at
headquarters he will hear iv something to his advantage.' So he
buys a ticket an' hops to Wash'nton, where he gets a good room
suited -to his station right above th' kitchen an' overlookin' a
woodyard. Th' prisidint has to live where he is put, but th' vice
prisidint is free to go anny where he likes where they are not
partickler. .Th' constichoochion provides that th' prisidint shall
have to. put up with darky cookin', but th' vice-prisidint is per
mitted to eat out. Ivry mornin' it is his business to call at th*
White House an' inquire afther th' prisidint's health. Whin told
that th' prisidint was niver betther he gives three cheers an' de
parts with a heavy heart. Th' feelin' iv th' vice-prisidint about th'
prisidint's wcll-bein' is very deep. On rainy days he calls at th'
White House an' begs th' prisidint not to go out without his rub
bers. He has Mrs. Vice-Prisidint knit him a shawl to protect his
throat again th' night air. If th' prisidint has a touch iv fever, th'
vice-prisidint gets a touch iv fever himself. He has th' doctor
on th' 'phone'durin' th' night. 'Doc, I hear th' prisidint is onwell,'
he says. 'Cud I do anny thing f r him â anny thing like dhrawin'
his salary or appintin' th' postmasther at Injyannapolis ?' It is
princip'lly because iv th' vice-prisidint that most iv our prisidints
have enjoyed such rugged health. Th' vice-prisidint guards th'
prisidint, an' th' prisidint afther sizin' up th' vice-prisidint con
cludes that it wud be betther fr th' country if he shud live yet
awhile. 'D'ye know,' says th' prisidint to th' vice-prisidint, 'ivry
time I see you I feel tin years younger.' 'Ye'er kind wurruds,'
says th' vice-prisidint, 'brings tears to me eyes. My wife was
savin' on'y this mornin' how comfortable we ar-re in our little flat.*
Some vice-prisidints have been so anxious Fr th' prisidint's safety
that they've had to be warned off th' White House grounds.
"Aside fr'm th' arjoos duties iv lookin' afther th' prisidint's
health, it is th' business iv th' vice-prisidint to preside over the de
liberation iv th' Sinit. Ivry mornin' between ten an' twelve he
swings his hammock in th' palachial Sinit Chamber an* sinks off
into dhreamless sleep. He may be awakened be Sinitor Tillman
pokin' Sinitor Hoar in th' eye. This is wan way th' Sinit has iv
deliberatin*. If so, th' vice-prisidint rises fr'm- his hammock an'
says : Th' Sinitor will come to ordher.' 'He won't/ says th* Sini
tor. 'Oh, very well,' says th' prcsidin' officer, 'he won't,' an'
dhrops off again. It is his jooty to rigorously enforce th' rules
iv th' Sinit. There ar-re none. Th[ Sinit is ruled be courtesy, like
th' longshoremen's union. Th' vice-prisidint is not expected to
butt in much. It wud be a breach iv Sinotoryal courtesy fr him
to step down an' part the Sinitor fr'm Texas an' th' Sinitor fr'm
Injyanny in th' middle iv a debate undher a desk on whether
Northern gintlemen ar-re more gintlemanly thin Southern gintle
men. I shudden't wondher if he thried to do it if he was taught
his place with th' leg iv a chair. He isn't even called upon to give
a decision. All that his grateful counthry demands fr'm th' man
that she has ilivated to this proud position on th' toe iv her boot
is, that he shall keep his opinyoris to himsilf. An' so he whiles
away th' pleasant hours in th' beautiful city iv Wash'nton, an'
whin he wakes up he is eyether in th'. White* House or in th'
sthreet. I'll niver say annything agm th' vice-presidincy. It is
a good job and is richly deserved by' ayether Hinnery Gassaway
Davis or Charles Fairbanks. An', be hivens, I'll go further an*
say it richly desarves ayether iv thim."
"Has th' candydates accipted th' nommynation f r prisidint ?"
asked Mr. Hennessy.
"No," said Mr. Dooley, "th' comities haven't made up their
minds whether they will give th' dimmycrat nommynation to Ro
senfelt an' th' raypublican nommynation to Parker, or vicy varsy.
It don't make much diff'rence annyway."
"It's, sthr^nge about th' vice-prisidincy, Hinnissy. Th' prisi
dincy is th' highest office in th' gift iv th' people. Th' vice-presi
dincy is th' nex' highest an' tli' lowest. It isn't a crime exactly.
Ye can't be sint to jail f'r it, but it's a kind iv disgrace. It's
like writin' anonymous letters. Whin Sinitor Elkins is asked
about his father-in-law now he shakes his head an' says: 'We
don't speak iv him anny more in th' fam'ly.' At a convintion
nearly all th'dillygates lave as soon as nommynatcd th'
prisident for fear wan iv. them will be nommynated for vice-prisi
dint. They offered it to me f rind Joe Cannon, an', th' language
he used brought th' blush iv shame to th' cheeks iv.a naygur
dillygate fr'm Allybamy. They thried to. hand it to Hinnery Cabin
Lodge an' he wept bitterly.. They found a man fr'm Wisconsin
who was in dhrink an' had almost nommynated him* whin his wife
came in- an' dhragged him away fr'm timptation. Th' way they
got Sinitor Fairbanks to accipt was be showin' him a pitcher iv our
gr-rcat an' noble prisidint thryin' to jump a horse over a six-foot
fence. An' they on'y prevailed upon Hinnery Davis to take this
almost onequalled hono/ be tellin' him that th' raisin th' Sage iv
Esoopus didn't speak earlier was because he has weak lungs.
"Why- is it, " I. wondher, that ivrybody runs away fr'm a
nommynation fr vice-prisklint as if it was an indictment be th'
gran' jury?. It usen't.to be so. I've hollered mesilf black in th'
face f'r ol' man .Thurman an' Hendricks iv Injyanny. In th' 61'
days, whin th' boys' had nommynated some unknown mail fr'm
New York f'r prisidint, they turned in an' nommynated a gr-reat
an' well-known man fr'm the West f'r vice-prisidint. Th' candy
date f'r vice-prisidint was all iv th' ticket we iver sec durin' a cam
paign. Th' la : ad they put up f'r prisidint stayed down cast an'
was niver allowed to open- his mouth except in writin' befure wit

C C "\ /E'VE tol', me. who ye ar-re with fr prisidint," said
\y Mr. Hennessy, "but who ar-re ye goin' to vote f r f'r
Â¦ ' vicc-prisidint?" â¢ . . . . .
â¢ <Â¦Â¦ "I haven't med up me mind," said Â« Mr. Dooley.
"They're both good an' great men. Hinnery Gassaway
Davis is a fine ol' Virginian (West) gintleman. Through his
middle name he is related to 'WillumJ. Bryan an' he is father-in
law of. another gr'rcat man, Sinitor Elkins. Mr. Davis is eighty
wan years old and has forty millyon dollars, or is forty millyon
years old an' has eighty- wan dollars. I'm not sure which, but
annyhow th' figures passes belief. He is a good man an'' it is
thought that his ripe ripe judgment and his still riper fortune will
add gr-reat strenth to th' ticket. I see in th' pa-pers that he looks
twinty years younger thin -his years an' I'll bet that befure th'
campaign is over he'll feel- three millyon dollars younger in his
bank roll.
"Th' Raypublican candydate is th' Hon'rable Charles Fair
banks, who hails fr'm Injyanny. Hence th' wurrud hail. He has
almost th' .same qualifications fr- thMofty office f'r which he Jias
been unanimously choosen be th' thrcasurer iv th' campaign com
ity. He is not quite th' statesman that Hinnery is: He misses
it be about thirty-nine millyons. Still, he has enough to do his
jooty worthily through th' campaign. Sinitor Fairbanks has a
fine war record. He served throughout th' rebellyon as a cashier
to th' First Naytional Bank iv Terry Hut an' has iver since given
most iv his time an' labor to his counthry an' his counthry's rail
roods. He is sthrongly in favor iv presarvin' th' goold standard an'
as much iy it as possible. Hinnery Davis doesn't care so much
about goold. He has all kinds. An' there in a few well chosen

MR. DOOLEY ON THE DUTIES OF A VICE-PRESIDENT.HE slowest waiter 1 know is the British railway refresh
ment room: waiter. His very breathing, regular, harmo
nious as it is with all the better attributes of a well-pre
served grandfather's clock, conveys suggestion of dignity
and peace. He is a huge, impressive person. There em
anates from him an atmosphere of 'Lotusland. The otherwise un
attractive room becomes an, oasis of repose amid the turmoil of
a fretful world. All things conspire to aid him; the ancient
joints, ranged side by side like corpses in a. morgue, each one de
cently hidden under its white' muslin shroud, whispering of death
and decay ; the dish of dead flies, thoughtfully placed in the cen
ter of the table ; the framed advertisements, extolling the virtues
of heavy beers anil stouts, of weird champagnes, emanating from
haunted-looking chateaux, situate â if one may judge from the il
lustration â in the midst of desert lands; the sleep-inviting buzz of
bluebottle. The spirit of the place steals over you. Your idea on
entering, with a quarter of an hour to spare, was a cutlet and a
glass of claret. In the face of the refreshment room waiter the
notion appears frivolous, not to say un-English. You order cold
beef and pickles, with a pint of bitter in a tankard. To win the
British waiter's approval you must always order beer in a tankard.
The Uritish waiter, in his ideas, is medieval. There is a Shakes
pearean touch about the tankard. A soapy potato will, of course,
be added. Afterward a ton of cheese and a basin of rabbits' food
floating in water (the British salad) will be placed before you.
You will work steadily through the whole, anticipating the som
nolence that will subsequently fall upon you with a certain
amount of satisfaction. It will serve to dispel the last lingering
regret at the reflection that you will miss your appointment and
suffer thereby serious inconvenience, if not positive loss. These
things are of. the world â the noisy, tiresome world you have left
without.
To the English traveler the foreign waiter, in the earlier
stages of his career, is a burden and a trial. When he is com
plete â when he really can talk English â I rejoice in him. When
I object to him is when his English is worse than my French or
German, and when he will, for his non-educational purposes, in
sist, nevertheless, that the conversation shall be entirely iii English.
I would rather he came to me some other time. I would so much
rather make it after dinner â or say half an hour next morning. I
hate giving lessons during meal times. Besides, to a man with
feeble digestion this sort of thing can lead to trouble. One waiter
I met at a hotel in Dijon knew very little English â about as much
as a poll parrot. The moment 1 entered the sallc a manger he
started to his feet. "Ah! You English !" he cried. "Well, what
about us?" I answered. It was during the period of the Boer war.
I took it he was about to denounce the English nation generally.
I was looking for something to throw at him. "You English â you
Englishman, yes?" he repeated, and then 1 understood he was
merely intending a question. 1 owned up that I was, and accused
him of being a Frenchman. He admitted it. Introductions, as it
were, thus over, I thought I would order dinner. I ordered it in
French. I am not bragging of my French; I never wanted to
learn French. Even as a boy it was more the idea of others than
of myself. I have learnt as little as possible; but"! have learnt
enough to live in places where they can't (or won't) talk any
thing else. Left to myself I could have enjoyed a very satisfac
tory dinner. I was tired with a long day's journey, and hungry.
They cook well at this hotel ; I had been looking forward to my
dinner for hours and hours. I had sat down in my imagination to
a consomme bisque, sole au gratin, a poulet saute and an omelette
au fromage. â¢ It is wrong to let one's mind dwell upon carnal
delights, I see that now. i At the time I was mad about it. The
fool would not even listen to me. He had got it into his garlic
sodden brain that all Englishmen live on beef -and nothing, but
beef. He. swept aside all my suggestions as though they had been,
the prattlings of a foolish child. "You haf nice biftek. ' Not at
all done. Yes?" "No,I don't," I answered. "I. don't* want what
the cook of a provincial : French . hotel calls a biftek. I want some
thing to eat. I want- â " Apparently he understood neither
head, the black side whiskers, the Roman nose. But your waiter
had blue eyes, this man soft hazel. You had forgotten to notice
the eyes. You bar his progress and ask him for the red pepper.
The haughty contempt with which he regards you is painful to
bear. It is as if you had insulted a lady. He appear:, to be say
ing the same thing: "I think you have made a mistake; you are
possibly confusing me with somebody else. I have not the honor
of your acquaintance." I do not wish it to be understood that I
am in the habit of insulting ladies, but occasionally I have made
an innocent mistake, and have met with some such response. The
wrong waiter conveys to me precisely the same feeling of humili
ation. "I will send your, waiter to you," he answers. His tone im
plies that there are waiters and waiters ; some may not mind what
class of person they serve, others, though poor/have their self-re
spect. It is clear to you now why your waiter is keeping away
from you ; the man is ashamed of being your waiter. He is watch
ing probably for an opportunity to approach you when nobody is
looking. The other waiter finds him for you. He was hiding be
hind a screen. "Table forty-two wants you," the other waiter
tells him. The tone of voice adds, "If you like to encourage thiis
class of customer, that is your business, but don't ask me to have
anything to do with him, that's all!"
Even the waiter has his feelings.
(Copyrighted 1904 by Central News and Press Exchange.)
A waiter at the Gare du Nord in Brussels, on one occasion
pressed upon me a five-franc piece, a smalLTurkish coin the value
of which was unknown to me, and remains so to this. day, a dis
tinctly, had two francs and from a quarteTof a pound- to six ounces
of centimes, as change for a twenty : fran?.;n0te, after deducting the
price of a cup qf coffee. He '.put it dowhwith the air of one sub
scribing to a charity. We looked^. at one. another. I suppose I
must have conveyed to him the; impression of being discon
tented. He drew a purse from his pocket.- The action suggested
that, for the purpose of satisfying ; my inordinate demands, he
would be compelled to draw upon -his private resources; but it
did not move me.. Abstracting reluctantly a fifty-centime piece he
added to it the heap upon the table. I suggested his taking a seat,
as at this rate it seemed likely we- should be doing business to
gether for some time. I think he .gathered I was not a fool. Hith
erto he had been judging, I suppose, .purely from appearances.
But he was not in the. least offended. "Ah," he cried, with a
cheery laugh, "Monsieur comprehend!" He swept the whole non
sense back into his bag and gave me the right change. I slipped
my arm through his and insisted upon the pleasure of his society
until I had examined each and every coin. He went away chuck
ling and told another waiter all about' it. They both of them
bowed to me as I went out and wished me a pleasant journey. I
left them still chuckling. A British waiter would have been sulky
all the afternoon. The waiter who insists, upon mistaking you for
the heir of all the Rothschilds used to cost me dear when I was
younger. I find the best plan is to take him in hand at the be
ginning and disillusion him. He sighs when you sweep aside his
talk of '84 Perrier Jouet, followed by '79 Chateau Lafite, and ask
him if, as man to man, he can conscientiously recommend the
Saint Julien at two and six. But the fault is not yours. Your
aristocratic bearing has deceived him. You are not to be blamed
for possessing an aristocratic bearing.
The fatherly waiter is sometimes a comfort. You feel that he
knows best. Your instinct is to address him as "Uncle." But
you remember yourself in time. When you are dining a lady and
wish to appear important he is apt 'to be in the way. It seems,
somehow, to be his dinner. You have a sense almost of being de
trop. The ascetic waiter is a distinct damper. He is an intel
lectual looking man. At the bottom of my heart I agree with
him. There is, when you come to think of it, something very
gross, very animal, in these prolonged gorges of food and drink.
Why don't we live plainer and think higher? But he is out of
place in a restaurant.
The greatest insult you can offer a waiter is to mistake him
for vour waiter. You think he is vour waiter â there is the bald
English nor French. "Yes, yes," he continued, cheerfully, "with
pottitoes." "With what?" I said. I thought for the" moment he
was suggesting potted pigs' fee t in the nearest English he could
get to it. "Pottito," he repealed; "boil pottito. Yes? And pell
he'll." I felt' like telling him to go there. I suppose he meant
"pale ale." It took me about five minutes to get that beefsteak
;out of his head. By the time Thad done it I did not. care what I
had .for dinner. . I took pot-du-jour and veal. He added, on his
own initiative, a thing that looked like a poultice. I did not try
the "taste of it. He explained it was "plum puddin." I fancy he
had 'made it himself. This fellow is typical; you meet him every
where abroad. He translates your bill into English, for you, calls
ten centimes a penny, calculates twelve francs to the pound and
presses a handful of sous affectionately upon, you as change for a
napoleon. .'
-The cheating waiter is com mon to . all countries, though in
Italy and Belgium'he flourishes, perhaps, more than elsewhere. But
the British waiter/ when he is detected, becomes surly â does not
take it nicely. The foreign waiter is amiable about it â bears no
malice whatever. He is grieved, may be, a't-your language, but
that. is because he is thinking of you â the possible effect of it upon
your future. To try and stop you he offers you another four
sous. The story is told' of a Frenchman who) not knowing the le
gal fare, adopted the plan of doling out pennies tq a London cab
man one at a. time until the man looked satisfied. Myself I doubt
the story-. From what I know of the London cabman I can see
him leaning down still, with outstretched hand, the horse between
the shafts long: since dead, the 'cab chock full of coppers, and yet
no expression of. satiety, upon that cabman's face. But the story
would appear to have crossed the channel, and to have commend
ed itself to the foreign waiter- â especially to ; the railway refresh
ment waiter. He doles 6ut centimes to the traveler, one at a time,
withÂ«the air of a man who is giving away the savings of a lifetime.
If, after five minutes or so, you still appear discontented, he goes
away .quite suddenly. You think he has* gone to open another
chest of halfpence, but when a quarter of an hour has passed and
he does not reappear you inquire about him among the other
waiters. A gloom at once falls upon them. You have spoken
of the very thing that had been troubling them. He used to be
a waiter here once â one might almost say until quite recently. As
to what' has become of him, ali! there' you have them. If, in the
Course of their checkered career, they ever come across him they
will mention to him th,at you are waiting fdr him. Meanwhile a
stentorian voiced official is shouting that your train is on the
point of leaving. You console yourself with 'the reflection that it
might have been more. It always might have been more â some-

7The men below stairs, after some dis
cussion, had decided on bullet. This
was out of consideration for Billy's
standing as a frontiersman. Besides,
he had stolen no horses. In order not
to delay â¢ matters the execution was
fixed for the present time and place.
Billy stood with his back to the logs of
h's own hotel, his hands and feet
bound, but his eyes uncovered. He
had never lost his, nerve. In short re
spit' which preparation demanded, he
told -his, opponents what he thought of
them. .
The girl heard a faint scramble, then
the soft pat of some one landing on his
feet. Peering from the window, she
made out a faint shadowy form steal
ing- around the corner of the hotel. She
puther head to her heart and listened.
Her understanding of the stranger's
motives was vague, but she had caught
his confession that her kiss had meftint
much to him. and even in her anxiety
she felf an inclination to laugh. She
had bestowed that caress as she would
have kissed the cold end of a dog's
nose.
"Do yo"u love him?" asked the stran
ger.
"God knows I'm purty tough," con
fessed Nell, sobbing, "but I jest do
that!" and she dropped her head again.
The invisible stranger In the gloom
fell silent, considering.
"I'm a purty rank proposition my
self," said he at last, as if to himself,
"and I got a job on hand which same
I ought to put through without givin'
attention on anythi-i* else. As a usual
play, folks don't care for me and I
don't care much for folks. Women in
general. They drtve me plumb tired.
I reckon I don't stack up very high on
the blue chips when it comes to cash
in' in with that sex, anyhow; but in
general they gives me as much notice
as they lavishes on a doodle bug. I
ain't carin', you understand, nary bit;
but onct in a dog's age I kind of han
kers fer a decent look from one of
them. I ain't never had no women
folks of my ownâ never. Sometimes I
thinks it would be some scrumptious to
know a little gal's waitin' for me some
wheres. They ain't none. Ihey never
will be. I ain't built that way. You
treated me white to-night. You're the
first woman that ever kissed me of her
own accorJ."
One of the men. as a signal from his
lea'der, -relieved Billy's belt of consider
able weight. Then the latter was per
mitted to sit on a cracker box. Two
more mounted the little stairs. .In a
moment they returned to ? report that
the upper story contained no human
beings, strange or otherwise, ; except
the girl, but that there remained a
small.,, trunk. Under further orders they
dragged the trunk down into the bar

to contain clothes, of the ; plainsman's

"Now," said Black Hank angrily, in
a low tone, "I want to know -why you
tried that monkey game." â¢
Billy, wary and afraid, replied' that
he had" tried no game, that he had for
gotten the tenderfoot for a moment, and
that he did not believe the latter would
prove to be the sought-for express mes
senger.

insisted Charley.
i The man against the countegj^ad lost
nothing of the scene. -Billy's*&enial, his
hesitation, his half-truth, all looked
suspicious to , him. With one swift
round sweep of the arm he had Billy
covered.- Billy's arms shot over his
head without the necessity of a.com
mand.
Hank firmly about the waist, whirled
him into a sort of shield and* began an
earnest . struggle for the instant pos
session of the outlaw's drawn.revolver.
It was a gallant .attempt, but'unsuc
cessful. In a moment Billy was pin
ioned to the floor and Black Hank was
rubbing his abraded forearm.' After
that the only question was whether it
should be rope or bullet.
' Now, when Billy had gone down
stairs, the stranger- had wasted no more
time.. at the' 'window. He had in his
possession $50,000 in greenbacks" which
he was' to deliver as scon as possible to
the Buck Tail Agency In Wyoming.
.The | necessary change of stage; lines
had forced him to stay over night at
Billy Knapp's hotel.
â¢. The messenger seized his bag .and
softly ran along through the-canvas
partitioned rooms wherein Billy ' slept
to, a -narrow, window which he- had al
ready noticed gave out almost~directly
into the pine woods. The window was
of oiled paper, and its catch, baffled
him. He 'knew it should slide back,
but. it refused to slide for. him." He
did '.not dare, to break, the paper .be
cause of the crackling. noise. A' voice
at his shoulder startled him. ! ' ,-. ' Â¦-'
- "I'll show you," whispered the red-,
cheeked .girl. â¢

ket,'her hair falling about her;shoul

her; coverings. The little man suffered
at once an agony of. embarrassment in
which the thought of his errand was
lost.' It was recalled' to him' by -the
girl.'; Â£â¢;Â¦;Â£Â£:â¢< .:.--.
j ! "There vou are ! " . she Â¦'., whispered, .
showing him the jopen window. . " Â¦
"Thank you,", he stammered : pain

~ The girl laughed under her breath.
/ ''That's all 'right,"' she said- heartily,,
"I 'owe you that for calling old- whis
kers off his bfonc," and she kissed h'im.
The .messenger, trembling with, self
consciousness, climbed hastily through
the window, ran the broad '"loop of the
.satchel .up his arm;" and, instead of
dropping to the ground," as the girl had
expected, swung.: himself . lightly .'-Into
the branches of a rather large -scrub
oak that V grew. near. She listened to
the rustle of. the leaves for a moment
as he nearedthe trunk,-and;then,"un
able longer to restrain' her curiosity. In
regard to the doings below, turned to
the stairway.
As she did so two men mounted.
They examined the roorr.F of the upper
story hastily but carefully, paying
scant attention to her, and departed
swearing. In a few moments they re
turned ft>r the stranger's trunk. Nell
followed as far as the stairway. There
she heard and saw things, and fled in
bitter dismay to the back of the house,
when Billy Knapp was overpowered.
At the window she knelt, clasping
hands and placing her head be
tween her bare arms. -Women in the
West, at least women like Nell, do not
weep, r zt she came near it. Suddenly
she raised her head. A voice next her
ear- had addressed her.
She looked here and there and
around, but could discover nothing.
.';: "Here, outside," came the low, guard
ed: voice. "In the tree.""''
Thejs she sJTw that the little stranger
had not stirred from his first sighting
place. . . .
"Beg your pardon, ma-'am. for start
ling yc-u or 'for addressing you at all,
which I shouldn't, but "
" "Oh, never mind that!" cried the girl
impatiently, shaking her hair. So de
precating and timid were the' tones
that, almost without an effort of the
imagination she could picture the little
man's blushes â¢ and his half-sidling
method of delivery. At this supreme
moment' his littleness and lack of Self
assertion jarred [on her mood. "What
you doln'' there? Thought you'd vam
oosed."
Â¦ "It : was safest here," exclaimed the
stranger. "I left no trail.".
She. nodded .comprehension bf r the
common sense of this. - -
.. "But, ma'am, I took the: liberty of

be in trouble. Of course I ain't got no

Nell with. a sob. - v i"-. '

'-, -The girl started, but her keen West
:ern mirifl saw the difficulty -at once.
"They, thinks 'Billy pertects you, jest
the same." "
He went to his- "room" and buckled
on a heavy belt, then descended . the
steep stairs.
The barroom was Ughted and filled
with men. Some of them were' eating
and drinking; others were strapping
provisions into portable form. Against
the corner of the bar.- a tall figure of a
man leaned, smokingâ a man lithe, ac
tive and muscular, with a keen, dark
face and black eyebrows which met
over his nose. Billy walked directly
to this man. , ._
"What is it?" he inquired shortly.
"This yere ain't in th' agreement."
"I know that," replied the stranger.
"Then leave yore dust and vamoose"."
"My dust is there," said Black Hank,
placing his hand on a buckskin' bag at
his side, "and you're paid, Billy v Knapp.
I want to ask you a question.; Stand

"Narry messenger," replied Billy, in

"That thar stage ain't what you calls

though his common sense told him that

his guest, would : hardly be chosen' as

cause the place would have no more of
her. , '
In the face of Billy's approval the
old "Tiian fell silent.
About midnight, the four inmates of
the frontier hotel were awakened by, a
tremendous racket outside. The strati-.
ger arose, fully clothed,- from his bunkl
and peered through the narrow | open
window. A dozen horses were'-stand
ing grouped in charge of a single ma ny
indistinguishable in the dark. Out of
the open door a broad band of . light
streamed from the saloon, whence came
the noise of voices and of boots tramp
ing about.
"It is Black Hank." said Billy, at his
elbow, "Black Hank and his outfit.
He hitches to this yere' snubbin' post
occasional."
Black Hank in the Hills would have
translated to Jesse James further
south.
The stranger turned suddenly ener
getic. ?
"Don't you make no fight?" he asked.

"Fight? Co'se not. Hank ain't plun

"Bully fer you!" he cried, slapping
his knee; "struck pyrites (he pro
nounced it 'pie rights') fer shore that

"You chore mustn't speak to a lady
that way," replied the stranger firmly,
in his little piping voice.
Billy caught the point, and exploded
in a mighty guffaw.
"1 don't wonder yo* don't like it,
then!" said he, with a funny little flare
of anger.
â¢â¢/kleanin* what?" shouted Charley
threateningly.
Billy snorted again and went inside.
He hated sentiment of all kinds. The
two men sat opposite each other and
ate cupper, which _was served by the
red-cheeked girl. The stranger kept
his eyes on his plate while she was in
the room. He perched on the edge of
the bench with his feet tucked upder
him and resting on their toes. When
she approached the muscles of his
shoulders and upper arms grew rigid
Â¦with embarrassment, causing strange,
agwkward movement of the hands.
He answered in monosyllables.
Billy ate expansively and earnestly.
Toward the close of the meal Charley
slipped into place beside him. Charley
was out of humor, and found the meat
' r yore soul, Nell," he cried,
"this yere ain't fitten fcr a hog to eat!','
The girl did not mind, nor did Billy.
It was the country's mode of speech.
The stranger dropped his knife.
"Yes, sir," piped the stranger. Billy
snorted at the title. "I has some per
sonal belongings which is valuable to
me." Â¦ He opened the bag and produced
a cheap portrait of rather a cheap
looking woman. "My mother that was,"
taid be.
The tenderfoot was seated on a small
trunk just outside the door. As he
held his hat in his hands, Billy could
tee his dome-like bald head. Beneath
the dome .was a little pink and white
face, andÂ«below that were narrow slop
ing shoulders, a flat chest, and bandy
legs. He wore a light check suit and a
flannel shirt whose collar was much
too large for him. Billy took this all in
while passing. As the driver climbed
to the seat, the hotelkeeper commented.
"Say, Hen," said he, "would you
etuff it, or put it under a glass case?"
"I'd serve it a lay Tooloose," replied
the driver briefly, and: he brought his
long lash S-shaped across the four star
-tled backs of his horses.
Billy turned to a reinspection of his
(ruest and met a deprecating smile.
"Can I get a shake-down heie for to
night?" he inquired in a high, piping
voice.
"You kin," replied Billy shortly, and
began to lowl.for Charley.
That patriarch appeared around the
corner, as did likewise the cook, a
black-eyed, red-cheeked creature, af
terward couuted by Bill; as one of h:s
eight matrimonial ventures.
."Snake this stranger's war-bag into
th' shack," commanded Billy. " And
yell, jest nat'rally rustle a few grub."
The stranger picked up a small hand
eatchel and followed Charley, into the
building. When, a little late*, he re
appeared for supper, he carried the
handbag with him and placed it under
the bench which flanked the table. Af
terward he deposited it next his hand
while enjoying a pipe outside. Natu
rally all this did not escape Billy.
"Stranger," said he, *'yo' seems
mighty wedded to that thar satchel.".
"Guess I ambles forth and sees what
fer a tenderfoot it is," replied Billy,
hastening from behind the bar.
"Nope."
That exhausted the situation. The
two men puffed silently for a moment
at their pipes. In' an instant the driver
turned to go.-.
"I got you a tenderfoot," he remarked
casually. ~"I reckon he's outside."

DL'KING one spring of the early
seventies Billy Knapp ran a spe
cies t)f road he-use or hotel at the
crossing of the Dcadwood and
Big Horn trails through Custer Valley.
â¢Travelers < hangins from one route to
the other frequently stopped there over
night. lie sold accommodations for
man and beast, comprising plenty of
Â¦whisky and plenty of hay. That was
the any one could say of it. The
hotel ivas of logs, two-storied, with
partitions of sheeting to insure a cer
tain piiyecy of. sight if not of sound;
had three beds and a' number of bunks,
and boasted of a woman cook â one of

it long. He. v.as too restless. ' â¢
The personnel of ins establishment

ready riicniioned, and an ancient Pistol
by the name of .Charley. * The latter
wore many firearms, and- had a good
deal to say, but had never; as Billy
expressed it, "made good.". This, in
the West, could cot have been for lack
of oppc-rtunity. His ' functions were
those of general factotum.
One evening Billy sat chair-tilted
against the logs of the hotel, waiting
for the stage. By and by it drew in.
Charley hobbled out, carrying buckets
of water for the horses. The driver
flung the reins from him with the
lordly insolence of his class, descended
slowly and swaggered; to the barroom
for his drink. Billy followed to serve it.
"Luck!" said the driver, and crooked
his elbow.
"Anything new?" queried Billy.
"Nope."
' "Held up?"
roic?. The execution of this man was
necessary to hire, nut because he was
particularly angry over the escape of
the messengerâ he exptctgd to capture
that individual in due timeâ but in or
der to preserve his authority over his
men. He was in the act ol moving
hack to give the .shooters room when ha
heard the doc-r open and shut.
He turned. Before the door stood a
small, consumptive looking man in a
light check suit. The tenderfoot car
ried two short-barreled Cblt'a revol
vers, one of which he presented direct
ly at Black Hank.
" 'Nds up!" he commanded sharply.
Hank was directly covered, so ha
obeyed. The newcomer's rye had a
strangely restless quality. Of the other
dozen inmates of the room eleven were
firmly convinced that the weapon and
eye not directed at their leader wero
personally concerned with themselves.
The twelith thought he saw his chance.
To. the. bewildered onlookers there
seemed to be. a flash and a bans in
stantaneous. Then things were as be
fore. One of the stranger's weapons
still pointed at Black Hank's breast;
the second at each one of the others.
Only the twelfth man. he who had seen
his chance, had collapsed forward to
the floor. No one could assure' himself
positively that he had discerned the
slightest motion on the' part of the
stranger.
"Now," said the latter sharply, "one
at a time, gentlemen. Drop your sun!"
this last to Black Hank. "Muzzle
down. Drop it!- Correct.".'
One of the men -in. the'. back of thÂ»
room stirred slightly on"tKtr"ball of his
foot.
"Steady there!" said the stranger.
The man stiffened.
"Next gent," went on the little man.
subtly indicating another. The latter
obeyed without hesitation. "Next! Now
you. Now yeu in ths corner."
One after another the pistols clashed
to the floor. Not for an instant could
a . single inmate of the apartment,
armed or unarmed, flatter himself that
his slightest motion was overlooked.
They were like tigers on the crouch,
ready. to" spring the moment the man's
guard lowered. It did not lower. The
huddled figure on the floor reminded
them of what 'might happen. They
obeyed. â¢ ' Â¦ Â¦Â¦ :_
"Step back!" commanded the stran
ger next. In a moment he had them
standing in a row against the wall.
rigid, upright, their hands over their
heads. Then for the' first time the
stranger moved from his position by
"Call her," he said to Billyâ"the
girl."
Billy raised his voice. "Nell! O.
N'ell!"
In a moment she appeared in the
doorway at the foot of the stairs with
out hesitation or fear. She had slipped
on a dress. When she perceived the
state of affairs, she brightened almost
mischievously.
"Would you. just as .soon, ma'am, if
it ain't troublin* you too much, just
sort of naturally untie Billy?" request
ed the stranger. \
She did so. The hotel keeper
stretched his arms.
"Now pick.up them guns, please."
The two set about it.
""Where's that infernal old repro
bate?" howled Billy suddenly, looking
about for Charley.
The patriarch had quietly slipped
away.
"You can drop them arms." advised
the stranger, lowering the'muzzles of
his weapons. The leader started to say
something.
"You shut up!" said Billy, selecting
his own revolvers from the'heap.
The stranger suddenly, picked up
one of the Colt's single-action re
volvers which lay on the floor, and,
holding the trigger back against tha
guard, exploded the six charges by hit
ting the hammer smartly with tha
palm of his hand. In the thrusting
motion of this discharge he evidently
had design, for the first six wine
glasses on Billy's bar were shivered.
It was wonderful work, rattling fire,
quicker than a self-cocker even. He
selected another weapon. From a pile
of tomato cans he took one and tossed
it into the air. Before it had fallen he
had perforated it twice, and as it rolled
along the floor he helped its progres
sion by four more bullets which left
streams of tomato juice where they
had hit. The room was full of smoke.
The group watched, fascinated.
Then the men against the wall grew
rigid. Out of the film of smoke long,
vivid streams flashed toward them,
right and left, like the alternating
steam of a locomotive's pistons. Smash,
smash! smash, smash! hit the bullets
with regular thud. With the twelfth
discharge the din ceased. Midway be
tween the heads of each pair of men
against the wall was a round hole. No
one was touched.
A silence fell. The smoke lightened
and blew sjowly through the window
and open dopr. The horses, long since
c" serted by their guardian in favor of
the excitement within, whinnied. Tha
stranger dropped the smoking Colts and
quietly reproduced his own short-bar
reled arms from his side "pockets. Billy
broke the spell at last. C v
"That's shootin'!" he observed with a
sigh.
The fifty thousand is outside." said
the stranger."Do you want "em?"
There was no reply.
"I aims to- pull out on one of these
here broncs of yours." said he. "Billy,
he's all right. He doesn't know nothin'
about me."
He collected his six-shooters from the
floor.
"I.just takes these with me for a
spell," he remarked. "You finds them,
if you locks hard enough, along on th'
trailâlikewise your broncs."
He backed toward the door.
"I'm layin' for the man that sticks
his head outen that door." he warned.
"Stranger." called Black Hank, as he
neared the door.
The little man paused.
"Might I ask your name?"
"My name is Alfred," replied the lat-
Black Hank looked chagrined.
"I've heard tell of you," he remarked.
The stranger's eye ran over the room
and encountered that of the girl. He
shrank into himself and blushed.
"Good night." he said hastily, and
disappeared. A moment later the beat
of hoofs became audible as he led the
bunch of horses away.
For an instant no one spoke. Then
Billy: "By God. Hank. I means to
stand pat with you: but you let that
kid alone or I plugs you!" Billy was
the only man armed.
"Kid, huh!" grunted Hank. "Alfred
a kid! I've heard tell of him."
"What have you hearil?" inquired
the girl.
"He's the -plumb best scout on the
southern trail and the best pistol shot
in the West," replied Black Hank.

pedia and made up the finest pattern
for a social study that you ever did
see. In order to secure the necessary
misinformation he disguised himself. In
a celluloid collar and a false accent and
concealed himself In \ the Franco-Irish
quarter to see how the other half-and
half lives.
When he came In from the bush he
discovered, with the feeling that he
would have classified as one of Blcken
ing horror, that the world had con
tinued to revolve. on Its axis and that
nobody cared for underdone' sociology
with a sauce of harrowing details. By
this time the great reading public of
the United -States and Springfield,
Mass., had landed on the domestic tale
as about the best thing for a quiet
evening's entertainment G. Eliot was
down temporarily, but he was a long
/way from out The tale of sweet do
mesticity for his and the sooner the
quicker.. The story that he knocked
together in the course of the next six
months would have brought tears jj to
tho eyes of a cigar store Indian. But
when it came to the publishers the
touch failed to materialize. G. Eliot
was informed, gently but firmly that
the only thing that wasn't a drug on
the -market was a hand-sewed, leather
lined; historical romance.
That was Jusf the moment' that Mr.
Foozleit had been waiting for, although
he didn't know , It. â¢â¢Â£ King Canute, who
was .collecting dust In the dim recesses
of . the pigeon holes, was dragged out
and introduced to an expectant public.
G. v Eliot : had discovered that v novels
move In cycles and .that If a man can
only, wait long enough the procession
will come around his blocx. Thereafter
all that 1 he had < to do was to keep ' an
eye on' the publishers' announcements
and fire out hl a old manuscripts in the,
proper order. He has af length dis- .
posed of all of them and Is resting In'

days In durance vile if he had polluted
the atmosphere with them under the
influence of spirituous beverages. The
difference between a historical novel
ist and a plain drunk is that the for
mer will never sober off and therefore
must be treated with due leniency.
When G. Eliot got his eyes open to the
demands of the hour it was Impossible
to throw a stone In the State of In
diana without hitting a man who had
at least two volumes to his credit. He
thought he saw an opportunity coming
around his way and made a grab at it,
but, alas, it was only a fleeting show.
His grab consisted of a powerful tale
of the, reign of King Canute, the first
man to make successful use of the wa
ter cure. It was a hot book all right,
but by the time G. Eliot had it off the
stocks the tide of historical novels be
gan to run outâ a thing which had
happened to the authors' ideas long be
foreâand 1 no one was reading anything;
but religious works with a high moral
purpose.
Of course, G. Eliot was seriously
wounded in his* 'most tender feelings,
but, carefully concealing the wound"
under a small mortgage on his house,
he blocked out an affecting and - su
premely moral tale. that' was calculated
to reform the head waiter of a s Raines
law hoteL". Anything more convincingly,
moral than that is beyond the power of
mortal man to conceive. There can; be
no question that the moral reformation
of the world would have been accom-^
plishad'and the millennium would hive
been ushered; in in a blaze of gloryr
and royaltiesâ if the child of Q. Eliotffc
brain had been permitted to seo the
light of day. : But by the time;G.* Eliot
had v rolled up his . sleeves : and ; unlim- .
bered his typewriter people. had; begun
tevget ' ready to: get tired . of religious
novels and were lining, up to buck the
center of the social problem.
Once again G. 1 Eliot was due to have
his tendereit feelings walked on and
he was right on hand with the goods.
After he had scraped the ; dust out of
bis eyes and boxed his Intellectual com-
of a mission. To be sure, he wasn't a
Christian Scientist, or a vegetarian, or
a' Socialist, or even a* firm believer in
the good old doctrine that the world
is going to the dogs. AH of these
working hypotheses are good things
for a budding novelist to have In stock,
but Foozleit didn't have any of them*
His principal mission was to convince
the publishers that his books were
worth selling and the public that they
were worth buying. We may say in
passing that his mission appeared at

that is the only charitable explanation

It was under the' last heading, how
ever, that Foozleit'- came nearest to
falling. In fact, It V was when he at
tempted to perform the feat implied
therein that he did fall â flat He un
doubtedly needed â¢ the money, but
somehow he didn't seem to be able to
get In sight of it His trouble was the
very common one of being possessed
of a superabundance of hindsight, to
the great detriment of his available
supply of foresight. 'He could 'always

The 'weather bureau can continue to ";

When G. Eliot appeared on the liter
ary horizon the historical novel was on
the rampage. Richard I, Godfrey 1 de
Consomme and all the innumerable
host of captivating young men who as
sisted George Washington to ,be the
father of his country- held the center
of the stage. The air was filled with

There are three classes of people who
commit fictionâ those who have a mis
sion, those v.ho have time to kill or

typwriter because they haven't any

To return to G. Eliot Foozleit, he
didn't seem to fall in any of the above
classes. That's the trouble with a real
nice, comprehensive, scientific classifi
cation. Just as you have it all laid out
and propped up at the corners so that
you are sure nothing can get by it you
discover that all the cases you want
to get your brand on are going the
other way. However, we shall stand
.by our classification. It's a good one,
even If It doesn't fit. As we have
intimated two or three times, Foozlelt
showed the innate stubbornness of his
nature by his absolute refusal to fall
in with the arrangement that we have

to follow him out Into the open and

would liketo be, as she tries to be
and as she allows herself to be
are species wholly and widely di
vergent.
If the metropolis were robbed of its
chorus contingent newspapers would
have to go out of business, to say noth
ing cf the stage "Johnnies," as they
undoubtedly add to news interest by
furnishing pretexts for glaring head
lines.
Some stories of the chorus girl brand
keep the presses hot and at high
pressure, while other warm passages
are blown out like a fu^e before they
get into print.
The chorus girl Is a fixture, a fea
ture and, above all, qhe is peerless as
a continuous surprise party.
And in other lines she has a mission.
Many newspaper and magazine
writers have constant and urgent need
for models for illustrations that must
be recruited from the chorus. ranks.
To one who has never been in a green
room or behind the scenes the novelty
is a revelation.
As a special favor those wishing
models are sometimes permitted to in
vade the sacred precincts, where such
young people as may meet the require
ments are pointed out, introductions
follow and engagements are planned.
When a girl has no gowns of her
own and has to be ragged up In bor
rowed Cogs the whole performance is
very funny, yet has a dash of pathos.
They are all rather emotional, as
may be expected, and have nothing
of the "real swell" repressed manner
that passes as good form in "high so
ciety." "When pleased thsy fairly beam,
and one who appreciates happiness In
others is more than repaid in witness-
Ing the keen relish for pleasure they
evince.
One beautiful girl,: who posed for a
number of photos, had not a single
gown suitable, in consequence she was
ragged out very handsomely in an
elaborate creation borrowed for the oc
casion and in which she looked superb.
Perhaps never in her life had the girl
worn anything beyond the ordinary
and her naive, spontaneous delight was
refreshing. . After the pictures tor
which she had been engaged were all
taken, she stood before a mirror ad
Â¦ miring herself -witfc all. the abandon of
achlld. â¢ Following a preamble of apol
ogies "and after much- 'beating about
the 'bash,.' she nerved herself to ask
if she might have a couple of negative*
taken of herself, as she could sell the
pictures to, several papers that had re
quested them, but which she had been
obliged- to refuse, haying nothing to
wear, "and "i never" looked so nice- ia
ray life as I do now." fj*Â«?
In" these" days of :jaded society in
anities the naturalness of such girls,
engaging and enthusiastic, is a re
freshing contrast* to 'those who are
taught that to laugh is provincial and
enthusiasm plebeian.
Mothers' . of eligible . sons would do
well to. keep their tender darlings from
thege girls, forced to make a living and
to /cultivate Â¦ the arts and graces .that
make them at" all time's charming com
panions. " They, know only too well that
a "pfeaslng personality Is the surest
road to success, and they know also
that ,'they. -must keep well and bright
that they may ".'preserve their good
looks. '
They are eager for the advertising
that helpV'them and many of them
would" gladly pose for this privilege
alone because popularity is always a
large stock in trade for the girl whose
good looks Is her only dower.
One little girl whose beautiful face
is always in demand is a perfect min
iature Lillian Russell, and although
sought after and pictured so frequent
ly, is yet unspoiled, and as sweet, mod
est and unobtrusive as it Is possible
for a girl to be. She has several de
pendent upon her and when posing
gowns are always furnished her. '
The dainty tiny maids, known in the
New York stage vernacular as "broil
era," are all pretty and wee bits of
femininity. The "show girls" must
be large and handsome to show off
the magnificent gowns that have be
come a feature of the shows.
In the Sunday and daily papers plc
iures of these girls appear, and a note
written -to the theater explaining the
want of models, and giving the
name of the photographer in way of
reference, seldom falls to secure a
courteous response, the pay and the
advertisement being both desired.
If- a writer be cordial in manner
these trips to the studios are full of
fun into which the girls enter with so
much vim and life.
People living in straight-laced big
otry have little idea of the lives of
these girls. "Where one I3 coddled in
luxury, scores feast in back room flats
with little of the joy of life to brighten
it.- tertii
Contact with these girls In business
relations would change many people's
views, and if mothers of eligible sor.d
are wise, they will lock the boys in
glass cases whenever the New York
chorus girl comes to town. She is so
pretty, so bewitching, and. so amiable,
and fairly bubbling over with the Fizz
of Life. She is always -obliging and
eager to earn a pittance, and her worst
fault is the splendid contrast she
makes with the society girl with her
steel riveted face and armor plate ego
tism and artificial manners. Â¦
The chorus girl Is a relaxation, and
therein a snare, and taking her all In
all, she t Is so pretty and bewitching
that the boys are In dangerâ and the
hubbies â well!
Ring off, did you say? Oh. well, we
are not telling all that we know.
A sirl who has been on the stage or
who bar taken a course in Delsarte is
always preferable for illustrations to
one who knows nothing of the expres
sion of action or the expression of emo
tion. The actress always wants not
only a pretty picture, but a catchy
one, and for this reason lends her per
sonality more to the work of the mo
ment.
Now, the general run of real, livft
chorus girls 1? very different from the
pictures ensemble who is featured as
having an appetite two and a half
yards long and warranted not to
shrink, with a thirst that would make
the Mississippi River look like a syphon
out of business and which develops into
an enormous capacity for midnight
suppers and a hankering for automo
biles, to say nothing of the hansom
habit as a digestive proposition.
The chorus girl as she is, however,
is generally a hard worker, who knows
and sees little of life outside of the
drudgery of rehearsals and the glam
our of footlights.
Sick or well, rain or shine, hot or
cold, the chorus girl must be on time,
and for the slightest - infraction of
rules or a want of promptness she is
heavily fined, which makes a serious
inroad on her small salary. The prin
cipals of various shows receive princely

you have each grain separate and crys

Grate fine maple sugar and mix in
quantity to suit taste with "founda

Walnut creams are sometimes made

taste. After It is formed into balls,
cubes or different shapes, place them
upon plates or waxed papers and set
them aside to dry. This cream, by the
way. can be worked in candies similar
to the French cooked cream.
Take two tablespoonfuls of grated
cocoanut and half as much "founda

with your hands until the cocoanut is
all well mixed in it If you choose, you
can add a drop of vanilla. If too soft

The cream that is used in all

Occasionally one is mystified because
the cream does not come, and when
this happens nine out of ten times the
sugar needs clarifying. This is done
by beating up well the white of an egg
with a cupful of cold water and pour
ing into a very clean iron or thick new
tin saucepan. Then put into the pan
four cupfuls of sugar, mixed with a
cupful of warm water. Put on the stove

nil. for there is scarcely a house that
does not possess some kind of nuts

Salted almonds really should be dried
in paper of this description. And, by
the way, here is a splendid receipt for
making them:
Almonds, Salted.â Half pound al

Hickorynut candy has a peculiar fla
vor that Is particularly pleasing to
come. So take one cup hickory nuts
<mcÂ£ts), two cups sugar, half cup wa

ctirring, until thick enough to spin a
thread; flavor with extract lemon or
vanilla. Set off into cold water; otlr

and fancy the candy is infinitely better,
vegetable colorings, which are abso
lutely harmless, may be used, and then
they are quite certain that.it equals
in excellence that of the best confec
tioner.
For stick candy, boil together one
pound of sugar, one cup water, one
half teaspoonful cream tartar and a
scant tablesDoonful of glycerine until
the syrup, when tried in cold water,
is very brittle. Then It must at once
be poured out Into lightly buttered
dishes. .Just before pouring out stir
in two teaspoonfuls of the flavoring
that is liked the best.
one pound of powdered suger in a
shallow pan and allow It to melt slow
ly on the back part of the stoveâ do not
make the mistake of putting it on the
hot part of the stove or add water to
start the melting of the sugar. Have
ready a hot dish, well buttered, and
when the sugar has dissolved to a
liquid consistency, sprinkle the pow
dered nuts In the dish and then pour
the melted sugar over them. Be sure
to spread over enough surface to make
a thin candy, for it Is more delicate
and attractive than when made thick.
Another nut candy that is always
good is almond nougat. It is made by
blanching one pound of almonds, cut in
small pieces. Pour four ounces of honey
into a tin cup and set in a kettle of
hot water. Boil this until It can be
rolled ino a ball. To this add one
ounce of powdered sugar and the well
beaten white of one egg; stir this and
the almonds together. Dust pulverized
sugar over them and you will find
them quite to the queen's taste.

the simplest candies are Â¦ always the

a low-down game and play bad tricks
behind the scenes get punished openly.
I am a thorough psychologist In these
things, believing that we are helped by
influences beyond ourselves.
"While we have broached the psychic, .
however, I would like to make it
clearly understood that I am not a
believer in modern spiritualism. As
the Americans say, I take 'no stock'
whatever in spirit rappings, and all
that sort of thing.
"I have not the slightest doubt, how
ever, that we are aided by things
which are far above and beyond us.
For instance, if a person make up his
mind to accomplish a certain thing
provided, of course. It is salutary in
itselfâ all he has to do is to place him
self in accord with the universe, so
to apeak, and everything In the world
will tend toward the accomplishment
of that object.
Power of the Mind.
"I myself have tested this time and
again, and I know positively what a
great thing it is. When the human
mind concentrates upon accomplishing
a certain object and places Itself In
tune with these unseen powers, de
voutly wishing and working for the
chosen end, events will shape them
selves in accordance with that desire.
"Opportunities will occur as if they
were ordered, and everything â time,
place, space â will conform itself, Just
as If they had been expressly arranged.
The main thing is to become in accord
with these Influences. That once ac
complished, one's aspirations will work
themselves out.
"I have tried to give expression to
this theory In the 'Romance of Two
Worlds,* but that book was written
when I was extremely young â just out
of the conventâ and I realize it3 crud
ities.
"In fact, I am not at all satisfied
with any of my work up to this point.
j and hope some day to give expression
to my thoughts In works that I shall
have reason to be content with. That
is one of the objects of my life. OnÂ»
of my favorite books on this subject
is Trine's 'In Tune With the Infinite.*
There is scarcely a day passes that I
do not read something from It.
The Soul's Immortality.
"The subject of the soul's immortal
ity has long settled itself in my mind. 1
cannot say I believe itâ I know it.
Death to me is nothing. I do not even
admit it. The fact that I am is suffi
cient proof for me that I always was
and always shall be. Even here and
now we can beginâ we have begunâ
immortal life. Our duty here is to place
ourselves, as Trine says, In tunÂ© with
the Infinite.
"I even go so far as to believe that
people could keep themselves in perfect
bodily health by following out the dic
tates of such influences as they feel
bring them into accord with the uni
verse. *
"Death is a mere putting off of one
garment to put on another. Whether
the garment taken up after death be a
, better or worse one than that worn
here depends entirely upon how the
present life is spent.
"These thoughts, so briefly outlined
here, have been constant companions
of mine for years; and, if the health,
strength and time be given me. I cer
tainly intend to elaborate them fully
some day.
"I might tell you that so far as my
psychic theories are concerned. I put
them into practical workings every day
of my life. All my business transac
tions are shaped more or less by their
dictates, and, when I have carried any
undertaking up to a certain point, I
leave it to take care of itself. I always
find that It is taken up just where I
leave It and carried to successful con
clusion. Something distinctly tells me,
'You have done sufficient; leave the
rest to us,' and so I do."
Altogether, Miss Corellis lines have
fallen in pleasant places. Though she
has had one or two great sorrows in
her life which have left their mark, she
Is uniformly cheerful. She is still la

joys enormous contemporary fame.
Miss Corelli's "copy", is very clear
and almost without correction. The
original MSS. of "The Romance of Two
Worlds" looks as if it were a clean
copy made bv some one employed in
writing legal briefs. A specimen of
Miss Corelli's penmanship was given
by her in the little poem, a photo
graph of which accompanies this ar
ticle. The poem is, here reproduced
in MSS. for the first time.

Corelli, "I, have luncheon and then

it has been a .source of Income since.
Even 'Thelma,* my next venture,
brought me very little when first pub
lished. But though I needed money
at- the time it was never my first
thought. I loved writing, and I shall
always love it."
Miss CorelH was asked what method
she employed In producing her work.
"Well, I make it a point to begin
work regularly every morning about
nine-thirty and I remain at it until
two in the afternoon, producing on an
average about two or three thousand
words. I write everything out with
the pen, as I do not care to dictate
and cannot use the typewriter. I have
my manuscripts typed afterward."

"Here is a letter I got the other day
from a girl in Devonshire â quite a
stranger."
Miss Corelli produced from her table
drawer .a letter written by a simpM
country girl living in the west of Eng
land, who thanked the authoress for
having written her book "Ardath,"
which, she stated, had helped her in
her outlook on life. Miss Corelli re
ceives many such letters and Invari
ably answers them with encouraging
words.

Knew, Charles Dickens.
"I spent all my time with the only
father I ever knewâ the song writer
and poet, Charles Mackay, who adopted
me in infancy. With the exception of
lessons in music from a daily govern
ess, he taught me everything. He used
to make me learn poetry by heart, and
when I was about seven he would
make me recite all sorts of famous
pieces, even to the soliloquy in 'Ham
let,' which I used to 'declaim,' so he
told me, very tragically, for the amuse
ment of himself and his friends.
"He was intimate with Charles Dick
ens and Bulwer Lytton and used to tell
me many stories about them. He al
ways encouraged me in the study of
Shakespeare, and at twelve years old I
knew every character in every play,
and could give any quotation its place."
"When did you begin to write any
thing for publication?"
"Some little verses of mine were pub
lished when I was about fourteen. But
I never thought of living by my pen. I
was intended for a musical career, and
it was only when I returned from a
two years' training in a French con
vent that. I learned it would be neces
sary to do something to help my dear
adopted father, who was seriously ill

he had done.

are respectively 'Puck' and 'Ariel.' I
have all I can do to hold them, and

"How is it rou happened to come to
Stratford-on-Avon to live?"
"It arose out of a mere 'sentimental'
association. My stepfather, Dr. Mac
kay, had always promised to take me
to Shakespeare's town, but his death
occurred before we did the promised
pilgrimage. He died in 1890. I visited
Stratford then, while mourning for his
lossâ and wished even at that time to
live there. I had only written four
books then. But circumstances ren
dered this impossible.
The Shakespearean Fight.
"After my serious illness in 1897, and
my slow recovery during 1898, . I again
thought of the old town, and came
back to it. I loved it very much â I
love it still, though there are a sec
tion of persons connected with the
Shakespeare Birthplace Trust who
have done their level best to make me
hate it. But they have not succeeded.
And they have injured themselves in
trying to injure me."
"The old houses you have saved in
Henley street are genuine of Shakes
peare's period?"
"Certainly. The deeds exist that
prove them so.. They are at the birth
place, and the trustees are awara of
them. Nothing but the most willful
obstinacy and ignorance could have
planned such a wholesale transforma
tion of Henlev street as was intended.
Even as it is, future generations will
execrate the men who have altered the
old street, Just as we execrate the
memory of Francis Gastrell, who cut
down Shakespeare's mulberry tree." .
IJow Attack Was Waged.
"The Interest of Stratford is to pre
serve its Shakespearean associations
religiously. At present it is destroying
them as fast as it can and there will
soon be nothing left for any reverent
lovers of Shakespeare to see. Mr. Sid
ney Lee tells us that there is nothing
left genuinely of Shakespeare's time In
the birthplace itself but the cellar and
that is not shown to visitors. So that
enthusiastic Americans are only rever
ing a sham after all, according to Mr.
Lee."
â¢ "Did Mr. Lee help you In your ef
forts to save the old cottages?"
"Mr. Lee helped very much to spread
the libelous assertions of his friend Mr.
Flower against me," replied the novel
ist quietlyâ "and he had no excuse for
doing so, as I wrote him a friendly and
courteous letter, telling him that the
story of my wish to purchase land in
Henley street waÂ« not true, and asking
him 'as a scholar and gentleman,' not to
credit suchi rumors. He never answered
the letter, but he continued to spread
the calumny In a circular letter about

velous â and one might say easy â suc

within her life that had deeply wound
ed it, or that the struggle had Wearied
her.
Though Miss Corelli stated she had
an aversion to being interviewed, still
once entered on the task she answered
every question quite fresly:
"It must be very nice to he so famous
âtell us how it feels."
She laughed. "Well, I suppose it has
its few advantages. But there are a
good many drawbacks as well. Do you
know, sometimes here in Stratford there
will be ever so many groups of people
standing out in the street merely gaz
ing ud at the house. They must find
some pleasure in it or they wouldn't
do it; but it seems so funny!
"Now and theta a venturesome ad
mirer will riner the bell and offer my
butler half a crown (60 cents) to stand
inside the hall for a minute! I wouldn't
say he has always refused the bribe,
but he often has. One cannot help be
ing amused at such a form of hero â or
shall I say heroine â worship. Though I
am sure it is all meant kindly."
Drawbacks of Glory.
"But," she continued, rather sadly,
"among the drawbacks is the grudge
some people seem to bear me for hav
ing earned the right to live. Constant
misrepresentation and downright cal
umny are â¢ so often my portion that
I have ceased to care about it now.
* "But 'what I regret is that in Amer
ica especially they accept their infor
mation about me in the press from
their London correspondents, not one
of whom has ever seen me, except Just
now yourself. These gentlemen take all
their impressions from hearsay, which
they never attempt to verify."
"You bear no very good feeling
toward the press, perhaps?"
"Ah, the old story, cropping up
again," she said laughing. "Please
don't make such a mistake as to re
port that I dislike journalists.
, "I have ever bo many good friends
on the press, men of sterling worth
and ability, and I have no grudge
whatever against my enemies there.
"When I first began my career as

sixteenth century house and retains its
Elizabethan gables at the back. Its
antiquity may be imagined from the
fact that a "manor fee" of eight shil

Charles II upon the house has still

So many erroneous and damaging
things have appeared recently with
reference to the distinguished author
ess that the writer of this article has
Rt last persuaded Miss Corelli to grant
aji interview which would afford the
public a correct idea of one who, up
to this time, has been known only
through her books.
Miss Corelli is not a very persuada
ble person, when it comes to inter
views.
She is a rapid and easy talker on
every topic but one â herself. Extract

is like drawing out leviathan with an
hook.

For years she has shunned the

been an abomination in her sight. Up

ago were the only photographs of Miss

Miss Donald Smith, which hangs on
the wall of the fine old Tudor oak
staircase in Miss Corelli'a home at
Stratford-on-Avon, the pictures which
accompany this article are the only
photographs for which the authoress
has ever sat. She has been persuaded
to have these taken rather than allow

The King, by the way, is a great ad
mirer of her works, and takes the
trouble to sound her praises en all oc
casions. When "Barrabas" was pub
lished In 1893, the Kingâ then Prince
of Wales â went about asking his
friends: "Have you read Mies Co
relll's 'Barrabas?' " which, doubtless,
did not do the book any harm.
In the Corelli home taste, luxury and
wealth are combined very happily, ev-.
erything being In perfect keeping. As
you see all this goodly gear gathered
together you wonder that so much
could have been accomplished by a
"mere woman," alone and unassisted,
solely by Intellectual output.
Quite a Busy Woman.
Miss Corelli's personality is difficult
to describe. She is not tall, yet con
veys the Idea of height. Somehow, you
expect to find her sort of new-woman
ish. As a fact, she Is a very womanly
woman. Her love of flowers amounts
to a passion, and her drawing-room
opens into a winter garden where roses
and lilies and even lilac and laburnum
bloom all the year around. She is a
skilled musician, playing the piano and
mandolin with equal ease, and she Is
quite renowned among her Intimate
friends for her voice and the way she
renders the national ballads and "folk
songs" of various peoples.
She is not, as has been often re
ported of her. Irritated or seriously
put out by the various attacks made
upon her.
"I have too much to do," she says,
"to mind them."
The repulsive caricature -which was
circulated broadcast by her enemies,
after her action for libel at Birming
ham law courts, amused and surprised
more than it distressed her. The offen
sive latter press which in more than
one instance accompanied the cartoon
in its career through some of the
American papers she admitted to be
rather trying.
Miss Corelli displays good taste in
dress, combined with simplicity and
economy. In her own house she wears
very simple gowns, made after the
Greek models, in various pale colors,
such as suit her fair complexion. She
does not care for jewels and seldom
wears any. Her hair is of the true
light golden, so rarely seen and most
difficult to photograph; she dresses it
simply, its natural waves being drawn
loosely back from the temples and
fastened in a thick twist at the nape
of the neck. Her eyes are deep blue,

COOKING TOUGH MEAT TENDER
(N. M. J.). It in quite true that a good
cook can prepare tough meat so that
it will be. tender and palatable. The
secret is in the selection of the meat.
In the correct seasoning of it and cook-
Ing it slowly. Continuous rapid boiling
makes any meat, and particularly beef,
dry and tasteless. Rapid boiling for
five minutes to seal the Juices In the
meat, then slow cooking, just below the
boiling point, for several hours, accord-
Ing to the quantity and quality of the
meat, makes it tender and palatable.
Putting meat In cold water or water
below the bolllnr point, draws out the
natural Juices and leaves the meat
tasteless; adding sail as soon as the
meat. is put in the water also Impairs
Its flavor by drawing out the- Juices,
leaving the fiber flat and tough. The
most approved method of cooking
tough meat tender Is as follows: Sup
pose you have a piece of beef from the

qualities but tough from developed
muscles^ Trim off all the outer skin,
which imparts a strong and unpleasant
flavor, rinse quickly and dry. Put two
tablespoonfuls of fresh beef suet, cut
in small pieces, in a kettle and when
without strain. Repeat twice each
day until fatigued; ten or fifteen times

using the roller over a thin towel or

brows is corrected, then It is merely
the labor of a few weeks, unless one is

cleansing of the skin with warm soapy
water. As oils are more or less of
fensive in hot weather I would sug
gest that you use a good skin food only
once each day, preferably at night, and
dry massage in the morning. Rub the
cream lightly over the forehead, then
place the finger tips of both hands
above the nose and draw backward
toward the temples in a stroke motion.
Repeat this for ten minutes then begin
at the temple and go over the forehead

Irritating the skin. Begin lower down
and continue Just above the eyebrows,
then go over each deep wrinkle, also
in a rotary movement, repeating many
times. Then stroke the skin upward,

face with soap to remove all traces of
oil and massage, this time without the
use of the cream, but with the move

TREATING DISCOLORED SKIN
(Esther C. L.). â When the skin of the
face is discolored by the application of
a plaster of mustard or anything else
which is inclined to blister, the treat
ment must be of a very soothing na
ture and applied frequently to hasten
the restoration of the natural color. Do
not use any preparation which is large
ly composed of glycerine, for it will Ir
ritate the skin. Oil Is most valuable,
for it will nourish the pores, softening
any dead cuticle, which may then be
wiped away without pain or soreness,
and It also prevents the parched skin
from peeling deeply. Sweet oil or cocoa
butter are both excellent, and the spot
should be freely anointed before re
tiring and enough rubbed in at Inter
vals during the day to keep the skin
moist. As soon as the tenderness Is re
lieved make a solution of peroxide of
hydrogen, one part to five parts oC
water, and dabble the spot freely sev
eral times each day. This will usually
bleach out j any remaining discolora
tion. Watch the _spot closely, and if It
still shows a drawn, parched appear
ance rub in a little oil from time to
time, while continuing the use of the
solution. Dilute only a small quantity
,of the peroxide dally, for it loses
strength quickly. Keep the undiluted
portion in a cool place and away from
the light.
IMPROVING OIT.Y HAIRâ (Edna).
Hair which is inclined to be excessively
oily 13 always especially provoking
during the summer when a girl wishes
to look her best. Perspiration, humid
ity and the more abundant natural flow
of oil conspire to keep the dainty girl
in constant perplexity as to wnat to
do to prevent the obnoxious stringy
look so fatal to good grooming. While
the free use of soaps, ammonia, etc.
will keep the hair dry, excessive clean
ing is not advisable as it causes the
hair to lose its pretty shade and take
on a dull faded look. Constant sham
pooing, like bathing, may be overdone.
The following regimen Is practical and
without detrimental effects. Brush the
hair daily for at least flrteen minutes,
night and morning. Shampoo once in
three weeks. Massage gently while ap
plying a tonic lotion. Have your drug
gist prepare this lotion: Forty grains
of resorcin, two ounces of alcohol, one
ounce of bay rum and two ounce3 dis
tilled water. Rub well Into the scalp
once each day for two weeks, after
which every alternate night will be
sufficient.

TO PREPARE A ROSE PILLOW
(Mrs. O. E.). â To prepare rose leaves
for a pillow gather the fresh petals
during the middle of a clear day when
free from dew or rain. All kinds of
roses may be used and the blossoms
should be pulled apart and the petals
spread out thinly on sheets of tissue
paper In any airy place away from the
direct rays of the sun to dry. As soon
as the petals begin to curl up and feel
dry to the touch they must be put in
a roomy bag of thin cheese cloth to
prevent blowing about. In a cool, dry
room, where the air circulates freely.
Unless this part of the work is care
fully done the petals will have a dis
agreeable musty odor. Pillows filled
with dried flowers are generally more
or less epiced, according to individual
taste, but if you wish to retain the
true odor only it will be necessary to
add the perfume of the fresh rose, lost
in the drying process, by a small

he said! /'You've set yourself on fire,

sunshine, sucking his candy, until the
vision blurred in his dim old eyes. Then
he returned to his brazier. He sat
down, and drew his chair almost over
it. He bent double, with his elbows on
his knees and his head resting on his
hands, and there he >sat alone for a
long time. Finally he straightened up.
The subtle warmth of the fire had
stolen through his body. He leaned back
in his chair, his head drooped over to
one side, and his work-worn old hands
lay palm upward on his knees. He was
fast asleep. The brazier under him con
tinued to glow and send its cheery
comfort stealing up around his chair.
It had a friendliness and hearty
warmth that were more than the kind
ness of many of the old man's friends.
The dusk of evening came down and
filled the corners with shadows. And
presently a glow that was not all in the
brazier began to illuminate the center
of the room. A thin, wavering mist of
smoke curled up around the old man
and crept silently along the dingy ceil
ing. ' A moment later there was a sharp
burst of flame that disappeared as sud
denly as it came. The old man's
trousers leg rested against 1 the hot
brazier, and the fine fire gnawed and
sparkled In the heavy cloth. A few
shavings on the littered floor of the
shop were crisping with sudden wisp3
of flame, and the chair legs were on
fire. I But Uncle Luther slept on, wholly
unconscious of his danger.
Jonathan Dowell, returning from the
village, saw a sinister glare in the shop
windows. He rushed into the room,
seized the old man and lifted him
swiftly to one side. Then he beat out
the fire with a gunny sack.
Uncle. Luther sat up, trembling and
terrified. His wooden leg was gone. It
had burned almost to the stump, and
the charred remains were still smoking.
Jonathan Dowell's voice rang with
anger. v
"It's good of you to say so," said
Uncle Luther, "but I jus' can't do it.
Tommy's the man," and then he add
ed wistfully, "I wisht I could see
Tommy."
But Uncle Tommy did not come.
Uncle Luther heard, however, that
Uncle Tommy had been appointed
marshal of the parade, and he was
glad of it. P'or himself, he was busied
after the first day or two with a
stout piece of ash, which he slowly
whittled down with a draw shave to
the proportions of a wooden leg. It
would not do as well as a regular ar
tificial leg, such as the one he had
been wearing, but he hoped that it
would serve him for the Memorial day
exercises. He still cherished a desire
to march with the parade, although
he knew that Jonathan would not ap
prove of it. He was afraid of Jona
than. But whole days slipped by
wherf he-was not strong enough to
work, and yet he clung to the task
with feverish eagerness. The man
within him protested that he was still
good for something, that old age had
not robbed him 'of everything.
On the morning of Memorial day
the whittling was all finished, but
there remained the task of attaching
the 1 straps and Uncle Luther knew
that he could not hope to complete
the leg in time for the exercises. So
he laid it away and' toward noon he
dressed UDyih his best blue clothes and
put on hi3 wide brimmed black hat
with the gold cord around the crown.
Then he hobbled out of the door and
dropped, down on a box by the fence
with his back resting against a post.
It was a fresh, clear May .morning.
During- the night there . had been a
shower and the grass at the roadside
"I was thinkin'," he said, "that now
I can't march, p'raps Amery might let
Tommy have it â "
Captain Enoch frowned darkly, but
Uncle Luther hurried on:
"He's more commandin'-that I be,
er ever was, er ever will be, an' he's
had practice "
"Oh, you'll be ready to march by
Decoration day," interrupted Captain
Enoch.
" 'Twant so bad as if you hadn't lost
it, before," he comforted.
But Uncle Luther had no mind for
treating his loss frivolously. The years
has crushed all of the humor out of
him, and left him only tragedy.
"Get in," commanded Uncle Tommy,
in a voice that was not to be disputed.
Uncle Luther, sitting as straight aa
a trooper, drove out at the head of the
procession, while the band, with a rat
tle of rums, swept into "Hall, Colum
bia, Happy Land."
Uncle Luther strapped on the leg
with trembling, inefficient fingers, and
then Captain Enoch and Uncle Tommy
marched him out between them. Uncle
Tommy's ov.n horse and buggy, deco
rated with ribbons and flowers, stood
In front of the shop.
"You're goin' to be the marshal of
the day," said Captain Enoch.
"Butâ Tommy "
"I calculate to make a speech," ha
stammered; "but â we thought we'd
decorate the livin' this year. Lather,
here's a new tpg."
He held out the odd-shaped package

to see it at all. He reached forward
and put his hands on his brother's
shoulders, and the leg fell down un
heeded between the two old men.

stopped, almost in front of his own
little shop. The band had swung out
to one side. It was playing â¢'Amer
ica," and the sweet, shrill voices of
the children rose and fell with the
music. Uncle Luther sank back on
his box. trembling.. Through a mist
of great happiness he saw Uncle Tom
my and Captain Enoch advancing to
ward him side by side. He couldn't
believe it at first; he didn't pretend to
believe it.
"I'm gettin* old." he muttered, "an*
I'm not steady in my mind."
But he rose to meet them. Uncla
Tommy carried an odd-shaped package
In his arms, and when he was near to
Uncle Luther he stopped and cleared
his throat. Every one was silent, lis
tening.
And that shows how two brothers,
who have been boys together, men to
gether, and soldiers together, may drift
apart. For years Uncle Tommy and
Uncle Luther had not met, except at
gatherings of old soldiers, and these
were not pleasant meetings. For the
two little towns, albeit they lay out on
the wide Minnesota prairie, with only
an imaginary line between them, could
not agree. It was the^kind of dissen
sion that grows rank and strong in lit
tle communities where there arc few
outside interests to occupy the inter
vals of attention. And the old soldiers
took it up, ajid fought it out as valiant
ly as they had marched on Vicksburg.
They might have had a Grand Army
post, with reminiscent camp fires, and
they might have had Fourth of July
celebrations and Memorial day pa
rades; but as certainly as Uncle Tom*
my led the hosts of West Alden in one
direction, Amery and Captain Enoch
Bradley could be depended upon to
inarch in exactly the opposite direction.
As for Uncle Luther, he always fol
lowed Uncle Tommy's procession wher
ever it might lead. Again and again
the old soldiers of the two towns met
in the interests of harmony. Uncle
Tommy would come to preside, and
Uncle Luther would second the motions,
and then all would slump off into the
quagmire of dissension. At such times
the fires of a stirring past would blaze
up in Uncle Luther's faded eyes, his
stooped shoulders would stiffen back,
a faint flush would steal into his
cheeks, and he would nod his old gray

UNLE TOMMY DOWELL and
L'nHe Luther Dowell were twins
only in age and patriotism. In
everything: else they were as dif
ferent as b'ack and white or hot and
cdd. Uncle Tommy was short and
puffy, and bald of head, with a remin
iscent twinkle in his blue eyes and a
t ertain sprightlincss in his step that
quite belied his age. Also, he had two
srood, stout, stubby legs, although they
were a bit bowed and stiff, so that be
thumped smartly with his* heels when
he walked.
What Uncle Tommy lacked of reach
ing nature's' standard of a man. Uncle
Luther made up. He was gaunt and
stooping, and so spare that one almost
expected to hear him rattle in his old
blue clothes like withered peas in a
pod. Fine trouble lines mapped his
forehead, and his beard" was thin and
pray. When he walked he lurched at
every step and bore heavily on his
cane, for he had left his good right leg
on the bloody slopes of Chickamauga,
and for nearly thirty years he had
stumped painfully about on a wooden
leg.
Uncle Tommy was bluff and prosper
ous. He lived in a comfortable house
in West Alden, and when all of his
children came home for Thanksgiving
dinner Uncle Tommy's wife put all the
spare leaves in the dining table and
carved two turkeys.
Uncle Luther had a little one story
shop, across the county line in the ad
joining town of Amery, where he sol
dered pans and tinkered clocks. It
vts next the lane, in the farther cor
ner of his son Jonathan's land, and he
made up his own bed and cooked his
meals in the little room in the rear.
He seemed at least twenty years older
Uncle Luther walked up the road
alone. His step was brisker than usual,
and there was- a brighter gleam in his
eye. He could not Jielp feeling proud
that he had been honored. There were
other men in Amery who would have
served better im his placeâ he knew
that well enough, for he was old, and
he didn't walk easilyâ but he was glad
with the joy of appreciation. For so
many years he had been an unnoticed,
crippled tinker, and when at last rec
ognition came to him, even at the ex
pense of his more fortunate brother, he
could not help exulting.
"Well, I fought fer it," he mumbled;
"an* 1 bled fer it. I'd a-given both my
legs, if necessary; they know that."
Then, after a pause, he said aloud,
"But I wisht Tommy'd got it."
He opened the door of his little shop
and went in. His eyes swept the fa
miliar disorder of the room, the rusty
tools hanging on the wall, the blear
faced old clocks, the pots and pans, all
the toys of a second childhood. He was
glad to be at home again, for. he was
worn out with the excitement
of the meeting. Outside the sun shone
on the green prairies, and there was'
warm, puddly dust in the road; but
Uncle Luther's .blood was thin and
cold, and he shivered in the damp in
terior of the shop. So he brought his
soldering brazier, from thd corner and
stirred the coals into a bright glow.
Then he bent over to warm his hands.
Jonathan Dowell came down the lane
between his prosperous fields on his
way to town. Little. Dick was with
him. When Uncle Luther saw them he
went to the door and beckoned.
"Come in, Jonathan! Come, in!" he
called.
His face shone with pride and he told
with feverish eagerness of the new
honor which the day had brought him.
"Nonsense," Interrupted Jonathan
testily. "Don't you know, father, that
you're gettin' too old and feeble to take
part in such things? You ain't able
to walk to the graveyard an' back, an*
you're only stirrin* up trouble between
the families. Uncle Tommy'll never
forgive you."
"I know it," he faltered: "I know it.
Jonathan. Tommy'd ought to. have it.
I told 'em so. . I said Tommy'd ought to
have it."
. The end of the lane was the end of
Dick's little world, and he turned and
loitered back, humming a tune, to him
self, as a child will. Uncle Luther ;
stood. in the doorway and watched him
wistfully. Of a sudden he recalled. how
Uncle Tommy had looked when ' they
were boys together. k
"Jus*, like Tommy, exactly," â¢ he said,
half aloud, gazing fondly at the little
fellow. Then he bent over, him stiffly
and beckoned. '
"Come see gran'pa," he said.. smiling
enticingly.
Dick crossed his hands behind his
back and looked at Uncle- Luther so
berly. He was a sunny haired little
fellow, with: blue syes and puckery red
lips, and he stood full in the -.bricht
May sunshine. Uncle Luther regarded
him seriously.
"I told 'em I didn't want to march."
,he said, protestingly. "I said Tommy'd
do it better'n I could. But < Captain
Enoch, ner any of 'em, would listen to

met again, thoroughly determined* to
be harmonious. _. In ten minutes' time
Uncle Tommy was thumping on the
jiiKc table with his cane, ai\d several
other old soldiers were clinging to
Captain Enoch's coat-tails, while the
two men glared and threatened. And
then Captain P^noch executed a well
planned flank movement, routed Uncle
Tommy and ran up the Amery colors.'
A few minutes later his faction, acting
with the right of might, had decided,
upon all the important features of the
parade. And to further rout Uncle
Tommy and his retainers, they ap
pointed Uncle Luther to the honored
position of marshal of the. day. , â¢
At first Uncle Luther was dumb
with jistonishment. He had as good
right to be marshal as Uncle /Tommy.
They had belonged to the same regi^
ment, and both had reached the rank
of corporal. Uncle Luther on one leg
and Uncle Tommy on two. But Uncle
Luther always had deferred to Uncle
Tommy as if he had been an older
brother, and it seemed to him hardly
short of sacrifice to appear as Uncle
Tommy's rival. So tie struggled to "his
feet, and held up a lean finger to catch
Captain Enoch's eye.
"I rather have Tommy have the
place," he faltered; "he's better fitted
for it than I be."
But Uncle Tommy was storming
down the room.
"Keep it!" he roared, andÂ» he went
out, slamming the door after him.
Uncle Luther followed him a few
steps, wistfully, and then he dropped
back into his seat, and listened dumbly
while Captain Enoch and the exultant
revolters planned the details of the
parade.
"lÂ£'s Amery's turn this year," gloated
Captain Enoch.
For two years the towns had- held
Memorial day services, but they, had
been mournfully dispirited. Uncle
Tommy, by 'sheer force of character,
had been marshal of the day, and
Uncle Luther and a few stragglers
from Amery had marched with the
parade; but Captain Enoch , and his
supporters stood by with gloomy for
bearance and offered no word of en
couragement. There was really little
need of Memorial day services, except
in the abstract. The cemetery, where
the discord of the^ two towns was
buried, lay on a bare prairie knoll, set
around with precise rows of spindling
eottonv,oods that languished half the
summer with thirst and whipping
winds and dust â and it contained no
soldiers' Ki'avcs. But Uncle Tommy's
parades marched up the road to the
cemetery gate and back again, and
Untie Luther felt that the country's
dead, wherever they might lie, had
bcerl honored. . .
that none but he could hear. Some
times the tears came up to his eyes, and
the boy who was fortunate enough to
hear him talk thrilled with the quick
pride of strife and longed to shoulder
a carbine and march away to the mu
sic of fife and drum. '
News travels quickly in a small town,
and the next morning the sympathetic
and the. curious came to condole with
fUncle Luther, and . to examine the re
mains of the fifty-dollar i leg, and to
point out where the fire had charred
the chair. â¢ They went about solemnly,
as at a funeral, glancing sideways from
the corners of their eyes, and yet not
missing anything.
Among the very first to call was Cap
tain Enoch Bradley, who was a hearty,
warm-blooded, irascible old fellow, and
his bluff sympathy went far toward
solacing; Uncle Luther in his affliction.
"Too bad to trouble Jonathan an' his
wife," he muttered. â "Cory is so thrif
ty an' partie'lar. I'm careless, I know
it. I'm gettin' old." And then after
a time his mind reverted to the ear
lier interests of the day, and he said
aloud: "I wish Tommy'd got it."
Uncle Luther was glad when his son
vent away. He crept to his little. back
room like a wounded dog, and lay down
on the bed. Old age had made him
sli/w, and he could not realize at first
the full magnitude of his disaster; but
he- knew that he had deeply angered
his son.
"Don't go 'way," said Uncle Luther,
eagerly; "come an' see what gran'pa's
got for Dicky."
He turned and hobbled painfully
across his shop. He put on his spec
tacles and opened a drawer in his
workbench, and in its depths he found
a stick of horehound candy.' Dick stood
with one pudgy hand resting on the
door frame, peering into the shop-with
wide eyes. *
"Candy," announced .Uncle Luther,
expressively.
Dick drew a little nearer, glancing
from the candy to his grandfather's
wrinkled face. Uncle Luther waved
the stick like a wizard's wand, and
lured Dick nearer and nearer until a
dirty little hand closed over the candy.
Then he reached out slowly and cau
tiously and gathered Dick in his arms.
"Ain't you goin' to kiss gran'pa?" ha
asked eagerly. ; .
But the little boy wriggled away, and
ran out of the door. Uncle Luther
watched him loitering: up the lane in the
me..-- Don't, go, 'way. Dicky, don't go
way, an' leave gran'pa." .beseechingly.
But the little boy was edjsrinjr away;
he didn't understand, and he was
afraid. * v^ r A?
"Down with the traitor, up with
the star," he' chanted in his thin,
quavery, old voice.
Now they had reached the end of
the lane, and Uncle Luther could
make out the full length of the
parade. It was by far the greatest
celebration that the town ever had
known and ' his heart swelled with
pride at the thought. Not once did he
recall his owi) disappointment and
sorrow; it was all for the glory of the
day. f v '
Suddenly. Uncle Luther shrank
back. What were they trying to do?
He felt an impulse to run forward and
tell them inat they had missed the
way to tfce cemetery, and that the
lane ran only as far as Jonathan
Dowell's house. But before he could
Then the old fellows in blue swung
at the corner, they were keeping mili
tary line, and something of the old
spirit had thrilled their steps into an
unwonted precision. The band, wheel
ing with them, swept into "Rally
Round the Flag, Boys." Uncle Luther
leaped forward on his one good leg,
waved his hat around hjs head, and
shouted, "Hurrah, hurrah!" His head
was thrown back, his eyes flashed, his
breath came quick and hot.
Uncle Luther put on his long-dis
tance glasses and he saw a blur of
blue moving along the road from the
village. Above it there was a blur of
red and white. A moment later they
resolved themselves into a knot of old
soldiers, with the flag flapping^above
them. Uncle Luther took a long
breath and his eyes shone. Suddenly
a band began to play the stirring mu
sic of ''Marching; Through Georgia."
"They've got the band," exclaimed
Uncle Luther, in a voice that choked
with ecstasy.
Unconsciously he rose on his one
good foot and took off his hat. His eyes
dimmed, and as the enlivening strains
of the music came up to him another
picture formed on his misty glasses. He,
saw the boys in blueâ not a meager
handful of gray and stooping remnants,
but boys with fresh young faces and
broad shoulders and proud chins. They
were muddy to the knees with march
ing, they were ragged and tattered,
but they swept by to the drums and
fifes, regiment after regiment and bri
gade after brigade; and orderlies clat

UNCLE LUTHER DOWELL'S WOODEN LEG.What she saw was the face of a
superior, who looks with a certain
amount of interest and indulgence
upon the pranks of a willful child.
She instantly felt as if she were a
small, shivering thing In the midst of
a big, cold world,' though she clutch
ed frantically at her oozing dignity.
"I don't see how you dare talk to
me in such a manner," she began,
with a look that was meant to crush
him. But the rest of the sentence
was lost, for. instead of returning to
the worm state againâ as by every
token he should have done â he sim
ply burst into an amused laugh. H\?
The rhythmic rumbling of the wheels,
the whirling lights outside where the
dusk had deepened into velvety black
ness, the cheerful brightness of the car,
all seemed unreal.
She had boarded a train at Jersey
City like a queen with a faithful, hum
ble servant in tow, a servant whom,
in her heart of hearts, she valued, but
of whose devotion she was so sure that
her estimate of him was. disparaging
for that very reason? And nowâ two
hours later â everything had changed!
. Even now, out of the tail of his eye,
she could - see that he was regarding
the handsome, well-set head -of a girl
who occupied a chair a few rows ahead
of them with the Interest of a man
who realizes that you never know when
or how you may' meetâ Her !
For the time being he actually seemed
to have forgotten her royal self com
pletely. It was all very well to pretend
to give her the choiceâ allowing her to
abdicate, as It were. In reality, she

Beneath his nonchalance she had ex

plainly from hi3 eyes on other occa

istence and answered her with cheer
ful readiness:
"You are the fourth." he announced
shamelessly, and at the words her
eyes blazed into his again involun
tarily and he became lost in a great
contentment. Usually she refused him
so differently! It was: "You see, I
don't love you in that way, though I
want you for a friend. Somewhere
there is a nice girl waiting for you
and we'll find her together." Jerrold
gloated inwardly at the way In which
the tables had turned and marveled
at his own stupidity.
He left a lively interest of fellow
ship with the worm that turned glow
ing in his veins. After months of ab
jectness he tingled with the conscious
ness that Richard was himself again
and no longer a man made weakly
indulgent by his love. In the nutter
ing of her nostrils he could read the
anger and resentment that was surg
ing through her and he found the
sight exhilarating. . She- was in sad
need of subjugating, this Katherine of
his, and he applied himself to the
task with a keener zest than he had
ever before experiencd.; There was
Just a hint of mockery in his tone
when next he addressed her.
"Of course," he continued, as if the
ten minutes of tense silence that had
elapsed since his last remark was the
most natural thing in the' world, "it
rests entirely with you whether 'to
be continued* or 'concluded' shall be
written after this, the fourth chap

suddenly ceased to absorb all of Miss
PIxley's attention. She turned toward
him like a cornered creature prepared
to conceal her chagrin to the ut
most. But at the expression of his
"Might I ask just where I occur in

tone whose exaggerated indifference

She stopped so abruptly that Jerrold
yas comically reminded of a fractious
saddle horse he had once owned, which
'would terminate a mad run with the
same abruptness, planting his forefeet
as rigidly as pokers. At last he had
touched a responsive chord.
"You were atout to remsxk?" he

HER LAST CALL
A strange thrill ran through Ethel
Pixley, and she turned toward . the
man beside ' her.' It was only by an
effort that she kept from holding out
her hands to him. His .face was grave
almost, to sternness, and under his
masterful glance, her own eyes fell,
and she wondered in a sort of*desper
ation whether her lips were quivering.
"As he says, Ethel, it's the last call,
and I'm waiting for your answer."
Her only reply was a swift uplift
ing of the eyes : that ' he remembered
for- years afterward as the sweetest
thing he had ever witnessed in the
way of April \ showers, and, later â¢' on,
when .they had responded to the last
call for dinner, the waiter wopdered
and chuckled,' too, as he tucked Into
his pocket the crisp, two-dollar bill
that he received as his share of the
spoils. .
(Copyright, , 1904, by Mary McKeon.)
"From chapter to chapter!" she. fin
ished sarcastically, and at the look of
hot scorn that accompanied the words
he had a gloating idea that the day
was won.
At this juncture a picturesque figure
appeared at the end of the car, above
whose snowy garments a head that
looked as if it were finely turned
bronze, rose superbly.
"Last call for dinner in the dining
car!" called. a musical voice, as he
lounged dow'n the aisle with the gait
of a man who has his sea legs on.
"Dinner now ready in the dining-car."
There was a brief pause when he
passed them and disappeared at the
other end of the car,, but his voice
floated back to them, barely audible
above the rumble of the wheels, and
freighted with a lingering ominous
"Last call!"
was convinced that she was dethroned.
"HandBome girl up there, isn't it?"
he observed with enthusiasm, turning
toward her at last with the furtively
apologetic air of a man who has mo
mentarily forgotten himself. "So well
set up! Look at those shoulders and
the poise of that head! Regular Juno!"
Ethel PIxley assented stiffly. "You
have not always admired that type,
though," she added defiantly. "You
used to say you thought girls like that
masculine!"
"What a blind idiot I must have
been!" was the placid rejoinder, "and
how one's standard of feminine beauty
changesâ"
Vf^TNHYLLIS," I asked, "will you
fl> J marry me?"
Y^ "Seven!" said Phyllis.
X I looked in astonishment.
"Seven?" I questioned. "Seven
what?"
"Why? the score, you silly," she re
sponded demurely. "Some one harc to
keep track of It." ,
That's the trouble with Phyllis. If her
sense of humor were not so highly de
veloped I'm quite sure I would have
had her ages ago. She never will take
me seriously.
"Bother the score," I cried desperate
ly; "anyway, we'll not count the other
six times."
"But I would very much rather."
Phyllis was staring into the fire. I
didn't know Just what she meant. I
never was much good at guessing."
' "Well," I answered indifferently,
"just as you please. , Count them if you
like. All I meant was that none of them
mattered so much as this time."
"Positively your last chance, ladies
and gentlemen," she cried gayly.
I assented in my most dignified man
ner. Phyllis laughed. I do wish she
would take me seriously once In a while.
â¢ /'Why'dc^you keep on proposing to me
like this?" she asked me.
I shrugged my shoulders.
"If you must have it," I replied flip
pantly, "I suppose it's my little form of
diversion â my hobby, if you will. We
all have our hobbles more or less, you
. know." : .
Phyllis frowned. I liked that frown
Immensely. Then she looked at* me
quickly when I was not expecting it.
"You appear to be enjoying your
seif," she complained.
"Me?" I aueried in mock innocence.
"Oh, I protest; really I'm not!"
Phyllis frowned again.
"Well, then, you ought to be."
"I know," I agreed; "I ought to be.
Seven times ought to be productive of
more than it / has shown so far. I
wonder," I concluded dreamily to my
self, "I wonder if eight will do it."
"You haven't been answered for
seven yet," said Phyllis.
"No," said I; "nor for any of the
â¢other six either."
, "Now, there was Darcy Graham,"
said Phyllis inconsequentially. "He
asked me to marry him nineteen times
and swore eternal devotion each time
whether I would have him or no.
There's a man for you!"
"And then went and married Kitty
Macpherson," said I, almost to my
self.
"No," corrected Phyllis; "Kitty
married him."
â¢'Willie Atkinson came next," I ven
tured. '
"He only ran up to thirteen," said'
Phyllis.
"Which accounts for his failure," I
suggested.
Phyllis paid no attention to my re
mark.*.
"I : think the little fellow from the
bank whom I - met - in the summer
came after that?" she murmured in
terrogatively.
Phyllis locked at me with a funny
little smile. She never will take me
seriously.
"I suppose this will make a new
climax." said she.
. But her looks belied her words and
for once I was bright enough to see^
"No." said I as distinctly aa my
throat would let me. "this is not a
climax. This is a beginning!"
(Copyright, 1904, by Hubert McBean Johnston.)
"Thanks." I replied; "but with a score
of seven it does not seem have bene
fited me greatly. Will it do me any good
to make it eight?"
Phyllis toyed with the corner of tha
sofa cushion.
"You might do a great deal better,"
said she deprecatlngly.
"Then I don't have to make It eight?"
cried I, for once in my life comprehend
ing.
â¢ "I did not say Just that, sir," said
Phyllis saucily. ,
I den't thiEk I ever saw Phyllis look
so beautiful, and the odd part of It was.
I couldn't see her eyes,- either. She was
staring full' Into the fire all the time.
If it makes her look that, way, I wish
she Would look into the fire always.
â¢ "But I do make it eight, Phyllis."
Â«aid I soberly. '.-'.:.h'..-
I took hold of her arm , and turned
her round so that she was facing me:
but she still held her head down and I
could sea only her eyelashes. Phyllis
has long eyelashes.
"And you'll marry me, Phyllis?" I
whispered. I don't know whether I
raised my tone interrogatively or not.
I hadn't the same control over my
voicn that I had the other seven times.
"No, nothing serious," said Phyllis.
"But an awful lot of little things. I
think you need some one to take care
of you." - .."o -. .; v
"Parks Is an exceptional valet," said
I in his defense.
"Now, a wifeâ" began Phyllis, mus
ingly.
I laughed.
"Yes." said Phyllis, taking no notice;
"I think you need a wife. Why don't
you propose, to some nice girl. Jack?"
"I have," said I stoutly.
"Huh!" snorted Phyllis in disbelief.
"How many proposals have you Â«vtr
"Seven," said I.
I think Phyllis was pleased. Anyway,
she smiled a little.
"There was the Rawshaw girl." said
she warnlngly.
"Nice girl," I assented warmly.
"Nothing particularly queenllka about
a girl's carriage, though, when she's
only five foot three."
"And Bessie Fleming?"
Phyllis was getting back at me.
' "A sweet creature," I agreed; "but I
really prefer blondes."
â¢ "And then â¢ there's a - whole host of
others you. might have if you wanted
them. You're a catch, you know."
"I know." said I wearily. "You might
have been nicer, though, and said that
I was very popular. It all means the
same, perhaps, but there are prettier
ways of saying it."! *' >; >>
"Oh, no," said Phyllis sweetly, "you're
rather nice as well.". tri.';' 1 *:â¢:.
"Jack," she said, "you have soma
gray hairs."
"It's not polite of you to remind mÂ«
of It," I said. t
"And your complexion isn't as good
as it used to be," she continued. "Be
sides, there are a lot of little thingsâ
particularly about your clothes."
"Nothing serious, I trust?" I asked in
alarm.
I had expected Phyllis to be affected;
instead, she burst out laughing. That's
the trouble with Phyllis; she never will
take me seriously.
"You're a goose," she compliment
ed me. . ...
"Aw, thanks," I murmured.. "So good
of you."
Phyllis regarded me gravely. : Now^
it's an odd thing, but whenever Phyllis
looks at a fellow like that he feels sort
of funny all over, you know. I don't
know Just what it is. I think it must
be what they call personal mag
netism. "..-. -f r .\ 'Â¦ r :-
"Suppose, though, I were to accept
you some time?" queried PhyHIa in an
awful tone. , .
"I would have a new climax for the
next one," said I. I natter myself I
said it indifferently.
"The very idea!" I murmured in a
surprised sort of way. "I never even
Insinuated such a thing. But you
know," I concluded dismally, "you
haven't had a proposal In three
weeks."
"I have," Insisted Phyllis; "I had
one just to-night."
"Oh, but that doesn't count." said I;
"you told me so yourself. These are
only sort of trial heats to keep you in
form, "you know." j
"Oh!" sniffed Phyllis. :;';
"Besides," I added, . "I need material
for my storiqs." . . â¢ ,
"What a risk you are willing to run
for the sake of material!" said Phyllis.
"It is necessary that ona make
some sacrifices for the sake of art," I
explained. ..V.V/
"How awful it must be to be laid on
the shelf," I remarked sympathetic
ally.
"I'm not!" asserted Phyllis Indig
nantly, v: â¢*Â¦>*:;
"I can't remember who was next,"
said Phyllis quickly. "Do you know?"
"I think," said I reflectively, "I
added about two to my own score that
day; I alway3 liked you in white, you
know."
"One," said Phyllis, consulting her
tablets.
"Hold your head that way again," I
said. ''"What long eyelashes you
have!"
Phyllis deliberately turned the other
way.
"Hold it round," I commanded. "I
want to look at it."
Phyllis held it round. Phyllis likes
to be commanded at times â only a fel
low's got to know when to do it.
"A rather pretty mouth, too," said
I gravely, "and your color is also very
fair yet. One would never guess you
were getting up in years."
"I'm not," denied Phylll3 with a
certain assumption of dignity; ."I'm
only 23." * .
"You don't show it," I responded
gallantly. "Were I asked to make a
guess I should say 'sweet 16 and â ' "
"Quite so!" said Phyllis dryly, v ,-â¢'
"Surely you don't count him?" I
questioned in surprise. "Why, you
told me yourself that he only lasted
till the second round." '
"He would probably have stayed
longer if you hadn't come down that
Sunday," said Phyllis in a vexed way.
"You always do turn up at the most
inopportune moments."

me â " I began.

A NEW CLIMAX
Tamasa's keen eyes studied tha youth
whose gaze followed the link behind
her in the clrclings of the endless chain,
and the result of the study was made
apparent in open encouragement or
harsh repudiation.
At the gangplank Tamasa's eyes
were almost kindly, for Miguel, the
Fcrutinizer ,. of fruit,, received thirty
eight cents a day; but Fana's gaze at
that noint dropped resolutely to her
feet, for Miguel was ill-favored and
morose.
In the ship's hold Tamasa's good
nature changed to black looks, while
Fzna's gaze rose swiftly and sweetly
and happily. Rafo received but 19
cents a day, but he was handsome and
blithe-hearted and straightforward..
Hound and round .circled the end
less chain, bearing- its stream of ban
anas from the wharf to the hold, and
like alternating belts of sunshine and
cloud changed the faces of old Tama
sa and youthful Farta aa they went
from gangplank to hold and hold to
gangplank.
Under ordinary circumstances ' the
gangplank was amply v.-ide for the
loaded chain, but Fafo's unchanging
politeness in the hold and Fana's per
sistent coldness at the plank had
.*7"f LONG line of b?rdins figures
f { passed \;!> the gangplank into
1 â¢ I the hold <>f the vessel, then back
JL by another plank to the wharf,
vhere they arsin connected with the
line, forming an endless chain. Each
link was a wo:nan. and upon every
Eloping back v,as a bunch of bananas.
At the wharf er.d of the gangplank
a man gave a glance ::t the number of
clusters, or "hands," upon the bunches
as they passed, and then called out
<heir sizes In a sring-song "one-half
buhch." "one batch.** "two and a half,"
"two." "one and a half." "one," "one,"
'"two," and ar.otlifr man with a b<x>k
upon a board, placed across a barrel,
marked them down.
In the hold two men directed ths
women where to place the fruit. Both
of these were "eor.chs"; one. a rough.
brutal looking fellow, who merely
nodded directions and scowled, and
the other a laughing, jesting young
ster, who gave his orders by spring
ing forward and helping each woman
to deposit her bunch in its proper
place
Usuaily the women thanked him
with looks c-r words, Eonne of them
adding: "You good boy. Rafo," or,
."Ev'body goin' smile on you if you
keep on like dis."
But one link of the human chain
.'there was that did not thank him with
.looks or words either. She was old and
shrunken, with covetous, auspicious
eyes, and when Rafo sprang forward
. she always met him with angry snarl
ings ar.3 would never allow him tc
- touch her bunch. But not a whit dif
:ference did it make to Rafo. His sons
or laugh went on just as light heartedly
as ever, and when her portion of the
chain came round again he was wait
ins as usual with his ready offer of
; help, his ready laugh and his friendly
" eyes.
Â¦ Just behind the old woman circled a
young grirl. as young as Rafo, and
beautiful in "spite of her dark face and
bare fe<=-t and tattered garments; â¢ in
spite of her hare shoulders with their
burden of bananas. She was always the
. link in the chain behind eld Tamasa,
her mother, and Ilafo never had time
for more than one swift glance into
her eye? before Tamasa had deposited
her bunch and whirled upon them with
her hawk-like eyes.
. It was just the seme on shore at
the Tamasa hutâ the two links were al
ways together. Tamasa loved but one
thing in the worldâ her daughter Fana.
Nothing was too good for Fana, noth
' ing too high to be hor rd for her. So
darkened more and more the tempes
tuous countenance of Tamasa. until; at
last, just after they had passed the sul
len Miguel, her resentment got the
better . of . her tenderness and ahe
turned with a sharp reprimand.
But Fana had not yet raised her
eyes f rom - her feet and' the '*â¢ conse
quence of Tamasa's checking the reg
ular motion' of the chain brought them
together and swayed the bunch .of
bananas from its delicate balance.
Fana tried to right herself, but in
vaim A moment . later there was a
loud splash in "the water twenty feet
below, accompanied by a scream from
Tamasa, who was peering down with
wild, frightened eyes.
Miguel was not ten feet away, but
his face was sullen with resentment
and anger and he made no : move.
Then there was a swift rush from the
hold and a second; splash and Rafo's
head rose to the surface with a merry
shout of encouragement.}
A rope was dropped from the vessel,
and even as Rafo's left arm encircled
the girl, his right hand shot up and
caught it. Then he whispered some
thing to her and, with quick intuition,
and courage equal to his own, she
placed her arms over his shoulders so
as not to impede his movements and
then, hand over hand, he went up the
rope until he could swing himself
across the gangplank. It was a rare
exhibition of nerve and muscle and the
spectators sent up an involuntary
shout of appreciation â all except Mi
guel and Tamasa.
The old woman's face was drawn and
tremulous, but the look she cast upon
Rafo was as black as ever.
"Come, Fana," she whispered hoarse
ly, "we will not work any more to
day. We will go home and rest."
But Fana was leaning against Rafo,
smiling happily. .Instead of recovering,
from fright, she was perfectly calm.
"Rafo," he called imperiously. "Hera,
quick! I want to see you. I'm In %
hurry. Oh, there you are," as ha saw
the group. "Well, I'm sorry to disturb
you. but every second 13 precious to
me now. I .have an imperative sum
mons to England to settle, up an es
tate, and will have to be gone two
years or more. , I want you to take care
of my flnca until I return. I've had
you work for me, Rafo, and know you
are perfectly honest and j trustworthy.
"What do you say? Quick! I must get
my things ready and take this boat
back. You will know how to cut and
ship the bananas, and I will give you
fifty dollars a month and pay all ths
expenses. And, oh, yes," as ho no
ticed for the first time the figure en
circled by Rafo's arm, "this will be a
good time for you to get married.
There is a comfortable house on "the
plantation you can live in. What do
you say?"
Rafo made him a low bow, showing
his teeth. "Si, senor," he answered,
"we Â¦will be married In twenty minutes,
and you can leave in thirty â as soon
as you have kissed the bride." And
then his merry, infectious laugh rang
out so heartily that all had to join In,
even Tamasa.
(Copyright, 1904, by Frank H. Sweet.)
"Let the little one rest," interrupted
Rafo. pleasantly. "Don't you see how
weak she is. And I like it."
"Youâ like it!" screamed Tamasa.

When I could get in a^word I hesi
tatingly tjbld him I was not a candidate
for hymeneal advancement, drawing off
my glove that he should see my wed
ding ring.
Fortunately a diversion occurred' then
in, a welcoming speech to the bachelors
irom the lady, president, made from a
rude platform, in a voice choking with
emotion. It was very cleverly put to
gether, and her thanks for the ready
response of the celibates "to the spin
sters' call for succor" was very amus
ing. An excellent/reply on behalf of
the bachelors was made by the presi
dent of the .Brussels party, who re
minded his hearers that last year's fete
had resulted in fourteen weddings, add
ing "go thcu and 'do likewise." Both he
and the lady president were presented
with bouquets and exchanged the kiss
of friendship, an example so promptly
followed by all the couples that I was
glad .to have lost my young man in the
crowd. * , â¢ ;-*.
A very fat girl with the voice of a
mouse then gave us a love song, and
many ditties on the tender .passion fol
lowed. An amusing incident was the
speech of one of those bachelors who
had been unable to find partners and
.who, bewailing their sad fate, sug
gested that next year the committee
should import enough girls to go
around. With "a bow to the stranger
lady he was even good enough to invite
"the blonde misses of Albion."
It was with much amusement that I
settled down to coffee and my new
conquest. Oddly enbugh, he knew a
few words of English (I suspect he was
employed in some shop), and he gave
me many terribly tortured English
phrases to unravel, but at last he sank
back Into comfortable French. He was
good to say he had noticed me the in
stant he arrived, that he liked some
thing "high class," hazarded tljat I was
perhaps at the head of some business,
or perhaps maid to some lady of title.
He was evidently seriously looking
for a wife, and I grew rather anxious
about the end of the edventure. With
great volubility he pointed out that he
was "joli garcon," taking off hi3 hat
that I might admire his curly locks
and dark eyes; told me that his posi
tion in life was "tres bonne," that he
had economies and was all the time
artfully trying. to resolve that, burning
question for Continental suitorsâ my
"dot" He told me he had a mother
and that she intended coming with him
that day to look out for him, but was
prevented by illness. She would live

I looked . on with considerable in
terest at this odd fete,' and was rather
amused to' find that, the bachelors
being greatly in excess of the girls,
I was receiving invitations myself to
take coffee with one or another of the
partnerless swains, invitations given
by a whispered "Mdlle?" nudge and a
jerk of. the head in the direction of the
tables. At last a smart young man
from some neighboring country town
advanced with great form, ' and with
much clicking of heels to white can
vas shoes and a flourish of the hat
"begged Madamoiselle to do him the
honor of taking coffee with him."
Realizing all that accepting his invita
tion misht imply, I demurred, but his
insistence, a spice of mischief born of
the holiday feeling, made me change
my mind, and with a smile in my
sleeve at the thought of the husband
left at home I advanced to take my
place with the rest.
It, must be stated that earlier in the
afternoon my hostess had informed me
that my arrival had been viewed with
great disfavor by the girls, who saw a
possible advantage in my town-cut
clothes and the fact that I wore a hat,
which they did not. Being already pro
vided with admirers themselves, how
ever, they could now afford to be gen
erous, and my appearance as a candi
date for coffee and matrimonial honors
was greeted with much applause.
SEEKING A "CHIC" WIPE.
Excitement reached fever heat when
eighteen smart bachelors, all with huge
buttonhole bouquets and headed by a
vivacious president, arrived from
Brussels. There was an awful pause
when 4 o'clock struck, and not one
single young girl could be found with
sufficient courage to go to the office
tables and await a companion. They
emerged shyly from their own doors,
linked arms and, union giving courage,
proceeded to thread the crowd. But
they were deaf to all invitations.
By ten minutes past 4 they were toss
ing their heads like proud society
beauties, showing themselves off with
all the airs and grace of finished co
quettes. They even wound their way
between the tables (whereat every
young man tucked up his collar and
pulled down his waistcoat and pre
pared for a dash), but they would not
take their places. It seems that en
vious rivals of other villages had made
disparaging remarks on the anxiety
of the girls of Ecaussines-Lalaing to
secure husbands, and, as an old crone
on a doorstep mumbled "our girls
must show to-day that they are not
to be picked up in a minute." The
swains were getting more than a little
cross, when, the sacrifice to Mrs.
Grundy having been paid, the girls'
presidentâ the eldest of the partyâ
gravely took her place at table. An
other and another followed, each leav
ing a vacant seat on either side. There
was a shout from male throats, and in
an instant every Jill had a Jack beside
her, though honesty compels the
acknowledgment, that, . the afternoon
being hot, and many of the men having
come long distances, they seemed at
first far more interested in the coffee
and a peculiar sweet cake made for
the occasion, and known as a "mas
telle," than in sweethearting. The
mastelle looked hard and uninviting,
but local custom allowed of its being
dipped In the cup till it was soft and
sloppy.
Twelve tables for the festival dotted,
in the open air, the small "place" on
the bank of the Sennette. On these
white-cove/ed tables bowls for coffee
were placed. They had no handles,
were wreathed with roses and bore af
fectionate phrases suitable to the oc
casion, as did the many welcoming
arches, some of which bore a design ot

The rivalry has been made more bit
ter than e\er since Ecaussines-Lalaing
has hit upon an idea which has brought
many matrimonial prizes and much
trade, and has become famous not only
in the general idea, but as having actu
ally succeeded in originating a delight

are fast disappearing.
By 2 o'clock each village window
framed the figure of a young girl,
dressed in her Sunday best and looking
cut like sister Anne "for some one com

the old song "Is Nobody Coming to

BITTER RIVALRY.
BRUSSELS, Aug. 6.â When last year
the sixty marriageable. young girls of
EcauFsines-Lalaing, in Belgian Hain
eult, came to the sorrowful conclusion
that their small village could not pro
vide sufficient husbands to go around,
and issued their now famous invitation
to the young men of foreign parts (the
expression, in local parlance, including
the lads from the village over the hill.
as well as those from strange coun
tries), to a "Router" that they might
raake acquaintance, with a possible
view to matrimony, they as little real

ever be associated with it.
Candidates for
Matrimony

The explanation of this lies in the
fact that for the last twelve months an
American restaurant has been estab
lished in the Strand and American vis-,
itors who lodge at hotels in the vicinity
much prefer getting .their meals there
to partaking of the fare t?Â»~ A their car
avansaries afford. The complaint of
the hotel proprietors is really a tribute
to the superiority of American cooking
and to the greater variety of American
dishes. It will not be long before some
of their English patrons find this out.
Some of the proprietors will then prob
ably seek to provide a remedy for their
waning receipts by importing Ameri
can chefs and reorganizing their kitch
ens. â¢ vl Â¦
AX AMERICAN' RESTAURANT.
Mrs. Lawrence McGuire and her
daughter, together with Charles West
ing of New York, have arrived in Lon
don for the season. They have been
seeing, the sights and enjoying the hos
pitality of a number of the Irish mem
bers of Parliament whom they have
met in the States from time to time.
They were guests of William Redmond,
the brother, of the Irish leader, at the
House of Commons on a recent evening
and enjoyed the much coveted luxury
of tea on the terrace of the Houses of
Parliament. After "doing" London,
they will see the beauties of Derby
shire and the lake district. They will
go to Killarney on their way home.
Proprietors of some of the big hotels
in the vicinity of the Strand are com
plaining that their American guests do
not patronize the hotel dining-rooms.
"For that reason," says one of these
Bonifaces, "we are not so keen on them
as we used to be and much prefer ca
tering to^ the traveling Englishman.
The latter, as a rule, both eat and sleep
at the hotel, but within the last twelve
months it has been especially notice
able that most of the Americans of the
tourist class who put up here merely
engage bedrooms and get their meals
elsewhere. We call them 'one liners,'
because there is never more than one
line on their bills every morning â bed,
six shillings. The popular notion that
American travelers spend their money
much more freely than those of any
other nationality is no longer true.
Man for man we make much more
money out of our English patrons than
out of our visitors from the 'land of
liberty.' "

Since Count Ward accepted the posi

Roumania, at the urgent request of
Queen Carmen Sylva, he has practical
ly made up his mind to settle perma
nently in England. He has taken a
country residence, Fulwell Park,
among the Surrey hills, and between
there and his favorite hotel he proposes
to divide his time. Fulwell Park would
have been the scene of lavish enter

LONDON. Aug. 6. â In undertaking
the restoration of his latest acquisi
ition, Hever Castle, William Waldorf
Astor is taking particular pains to con
ciliate British ppinion, which is very
sensitive on the subject of American
dollars applied to the remodeling of
historical structures. He has put in
charge of the work F. L. Pearson, a
well-known architect, who is an ardent
devotee of the antique, and has caused
it to be known that he has instructed
him to spare no expense to preserve
the original design as far as possible.
.Furthermore, he has announced his in
tention of adding to it a large deer
park and old-fashioned garden, so that
its surroundings will be in accord with
those that prevailed when it was occu
pied by Anne Boleyn, whom Henry
III married and subsequently behead
ed. Heretofore Mr. Astor's manage
ment of his property in England has
not added to his popularity, which may
in a measure account for the fact that
at Hever he has assumed the role of a
patron and preserver of historic asso
ciations.
LONDON, Aug. 6.â In view of th&
very mixed character of the folk who
occupy the royal inclosure at Aacot this
year it has become a mooted Question
whether in the near future it will not
be considered more fashionable to be
outside rather than inside this spot,
popularly supposed to be sacred to the
social elect. To be sure, thÂ« King and
his immediate satellites were inside,
but so, too, were a varied assortment
of tradespeople, money lenders and so
cial nobodies. And on the outside were
those leaders of fashion who had re
ceived tickets for the inclosure, but who
found that these pasteboards afforded
a cheap and easy means of paying oft
debts and obligations to lots of persons
who need keeping in a good humor.
Permission to enter the royal In
closure at the races is supposed to be
confined to court circles, the members
of which write to Lord Churchill for a
ticket, and it is he who decides wheth
er applicants are of sufficient distinc
tion to be entitled to bask in the sun
shine of the royal presence. What ia
done with these same tickets afterward
is, unfortunately, a matter beyond hi3
control. If it were an exception for a
social "outsider" to get into this
charmed spot the offending court mem
ber responsible for the intruder might
be discovered, but the giving away of
the tickets has now become so general
that to be inside does not at all imply
that one is an "insider" in court cir
cles, and, on the other hand, a place
on the outside by no means indicates
inferiority to those within. The femi
nine aspirant for social honors who has
suceeeded in getting a ticket to the
royal inclosure for the first time is
plunged into misery and distress by the
perplexing problem that confronts her.
If she makes use of her ticket she may
expose herself to the suspicion of hav
ing obtained it by purchase from some
body else and be classified with the
tradespeople and social nobodies who
sail in under false colors. On the other
hand, if she makes no U3e of her ticket
and remains outside she fears it may be
thought that Lord Churchill did not
consider her standing sufficient to en
title her to one. One woman unac
quainted with the strange traffic done
in royal Inclosure tickets was bemoan
ing her failure to obtain one to Mrs.
George Keppel, who enjoys the distinc
tion of being numbered among the
King's particular friends. "Why bother
about a ticket?" exclaimed Mrs. Kep
pel. "I got rid of mine to a tradesman.
and you will find lots of us outside at
Ascot who have done the same thing.**

defects which are dealt with In the an

The need for special schools for de
fective children, where speech of as
normal a kind as possible is taught and
clear articulation insisted, on. are
clearly^ shown by the following remark
able statements:
"To a considerable number of chil

most rudimentary attempts seem al-
impossible of acquirement. Many
of .these have marked mental feeble
ness; others seem scarcely amiss in
many respects.
"The want of literary ability is prob
ably more general than is supposed.
There are many cases of inability to
recognize words or to spell anything
like the words,, dictated, while at the
same time the \child . has fair to good
faculties in other respects, such as
mental arithmetic."

"She's doing splendidly in Italy.
Her Marguerite â I heard her in Na

Alice. So pretty and slim and grace
ful, loo."
'It was after this that she told me
of Carre and the "Lakme"; how one
day she had gone to the Opera
Comique I rr Paris, paid for a five-franc
seat and been shown to a box; how
afterward she had gone to Mme. Sa
rah Duff's to have her voice tried and
Carre had burst open the door of the
room with an offer to her to sing
Lakme; but how, relatively, $25 a
fteek at Fisher's is better than %2 a
week there.' Again, that grand opera
disappointments broke a good many
hearts. That she didn't want hers
broken. Her story of Mary Garden,
Mme. Duff's star pupil, who one day
on the failure (through illness) of
Renauld in the part of Louise, in
Messager's opera of the name, walked
on the stage from the audience in
street gpwn and sang the second act,
was fascinating. So successful was
Misa Garden that she has since been
brilliantly identified with the role.
"She's as thin as this," Miss Morton
put it, picking up the butter knife,
"and without much volume of voice.
But how she sings and acts! I think
she's the greatest living artist to-day,
as great an actress as Bernhardt."
Misa Morton's reminiscences of
London, where she has recently been
singing in the immortal "Florodora,"
gladden some. The Lord Mayor's lit
tle red cap tickles her sense of fun. She
claims, too, only one Duke in her re
tinue, the Duke of Cambridge, -'who
wpuld run errands for me."
"Have you ever heard ofâ Kolb
and Dill?" I ask her finally.
"Do I ever, ever, ever hear of any
one else â only Maude Amber?" Miss
Morton helplessly-feplled.
' I tell the tale as 'twas told to me. I
wouldn't â if I could â venture to di
vorce the Morton fancy from the stern

the thin lawn and lace of it at a prob

- Miss Morton attempted an elaborately
â¢ matter-of-fact tone as she said, leaning
over to the scene: "One must be com
fortable, you know." Then, her little,
â¢ sensitive nostrils, thin as an egg shell,
all a -quiver, she cried: "Ah, but it's*

the voice changed and it was Dorothy
Morton of Fischer's that turned round
.from the window.
.. "You don't want to photograph me,"
she coaxed the artist. "I hate to be
"photographed. Fat women should
" never be photographed. And look at
ine! I'm not going to change my dress.
There! All right, if you must. Look
like- your litho, Dolly. Smile. Show
your teeth â if I had only two more
Inches of neck I should be all right?"
Just as she was, dropped into the
window seat. Miss Morton was "took."
"Will you look now through the win
dow, please?" from the photographer.
"Ah, yes! Is he never going to come?
:Alas! Alas!" She suited the word to
.the pose, then asked, "Am I as fat this
way?"
â¢ She was, but there was no use in say
ing so. But note when you next see
Her. as I did then, her face of strange
"contrasts. Note the small, sensitive
rose, the tiny mouth, with the heavy
chin; note the exquisitely arched and
mobile eyebrows, the heavy-lidded,
"sensuous, burnt-hazel eyes; note the
ebon hair, the white skin, the avoirdu
pois, the vivacity.
"It wouldn't be bad to photograph
me in the tank, would it?" she asked
. me. "I'm a mermaid this week, you
â¢ know. First scene's in a tank, a la

"Worms or peanuts?" I inquired.

Miss Morton laughed. As she ordered
it from the attendant Jap we talked

didn't understand the Oriental. You

"Nora Bayes?"
"Ay jolly, fine fellow," Miss Morton
dubbed her soubrette confrere. "Yes, I
made Nora set the table and we hadâ
though I say it that shouldn'tâ a good
dinner. You haven't met Nora yet?
You should. She's as springy as a lit
ile piece of elastic. Funny, no end.
Just the same off the stage as on.
Every night she stamps past my door"
â Miss Morton put every pound she has
into the clump! clump! with which she
imitated Miss Bayes' stamp across the
floor â "and sings out, 'Good-night,
Doddy!' You know, I'd miss it awfully
if that girl forgot to say that!"
"She's very bright," 1 testify then,
and ask: "Are those her own songs,
that immortally funny one about going
to 'hunt for beer and not for deer,' and
the rest?"
"I don't know," Miss Morton replied,
"shouldn't wonder, though. It's like
her."
"I thought so." I said. "Curious
Fischer's should get hold in so short
time of two such clever minxes as the
Bayes and the Aug."
"Sure," said my neighbor. "Sugar?"
as we wandered over to the tea table.
"Miss Aus is enormously clever."
"So clever that I don't know why_ she
is not doing something more than vau
deville specialties."
"Shall I tell you?" Miss Morton
asked. "It's nerves. That girl is all
nerves. She thinks twice as fast as she
can speak, and when the time comes
for her to play most of her vitality is
gone."
A step was heard here below the open
window and the actress laughed as she
ticketed it, "Mr. Conger, my husband."
"Very happy?" I laughed back.
"Oh, yes," Mrs. Conger said. She
added, "It's all new yet."
"How new?"
"Eighteen months," she confessed.
"Mr. Conger was one of Frohman's
men, you know. He was the 'original
little Billee in 'Trilby.' He's given up
the stage now." I did not ask if this
were in deference to Mrs. Conger's de
sire, for the gentleman came in here. I
fancy not, however. His round, rosy,
clear-eyed, clean-shaven face looks
rather like that of a person accustomed
to decide his own fate. He had just re
turned from a swim.
"Every day he goes swimming/' Mies
Morton pouted. "I'm beginning to sus
pect things"-â
"Another, mermaid?" I suggested.
"Exactly," she nodded, but beyond
trying on me the dog and the porpoise
story Mr. Conger was not to be In
veigled into the interview.
With a business-before-pleasure air
I said then: "Now, you will please tell
me your favorite role, and the rest, and
about the Daly times and so on."
Miss Morton put her elbows on the
table and her plump cheeks in her
hands to the tale. "My favorite role?
Oh â Mignon."
"You've done grand opera, then?"
"Oh, yes," she answered. "Santuzza,
too. I sang that against Calve in Chi
cago."
"My!" I exclaimed respectfully.
"Yesâ show her those notices, Fred
dy," and "Freddy," from some corner,
cheerfully dug up a St. Louis notice of
Miss Morton's Santuzza, eminently
complimentary.
"St Louis," "Native," '-'Comparison
with the best." I read, and asked:
"Then you are from St. Louis?"
"I am a Southerner," she put it- "I
was singing then with the Schiller
Opera Company in 'The Pirates of

next Monday (this was Friday) in
"Rusticana"â so. will we!' I didn't
know a line of it then, but we opened
all right!"
I was in the/b'gosh frame of mind by
this. But Miss Morton neglected to
show me her Chicago notices. I must
remind her.
"In light opera"â
"Oh, I know," I interrupted, " 'O Mi
mosa San.' "
" "Yes," she agreed, "I've sung the
part 765 times. I like 'The Fencing
Master' very much, too."
"How long were you with the
Dalys?"
"Five years," sheâ did she sigh?
"Just imagine," she threw iri, "Sir
William Jardine bought the Ameri
can rights of 'The Geisha,* and gets
10 per cent of the gross receipts every
time it is played. Wish 1 had 'em!"
"Who taught you to sing, Miss Mor

"Madame Murlo-Celli," she told
me. "in Italy. But the person I
learned most from is Mme. Sarah
Duff. I've just been with her in Paris
this year. She is a / Chicago woman
who now assists Henry Russellâ"
"Alice Nellsen's Henry Russell?" '
"The same, and a magnificent teach

will give you an absolutely new un

believes â so do I â that the Lord put

ear is another story. I have a queer
idea about ears. I have mine thor

"True," I agree, as I am expected,

would tell her boy that she wanted this

Fuller's thrilling, en try into Port Ar
thur is part of the history of the war
and whatever' his judgment- is ; worth
he should be in possession of plenty
of facts upon which- to base an opin

Fuller arrived here yesterday on the

may resume his desk as dramatic and
literary editor of the paper which gent
him to Japan or he may, "if the cre
dentials can be obtained, spend the
coming winter campaigning with the
Russian forces. He wants no more
of Japan.
"When Japan began to open her
eyes," said Fuller, "the first thing she
saw was the necessity for a scientific
knowledge of the art of war. The
civilized nations of the world went to
her aid. They welcomed Japan's ca
dets at their naval and military
schools and gave to the little brown
students as much attention and care
as they devoted to the training of
their own officers. There are gradu
ates from American and European na
val and military academies on every
Japanese warship arrd with each of
her numerous regiments on land. It
Is the ideas planted by foreign instruc
tors and nourished under Caucasian
discipline that are now being turned
to the temporary confusion of the
hosts of the Czar.
STILL SEEKING KNOWLEDGE.
"That the Japanese learned their
lessons well nobody can deny and the
fact that Japan still believes she can
get something from foreign nations is
evidenced by the large numbers of
Japanese 'students' to be found all
over the world. - This war Is the first
in which modern fighting machinery
is In the hands of both contestants.
Hence to the military world every en
gagement is full of vital Interest. The
theories of the science to which mili
tary and naval men have been devot
ing their lives are being tried out as
would be possible In no other way and
the opportunity to observe the opera
tions on land and sea would be of ln
calulable benefit. Japan has the

now able to stand up against the bear.
And what Is she doing?

demonstration. President Roosevelt
, was fully In accord with the idea of
sending a squadron to the East. It is
probable the battleship squadron would
have been sent had it not been at sea
and out of reach of the cable. Under
the circumstances it was felt that no
time was to be lost, and orders were
given the European squadron.
â¢ The battleship squadron consists of
the modern battleships Kearsarge, Ala
bama, Iowa, Illinois, Maine and Mis
souri. It is commanded by Hear Ad
miral Barker and : is the most powerful
squadron of the navy.
The European squadron consists of the
protected cruisers Olympla. Baltimore
and Cleveland. The cruiser Des Moines,
a sister ship to the Cleveland and a
new vessel, has been added to the Euro
pean squadron and will start across the
Atlantic on August 20. The Olympla,
which was Admiral Dewey's flagship at
Manila, is now the flagship of Rear
Admiral Jewell.
. Should the two squadrons be com
bined-It is evident that they would
form a formidable force. It Is obvious
such ' a fleet would exert a powerful
moral effect. ,
'Â¦ Just what course Hear Admiral Jewell
Is expected : to follow is not disclosed.
It is known. everything will be done to
avoid ; complications with other Euro
pean countries. â¢ While It Is not expected
that It will be necessary for the Euro
pean squadron : to commit any hostile
act, it is nevertheless admitted at the
State Department -that the situation is
a delicate and trying one.

In exchange for this overwhelming
superiority in heavy gun fire, the six

disappears.
Â¦Â¦. The four new armored cruisers are
also to be remarkable and of gr^at
size, being the largest cruisers built
for the British or any other navy.
They are to be known as the Minotaur
clusr. They will steam twenty-three
knots, displace 14.600 tons, or 400
more than the Drake class, and will
carry four 9.2-inch guns of the same
type as those on the Lord Nelson and
ten of the new 7.5-inch guns, which
fcre four 200-pound shells a mlnuf
through more than two feet of iron
Both the cruisers and the battle
ships will represent a capita! of
540,000,000.
The advantage in the new ships lies
in their creator number of 9.2-inch
runs. This v.eapon is one of the most
powerful in existence. Firing a 3S0
pound shell twice or thrice a minute
and driving it through thirty-five
inches of iron, it is more powerful
than any gun of a Eimilar type
mounted on foreign battleships.
The four twelve-inch guns fire 850
pound shells through come four feet
cf Iron.
LONDON, Aug. 6. â Details given In
tfcs House of Commons this week as
to the Ehipbuilding programme of the
British Government for the present
year show that the two new battle
ships cf the Lord Nelson class will be
truly worthy of their great names.
Their batteries ere such as has never
before been put into any fighting ship.
On a displacement of 16,500 tons, or
ISO tons larger than the previous
lsrgest (the King Edward), they will
carry fourteen big armor piercing

The Russian position at Anshan
shan is as strong as that at KInchou.
It consists of a precipitous . barrier
flfteenÂ»miles long, flanked on the east
ward by the river and a marsh and
on the westward by a level plain and
Is impossible of approach by infantry
by either side. The only weak spot Is
to the eastward, where the Japanese
may mount heavy guns with a longer
range than the Russian pieces and
pour in a flanking fire. It is consid
ered more -probable, however, that
General Nodzu will try to cut in be
tween Anshanshan and Liandlansian
and cut pff the. former place from
Liaoyang.
The Dick of Kuropatkin's troops,
the newly arrived European regi
ments, are stationed at Anping and
Anshanshan, .where the hardest onset
is expected to be made. Some of these
regiments were raised 200 years ago
and have great war records. Officers
acquainted with the men declare that
the dogged tenacity displayed at
Tushu Pass and Nanga Pass has be
come only more fierce and unyielding
under the reverses met by the troops.
Experts at the War Office are dis
cussing the probable course of the im
pending operations. They say that the
Japanese will try to capture either
Anping or Anshanshan, whence they
will be able to strike Liaoyang, and
they think it more likely that Anshan
shan will be selected, because that
place is in the line of advance of Gen
erals Oku's and Noduz's armies and
must be captured before an attempt
Is made to flank Liaoyang from the
westward.
The military authorities do not en
tertain the slightest doubt of General
Kuropatkin's ability to repulse an at
tempt to capture and cut off Liao
yang. The defense there has an'Im
mediate advantage, operating within
the small radius of twenty miles, thus
enabling General Kuropatkin to re
inforce promptly any weak points.
The army at his disposal i3 estimated
at 150 battalions, besides cavalry and
artillery, altogether not far short of
200,000 men.. Only one-third of this
force was engaged in the fighting of
July 30 and 31 and August 1.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. : 6.â If Is
expected that within forty-eight hours
the battle that will decide the fate of
the Russian Â¦ arms Manchuriaâ at
least for the present campaign â will
have been begun in the vicinity of
Liaoyang, where General Kuropatkin
now faces the combined armies of
Kuroki, Oku and Nodzu.
â¢ An issue of such importance mo
mentarily eclipses Interest in the
siege of Port Arthur. The fate of the
latter place is not likely to influence
the immediate destinies of the cam
paign, but Liaoyang ia closely tied up
with the fortunes of the whole war.
The loss of such a position, with its
accumulations of stores. . would " im
mediately and perhaps irreparably en
danger the main Russian position in
Manchuria.

a grievance which will be aired from
all the ends of the earth as the de
ceived and disappointed writers reach
their homes and typewriters, but the
troubles of the military attaches make
the woes of the war j correspondents
seem petty by comparison."
Of all of this and more did Fuller de
liver himself yesterday as he stood On
the Doric's deck.
"I went from Japan to Port Arthur,"
he continued. "When I was released
from Jail and went among those Rus
sian soldiers I realized that with all
their faults they were white men, and
there came upon me a full realization
of the difference between the white and
the yellow. If Japan should win this
warâ and I hope she won't and do not
see how she can â it will be the worst
thing that could happen, so far as
America is concerned."
TRIP TO PORT ARTHUR.
The story of Fuller's trip to Port Ar
thur is a thrilling one. Tired of wait
ing in Tokio he went to Chefu, where
he hired a sampan and with two Chi
nese started for Port Arthur. He was,
six days making the trip. He landed
June 11 at Louisa Bay and started to
walk to Port Arthur.
"The next day," he said, "while
walking along a road I saw a group of
Russians ahead. I walked straight
toward them, but chucked my. note
book, binoculars and revolver. They
questioned me and took me for a spy.
I told them I was a correspondent. I

I ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 6. â The

The runner who sets out on a two
mile race usually passes through two
distinct stages of exhaustion. In the
first quarter, if the pace be fast, he
feels the first symptoms of breathless
nessâthe throbbing temples, the surg

the chest that makes so many men
drop out before completing half the
distance. This might be called acute
fatigue, but if he can keep on the dis
tress passes away. The heart and
lungs work a Htle harder and aft last
succeed in catching up with their task
of purifying the increased stream of
sewage brought" to the lungs by the
blood, to be carried off in the form of
gases by respiration. The distress dis
appears from the face, the lungs seem
to regain the power to expand and a
crushing weight appears to have been
lifted from the chest. The head be

one. She became slightly hysterical
and wanted the jeweler arrested. Ga

The Gaelics could play only eight
men, as most of the passengers and
the officers and crew were British sub

would be more in keeping with the
holiday they were to enjoy on the lit

ball fans pointed out the fact that
Midway bore aloft on its one flagpole
the Stars and Stripes and that, under
the circumstances, the national Amer
ican game should be in order, baseball
was the game decided on. So with
only eight men they played the game
and won a victory.

The hottest fighting began at day
break of July 27. The battle tiommenced
under the rays of a scorching sun. The
Russian risht wing was compelled to
undergo the brunt of the terrific can
nonading. To this fierce fire the Rus
sians replied with deliberation. The
naval battery was again made the tar
get for the heaviest fire,, and it was
evident that; the Japanese were trying
to sjlence the most dangerous Russian
position.
As the day wvre on the accuracy of
the Japanese fire increased. In the
meanwhile the Russian infantry, pas
sive witnesses of the artillery duel, lay
in their trenches awaiting an attack.
They were well protected and - but a
few shells fell among them.
At 9 o'clock volley firing gave warn
ing of the Japanese assault, which fol
lowed swiftly. As the Japanese infan
try advanced the Japanese artillery flre
slackened somewhat, but the Russian
batteries^ replied with increased vigor,
while the Russian riflemen volleyed
rapidly.
For- an hour the Japanese advanced
intrepidly in the face of a fire which is
described as a thousand volleys in sim
ultaneous eruption. The Japanese ad
vance against the Russian right wing
ceased and the Russians cheered, but
at this moment news arrived from Gen
eral Stoessel,' the commander In chief,
that the terrific pounding to which the
Russian right wing had been subjected
was nothing more than a mask to cover
the concentration of Japanese troops
preparatory to an attack on the Rus
sian left wing, of which "Wolfs Moun
tain was the key. General Stoessel
commanded the presence of Major Gen
eral Kondratenko, who mounted his
horse' and at once started to join the
commander in chief. After having rid
den a short distance Major General
Kondratenko was compelled to choose
between two roads, one long and safe
from the fire of the enemy, the other
short and leading through a shell-swept
valley.
"God favors the brave," remarked
tho general, and he and his staff gal
loped safely over the dangerous road.
At noon of July 27 the Japanese sud
denly ceased firing, and presently ob
servers with the aid, of field glasses
could see the enemy quietly eating rice.
After this the right wing was occasion
ally reminded of the presence of the
Japanese by the descent of a huge
shell, but the worst was over. In the
meanwhile the main attack, which,re
sulted in the capture of Wolfs Moun
tain, had been developed.
During the fighting of these three
days the : Russians "used telephones for
communication with all parts of the
field.
CHEFU, Aug. 6.â A newspaper pub
lished in Port Arthur and which was
brought in here to-day gives fragment
ary details of the recent heavy fighting
there.
The Japanese artillery opened a de
sultory fire on the afternoon of July 23.
That night the Russians slept on their
arms ln the trenches. They occupied, a
line sixteen miles long. Â¦-
The next morning, July 26, the fog
cleared away at 6 o'clock and the Japa
nese then began tp fire along the entire
line. This fire was kept up until dark.
The Japanese marksmanship was more
accurate, showing that they had de
rived benefit from the practice of the
preceding day. Their heaviest fire was
directed against the batteries which in
cluded the twelve-inch naval guns.

The dispatch to the Bourse Gazette,
which Is dated Thursday evening, says:
: "There has been fierce fighting Tues
day, Wednesday and to-day. The Jap
anese made a vigorous attack on the
center of the Russian position at Huit
siatze. The enemy was fifty-four bat
talions strong, thirty-six of which
were regular troops and the balance
reserve men. General Kuroki employ
ed the reserve 'men in the attack, while
the regulars carried out tht feints in
tended to delude the Russians. The
reserve men attacked with desperation.
Their ranks were decimated by the
Russian fire' each time they advanced,
but the vacancies were quickly filled by
fresh men. The Russians ultimately
slowly retired to suitable positions,
whence they inflicted great losses on
the Japanese with heavy artillery fire.
The Japanese losses are estimated at
10,000 to 13,000. The Russian losses were
comparatively insignificant."
J ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 6.â A dis
patch to the Bourse Gazette from Llao
yang says that another great battle has
been fought ln the neighborhood of
Hultsiatze, on the railroad, about four
teen miles west of the Liaoyang, in
which â¢ the Japanese losses are esti

All expressed themselves as delighted
with their trip to California.
As the cars left the valley and began
gradually to climb the steep grade the
visitors became slightly interested.
With the cars rising still higher and
winding around the mountain, reveal
ing glimpses of the- hills and the pano
rama of . the bay beneath) the party
became enthusiastic.
Aftr a short rest at the tavern an in
formal luncheon was served. A visit to
the observatory at the top of the moun

After their hard duties of the past
month the members of the Merchant
Marine Commission of Congress gladly
accepted the Invitation of Captain I. E.
Thayer and, together with their wives
and relatives, visited Mount Tamalpais.
The party assembled at the ferry
building at 10 o'clock. Although hav
ing been on a trip around the bay, they
were interested in every detail of the
harbor scenery. The short trip on the
North Shore to Mill Valley was made
without Incident, and without any feel
ing of wonderment the visitors boarded
the cars for the summit of the moun
tain.

PARTY SEPARATES HERE
Every day new stockholders are se
cured at a ratio that will probably
swell the subscribed capital to the limit
by June, 1905. All over the State able
asents are explaining the working of
the Institution to people who ought to
know of it and who will be benefited a
thousandfold. It does not require much
explanation. Though massive, it is lika
everything that in truly strong â very
simple. Through the efforts of this
association the time win - come when
nearly all deserving Callfnrnians will
have homes of their own. when children
will not be driven into the streets to
get anywhere away from crowded tene
ments, where discomfort rulC3 and
disease lurks.
No matter how small the Income, any
one can become a stockholder in thÂ«
association if he makes an effort. it
is those with small Incomes who should
especially endeavor to make such an
effort. Small savings bear interest at
the rate of 6 per cent. When half the
price of the contemplated home is da
posited the association immediately bo
gins to build the house.
The money is always safe â safsr. In
fact, than In any bank, for the associ
ation has secured itself against": any
panic. -The by-laws stipulate that in any
emergencies only one-half of the month
ly receipts will be used for the purpose
of paying off withdrawals. This ex
plains how the Continental" was able to
make loans during the '"hard times" of
18&3 and 1834. when banks with- millions
of assets could not loan a dollar.
The officers and board of directors
are well known in this community.
Their names alone would ge a guarantee
of the association. They are: Hon.
"Washington Dodge, president; T ames
McCullough. vice president; J.* Q. Craw
ford. M. 1). : Gavin McN'ab. attorney;
"William Corbin. secretary and general
manager, and David \V. Loring. assist
ant secretary.
The association is as conservative and
as safe as the Bank of England. Tha
subscribed capital is now $16,553,900.
That is an Increase of $2,000,000 in. one
year.
The Continental Building and Loan
Association in the present year has
helped 349 families toward securing
their own homes.
That means more than can be told
in a paragraph. It means that over
10,000 children are given the chance
that every child should have â a rood
home in a healthy district. It means
that 3100 men of all walks of life hav*
been made immune from the rent col
lector and have something to Â»how for
years of work. <
The rent paid by the average "man
takes one-fourth of his Income and
fives him nothing. He is never com
ortable in a house that Is not his own.
The neighbors are not congenial and tha
landlord complains because his children
are not deaf mutes. The man Â¦without
a home Is as badly oft as the man with
out a country. ' Â¦
Slowly but surely the crowded tene
ment houses, where human beings arÂ«
being: herded like animals, are passing
from this city. The annual report of the
Continental Building and Loan Associa
tion. Just received, shows that in tha
fifteen years of its existence it has
helped 3100 families to build their own
homea. This number of homes. If ag
gregated, would make a city as larse
as Stockton. .

were assigned to duty.
- Reports were received from the sev

tions of a victory for the league forces
at .the primary election.
Primaries were held by Republicans
throughout Contra Costa Countv yes

The Senatorial nominating conven

nine from Marin and eleven from Con

indorsed by the Marin County Re
publicans, but the superior strength
of the Contra Costa delegation will
give the nomination to Belshaw. It is
expected that the Republicans of
Marin will accept the result gracefully
and work for the success of the entire

was at the Union League Club last

tion that the next Senator should

THOUSANDS UNDER
THEIR OWN ROOF
The Watsonvflle Pajaronlan advises
the Republicans of Southern California
to stop their factional lights and settle
upon one candidate for the United
States Senate. The advice Is given in
this form:
"Yesterday's Call had an editorial
which we thoroughly indorse, conced-
The Republicans of the Seventeenth
Senatorial Districtâ the Twenty-eighth
and Twenty-ninth Assembly districts â
are making a determined fight to win
a State Senator to succeed Joseph M.
PlunkÂ«tt. Bernard L. Conlon is favor
ably spoken ' of for the Republican
nomination.'
Assemblyman Abner McMahon. Thir
tieth District, expects tha Union Labor
party nomination for State Senator
from the Twenty- third Senatorial Dis
trict.
The Republicans of the Forty
fourth District will give the nomlnar.
tldn for the Assembly to Jacob Step
pacher or Mel'Vogel. It Is common
talk. in political circles that Mr.. Step
pacher would .receive a very large pop r
ular vote, as his services to the State
and the Republican party for a third
of a century are frequently mentioned.
FIGHT IN THE SOUTH.
The number of electors registered in
San Francisco in time to vote at the
primary election day alter to-morrow
slightly exceeds 50,000. The politicians
would be surprised If the number of
votes polled next Tuesday should ex
ceed 26,000. The display of Democratic
strength will be larger than first esti
mated, owing to the warmth of the
contest between the regular,, or county
committee forces, and the followers of
the Democratic Leagrue. .
The Republicans are well organized
throughout the city, and the leaders
say that the party will easily enough
take first place in voting strength next
Tuesday. In four Assembly districtsâ
the Thirty-second, Thirty-third, Thir
ty-sixth and Thirty-ninthâ formidable
opposition confronts the Republican
organization. In the Thirty-second
District the leaders of the opposition
.claim to represent the true spirit of
the organization. The men supporting
the independent, or anti-organization
ticket, are the voters, It is asserted, who
placed the district in the Republican
column. Concerning his own candi
dacy for Senator to represent the Nine
teenth Senatorial District, Richard J.
"Welch says that he had no intention
at first of entering the race for the
Senatorial nomination, and did not get
into the contest until his friends vig
orously insisted that he should be a
candidate. Following is the Welch
ticket in the Thirty-second: State del
egatesâRichard J. Welch, Joseph H.
Armstrong, Frank J. Weiss, William
McKeon, E. E. Raymond. Legislative
and Judicial delegatesâ Robert Gordon,
Thomas F. Dolan, Hallie B. Davidson,
David Humphreys, Frank J. Fitzpat
rick, Charles F. Wachter, James L..
Gleeson, Robert E. Cavanaugh, Joseph
Norton, James B. Johnston.
RECRUITS FOR ORGANIZATION.
The rumor was current yesterday
that the organization ticket in the
Thirty-second District was receiving
the active support of J. N. Copus, who
was elected to the Assembly at the last
Legislature as the Union Labor and
Democratic candidate. There are indi
cations that the regulars will get more
than a little assistance from Union
'.Labor ranks. *

Â¦â¢BOSTON, Aug. 6.â Senator Henry
Cabot Lodge opened the Presidential
campaign in the East at Point Shirley
â¢ Winthrop this afternoon when he spoke
before the Xorth Dorchester Repub
lican dub. Senator Lodge devoted his
time principally to defining the attitude
of the Republicans on reciprocity with
â¢Canada. He said in part:
The Republican National Convention *t Cbl
Â¦ if j declared as follows:
"We believe in commercial reciprocity wher>
*ver reciprocal Â«rracs*racnts can. be effected
coctiÂ«tent with protection without menacing
a'ry American industry.
â¢ The President cf thÂ« United Etatea, in h!Â»
rep!y tÂ» the committee en notification, epoke
a* follows:
"We bel'.ere In reciprocity with forelrn na
tions- on thÂ« term* outlined in President Mc-
JtlrJeya laÂ»t epeech. which urged the exten
elon of our foreign market by reciprocal
. arreemeatg whenever they coald be made
without injury to American Industry or la
bor."
Senator Lodge then took up the con
sideration of a petition which has been
â¢ largely signed by Massachusetts vot
' ers, and which declares that the estab
lishment of reciprocal trade relations
v:i:h other countries, especially with
V'anada. and Newfoundland, is of vital
' importance to the commercial welfare
of the United States and especially that
of Massachusetts. He said:
ThÂ« Republican party Is not opposed to
reciprocity. On the contrary, we. who in the
last eigrht years have piven the largest ex

heartily favor It. What we. all of us who

The official statement of the New Tork
Associated Banks last week was somewhat die
appointing In that It failed to reflect the
gain In cash which was estimated upon the
basis of the traceabip movements of monj-y
during the week, ths discrepancy between the
amount of the average gain as reported In
the statement and that which was estimated
being $2,611,000. This difference may be In
great part accounted for, however, by the
fuct that the banks lost an average of 93.-
B00.000 by the payment through them to the.
sub-treasury on Friday of the previous week
of $2,800,000, the amount of the Central Pacific
note, and they also lost 11,500,000 which was
withdrawn on Friday of last week for ship
ment to Cuba on Saturday.
Tha net gain of cash reported by the state
ment was $131,300, specie Increasing ' It $1,
985.800 and legal tenders decreasing $1,854,100.
Deposits fell off $752,200, causing a reduction
of J1SS.0SO In the required reserves, and adding
this sum to the net gain in cash, as above,
made an Increase of $510,250 in surplus re
serve to $5G,303,S30. Computed on the basis
of deposits less those of $23,370,100 public
funds, the surplus Is $62,161,375. Loans were
contracted $1,861,200, probably reflecting thfe
cancellation of those against the proceeds of
the Cuban bonds and also the small volums
of commission-house borrowing: during thÂ»
week. The statement of next week will most
likely show a net gain In cash resulting from
the transfer hither from San Francisco of
about $4,000,000. of which' $3,000,000 will be
Japanese and the remainder Australian gold.
less than $2,f>00,000 of which will be shipped
on Tuesday to London. The daily average of
bank clearings during the week was $170,000.
000. or $6,000,000 lest than la the previous
week, reflecting- the decreased business on the
Stock Exchange.
It i may . be . noted . that . the bank statement
was out of proof the sum of the 'decrease In
loans less the - gain of cash being $O71,S00
greater than the decrease in deposits.

NATIONAL BANKS RECEIVE
COMPTROLLER'S APPROVAL
Railroad officials assert that there Is some
growth of trafflo on their lines and a de
cided Improvement In the business sentiment
in their territory and future business revival.
Increases in net earnings for June by the
Pennsylvania system, the Atchison and the
St. Paul were accepted as an Index of the
improving conditions in railroad finance, due
to an Important degree, however, to drastic
retrenchment In expenses of operation, nota
bly in the case of the Pennsylvania. Unrest
in ths labor world makes this evidence of
retrenchment In order to conserve earnings
a cause of anxiety. i
The discussion of strike preparations by
the anthracite miners, the strikes of the
meat packers and the cotton operatives and
the disturbance in the building trades In
New York all furnish food for this anxiety
and exercise a perceptible repressive effect
on the operations in the stock market. The
shutting down of worKfl by the Pullman Com
pany owing to a lack of orders -'and -of some
of the great harvesting machine works are
of bad effect on sentiment as clear indica
tions of shrinkage In the business. For the
same reason small comfort Is derived from
the great case of the money market, due to
the piling up of Idle reserves in banks.
The meat packers' strike is having tha
effect of aggravating the situation In Chi
cago and St. Louis.. Little attention has been
paid to the war news from the Far East,
except to far as it has been a factor In the
tightening of the London money market and
the withdrawal of gold from New York. The
running deficit in the Government revenues
keeps alive the posslbllty of a necessary with
drawal of Government deposits . from the
banks.
The investment demand, in the bond mar
ket has shrunk to small proportions, but a
good effect is produced by the successful
marketing of several bond Issues to first sub
scribers. !
United States bonds were unchanged on 4
call from last week.
GROWTH OF TRAFFIC.
The small effect produced on the price of
cotton is to be attributed without doubt. In
large part, to the large outstanding short
Interest waiting to cover in anticipation of
current developments. But confidence Is felt
also that tha holding of the price Is due to
the good projects of a favorable market for
the btaple, even with the abundant supply in
prospect. It Is generally believed that stocks
of cotton the world over are at a low state,
owing to the long sustained high price and
the resultant policy of hand-to-mouth buying
which has been followed by consumers. It
is natural that the stocks of companies whose
business is connected with the cotton trafflo
should have been conspicuously strong In the
week's trading. Additional sympathetlo ef
fect has been produced on the group by the
prosperous showing contained In the annual
report of the Southern Railway Company and
by the action of the Central of Georgia direc
tors In declaring the first interest disburse
ment ever allowed for the second preferred
Income bonds of that company.
The prospect of a short crop of wheat
presents a sharp contrast. The heavy decrease
in the exports of wheat for the last fiscal
year is evidence that last year's small sur
plus available for export will be materially
cut down this year, leaving an Important
gap In the foreign commerce of the country.
The corn crop is still looked to hopefully
to eke out the deficiency In our grain ex
ports, the more so as all accounts point to
a serious shortage In thÂ» foreign wheat crops.
The foreign demand for corn is already re
ported to be Increasing, and the further prog
ress of that crop, which promises well, will
be watched with Interest, as an Important
factor in the business conditions of the com
ing r^ar. Other factors in the outlook have
been as mixed as those for the crops. The
week's advices Indicate some revival in the
iron and steel trade and great Importance is
attached to these. Large orders have been
placed for pig Iron, and the announcement of
orders for 60,000 tons of steel rails for the
Harriman system of railroads had a marked
effect on the stocks of that syststn and on
the iron and steel stocks.
CONFIDENCE IS FEUT.
Total sales of bonds (par value). $1,145,000.
Increased attention has been given In the
stock market this week to the condition and
prospect of the crops. Che conflicting influences
from that source have caused a tone of hesita
tion in the stock market and a decrease In
the activity of the trading. But the most bril
liant prospects ever recorded for a large ami
profitable cotton crop, and with reports Jn
currency during the week pointing to something,
like a disaster to the year's wheat crop, the
divided sentiment in the stock market la ex
plained. The consideration of the cotton crop
wsji prompted by the publication of the Gov
ernment's estimate of a condition on July 23
of 81.0 per cent, of an estimated acreage of
32.000.COO. The sharp rise in condition In July
is contrary to the usual precedent. Although
the critical period of the crop Is yet to come,
the favorable progress thus far and the ab
sence of serious hurtful factors In the weather
conditions from day to day give rise to the
brightest hopes for this highly Important ele
ment In the country's prosperity.

NEW . YORK. Aur. 6.â There is little to |
record of to-day's short session of the Stock
Exchange. Dealings ran down to the level of
! midsummer dullness and the movement o{
i prices was so sluggish as to be entirely lit
1 conclusive as to any sentiment over the ouÂ£-
I look for values to be expressed. The uncer
tainty over the extent of damage to the sprlrfg
wheat was a continuing factor and Is expected
to be until the publication of the Government
report next Wednesday. The rally in consols
iÂ» a favorable influence on all securities mar- j
kets. The outgo of sold which has been in- j
augurated is the subject of interested dis
cussion, but is of little concrete effect, owing
to the plethoric condition of the money market.
Foreign bankers refrain from offerinc bills
against future shipments of Brain and cot
ton, as they usually do at this time of year,
because there is no chance of employing the
proceeds to advantage in the present stagnant
money markets here.
The money rate is relatively high in London
and no commercial bills of exchange are offer
ing as a means of remittance of credits. The
shipment of gold is therefore the only alter
native. The gold outgo next week, so far as ar.
ranged, promises to be more than offset by
the expected receipt at San Francisco of i
94,000,000 in Japanese and Australian gold to I
be transferred to New York by telegraph. The
bank statement did not reflect the full gain In
reserves indicated by the preliminary estimates,
but the showing was complicated by opera
tions in connection with the remittance to
Cuba on. account of the loan installment.

ter the Good Fellows' Orotto, opposite
the City Hall, yesterday morning and
he recognized one of them as Joseph
Eancroft, alias George Wlllard, alias
George Henderson, alias George Rayâ
a well-known Eastern crook. A
photograph of Bancroft had been sent
from the East and it was from this
photograph that Wolters recognized
him.

"WELL-KNOWN EASTERN
CROOK IS ARRESTED
The detective followed the two men
into the grotto and when they entered
a side room he went up to Bancroft
and placed him under arrest. Ban
croft, who was stylishly dressed, pro
tested that Wolters had made a mis
take. "I am a gentleman," he said,
"and you had better be careful of what
you do." Wolters promptly slipped
the handcuffs over his wrists and
made a' grab for the other man, who
struggled fiercely to get away. Wolters
hung to them both till Bancroft's com
panion slipped out of his coat and ran
out of the place.
Bancroft was taken to the City
Prison and locked up In "the tanks."
Some of the men whose pockets have
been picked recently are being round
ed up by Detectives Ryan and Taylor
for a look at Bancroft.

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 7. 1904.

returned from Europe, was the guest
of honor at a dinner given last even
ing by a number of his friends at tha
Dinner to a Home Comer.
Congressman Minor Makes Brilliant
Prophecy at Banquet or George
li. Thomas Post.
The twenty- fifth anniversary dinner
of George H. Thomas Post No. 2, G.
A. R., was held at the Occidental Ho
tel last night. Covers were laid for
165. Among the guests of honor was
Congressman Minor of Wisconsin, a
member of the Merchant Marine Com
mission visiting 1 this State, who was
invited to speak. He expressed his
sentiments regarding the ocean going
commerce of the United States, which,
he seemed to think, had been neglect
ed while other interests were carefully
fostered.
The banquet-room was .tastefully
decorated with American flags and
after the dinner toasts were responded
to as follows:* "The Occasion," Com
mander F. Ij.* Turpin; "The President
of the United States," Charles E. Wil
son; "Comradeship," A. D. Cutler;
"Reminiscences of George H. Thom
as," W. R. .Smedberg; "A Quarter
Century of G. A. R. History," W. R.
Smedberg;' "The Past and Future of
George H. Thomas Post," J. R. Scup
ham, N. B. Coleman and A. S. Fiske:
"Boys of the Post (under 60)," C. A.
Woodruff.
The toasts dealt largely with sub
jects of interest to the old soldiers
present. Congressman Minor diverted
somewhat from this line of talk when
he paid a high compliment to Califor
nia and prophesied that the commerce
of the Pacific would exceed that of the
Atlantic and should be carried In
American > vessels.

HOSTETTER'S
ST0HACH BITTERS
To cure a weak stomach is to
take Hcstetter's Stomach Bitters
at the very first symptom. It does
away with starving and dieting
yourself because it puts the stom-
ach in proper condition to digest
the food. In this way it cures
Indigestion, Dyspepsia, Constipa-
tion, Biliousness, Heartburn, In-
somnia, Headache, Cramps or
Diarrhoea. Nervous and sickly
women also find the Bitters un-
equaled as a regulator and tonic.
We urge a fair trial. V. *;-

Â¦ .. In order to prevent such milk from
entering this city the Board of Health
must satisfy itself through the inves
tigations of its own officials that the
milk is from unsanitary dairies. Ac
tion In .the Santa Clara case will de
pend upon the report which Ragan
and Hassler will make regarding the
notification sent by Health Officer
Simpson. â¢â¢-.*â¢.
Acting on information received from
Health Officer Simpson of Santa Clara
County, the local Board of Health yes
terday directed Health Officer Ragan
and Chief Inspecting Physician Hass
ler to proceed at once to make an of
ficial inspection of the dairies in the
county named. Ragan and Hassler
will leave this morning for San Jose
to prosecute their investigations.
In a communication to the Board
of Health Simpson said many of the
dairies in the county were conducted
in an unsanitary manner. He called
particular attention to the fact that
the fields upon which the cows were
put to graze were reeking with sewer
contamination from adjacent polluted
streams. Simpson desired the board
to be made acquainted with the con
ditions, as milk is shipped to this city
from Santa Clara County and the In
formation would be available in the
Health Board's crusade against un
sanitary dairies for the purpose of in
suring a pure, milk supply to San
Francisco. â¢
While the local Board of Health
has no jurisdiction over sanitary con
ditions in Santa Clara County, it has
the power to quarantine, against any
place which it knows is supplying im
pure milk or milk that may be in
danger of sewage or other contamina
tion owing to bad sanitary conditions
obtaining in dairies located in other
counties.

PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 6. â During
the last few weeks hold-ups and rob

currence in this city that a conditipn
of affairs almost bordering on a state
of terror prevails. ... .
To circumvent thugs, thieves and
outlaws in their hold-ups in the city
Chief of Police Hunt has ordered out
an extra number of policemen and
deputies and will add to this army of
protection seventeen men, who will be
specially detuiled to ride upon' street
cars in the suburban districts to guard
the pitssengers and railroad employes
from the highwaymen, whose partic
ular vocation during the last week or
ten days h:is been the holding up of
street cars in unprotected localities. .
Chief Hunt has also advised busi
ness men and others whose occupa
tions keep them out late in the night
to arm themselves and to shoot if

Mysterious Death of M. W.
O'Connell, Former Marshal
of the Town of Victor
DENVER, Aug. 6.â M. W. O'Connell.
former Marshal of Victor, came to his
death this evening by falling from a
fourth-story window in the rear of the
Markhaf}}>Hotel.
There is doubt as to whether O'Con
nell met with an accident, committed
suicide or wag murdered. The police
hold to the suicide theory, on the
ground j that an accident would have
been almost impossible, as the" window
in the room from; which O'Connellfell
was not open more than two feet. The
friends of O'Connell declare that the
Marshal was murdered, as he was seen
not more than ten minutes before his
death and at that time was in a cheer
ful mood. They declare that he had
many enemies who would not have hes
itated to kill him. .
Shortly before 6 o'clock O'Connell
went to his room in the Markham to
cha.nge his clothing. Ten minutes later
his body was picked up on the pave
ment. That he had started to dresa is
evident from the fact that his coat and
hat were found in his room.
O'Connell was Marshal of Victor at
the time of the Victor riot on June 6
and swore in a number of union men
to help keep the" peace. For this rea
son he was removed from office by the
Mayor of Victor and later charged with
having participated in the riot. He was
only, yesterday released on $10,000 bonds.

THE people of Kings County are interested in a
large proposition. The reclamation of the bed of
Tulare Lake is desired. Formerly the lake was
navigated by steamboats. It has disappeared from the
map as a body of water. In theodepression where for
merly were its waters agriculturists , find rich soil. A
mass meeting was held in Hanford recently to find out
what can be done to make the entire lake bed available
for agricultural uses.
It was represented that a tract of land 21,000 acres in
extent had been flooded out this year because the waters
of the Kings River were not carried off in drainage
canals. It is possible- to permanently reclaim Â¦ these
21,000 acres and 700,000 additional acres of arid land can
be brought under cultivation if the Kings River is prop
erly controlled and its verdure sustaining moisture is
wis'ely applied. No one questioned -the accuracy of these
figures. Some discussion followed. The outcome was
the appointment of r a committee of twenty-five citizens
to prepare a plan of procedure,- having in view reclama
tion.
In the coutse of discussion it was developed that the
overflowing of of acre's of crop:, this year
was due to the incqmpleteness of a canal system that will
eventually surround the boundaries of the old lake. :
This canal has the double object of preventing overflows
RECLAIMING A LAKE BED.
The young lady who was forced by a court the other
day to return her engagement ring after she had thrown
over the swain that had placed it on her betrothal finger
may soothe her chagrin in the reflection that the fellow
she refused wasn't good enough to have anything worth
keeping anyway.
Captain Eugene H. C. Leutze, U. S.
N., commander of the battleship
Maine, lias German blood in his veins,
and vast knowledge of detail about
naval ordnance in his head. Before
he was given the Maine and last went
to sea he was superintendent of the
gun factory at the Washington navy
yard, and gained the reputation of
being a strict taskmaster.
Habitually an "early to bed early to
rise" man. Captain Leutze found him
self unable to sleep one night. He
arose, dressed, left his quarters, and
walked down to one of the gun shops.
Although three shifts are needed to
dispose of the great press of work now
on hand, there was little doing.
1 Captain Leutze's sharp eye detected
a mechanic sitting on the carriage of
a great lathe, which was slowly run
ning to and fro, taking almost innnite r
sixnal threads of steel from a twelve
inch gun. He was dozing, oblivious to
all surroundings, when Captain Leutze
reached his side and aroused him
with:
"Well, what :.re you doing and
what's your, name ?"
The craftsman looked up and quail
ed. Then, with a resigned air, he re
plied: "Well, I guess it's Dennis."
He was not discharged.â Kansas
City Journal.
He Guessed It.
IN one of his thrilling editorials in the Examiner,
Mr. "Hearst frankly lays a . wounded spirit where
the .public can see it suffer. This injury has been
caused by "his discovery of a rich man's son, clad in
overalls, an apprentice in a machine shop and learning
a trade! Mr. JHearst is of the opinion that a rich man's
son should have an ambition above wearing overalls and
learning a handicraft. The overalls seem to be spe
cially offensive and are referred to with a bitterness of
expression which , we thought could not be, excited by
that harmless and. necessary article of clothing.
Mr. Hearst is of the opinion that a rich man's son
should put ill his time doing good, elevating his fellow
inair,'as it were, and declares that this young man in
overalls is not fulfilling that high mission.* We can see
no occasion for all this fuss. Men who have had trades
and worn overalls have done many a good job at ele
vating their fellows, and history asks no question about
what they wore, whether trousers or overalls.
Without taking time to fully examine the ethics of the
question, we should 'say that it, shows a very com
mendable spirit in a rich man's son that he desires to
join .his fellow-men in a workshop, learn their trade,
take pot luck with them and train his hands to skill
in a useful and honorable occupation. He will then
h?ve an honest calling by which to earn a living, if
his" riches take wings. " /
Mr. -â¢ Hearst puts in* ;parV of his time writing edi
torials deploring the- exclusiveness of the rich, a theme
upon which he is. occasionally almost eloquent and al
ways fervid, end now he bucks because a rich youngster
has dropped exclusiveness and wears overalls' and chews
hi3 lunch out of a tin bucket.
: vAs Mr.' Hearst is rich in experience as the son of a
millionaire he should explain more fully his objection
to overalls! We are of the opinion that they are 100
per cent.better than no "pants? at all, and we are minded
to defend them against ; this unexpected attack from the
rear.- '--â¢*' >'-'H* -â¢-Â¦ â¢ . Â¦ . .â¢
MEASURING MOUNTAINSâ Valam
brosa, Cal. The barometer is an Instru
ment for measuring the weight or pres
sure of the atmosphere. It is also used
for measurins mountains. When the
barometer is at the foot of a mountain
the pressure it sustains must be great
er than that to which It would be sub
jected at the top by the weight of thÂ»
column of air Intervening between the
summit and the bottom of the moun
tain. When it is known at how many
feet above the earth's surface the
pressure of air becomes so far lessened
as to cause the mercury in the long
tube to fall one inch, at how many feet
it falls two inches, three inches and so
on, the process of measuring the height
of a mountain becomes a very easy
one. Ot course, the number of feet cor
responding to inches of depression was
ascertained In the first instance by
actual measurement. This depression
varies with the size of the tube, and it
is also somewhat affected by the tem
perature and by the amount of mois
ture in the air. These latter differences
must be tested by actual experiment.
Allowance must also be made for lati
tude. To meet these conditions and to
insure perfect accuracy in the result,
complex formula and tables are used
by mathematicians, but for ordinary
use measuring barometers have been
made on which are recorded the heights
indicated by varying levels of the mer
cury, as the degree of temperature is
recorded on a thermometer.
ABOUT OVERALLS.
HOBSON'S CHOICE â A Subscriber.
Sacramento, CaL "Hobson's choiceâ
that or none," had its origin from thÂ»
action of an old English livery-stable
keeper. In the time of Charles I Hob
son let horses to the students at Cam
bridge. He would never break his rule
of letting the horses in strict rotation.
Persons wanting horses had to takÂ»
those whose turn it was to go out or
they could not have any. Hence thÂ»
saying. "That or none," which tu
transformed Into "Hobson's choice."
The wheat growers of California have organized to ask
the Legislature at its next session to appropriate $6000
with which to conduct experiments with the cereal and
to discover if possible the causes which .have contributed
to deterioration. As the fame of California rests more
upon her 'agriculture than upon her gold it is obvious
that the plan of the farmers to protect their most vital
interest must meet with popular and governmental ap
proval. .
SCHOOL OF MINESâ H. TL. Dedrick.
Trinity County. Cal. Professor David
Starr Jordan of the Stanford Univer
sity writes: "In a recent answer to a
correspondent is one In regard to the-
Missouri School of Mines. This institu
tion Is a well-conducted branch of the
University of Missouri, and is situated
at Rolla. Mo. It is not listed as a sepa
rate school because it is a branch of
the university." This furnishes the In
formation the correspondent from Ded
rick desired.
"Uncle Joe" thought a moment, re
membered that while at the store he
had seen several coats exactly like his,
which the salesmen had told him were
held at the same price, and then, notf
being averse to. picking up ten dollars
.with so little effort, said. "I'll go you."
â¢The exchange was quickly effected.
While walking on toward his office
"Uncle Joe" met one of hlSj daughters.
She scolded him for exposing himself to

Joseph G. Cannon, Speaker of the
House of Representatives, is not as
careful about the details of his dress
as some other members of Congress.
Since his elevation to his present po
sition he > has paid more attention to
his apparel than he did when he was
merely one of the many on the floor,
but even now he forgets sometimes to
the extent of leaving a few inches of
waistcoat unbuttoned or a cravat
crawling up to his ear instead of keep-
Ing under his chin. A few days before
Congress adjourned, he appeared in a
brand new suit, the fit and general
style of which indicated the work of a
finished and up-to-date tailor. This
had the effect of reviving a story of
the old days when he did not even
dream, perhaps, of occupying the seat
made notable by Crisp and Reed.
"Uncle Joe," as he is familiarly called,
has always been economical and firm
ly believes that a dollar saved 13 a
dollar earned. One of his methods of
laying up money along these lines
used to be to buy ready made clothing
and to pay not more than $15 for a
suit or an overcoat. The result was
sometimes too marked to be alto
gether acceptable to the members of
his family, and ultimately his daugh
ters worked out a plan which . they
thought would solve all the various
problems involved. The scheme was
simply to go to the clothing store
where their father traded, deposit u
certain sum of money with the propri
etor and instruct him to* bring: out his
best stock when his distinguished cus
tomer called, but to say nothing or do
nothing that would give him a hint
that the clothing displayed for hi3 in
spection was not his favorite $15 '
grade. Then, if he chanced to select
a suit worth $45 he paid his $15 and
the remaining $30 was taken from the
amount deposited by his daughters.
All went well until Â¦ some of the
neighbors were let into the secret. One
day "Uncle Joe" came proudly down
the street wVaring a handsome new
overcoat for which he had just paid
$15, but for which the storekeeper
had also deducted an additional thirty
five dollars from the trust fund." A
friend who had become 'acquainted
with the modus operand! of the deal
met him and. expressed excessive admi
ration for the now garment.
"Yes, it's a fine coat," said Mr. Can
non. "Only cost- me fifteen dollars,
too."

THE naval commanders of Russia have been ordered
to sink no more merchant ships. Skrydloff found
such use of his guns more congenial than in fight
ing the Japanese navy, and was so exultant over it that
he treated his gallant, gunners to the beer.
The press of the United States was no more inclined
to advise submission to Russian piracy than was that of
Great Britain. It has been especially refreshing to fol
low the course of such strong opposition papers as the
New Ycjrk World and the Times.
The World says: "Russia has grossly blundered in
making war on neutral commerce. Her position is un
tenable and must be abandoned. Apologies, reparation
in full and assurances against a repetition of such law
less raids will be demanded by the aggrieved powers,
and must* be granted."
The Times says: "It is simply intolerable that a cas
ual naval officer should be allowed to take the adjudica
tion of such a case into his own hands. The plain fact
is he has prevented the ship from being brought before
a court for adjudication and that therefore all presump
tions are in favor of the owners and against him. A
full restitution in 'value is what the British Government
is entitled to demand, and the Russian Government to
grant, and- what our Government is entitled to ask and
Russia to grant for such of the cargo as is owned by
Americans. As for the futqre, in case of other Russian
cruisers whose commanders are given to magnifying their
oflices, it would be well that the authorities of an American
port which an American steamer leaves for Japan should
be satisfied that she carries no contraband, and that
an American man-of-war, . more powerful than any
cruiser of the / Vladivostok squadron, should thereupon
be detailed to accompany the merchantman to see that
she completes her voyage without molestation."
That is the right sort of talk, and Americans will al
most regret that Russia backs down and prevents the
pleasure of such a meeting on the high seas.
The backdown is only one more added to the many
humiliations that Russia earned. More will follow un
til her pretense of ruling the world will be the world's
laughing stock.

about twenty feet apart. Each is fitted
up as a "deii," and In one are to be

scripts and books of reference of Ker
nahan in the other those- if his wife.
Each of the "huts" Is llrlued by win

ped with, a heating apparatus. Thus
the literary couple are able to work,
summer and winter alike, within a few
feet of each other, and yet be respec

miles apart. From what I saw of the
Kerr.ahans, however, I imagine that
few hours pass without visits being ex

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALX*
6 â¢ HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT

in" Westcllffe-on-Sea, the smart little
Eesex cummer resort, recently I had
rood luck to meet and visit an un
â¢'commenly Interesting literary couple
who make their home there â the Coul
son Kernahans. Kernahan himself is
too well known in the United States to
red any Introduction to American
readers. He produced that weird study,
"A Dead Man's Diary"; "God and the
Ant," which has been translated into
eight languages, including Chinese, and
'The Child, the Wise Man and the
Devil," of which 250,000 copies have
.been sold. "Scoundrels & Co." was one
of Kernahan's last books. Incidentally,
he is literary adviser to one of the best
known of London publishers. Mrs. Ker
nahan's work is, I fancy, less well
known in the United States, but she
has half a dozen novels to her credit,
among them '"The House of Rlmmon"
and ""Frank Redland, Recruit," and an
other coming out in the falL
"Thrums" is the name which the Ker
taahans have bestowed upon their cot
tageâa typical English one, half-hid

interesting abodes it ever has been my
â¢iot to enter. The drawing-room is lit
erally crowded with souvenirs of dis
tinguished folk, which in almost every
case have been presented by the cele
brities themselves. For instance, there
are the original sketches of famous
paintings by English artists, Rossetti
among them; signed photographs of
notable men in every walk of life, and
.what must be one of the most remark
able collections In this country of auto
graphed books. I hesitate to say how
many shelves they fill, but practically
every living English author is repre
sented, and in most cases the inscrip

that the writer and Kernahan are on
unusually friendly terms. Here are vol

THE "meeting of livestock men in Denver for consul
tation with the Secretary of Agriculture has re
newed an issue which will not down until it is set
tled right. The decline of "the. stock range on the public
domain has engaged the attention of the meat, hide and
wool interests for many years. The use of the range in
common has renewed in this country the experience of
Australia, where the livestock industry was nearly exter
minated by use of the range in common, and a leasing
tystem was adopted which has restored the range indus
try. Texas underwent the same experience and adopted
the same remedy, and now is the leading livestock State
of the Union, because leasehold control has restored the
carrying capacity of the range.
Moved upon by these object lessons, the livestock men
of the West took up the question and sought a similar
solution. They framed bills which were offered to an
unsympathetic Congress without result. The theorists
of the country, who had never seen the Western range,
had a theory that it is all adapted to the same tillage as
the prairies of Iowa and Illinois, and that the "cattle
barons" were attempting to gobble it in order to prevent
its use by the people for homes. As the theorists would
not come and look at the country, and refused to believe
the reports of those who knew the actual conditions, it
was easy to. call the leasing proposition a. "land grab,"
and induce the non-action of Congress.'
The livestock men encountered also the stolid opposi
tion of the Interior Department. It proved impossible
to convince that department that after all the land pos
sible of irrigation has been reserved for that use, and
after all that can be tilled by partial irrigation or none
has been taken out, there^, will remain several hundred
million acres of land that has not and cannot have any
other use than grazing. This range in a natural state
produced abundant forage plants, such as buffalo, bunch,
and gramma grass, legumes and ribbon grass, burr clo
ver and alfileria. If not overstocked these plants renew
themselves annually. If overstocked they disappear and
the land becomes desert again.
The Agricultural Department took up the expert ex
amination of the range plants. Its trained agrostologists
examined the range from New Mexico to Mon
tana and made truthful reports, which were pub
lished for the information of Congress. But these made
no impression upon the theorists. The destruction of
the range has gone on. The war for possession of its
declining forage has grown more titter. The Federal
reservations have cut out the summer range in the
mountains and our grazing industry is being driven to
exile in Canada and Mexico.
But our livestock men do not all intend to be ex
patriated without a struggle. They intend making one
more effort to convince the Government that four hun
dred million acres of range is worth conservation and
renewal. Hence this meeting at Denver, presided over
by Conrad one of the pioneer rangers of the
West, a man of high intelligence and great energy. The
Secretary of Agriculture was present. He is a Western
man and has personally inspected the ranges, as have
the experts of his department. In the meeting were <
Western Senators, members of Congress and Governors.
The discussion was full and practical. The sentiment of
the convention was .expressed in its resolutions. These
ask that the Federal forest reserves be put in charge of
the Agricultural Department and that the same depart
ment be authorized by law to proceed to classify the
lands on the public domain, segregating the range lands
proper, which can serve no other use, and that these
lands be leased under control of the Agricultural De
partment.
The proposed transfer of control from the Interior
Department to that of Agriculture has every merit and
no'demerit. The most of the business of the Interior
Department is in taking care of the unsold public do
main. When that domain passes to the control and use
of the people, as it should, that function of the Interior
Department ceases. Hence for years we have had every
possible obstruction put in the way of the use by the
people of the natural resources of the West by the In
terior Department. So tense has the situation become
that a citizen desirous of acquiring public land has come
to be treated as a potential criminal, whose laudable de
sire is evidence of evil motives.
Ori the other "hand, the Department of Agriculture is
concerned in promoting the productivity of the land in
private ownership or control. The head of that depart
ment is always a practical man, in sympathy with the
soil and those who' till or graze it. The Secretary of
Agriculture believes that every acre should be put to its
noblest use and that its capacity for such use should be
promoted. In his hands the ranges will have their ca
pacity restored and the good days of our range industry
will come again.
The Denver meeting was highly useful and may well
be the initiation of a wiser policy that will stop the de
struction . of the rangr and arrest the exiling of our
livestock interest to Canada dnd Mexico.

and providing means for distributing water on acres that
arc arid. The building of levees is considered only a
temporary expedient. The hope of the movers for per
manent benefit rests on the prospect of united action
among the prosent owners of the lake bed.
Tulare Lake^was eighty-seven feet below the point on
the Kings River at which water is taken out to irrigate
about the old lake bed. An organization has been effect
ed to be known as the Tulare Lake Reclamation and Ir
rigation Association. This much progress has been
made and more is expected. Seven hundred thousand
acres, if made agriculturally productive, will add largely
to the wealth and resources of Kings- County.
The Hanford Journal reports that much interest is
manifested in a proposition to have the United States
Government reclaim the land under the arid land law.
The alternative is that the people shall, by concerted ac
tion and the use of their own money, effect what is
found to be necessary. Engineers will be employed to
consider the projected work from the expert point of
view.
It reads something like a : romance that the land
about. a lake that was navigated by some living Cali
fornia pioneers has so completely changed its environ
ment that irrigation is necessary to sustain crops. Like
all lake^ bottoms washed by waters that are not laden
with chemicals detrimental to vegetation, the hollow that
marks Tulare's former- site is very rich. With the super
inducing climate of Kings County added it will prove
very productive, the necessary water being provided un
der control as a requisite.

HIS XOTES OX MONDAY
CHICAGO. Aug. 6. â Henry Koch, a
house painter, lost his life to-day in
trying to save the life of Policeman
Daniel O'Brien, who also risked his
life to save imperiled men. After
seven laborers had been overcome by
gas in an excavation at Eighteenth
street and Armour- avenue Policeman
O'Brien went into the pit and fastened
ropes about their bodies, j All were
lifted to the surface, but when the
last man had been taken out the po
liceman lay unconscious in the hole.
It was then that Koch went in and at
tached a rope to the policeman's body
O'Brien was rescued, but Koch fell
unconscious and though Patrick King
and Henry Thompson, firemen, bravely
went into the hole and brought up his
body, he was beyond resuscitation.

Andrea Sbarbofo, treasurer of the

of money remaining in his hands after
returning many subscriptions. The
letter is as follows:
"Editor of The Call â Last year at
the request of President Roosevelt a
subscription was made in this city in
favor of the national Martinique and
West Indian Islands relief fund; for
which $3767 05 was soon collected and
forwarded to the treasurer, Cornelius
N. Bliss, New York. In December last
there was refunded $1883 52, being
one-half, of the subscription, which
portion was not required for use in
the afflicted island.
"The committee, composed of Mayor
E. E. Schmitz, Henry T. Scott and A.
Sbarboro, met at the Mayor's office
for the purpose, of deciding what dis
position to make of the money re
funded and it was there decided that
the money should be refunded pro

MARTINIQUE FUND
GIVEN TO CRIPPLES
Whitelock said nothing, and Judge
Cabaniss sentenced him to thirty days'
imprisonment.
"You are of no use to me," said Mrs.
George Whitelock to her husband, an
ironworker, "for you never have sup
ported your six children, and I hope the
Judge will sock It to you good and
hard."
Charles Spohn of 503 California street
admitted that on the night of July 3 he
struck his wife, Laura, with a clenched
first, but he denied that the blow was
either unprovoked or. forcibly delivered.
While it was not exactly a love tap,
neither was it such a punch as he could
send home if trying for a knockout.
Laura was both intoxicated and- de
fiant, he said, when she returned home
after midnight, and when he courteous
ly asked for enlightenment as to her
rtcent whereabouts she viciously at
tacked him with a hatpin. As she had
him cornered and he did not desire to
have his person punctured, he swung
a light blow to her head. Blood was
not drawn nor was she physically dam
aged by the thump.
If the symptoms of amazement dis
played by Mrs. Spohn during her hus
band's recital were not genuine she
proved herself an excellent actress. She
gasped and shook her head until a
blonde coiffure became sidly disar
ranged, and occasionally she clutched
her ears as if to ascertain if they were
not deceiving her. Then she looked at
Police Judge Conlan with an expression
Indicating the pity she felt that he
should be compelled to sit there and
listen to such frightful prevarication.
It was only the rat-a-tat of the bailiff's
gavel outnoising Mrs. Spohn's tongue
that made her denunciation unintelligi
ble. When silence was restored the hus
band tried to say something in rebut
tal, but she talked as rapidly and as
loudly as he did, and the Judge finally
quelled the duet by continuing the case
till to-morrow.
Dr. Solomon Charles Mlsh is
charged before Judge .Conlan with
having performed a criminal opera
tion on Miss Edna Sampson, recently
from Stockton and now residing at
2700 Bush street. He is held in $3000
bail for trial next Wednesday. The
girl is reported to be In a precarious
condition.
Judge Cabaniss dismissed the
charge of obtaining money under false
pretense which Mrs. Sarah Johnson
had entered against James F. Young.
A grand larceny charge by the same
complainant Is pending against Young.
Â¦ L. L. Rea, a native of France,
cheerfully paid the ?5 which Judge
Cabaniss fined him for having struck
A. Pradelg a violent blow upon the left
eyebrow.
"Pay ze five?" exclaimed Monsieur
Rea, excitedly -passing to the clerk a
golden coin of the denomination men
tioned. "Here is ze five, and I'd pay
ze five more for ze plaisaire of plug
ging heem in ze ozzer eyebrow. Take
ze monee."
A. Bernardini, fisherman, residing
at 503 Broadway, said he would will
ingly go to jail -if his wife, Paulina,
who had him arrested for battery,
felt that she could afford to prosecute
him. To his evident surprise Paulina
promptly called his bluff by declaring
that she would rather see him in jail
than at liberty and expressed a hope
that Judge Cabaniss would remember
her preference when the sentence was
handed out.- To this the Judge re
sponded that it refreshed him to deal
with a complainant of Mrs. Bernar
dini's fortitude, which he would re
ward by sending Bernardini to prison
for thirty days. '

With the explosion of fireworks,
blare of band and considerable ora
tory, the corner-stone of the new Mis
sion Theater at Twenty-second and
Mission streets, was laid yesterday af
ternoon. Fully* a thousand persons,
mostly women and children, were
present. The corner-stone was laid
I under the auspices of the Federation
of Mission Improvement Clubs. The
â¢speakers dwelt mostly upon the. rapid
growth of the Mission and pointed to
the building of a theater in one of its
most populous centers as evidence
that the people who have money to
invest have conlldence in the district.
Â¦ The new theater has a frontage of
sixty feet on Mission street and a
depth of 120 feet. The architecture is
of the old mission style and the front
Is about forty-five feet in height. Th'e
building is fireproof throughout and
the, stage .will be equipped -with the
; most modern apparatus, so that either
vaudeville shows may be run or a

did not care to take up any new work
until the return of the superintendent,
who Is expected back In about three

PARK WORKMEN
ARE LAID OFF
Assistant District Attorney Ferral,
who. represented the defendant at his
trial, made an impassioned address in
his behalf. He declared that it would
be judicial murder to send the-defend
ant to the gallows, as he did not fire
the shots at Rice. He asked for time
to prepare a petition to the Governor
to commute the sentence to imprison
ment for life and said that the time
would arrive when the defendant
would receive a free pardon.
Buckley, was asked if he had any
thing to say. He stood up, and, al
though ho seemed deeply affected, he
said In a clear voice: "I can only say,
as my attorneys have said, that I am
innocent. I never fired the shots, but
they were fired by a man I did not
know. As sure as there Is a God
above me I am as : innocent of that
crime as any of the Jurors who found
me guilty. I never Injured that man."
The Judge after passing sentence
read correspondence that had passed
between him and ex-Governor Gage
and Governor Pardee, showing that
the records of the case had been sent
to each : of the Governors, who had
thus been fully advised of everything
that had. transpired.
William Buckley was resentenced
by Judge. Lawlor yesterday to be
hanged at San Quentln on October 1
for the murder of George W. Rice, a
non-union machinist, at Twentieth and
Howard streets on the evening of Oc
tober 11, 1901. Buckley was tried,
convicted and sentenced to be hanged.
A motion for a new trial was denied
and lie appealed to the Supreme
Court, but tha appeal was unsuccess
ful.
A writ of superaedeas will now, it is
said, be applied for to the Supreme
Court on the grounds that the defend
ant was not proceeded against by an
Indictment of the Grand Jury; that
he was not' confronted with the wit
nesses against him and that therefore
the court was without authority to
enforce the Judgment. The objection
was that Erllne Platt's testimony
taken at the preliminary examination
was read to the Jury, as she was un
able to be present at the trial.
j Attorney D. J. Murphy prior to the
passing of sentence said he desired to
make a request oh behalf .of the de
fendant. He declared that the story
first told him by the defendant was
the same as testified to by him as a
witness on the stand. If had im
pressed him with the stamp of truth
fulness. He asked for' delay In- the
execution of the sentence in order that
steps might be taken to save the de
fendant from what he believed un
just punishment.

The contest over the vacancy in the
Board of Education seems to have
narrowed down to Park Commission
er Atlmann and David J. Oliver Jr.,
with the chances rather favoring Alt
mann, although Oliver's supporters
claim it is an even race. Both men
are highly regarded by the present
members of the board and both have
influential backing. Deputy Health
Officer Levy, who applied for the ap
pointment, learned yesterday that he
is ineligible by two years owing to the
charter requirement that a School Di
rector must be SO years of age. The

District Attorney Bylngton has de-
J cided to lay the case of Georsre T.
Ballinger before the Grand Jury, Bal
linger was bookkeeper for thÂ© Califor
nia Art Glass Works, 133 Second
street, and was arrested on a charga
of felony .embezzlement â upon com
plaint of .William Schroeder, presi
dent of the company. He waa held
to answer, 'but waa released on a writ
: of habeas; corpus by Judge Graham.
'An information had been filed against
i him on Â»' the- same day that the writ
! was applied for and the case was as-
I signed to : Judge Dunne's/court.
A^motlon to dismiss the Information
was In due course made before Judge
Dunne- by Attorneys Barry and Bar
rett for, the defendant, but the Judge
refused to > grant the motion and hint
ed that the proceedings , would not
bear investigation. ,
Yesterday when the case iras again
called Assistant District Attorney
Whiting said he had - Been the wit
nesses in the case and he was satisfied
there was a clear case of embezzle
ment. It waa the intention of the
District Attorney to prosecute the
I case and to present it to the Grand
; Jury. There were other charges on
i which the defendant could be prose
i cuted besides the one In the lnforma
; tion. Whiting asked that the matter
j stand over for a week.
i Attorney Barry said no good result
j could follow the course proposed by
i the District Attorney. . The discharge
i of the defendant on a writ was a bar
to any further proceedings.
"If the facts," said the Judge, "pre
sented at the preliminary examination
! are substantiated the offense of em
j bezzlement was properly charged. I
j think the District Attorney's offlca
j should make a thorough Inquiry as to
j whether there had been anything
I lurking behind the motion for the dis
| charge of the defendant and discover
, upon whom the responsibility- rests.
Personally, I' have at no tima express
ed an opinion as to the guilt or lnno
jcence.of the defendant."
j Barry said he would enter a formal
exception to the language of the court
In regard to the defendant and the
j good faith of himself and Attorney
j Barrett in making the motion. The
i whole matter had been argued in the
! other court and the writ granted. He
objected to any^critlcism of the action
of the other court
"It seems to me," said Judge Dunne,
"that if you are clothed with right
eousness you have nothing to fear
! from an inquiry. The other court can
I take care of itself."
Barry again vigorously protested.
He denied that there had been any In
j tentlon of imposing upon the ' court
j The defendant would stand upon his
S rights and would rely upon the fact
j that he had' been proved Innocent of
i the charge, which fact should entitle
j him to have his rights protected. i
! The Judge said the -unfortunate
I thing was that he was not^ satisfied
the* defendant *was looking for his
rights. The whole proceedings if thor
j oughly analyzed would be a sufficient
: answer to all that counsel had said;
i He would continue the matter for a
j week. Barry again Jook exception to
} the language and manner of the court
and the Judge curtly said, "That is
all."

"Would a civil suit for damages avail the
plaintiff? In this case the answer admits that
the " defendants are . financially Irresponsible,
hence av money judgment - against them , would
be unavailing, r Furthermore, a resort to civil
proceedings " would involve a multiplicity ! of
suits. There jug,? COO members of the defend
ant's union, several hundred of whom must
have participated in the "boycott" of plaintiff;
the number and personnel of the participants,
however, was constantly, changing, tn the morn
ing one or two. lu the afternoon four or six.
and ; in the evening from thirty to fifty; the
names of the picket men were, and are, un
known to plaintiff; besides, eomo participated
! In thin case the answer admits that, if the
defendants are not res trained, the plaintlff'a
business will-- be completely destroyed.* For
such a wrong the Penal Codo affords the plain
tiff â¢" no remedy. The criminal law cannot
recompense plaintiff . for loss sustained, cannot
restrain others from committing like acts, can
not enjoin tho union from continuing the boy
cott, nor can it prevent a threatened injury
to hio nroBerty. ' .-
The only j question of law to be determined,
therefore, is the question of remedy. The de
fendant's counsel claims that the plaintiff's
remedy, if any. must be sought, either In
a criminal proceeding or in a civil action for
danastf In respect to the former claim It
is to . be noted that: a wrongful act is. In re
spect to its nature, either a public offense or
a private injury; but. tn respect to remedial
consequences, It may be both. The State may
punish a wrongdoer by imprisonment, but that
circumstance in no wise impairs the civil
remedy "bf the aggrieved party. In ex parte
Debs. 158 U. S.. 531. the United States Su
preme Court say: "When there Is an inter
ference, actual or threatened, with property
rishta of a pecuniary nature, U}Â« Jurisdiction
of equity arises, and Is not destroyed by the
fact that such acts are accompanied by, or
are themselves, violations of atrlmlnal law." ;
The courts generally hold that the "boy
cott" is illegal; It has been thus held in Vir
ginia, 84 Va. 927: New Jersey. 63 N. J. Eq.
101; Kansas, S3 Fed. Rep. 912; Michigan, 118
Mich. 497; Massachusetts, 167 Mass. 93; Illi

Fed. Rep. 135.
This action was brought to obtain a perma
nent injunction acainst the defendants, the
Stablemen's Union and ' others, to restrain
them from continuing the "boycott." Upon
filing 1 the complaint a restraining order was
issued enjoining defendants from interfering
with plaintiff's business, from picketing bis
promises and from roolestintr or intimidating
any of his workmen or patrons. Upon the ser
vice of the restrainlnc order the "boycott"
ceased. The cause was tried and submitted
and the facts herein before enumerated wero
proven by overwhelming evidence. There is no
testimony, however, implicating the defend
ants. E. Maza and John Klllian, and as to
those '3Â°fÂ£nt!ants thÂ» action is dismissed.
BOYCOTT IS DEFINED.
In consequence of the boycott plaintiff was
harassed and annoyed, his business was In
jured, he lost several customers, he was un
able to hire out his hacks and road vehicles
for lack of drivers and was compelled to send
twelve of his horses to pasture.
One of the health ordinances of the city for
bids rtable-keepers allowing manure to ac
cumulate upon their premises, and requires its
removal with reasonable^ expedition. When
the plaintiff, in compliance with that law.
Bought to secure men to remove the manure
from his stable, they were dissuaded from
doing fco by the pickets, and it was only under
police protection that plaintiff, after several
days, was enabled to perform a duty Imposed
upon him by law and sanitary considerations.
A dealer in hay who visited plaintiff during
the strike to obtain orders was requested by
corns of the pickets not to sell to the plaintiff:
they suggested to him that If plaintiff could
not procure feed his horses would starve, and
when the dealer refused to consider the in
human proposition he was- threatened that If
he continued to deal with plaintiff he would
be boycotted In his business.
Horses returning to plaintiffs stable were
at times frightened by the crowd which sur
rounded It. and one patron of plaintiff, on that
account, was compelled to enter the etable
from the rear. - Frequently the shouts of the
pickets were boisterous, their manner menacing
and their language opprobrious and threaten
ing. â¢. =
at all, but were boarded and lodged within it.
Subsequently, under the protection of a police
officer, they werfe escorted to and from a
restaurant, but even then they were occasion
ally followed and menaced by the pickets.
Upon one occasion an employe of plaintiff
was attacked by two men and knocked down;
one of his employes was followed to bis home
and struck with a rock, and another was ap
proached by some of the pickets and ursred to
join the union; upon his refusal to do so he
was Informed that he would be "finished."
â¢The provision is special legislation, because.
In matters of "trade dispute." it .- denies to
employers an equitable remedy which, it ac
cords to tho non-employing class; it applies
to â¢ "trade disputes" a-rulÂ« not applicable to
other disputes: one class of property. â¢ and one
of. property owners, under certain conditions
may obtain "eouitable relief, which, under the
same â¢ conditions, this act . denies to another
class of property '. and property owners. The
owner of real estate is entitled to an injunc
tion acainst a. trespasser whose acts threaten
bis possession; but. under this legislation, the
man who own a business, under like condi
tions, is denied liko relief.
The ' provision ia special * legislation because
"Keep the word of promise to our ear.
And break it to our hepe."
But such - a reproach does not reet upon
the law; for it in one of its oldest -and best
maxims that. "Where there is a wren?, there
is a remedy." Hence when a property right
is violated, and the common' law affords ths
Injured party ' no ' remedy, equity will inter
vene to redress the wrong. To deny the
plaintiff - equitable relief for the Invasion of
his , rights of property Is " to deny him due
process of ,law and to violate a fundamental
principle of the Constitution of the State;
for a right without a remedy Is no right
at all.
Second. The ' provision In question \m special
legislation. Inasmuch as it is not of uniform
operation: under it lit! rants do not stand
equal before the law. While It is true that
class legislation is. in the nature of things,
sometimes proper, yet such classification must
be founded upon differences, either defined
in the Constitution or natural in themselves
or which suggest a .reason which might nat
urally be held to justify a diversity of liti
gation. - â¢ , . .
Â¦ In Johnson vs. Goodyear Co.. 127 Cal. 7.
the Legislature attempted to confer upon the
employes of a -corporation certain legal rights,
which other employes did net possess; and
the law, upon that account, was held uncon
stitutional. ~*Â»MinBPi n^saBfjBie
In 127 Cal. 13. tho Supreme Court quotes
with approval the following extract from
State vs. Goodwill. 53 W. Va. 179: "The
property which every man has In his own
labor, as it is the original foundation of all
othÂ»r property. Â«o it Is the most sacred and
inviolate." Hence no syndicate of employers.
or union of employes, can bar one of the right
to labor, for â¢ the rlsht to labor Is the right
to live; but how can it be said that a right
is inviolate If. when violated, the law affords
no redress?-. For the law to declare a right,
and then deny it all means of enforcement,
would be to
LABOR IS MOST SACRED.
But. aside from these considerations. I am
of opinion that the act In question, la so far
as It attempts to deprive courts of equity of
the power to issue injunction*. In cases of
"trade disputes," Is unconstitutional, for ths
following reasons:
First. It violates that provision of our
State constitution which declares that ""all
men have certain Inalienable rights, among
which are these of enjoying and defending
life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and
protecting property." This provision is con
tained in the Declaration of Rights, and It
forever safeguards the rights of persons and
the rights of property. Freedom ts of the
spirit and essence of the Constitution; but
freedom' thus guaranteed to the citizen no
more implies a license in one man or in any
combination of men to harass or injure an
other in the pursuit of his lawful business.
than it Implies a license to deprive him cf
his personal liberty. The Constitution alike
protects natural freedom and industrial free
dom.
If the right of property Is Inalienable, the
right of labor is Inviolate. In Billings vs.
Hall, 7 Cal. 7, the Supremo Court of this
State, commenting upon the constitutional
provision In question, refers to it as "one of
the fundamental principles of enlightened gov
ernment, without a rigorous observance of
which there could be neither liberty nor safety
to the citizen. If one of the primary objects
of government is to enable the citizen to ac
quire, possess and defend property, how can
it be impaired by legislation r* The right
to labor is a right cf property, and the duty
to protect it Is the highest office of our
laws.
to enforce the authority of the union, aad to
dictate to plaintiff whom he should, and whom
he should not. employ. That ths plaintiff
was Injured In his property rights cannot be
gainsaid; that the acts of defendants. If con
tinued, would have ultimately destroyed his
business, ia admitted. If defendant's acts were
unlawful, the law presumes that their Intent
was unlawful; and ths act ef 1903 could not
and does not. sanction a combination to ac
complish an unlawful act.
The law defines the word boycott as "an
otgasized attempt to coerce or Intimidate one
Into compliance with a demand by combining
to abstain and compeUing others to abstain
from any business or social relations with
him." Thus defined the evidence herein abtin
dar-tly proves that Munroe accomplished his
purpose of "boycotting" plaintiff.
Daily, for nearly two months, the pickets
visited plaintiff's premises, bearing a banner
denouncing his business as unfair, and con
taining the false statement that he had
"locked out" union men from fats stable.
Every hour of the day. from 7 In the morn
ing until 7 at night, the pickets were shout-
Ins that the stable was unfair; while Munroe,
in the evening, when the concourse of people
walking or riding home in the cars en Market
street was the greatest, loudly called their
attention to the stable and . bade them "Loot
at this stable! The only- unfair stable oi
Market street; the stable that always was anc
always will be unfair."
Upon occasions bo and other members of
tho pickets called the plaintiff and bis em
ployes "scabs" and his stable a "scab stable.".
Occasionally some of the pickets . uttered
threats of violence ajcainst plaintiff and some
of bis men. The non-union employes of plain
tiff were finally compelled to enter and leave
the stable through the rear, but for several
fiayo after the etrike they dared not leave it
METHODS OF STRIKERS.
The presence of so large a body of men,
their marching, their banners and their out
cries, served to attract the attention - and
presence of a large concourse of people, so that
travel upon the street in front of the stable
was congested; to the extent that, upon'.oc
casions, police Interference was necessary to
clear both sidewalk and street.
Ore Munroe was appointed by the union
captain of the pickets; with full authority to
order, direct and control their action. Ha
testified that his business v.hs to see that
the men acted "within the law," but the union
left it to him to determine what conduct,
upon their part.--would be "within the law."
He admitted that be was the agent of the
union and that, as such, he considered It his
duty to "put pressure or rorce" upon plaintiff.
He claimed that the union had the right to
take "boycotting measures" against the plaint
iff and that he acted accordingly.
The following day three or four pickets ap
peared and patrolled the premises, and within
a week thereafter the number of pickets grad
ually increased, until upon some- occasions
there were as many as fifty men.
Concurrently with the strike In plaintiffs
stable the union employes In some thirty-six
other stables in this city went out and were
thereupon assigned to picket duty at. those
stables. Daily, between 6 and 7 o'clock in
the evening and when patrons of plaintiff,
with their horses and vehicles, were returning
to the stable, there were never less than
thirty and frequently from forty to fifty pick
ets, bearing one or more of the banners re
ferred to and .marching in front of plaintiff's
stable In an elliptical formation, their line
extending nearly fifty feet and completely
blocking the entrance thereof. While the
pickets were thus marching one or more of
them was continuously shouting. "Unfair
stable!"
The plaintiff declined to do so; whereupon
the walking delegate interviewed' all of the
union employes of plaintiff and they thereupon
ceased work acd left his employment. Shortly
thereafter two pickets from the union arrived
and commenced to march up and down in
front of the stable entrance; one of them
carrying a banner bearing the words, "Unfair
stable! Union men locked out and non-union
men put in'."
- About 7 o'clock on the morning of that
day the plaintiff was visited by a walking
delegate of the defendant's union, who re
quested him to discharge the non-union man
then in his employ and substitute Â¦ a union
man in his etead.
On the 22d day of April, 1904. the plaintiff,
Pierce, was the owner of an interest in the
>evada Livery Stables; on that date he em
ployed ten men, all of whom, eave one, be
longed to the defendant, tho Stablemen's
Lnlon, which union was composed of corns
600 members. At that time the relations be
tween the plaintiff and his men were har
monious; the latter were working upon the
schedule, during the hours. - for the wages,
and under the conditions prescribed by their
union.
on the side of the stable owner. The
union produced no witnesses. The ar
guments were made by Maguire . and
Van Xess and the case was submitted.
Judge Hunt's opinion, rendered yester
day, follows:
CASE IS EXPLAINED.
But if the act done be unlawful, and dam
age ia occasioned thereby, it avails nothing,
under the common law, whether the wrong
ful act was done by. one or by many in com
bination; in either event, the law awards re
dress against on?-, and all, â¢ of the offenders.
But, . in my . opinion, it Is not trua, at least
in a civil sense, that what one may do, many
may : do. , The ' law recognizes tho potency of
numbers; It is numbers which Is an insepar
able element in conspiracy, combinations or
unlawful assemblies. â¢ The threat which, if
uttered by one, might be innocuous, if uttered
by many, may well serve to intimidate. In
this case a single picket, marching in . front
of plaintiffs premises, could not be regarded
as an ' obstruction to the street, nor could he
amount to an "unlawful assembly": but, when
a band of fifty pickets, marched in a circle,
and obstructed the plaintiff in the free use
of his property, they became and were a nui
sance, and were guilty of a misdemeanor. Â¦
' The plaintiff employed but ten men, at the
time : of the strike, -. and yet several hundred
union men participated in the acts complained
of. It cannot be assumed that this aggrega
tion were seekins to, obtain the places which
plaintiff's union men voluntarily abandoned;
on the contrary, tfceir purpose was avowedly
-That act. In some of its features. Is liter
ally taken from the English statute of 1S72,
which regulated criminal conspiracies. Both
the English statute, and the above act. pro
vide that no atn-eement. contract or combi
nation, by two or more persons, to do. or to
procure to be done, an act In contemplation
or furtherance of a trade dispute between an
employer and an employee, . shall b# criminal;
nor shall those engaged therein be indictable
or punishable for the crime of conspiracy. If
; such act, committed by one person, would not
be punishable as a crime. Then follows a
provision, in the act of this State, not con
; talned in the : English statute, to the effect
that such combination shall not be considered
as In restraint of trade: "nor shall any re
straining order or injunction be issued in re
lation thereto: provided, that nothing In this
act shall be construed to authorize force or
violence or threats thereof." - -
In this case, the proofs, as we have seen,
abundantly show threats, force and violence :
nevertheless, "defendant's counsel contends that
a court of â¢ equity is prohibited from issuing
Injunctions in cases of . "trade disputes" be
tween employer and employe; and that the
legislative declaration against threats, force
or violence Is applicable only to the subject
of conspiracies: and that no matter what
force or intimidation "is practiced upon the
employer, by the employe, tn a trade dispute"
equity, is powerless to relieve by injunction.
Plaintiffs counsel contends that, if the act
of 1903 admits of such a construction, it Is
unconstitutional.
* It- is to be observed that the act in question
is In the nature of criminal legislation; it re-
I lates to conspiracies as crimes, and attempts
) to exempt certain conspiracies from the opera
tion of a pepal statute. It declares, for in
stance; that an act which is not a crime, when
committed by one, ia not criminal when com
mitted by many.
Now an act may be unlawful without being
a crime, for one is a private Injury, ihe other
a public â¢ffensc
MANY CANNOT EXCUSE WRONG.
Xow, It Is a cardinal rule of equity juris
prudence that, ' where injury to property Is
threatened by the acts of parties who are un
able to respond In damages, or where the re
dress of an Injury will occasion a multiplicity
of suits, or where the damage resulting Is
irreparable, a court of equity will furnish the
Injured party the only remedy that can avail
him, "to wit, the remedy of injunction.
Hence it follows that the pivotal question
in the case is this: Is the plaintiff entitled to
an injunction? Defendant's counsel claims
that he is not so entitled; that, even- If the
defendants cannot respond In damages, even
If the injury done, or threatened to be done,
was, or is. Irreparable In its nature, even if
a multiplicity of suits would be occasioned,
and even If the pecuniary damage sustained
by plaintiff would be difficult of ascertain
ment, still a court of equity cannot enjoin the
acts complained of because an act of the
Legislature of this State passed March 20. 1903.
forbids it from doing so. (See Statutes 1903, p.
289.)
REMEDY OF INJUNCTION.
in the proceedings to a less obnoxious degree
than others, some were present of tener than
others, some employed opprobrious epithets ana
others did not. But. even if the participants
were known. It would be difficult to prove the
amount of damage- which ths act of each in
dividual occasioned: or. If that were deter
mined, it would still bÂ« necessary to commence
several hundred suits and engage in a litiga
tion which, in any 'event, would be barren of
financial results, in consequence of the lm
pecuniosity of the parties. It must be appar
ent, therefore, that an action for damage*
would afford plaintiff no remedy.
When the case was heard evidence
was submitted, largely the testimony
of strikers that had been summoned,
In June Judge Hunt issued a tem
porary restraining order against the
stablemen that were boycotting Pierce's
stable and committing various acts
tending to injure his business. When
the hearing came up on a motion to
dissolve the injunction it was agreed
between James G. Maguire, attorney
for the union, and T. C. Van Ness, at
torney for the stable owner, that the
case should be tried on Its merits and
should be a test case of the right of un
ions to boycott and commit other acts
against a'lsusiness without fear of in
junction from a court of equity. The
statute upon which the union relied fol
lows:
Section L. No agreement, combination, or
contract, by or between two or more persons
to do nr procure to be done, or not to do or
procure not to be done, any act In contempla
tion cr furtherance of any trade dispute be
tween employers and employes In the State of
California shall be deemed criminal, nor ehall
those eneased therein be Indictable .' or other
wise punishable for the crime of conspiracy.
If such act committed by one person would
not be punishable as a crime. , nor shall such,
agreement, combination cr contract be con
sidered as In restraint of trade or commerce,
nor shall any restraining order or injunction
be issued with . relation thereto. Nothing' In
this act Ehall exempt from punishment, other
wise than is herein excepted, any persons

is now provided by any act of the Legislature,
but such acts of the Legislature shall, as to
the agreements, combinations and. contracts
hereinbefore referred to, be construed aa if this
act were therein contained; provided, that
nothing la this act will be construed to author
lzÂ» fore* or - violence, or threats thereof.
STABLEMEN RESTRAINED.
Judge Hunt's opinion will serve to
clarify the local atmosphere, which has
long been clouded by controversy be
tween employer and employe. His order
Is the most sweeping ever issued by a
Western court against the common
practices of unionism. In view of the
fact, however, that the constitution
ality of a statute upon which the un
ions based their right to boycott and
make the same effective is ruled
against, the case will not rest on Judge
Hunt's decision. It will be carried at
once to the Supreme Court by the de
feated organization. This fact was an
nounced in Judge Hunt's courtroom
yesterday morning by C. P. Munroe,
captain of the stablemen's pickets,
who was present to hear the reading of
the decision.
Judge John Hunt of the Superior
Court handed down a decision yester
day which, in its effect upon Industrial
affairs, is tho most important ever ren
dered on the Paclflo Coast This deci
sion was reached in the case of E. G.
Pierce, proprietor of the Nevada sta
bles, supported by the Citizens' Al
liance, against Stablemen's Union, Lo
cal No. 8760.
This suit had as Its purpose the quiet
ing of the striking stablemen that
harassed, threatened and terrorized the
non-union men employed by the stable
owners In place of union men who re
fused to work when demands mads by
them were rejected as unreasonable. In
the prayer of his complaint Pierce de
manded that an injunction issue per
petually restraining the defendant un
ion from interfering with his business
in any way, from picketing his prem
ises and from molesting or intimidatng
his workmen and patrons. His prayer
has been granted by Judge Hunt, and
In language that is plain and supported
by higher authority the court reaffirms
the principle that the light to labor Is
natural and inalieniable.
Judge Hunt Declares Statute Divesting tribunals of k Right to Inter
fere in Industrial Strife Unconstitutional and Void. -
For each and all ot the- reasons herein be
fore stated. I am of the opinion that, in so far
as the legislative act in. question attempts t>
deprive a court of equity of the power to
issue injunctions in cases of this character,
l; Is unconstitutional and vc'.d.
The .defendants wieretn rely entirely upon
the constitutionality of the legislative provi
sion In question. As I cannot sustain their
contention in that regard. It follows that. In
consonance with the views herein expressed,
s decree should be entered In favor of plain
tiff as prayed for. Â¦ It U accordingly adjudged
that plaintiff fs entitled to a final decree of
injunction against the remaining defendants.
In substantial accord with the restraining or
der previously granted herrtn and counsel will
prepare a decree accordingly.
thff" constitution Is not a risht which haj
ceased to exist; nor have the cases in which
an injunction ts necessary in order to pre
vent a multiplicity of actions ceased to be
ca-vj of equitable cognisance.
It is undoubtedly true that the Legislature.
an wts held in these cases, may alter, or
regulate, remedies and procedure, legal or
equitable, but it cannot destroy & substan
tive remedy, nor can it defeat the enforce-'
meat of a constitutional right by depriving
the injured party of the only remedy that the
law -can award for Its violation. This caao
Is manifestly one of equitable cognizance, for
the reasons already stated; and. In 24th Cal.
409, the i Supreme Court declared that that.
"In nAtters of equitable cognizance powers
grawf?a by the constitution, cannot be takea
away by legal enactment."
Defendant's counsel upon this point relies
upon the Wright case, 139 Cat. 474 and thÂ«
Spreckels case 117 Cal. S77. In each of those
cases one court sought to enjoin judicial pro
ceedings In another court and. la each In
stance, It was held that the court was pow
erless to make such an order. In the Wright
cass the court held that the Legislature may
restrain the judicial power to enjoin, "when.;
by statutory changes, some right ceases to
exist and In cases of equitable cccrnizancr
which no longer arise." This cas* does not
fall within either of the above classes. Ths

If the acts herein complained of were coas

EFFECTON INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS FAR REACHING
A PERMANENT injunction was granted yesterday by Judge John Hunt restraining the Stablemen's Union from further
effort to make effective, by means of threats, intimidation and the use of "pickets," a boycott declared against the Nevada
Stables. In its effect upon industrial conditions no more sweeping decision has been rendered on the Pacific Coast. The Judge's
opinion enters exhaustively into the right of organizations to boycott, and points to the long line of authorities that declare
the boycott illegal. Continuing, the decision divests the union of its one remaining defenseâ the act of 1903, which was passed
at the demand of the labor leaders, and which prohibits courts ot equity from interfering by injunction to restrain combinations
of men in trade disputes from committing acts which, if done by one person, would rtot be criminal. This statute, the court
holds, is class legislation and unconstitutional. This decision, if upheld by the Supreme Court, will go far toward preventing
scenes of violence during strikes.

signs in front of the place where a man is conducting a business
that is honest and to the interest of the public. . Through the de
cision competent men who refuse to pay the toll exacted by labor
unions for the privilege of working for their living are given the
protection of the law. Employers are equally protected in so far as
they are privileged to hire such men as can perform their duties. I
do not believe that the State Supreme Court will reverse Judge
Hunt* s decision." â T. C. Van Ness, counsel for the Stable-Owners'
Association.
I i I REGARD it as the greatest legal victory over unjust condi
Â¦ tions that has ever occurred in the United States. It is a
f'f I DO not question the abstract principles of individual liberty,
Â¦ justice and equality before the law to which he refers as the
basis of his conclusions and judgment ; but I do not think
that he' has satisfactorily disposed of the act of the Legislature for
bidding the issuance of injunctions in such cases. If the testimony
of certain witnesses of the plaintiff was true it showed that crimes
had been committed by individuals which should be punished ac
cording to the provisions- of the penal statutes, and an injunction
should not be issued to restrain the commission of crimes. The de
fendants are anxious to have the constitutionality of tha^ statute
finally and conclusively determined, and I believe that members ot
labor unions generally share that desire. I am of the opinion that
the matter will not be permitted to rest on the opinion of Judge
Hunt, but that an appeal will be taken to the Supreme Court" â
J. G. Maguire, counsel for the Stablemen's Union.

Yesterday .it was three,- and _ they all
went ' skiihrf\irig to the "outfieldâ all
clean drives, .with no chance for a fluke.
Poor old Otto Young _y as brought out
of obscurity by Peter Lohman and told
to do the "best he could on the. slab.
But the ancient star was not' thera. He
could, not discern the homo, plat", and
after filling up the bags with passes in
the opeturi.8${ round he was shorn of ?.!ie
pitcher's ;honors and Moskiman came
out to .wprk,- An infield out gave San
Francisco Che -for a starter in that in
ning. ... . .
For a while Oakland : played pretty
fair ball in the field, and Moskiman
had an assortment which puzzled. He
succeeded in getting out of a couple of
pretty bad holes, and was holding the
home sluggers where they belonged till
the panic came upon him with all its
fury in the seventh.
Whalen opened it with a drive to cen
ter and-Waldrpn beat a bunt. Hilde
brand laid down a sacrifice and Meany
placed a "Texas leaguer" over Me-
Kune'e topknot that brought in Wha
len. Cy Townsend responded with a
double to deep center and Waldron
skipped to the pan. Irwin joined in the
rally, and so did Anderson. San Fran
cisco emerged four more to the good,
and it was all over then for fair. ' '
Oakland, as usual, had all kinds of
chances to make ! runs,. but they tossed
each one away Just as. they have been
doing all week. No one could hit at the
right time, and no one seemed to care
-much whether he did bit or not. Twice
Streib could have brought" two in,, but
he was ,not there. Devereaux did the
best work, getting three safe ones and
stealing aa many bases.
Kruger executed' a catch that' will
outshine all the other ones. In the
ninth he ran to the jscore board . after
a drive from Townsend's bat and
copped it with one mitt, doubling up
HUdebrand at first. base. He caught the
ball on the dead run ' as it was about
to. strike . the ground,- -and made the
wonderful play without- an effort. The

Special.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SARATOGA, N. Y., Aug. 6.â In the
presence of the largest crowd ever seen
at the Saratoga race course the far
famed colors of James R. Keene,
equally as well known In Europe as In
America, were borne to the front to-day
â¢In the two most valuable prizes of the
meeting by Delhi winning the Great Re
public etakee, first money for which
was J42.000. and Sysonby winning the
Saratoga Special, valued at $14,000.
The two stakes therefore yielded Mr.
Keene $56,000. which, added to his pre
vious winnings this season, makes the
Keen** stable much the heaviest winner
of the year, a total of about $135,000
standing to his credit. It was not the
first $50,000 stake won In his career by
Mr. Keene, as his horse Disguise II
von a race of that value In England
several years ago. Mr. Keene was
freely congratulated by scores of gen
tlemen in the clubhouse and paddock.
There is no doubt but that the success
of his horse has greatlv cheered the
veteran financier, who has been an al
most daily attendant at the races since
the beginning of the season.
Delhi had little difficulty in winning
bis race. He Jumped out in front at the
start and cut out a hot pace the full
distance. Passing the grandstand the
first Unffe Waterboy was in second
place, but he began to fall back soon
after and was never a factor. Mercury
was a good second most of the way.
.The Picket finished strongly In third
"position, a length behind Mercury,
Â¦which finished second by a length. The
Duryea entry, Aceful and Mercury,
coupled In the betting, was first choice.
Sysonby was so well thought of that
the price against him remained 1 to 20
throughout. Summary:

CHICAGO. Aug. 6.â Mabel Richard
son, an added starter, at as good as 40
to 1 in the betting, almost threw the
crowd at Harlem into spasms to-day
by winning the Maywood handicap by
a head from Gregor K, with Miss
Crawford third and the great filly To~
kalon, badly beaten, fifth. The May
wood was the feature race of a good
Saturday programme, six horses start-
Ing. Alma Dufour and Mabel Rich
ardson were added at the last moment.
Tokalon, of course, was an odds-on fa
vorite, 7 to 20 being the best price of
fered by the bookmakers.
Miss Crawford and Beau Ormonde
were the best liked of the others, each
going to the post at 8 to 1. Starter
Dick Dwyer got them away to a good
break, with Tokalon first to show in
front. She apparently was not at her
best, and instead of opening up her
usual gap merely led her field by a
margin of two lengths to the stretch,
where Miss Crawford and Gregor K
moved up like a team and challenged
her. The moment they drew alongside
the favorite she quit to a walk and fell
back beaten. Mabel Richardson, which
had been outrun in the early part of
the race, then came with a furious
rush and' nailed Gregor K right at the
wire.
It was a pretty finish that brought
the big crowd to Its feet. The time,
1:44 4-5, was within one-nfth of a sec
ond of the track record for the dis
tance. . â¢ Â¦'.
There was considerable gossip after
the race relative. to.; Mabel Richard
son's startling improvement. Just
twenty-four hours before, when at 1 to
2 In the betting, she was badly beaten
by a field of Inferior horses.
Flaxman was the only favorite to
win.
Sam and Ed. Wagner, respectively
president and manager of the "Worth
Jockey Club, had a great day. They
are reported to have cleaned up In the

HARBIN SPRINGS, Aug. 6. â There
have been strong men since the days
of the redoubtable Hercules of ancient
myth, but Jim Jeffries gave an ex
hibition of physical prowess Thursday
evening that makes the cleaning of
the Augean stables look like a Mon
day morning washing.
Mine host Jim Hays had a three
year-old steer that was down on the
card for a killing and a butcher from
MIddletown was on his way to pull off
the event. Jeff heard of the matter
and with several friends" determined
to dispose of the beef before the ar
rival of , the MIddletown expert.
Jeff took a shot with his j trusty
rifle and the steer's lamp went out.
A block and tackle was made fast to
the limb of a tree Â¦ and -:the beef was
hoisted off the ground to be dressed.
After this operation had been per
formed Jeff's startling demonstration
of strength occurred. Getting a firm
hold of the carcass without any ap
parent effort he lifted it into a wait
ing wagon. The beef when cut up
and weighed In the kitchen scaled 510
Â¦ pounds.
Jeff continues his road and â¢ gym
nasium work daily and is In great
form. He "will not allow. any one'to
know his Â¦ weight and when brother

Justice Brewer is from Kansas, and
his State is Justifiably proud of him.
Soon after his elevation to the Supremo
bench a cigar manufacturer In Topeka
dedicated a ten-cent "domestic" cigar
to the Jurist, named It "Our Justice."
and on the cover of each box pasted a
portrait of Mr. Brewer.
A few years ago the Justice was la
Topeka on a business trip. The hotel
clerk recognized him, and the negro
bellboy, although he had no Idea who
the newcomer was, knew from the way
he was ordered about that the patron
was of some consequence. Going Â«p Jn
the elevator the negro stared constant
ly at the tall, dignified man.
Suddenly the black face was wreath
ed In smiles, and the boy said:.
" 'Scuse me. boss, but ain't you ds
gemmen dat invented dem 'Ouah Jus
tice* cigars?" Â£j
â¢This reminds one of the man who
was recalling famous persons who
"parted their names In the middle.**

At an old horseshoe nailed on the
wall near his bed the dead eyes of
Adrien Portal were staring yesterday
afternoon when the landlord of 131 1
Stockton street entered the window by
the fire-escape and found the room
filled with the fumes of illuminating
gas. The suicide had worked for per
haps an hour to render the room gas
tight before he lay down on the bed to
die. " ,
Early in the forenoon Jennie Angos
turas, a chambermaid, had met him
coming upstairs from the street with
an armful of laths. Three of these
laths were used to keep in place Por
tal's vest, with which he had plugged
up a. hole in the ceiling. There was a
large crack in the door, and this was
stuffed with Portal's trousers, also kept'
in place with laths. Another crack in
the door was plugged with rags held
by thw remaining laths.
On Monday last Portal- borrowed a
dollar from Philippe Maysonnade, the
landlord, and when his coat pockets
were turned out yesterday by Deputy
Coroner Michael Brown a small bottle
full of laudanum was found. None of
the contents had been swallowed.
Portal was a gardener, 56 years old,
and came from Lesbessons, France.

lifter -Alameda. Captain Dowdell, sailed
5*eÂ«taxtÂ»y "for Honolulu. Among the
piumeutgeni was Alexander Craw, for
mer" jftiuruntine inspector at this port
for ttie State and Federal Horticul
1 ura/ -'department*-". Craw's splendid
v(;r|;-.:ii this port attracted the at
r^ntityi of the Territorial government
and Jif jroes to Hawaii at a. salary
twice, .;<s .large as his services here
parm$ him.
?Governor Carter, who also sailed
veMerViay for Honolulu, but on the
Pa. '13 : :MfÂ«il linÂ«?r China, said that al
thoujsb ('raw's salary might seem
prinraly in view of the island gov
cvnrrr*?nt"s present policy of retrench
rnent." it was felt that services such
as Crsvv had rendered here were cheap
af-ariy price and paÂ«t experience had
tcld'-the Hawaiians that the largest
Â«?;lary la -s-mall compared with the
pnft/eetioti of :Â»n effective quarantine
against harmful parasites.
Cra^v Iraves behind him a whole
dtS fnll .'.'f friends, who are as sorry
to lo?e him as they are pleased that
â¢his worth has received substantial
recognition.

PROF. LOEB
IS OUTDONc
His Discovery That "Electricity Is the Basis of Life" Is Not
\ New. Dr. McLaughlin Claims It In Books Written Five
Years Ago He Offers Proof of the Influence of Electricity
Upon Human Vitality. Old age Can Be Defied. By Dr.
McLaughlin's Method Electricity May Be Used to Renew
Youth and Protect the Body From Disease. Note the
Comparison Between Prof. Loeb's New Theories and Dr.
Mclaughlin's Old Ones.
Prof. Locb of California University some time ago announced that he had
discovered that electricity was the basis of life.
He said that the motion of the heart was due, not to the heat, but to the
electricity in the body.
"A part of the chemical energy of food stuffs Is transformed into electri-
cal energy, which in turn gives energy to the muscles and organs of the
body." . .. â¢ ; , ~-~"
The announcement that electricity and not heat is the life is the climax of
Prof. Loeb's experiments, which have extended over ten years.
These results, he says, are going to upset most of the teachings of the text
books of physiology â that is. they are going to expose the fallacy of medicine
as it is administered by the regular physician of to-day.

Effect of Dr. McLaughlin's Treatment Upon Men
This is all in line with Dr. ?.icLaughlrri"s . teachings, which have been in
print for the past ten years. I>r. .McLaughlin has been a student of this sub-
ject for five years, and has made his observations frpm cases under personal
treatment.
In his book, written live years ago (in his introductory remarks^, he says:
"I anticipate still greater results from my efforts to demonstrate the truth
of my life-long claim that electricity is the basis of all animal vitality, and
without it we could not live." - ...
In another part of his book Dr. McLaughlin gives a. more comprehensive
solution of tlio heat problem than that advanced by Prof. Loeb. Dr. Mc-
LauirhliiT says: . '
"Tho food that wf> cat is treated rs fuel by the .stomach, just as is the coal
in h furnace. TIip chemical action which is produced upon the food by the
acids and julcea of the stomach burns the food and causes u carbonic heat.
This heat is electricity, and it Is forced into the nerves and vital organs and
is their life." Â«
Further. Dr. McLaughlin says: "Tho electrical heat generated t>y the con-
sumption of our food should keep healthy every vital organ of the body. De-
bility of the vital organs arises when the waste is greater than the repair â
wlien the stomach is not able to generate sufficient electrical heat to supply
thc demands of nature.
"This excessive waste is dur to overtaxation of the vital fa/c^s by hard
work mentally, grirf or worry, extra physical exertion, severe fevers, such
as typhoid or malaria, which drain away the vitality and leave the system
debilitated."
Now. here Is where Dr. MoUMiiyhliii passes beyond t^ie period i-overed by
Prof. Loeb and shows how this vital electricity, which is the basis of life,
may be replaced in the body when lost by the causes producing debility.
]if says: "When the stomach is not able to generate sufficient of this en-
. orgy to supply the demands of the vital organs, the natural result is a lower-
inp of. nerve, orprrnic Â«n<l muscular power â a general debility. Then an arti-
ficial anent must be used to assist the stomach- That agent Is the Dr. Jk-
LaujjhUn's Electric Belt."--
The human body charged with this electrical force is proof against the
debility usually foreshadowing the decay of old age. There can be no decay
where "there Is sufficient force to keep the heart and vital organs active, and
under Dr. McLaughlin's treatment men of 75 and 85 years" have found a new
lease of life.
An old man who bad been wearing u Dr. McLaughlin Belt every night for
two months vrrote: "While my age Is seventy years. I have become as youth-
ful in health :<!Â¦= a man of 35, and am ablu to do as much work. I am really
an old man made young."
Men and women who had been rheumatic -rripples for years, and whose
cases had defied the best doctors, have secured perfect health from Dr. Mc-
Laughlin's Belt. . * ' Â»
Dr. McLaughlin "has not only proven that electricity is the substance of
life and organic vitality., but has gone so far as to perfect the best known
means of replenishing that force in the body when it is lost. Ills Electric
Belt is the natural result of scientific study, coupled with experience and me-
chanical skill. ,
The current supplied by this appliance enters the body in a glowing stream
of vitalizing heat, so gentle that the nerves and vital organs absorb it as free-
ly ms a hungry babe brinks milk. This forco is added to the natural powers
generated by the stomach: it saturates every vital part and soon transforms
the debilitated IkmI*' into a natural storage battery, which generates its own
health and closes the doors forever to disease and debility.
Dr. McLaughlin's book is published for free distribution to those inter-
ested in the development of vigorous health in men and women. It is pro-
fusely illustrated and describes his method of treatment and appliances. Sent
sealed? free, on request.-, Send for it to-day, inclosing this ad.

The country is never more alluring
than now in the early fall. The hotels
are not overcrowded, the chairs on the
porches are not pre-empted and there
are no relays .in the dining-roomâ all
of which is greatly to be welcomed
to him who was jostled about in' the
busy July days.
For rest and quiet, likewise for
pleasure, now Is the time to take to
the woods. Following are recent ar

A curious character came up recently
for trial In Paris in the person of Au
guste Baumann, charged with the at
tempted murder of Abbe Lebel in No
vember last. Baumann's own descrip
tion of himself is as follows: "I am
not an anarchist, I am a 'revolte,' an
independent; I support no prticular
theory. I have no grudge against Abbe
Lebel, but I am opposed on principle to
all priests,, soldiers, magistrates and
professors. Desirous of ending my life,
I have given myself up as a prisoner
and demand to be. sent o the guillo
tine." The court could not quite see its
way to grant this request, but'awarded
the prisoner fifteen years' penal s.ervi
tude, with ten yeaYs' exile to, follow.â

OAKLAND, Aug.. 6.â W. F. Den
ning, former manager here for the
Singer Sewing Machine Company, is
charged with having embezzled $2000
of the company's funds. He was ar
rested at Sacramento to-day and
brought to Oakland this evening by
Constable Hempstead. He had been
out camping with his two children, a
girl 14 years of age and a boy 12.
Several days ago he was arrested for
trespass. He did not understand .what
the charge was and asked if it was
for some trouble he was in at Oak
land. The Sacramento County au
thorities immediately got into com
munication with the police here and
his identity was discovered.
An affecting scene took place be
tween the father and the children
when they were separated. The Sac
ramento County officers promised to
take good care of the children.
Denning claims that he is not an
embezzler. He says that the missing
money -was lost through poor man
agement. He was broken in health,
he says, and took his children out
into the country to recuperate.

Undoubtedly the most marvelous trea
In the world grows in Brazil. It is tha

fibers, which acquire a beautiful luster
and serve also foe joists, rafters and
other building materials, as well as for
stakes for fences.
From parts of the tree wines and
vinegars are made. It yields also a sac
charine substance, as well as a starch
resembling sago. Its fruit is used for
feeding cattle. The pulj> has an agree
able taste, and the nut, which is ole
aginous and ' emulsive. Is sometimes
used as a substitute for coffee. Of the
wood of the stem musical Instruments.
water tubes and pumps are made. The
pith is an excellent substitute for cork.
From the stem a white liquid similar to
the milk of the cocoanut and a flour re
sembling maizena may be extracted.
Of the straw, hats, baskets, brooms
and mats are made. A considerable
quantity of this straw is shipped to Eu

As a result of requests for informa
tion from all over the country the Cen
sus Office lately issued a bulletin on
"Negroes In the United States," con
taining statistics with regard to the
extent, character and condition of the
negro population in the several States
pf ttie Union. The summary of the re
sults given in the bulletin is in part as
folBpvs:
'The number of negroes in the United
States (including: Alaska, . Hawaii and
Porto Rico) is 9,200,000â perhaps a
larger number than is found in any
other country outside of Africa. Near
ly nine-tenths of the negroes in conti
nental United States are found in the
Southern, States. The largest number
of negroes living in compact masses are
found in certain urban counties, sev
eral of which -lie outside of the great
cotton growing States. The four, each
having over 75,000, are the District of
Columbia; Shelby County, Tennessee,
containing Memphis; Baltimore City,
Md., and Orleans Parish, La., coexten
sive with New Orleans.
15 TO }.
"The district in which the propor
tion of negroes is greatest lies in the
Mississippi alluvial region along both
banks of the Lower Mississippi, where
five-eighths of the population is ne
gro, the maximum being in Issa
quena County, .Miss., with more than
fifteen negroes to each white person.
The center of the negro population is
in De Kalb County, Alabama, about
four miles from the western boundary
of Georgia and thirty-three miles
south of the southern boundary of
Tennessee.
"In the country districts as a whole
the negro males outnumber the negro
females slightly, and in the cities the
females outnumber the males decided
ly. This disassoclation of the sexes
between city and country is far more
marked among negroes than among
whites and has increased since 1890.
MANY ILLITERATES.
"Among negroes 44.5 per cent are il
literate. The percentage of Illiteracy
has decreased rapidly since 1S90, when
it was about seven times as common
as among whites, and this ratio be
tween the races has not altered ma
terially in the last ten years. Illiteracy
among Southern negroes is about four
times that among Southern whites. If
the percentage of illiterates should fall
in each succeeding ten years bv as
great an amount as it did between
1890 and 1900, an Improbable assump
tion, it would reach zero about 1940.
"There was a decided increase be
tween 1S90 and 1900 in the proportion
of marriages among young negroes.
This" increase of early marriages was
yet more j marked among Southern
whites of both sexes, and was prob
ably due to the great prosperity of the
country just before 1900.
'There are nearly 4,000,000 negroes in
the United States engaged in gainful
occupations. These persons, who may
be called breadwinners, constitute 45.2
per cent of the total negro population,

WELL ATTENDED RECEPTION
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Aug. 6.
An understanding has been arrived
at between Jack London, novelist and
newspaper man, and his wife, who is
suing him for a divorce. ,Mrs. London
to-day dismissed her original action
and instituted a second, alleging sim
ple desertion as the ground for her
complaint. The name of Anna Strun
sky is not mentioned in the second
complaint, which also omits the
charges of a gross character original
ly made against the husband. The first
complaint laid most of the unhappi
ness complained of to the door of Miss
Strunsky. None of these changes will
now have to be answered or tacitly
acknowledged as true if the case were
allowed to go by default.
Two weeks ago the Injunction pro
hibiting London from drawing any
money from publishing houses or
newspapers was removed. At that
time it was announced to Judge W. E.
Greene that an amicable settlement as
regards the property interests of the
pair had been arrived at. It is due to
this settlement that the change of
grounds upon which a divorce is to be
asked has been made.
By the filing of a new complaint,
however, notice is given that no com
promise is looked for and that the
Londons have simply agreed upon the
ground on which a divorce shall be
granted.â They have been separated
for the statutory period of a year and
this gives Mrs. London a choice as to
the reasons to be assigned for her pe
tition.

UNIVERSITY EVENTS
BERKELET, Aug. 6.â Librarian J. C.
Rowell haÂ» under consideration a plan to close
all the alcoves In the library to free access.
This plan was applied with success last year
to the shelves on the^ lower floor, the result be
ing that less booA were lost than In any pre
vious year. While the number of missing
books is much reduced there is a tendency to
further curtail the privileges of free access so
that the lose may be reduced to a minimum.
Another advantage from this system would be
to prevent the misplacement of books. It will
however, require additional clerical help to
wait upon ail the applicants.

FRESNO, Aug. 6. â The Rev. A. L.
Platt, formerly pastor of the Christian
church at Selma, created v quite a stir
in church circles the early part of this
week by eloping from Santa Cruz with
Mrs. Allie Johnson, a comely widow.
For a year he has labored with the
people of Selma, teaching them the
ways of righteousness, and now that he
himself has fallen the community Is
bitter against him.
Mrs. Johnson and Rev. Mr. Platt be
came very friendly at the church where
he was pastor. In fact it was there he
met her. Friends regarded the friend
ship as nothing put of the ordinary.
Rev. Mr. Platt lately resigned his pas
torate at Selma and went to Santa Cruz
taking his wife with him. He came
back to Selma last week, presumably
on a business trip, but when he left
Mrs. Johnson went with him. She
stated that she was going to visit the
Platts in Santa Cruz. She did visit
them, but not for long. She left to re
turn to her home and Rev. Mr. Platt
went with her as far as San Francisco.
Both have disappeared.

ALAMEDA'S ONLY FIGHT.
The fight is only for the control of
the party machinery, with an eye to
the election twa-years from now. It
is the same old fight that hasV existed
for the last fifteen years in this county.
The people back of the "regular" or
county committee ticket say that the
opposition tickets were put in the fiela
at .the last moment in the hope that
the votes at the Democratic primary
would be so few that they could win
with a small vote on their side. Iti
Berkeley there is some bitterness
against the new move, and the sup
porters of the "regular" ticket assert
that the new movement is in the in
terests of the Contra Costa Water
Company, so that it may control the
municipal light nest spring.
'The opposition tickets are an entire
surprise," said J. J. McDonald to-day.
"There has been no fight against the
regular tickets until Bachrach and
Layman.ce got up these new tickets.
1 have no idea what" the object can be,
and I am quite sure that the San Fran
cisco hsht is not behind the move on
this side of the bay."
Actual fights in the Republican ranks
are few and growing, fewer. The big
contest is between John Mitchell and
George Randolph for the Republican
nomination for Supervisor in the Fifth
District. This fight has become very
bitter, but instead of being upon old
factional lines men are fighting slda
by side who have been formerly polit
ical enemies. Behind Mitchell are
Charles E. Snook, Charles H. Spear,
chairman of the San Francisco Harboi
Commissioners; George W. Reed, Guy
C. Earl, City Auditor A. H. Breed and
others. Behind Randolph are State
Senator C#. R. Lukens, J. Cal Ewing,
secretary of the State Bank Commia
slon; J. P. Cook, County Clerk; George
Pearce, chief deputy County Clerk.
This fght- will center in the Second
Ward, and whoever carries that dis
trict will probably win the nomination.
The only other fight Is that between
J. J. Burke and Morris Flynn for the
Assembly nomination in the Forty
ninth District, and this is largely the
outgrowth of the Supervisorial contest
between Mitchell and Randolph.
Troubles over the Congressional nom
ination and over the nomination for
State Senator to succeed. G. R. Lukens
are settled. It was announced to-day
that there would be no opposition to
Knowland taking the nomination for
Congress and that there would be no
opposition to Lukens succeeding him
self as State Senator.
When it came to naming delegates to
be voted for at the primary election
on Tuesday next the committeemen
from the various districts prepared the
lists. There was no indication of a
light against these delegates until op
position lists appeared suddenly in the
Forty-eighth Assembly District, which
is along the southern water front; the
Forty-ninth Assembly District, which
includes West Oakland, and the Fifty
second Assembly District, which is the
town of Berlekye. An effort to get an
opposition ticket in Alameda failed,
but tights are expected in all of the
districts except the Forty-sixth, which
is the rural part of Alameda County,
and the Fortyrseventh, which is j Ala
meda City. ' .
These opposition tickets are backed
by S. Bachrach, secretary of the coun
ty committee, and M. J. Laymance, the
wealthy oil magnate, who has always
opposed the Fitzgerald wing of the
party.
TO COXTROU PARTY.
On the eve of the primary election
one of the good, old-fashioned fights
that have split a hopeless Democratic
minority in Alameda County so many
times has again developed. In at least
three of the seven Assembly districts
of Alameda County there will be tick
ets In opposition to those advanced by
the faction in control of the Democratic
County Central Committee.
Up to to-day there was not the
slightest hint of any fight among the
Democrats. The old R. M. Fitzgerald
wing of the party was in absolute con
trol of the county committee, even
though J. J. McDonald resigned as
chairman when he went East to at
tend the Democratic National Con
vention.

1016 Broadway, Aug. 6.
OAKLAND, Aug. 6.â While a
female companion kept watch at the
street door in order to see that an
avenue of escape was kept open, a
well dressed woman slipped stealthily
into the Vincent House at Seventh and
Market streets about 9 o'clock this
evening. She went straight to the
room occupied by D. Jackson and his
wife, rapped lightly on the door and
fled, leaving bn the floor a beautiful,
healthy baby boy about six months
old. Pinned to the shawl in which .the
little one was wrapped was the fol
lowing' note: "Christ said 'Suffer
little children to come unto me.' Will

1904." and this, together with the
clothing in which the child was
dressed, furnish the only clew by
which the little waif's identity may
be established.
The clothing consisted of a cro
cheted jacket, a gown of pink flannel,
pink crocheted shoes and finely made/
white underclothing. Over all was
wrapped a large, heavy shawl of dark
pink tennis flannel.
When Jackson answered the knock
at his "door and found the child he
called the landlady, Mrs. Joseph Kel
ly.. ' She' took the little waif to her
room andâundressed it. Finding no
marks of identification on the cloth
ing 1 , she summoned Policeman Scan-
Ian, who took the child to the police
station. Captain Wilson ordered him
to take it at once to the West Oakland
Home to be properly cared for. A
close examination of the clothing was
made at the home, but no marks were
found which would throw any light
on the baby's identity.
In spite of her precautions the
woman was seen by two girls as she
entered the building. These were
Edith and Norma Werly. Both give a
fairly good description of the woman's
clothing and appearance. She wore a
long brown cape and small straw hat,
trimmed with light colored flowers,
and she was about 5 feet 4 inches tall.
Her female companion was taller and
was dressed entirely in black.
The one who left the child was evi
dently well acquainted with the Jack
pon family. In the note left she re
ferred to the death of the son, A. J.
Jackson, formerly a student at the
University of California, who died last
November. Jackson says he knows of
no one by the name of Truman.

Speaker Cannon, at one of the din

(these dinners are strictly limited to
one hour), talked about mean rich men.
"The meanest rich man In Illinois,"
he said, "lives In Vermllllon County.
He Is a bachelor, and we'll call him
Crust. One day the superintendent of
the local cemetery told his lot salYs
man to call on Crust and sec If he
couldn't work oft a cemetery lot on
him. The salesman set out with a
hopeless air, and In a half hour he was
hack again. 'No go,' he said. 'Couldn't
get him, eh?' said the superintendent.
'No.' said the salesman. *HÂ» admitted
that I reasoned well, and that the lots
-were fine ones, but he said that If he
bought he mightn't get the value of his
money in the end.' 'Why,' said the
superintendent, 'there's no fear of that.

. Horses are bought every summer by
commissions of veterinary surgeons
and army officers. They pay about J1S0
each for horses between 3 and 4 years
of age, and send them on trial to four
depots, where they are kept one year
under scientific training to develop the
characteristics necessary In cavalry
horses. Nine thousand are needed each
year, but 5 per cent more are bought.
They run free in paddocks and sheds
on the depot farms, are groomed ten
minutes a day and fed the regular ra
tion of twelve pounds of hay, seven and
a half of oats and fifteen of straw each
day, with green food part of the year.
Each regiment has a certain number
of horses condemned each year and
sends a squad to the depot for an equal
number of new horses. There is al
ways a reserve of several thousand la
the Government depots and In an
emergency a considerable reserve force
can be mounted without delay and
without the uncertainty due to buying
on contract.
Austria has a horse population of
nearly 4,000.000. but the Government
maintains its own breeding farms for
cavalry horses. In Germany the mat
ter of obtaining remounts has been re
duced to an almost perfect system un
der Government paternalism. The
Government provides fine-bred stal
lions at convenient posts throughout
the country and in return for this serv
ice every horse owner is required to
bring his animal to the local "horse
muster" once'in ten years. From the
muster are exempt stallions, horses un
der 4 years old or those which are blind
In both eyes, mares with foal and horses
working in mines. The muster serve3
to 5 show exactly the available "horse
strength" of the nation.
HORSES BOUGHT BY OFFICKRS.
The problem of supplying the cavalry
with new horses to take the places of
thos& grown Old or disabled In service,
says the author of "The Cavalry
Horse," Is better solved m Germany
than in any other country.
The foundation of the solution In
every land Is a thorough knowledge of
the "horse population." Our own cen
sus report shows more than 21,000,000
horses of all sorts and ages. Our army
needs 8000 annually for all purposes)
and buys them on contract, paying an
average" price of $75. The cavalry
horses are the best of these. They arÂ©
bought when five years old and thÂ»
price for them Is above the average.
average- price of $75. Tha cavalry
man has his own animal and trains it
himself.
Russia, the only nation which haÂ«
more horses than America, counts 25,
000,000 in Europe and Asia. The Rus
sian Government buys very young
horses and trains them hard, with the
exception of those for Cossack regi
ments. The Cossacks are master train
ers and educate their own horses. Great
Britain and France each has 3,000,000
horses. France, with an annual "re
mount" in time of peace of 13.000 horses
had to buy in America In the war of
1871. â¢
GREAT BRITAIN'S SUPPLY SHORT
Great Britain uses only about 2000
remounts a year and does not supply
every cavalryman with a horse. In
deed, for 24,000 cavalrymen In the Brit
ish armv there are but' 16,000 horses.
This proportion is maintained on the
theory that a certain percentage of the
men are always sick or otherwise unfit
for duty and do not need the mounts.

Receipts of Produce.
Late mall advices from New York say of
Hops :
"Locally there was a firm market for 1003
Hops. Only small supplies were available,
due to light stocks, and prices were firmly
maintained. Coast advices indicated an easier
market for 19C4 Hops, due to the improved
outlook for the European crops as a result
of the rains during the week. Growers who
declined to' contract at 21c are in some in
stances. It was stated, looking- for buyers of
contracts at 20c. Advices were received from
up the State saying that it was possible to
contract at 25c for 19C4 Heps.
"The New York State crop promises to be
of good quality and the yield about 23 per cent
more than last year. The Pacific Coast crop
prospects are also favorable, indicating a crop
somewhat lancer than in 1903."

/ CHICAGO, Aug. Â«.â Besides taking into ac
count weakness at Liverpool and other foreign
centers, wheat traders here started with a
bearish Inclination, owing to favorable weather
conditions and the advices from Manitoba hold,
ing out- more cheerful prospects for the new
crop. Increased rocelpfs were an additional
factor in the domestic situation, tending to
bring out liberal offerings. The market opened
with September off Â«4c to ltfc at 06%c. A
largo quantity of long wheat was offered for
sale during the first few minutes. . While there
was fair buying by Southwestern houses and
local shorts, the demand was not sufficient to
prevent a further decline, September falling to
96^4 c. As 'boon as smaller holders had secured
pro.'lts the market became . somewhat firmer,
September rallying to -97c. For a time the
trading was rather light, with prices holding
fairly steady. A report by a prominent Chi
cago operator, who has been Investigating
tho wheat situation In the Northwest, etated
that the spring wheat crop was in a critical
condition and caused a fresh burst of bullish
enthusiasm. Thoae who had sold short on the
more favorable advices of the early part of
the session hastened to cover. There was also
good buying, by bull leaders. Under an active
demand September advanced to 07 %o. More
long wheat, however, came out on the bulge
and the market again eased off, September
closing at 07};Â®979>,c
! Corn was in sympathy with wheat. Septem
ber cloeed off a shade at 62 He
Oats w%re weak, September losing %o, at
I 32ftc.
I Reselling by packers in the face of a poor
1 demand caused weakness in provisions. At the
close September pork waÂ» down 35c. lard was
off 12%o and ribs 2%Â®6c lower. .

BARLEY â The week closed with the cash
grain steady and the futures weak. The
feature of the market at present is the heavy
buying by Los Angeles and other southern
points as far north as Salinas on the coast
and Stockton In the San Joaquin Valley. One
local firm alone has sold 15.000 sacks In the
Salinas Valley for this account during the past
few days, and there are other large sellers
besides; This gives a good idea of the volume
of this movement. In addition there Is still
a lively demand by speculators and millers in
the Sacramento Valley, so It will be seen that
the market is very active in the country, no
matter. how it may be in this city..
â¢ , CASH BARLEY.
The English market- was weak, with lower
Liverpool futures. The French markets wero
unchanged. The Hungarian crop was raised
3,200,000 bushels on account of the heavy
quality of the grain. The Swedish prospects
were lowered, by drought.
Chicago, though still nervous and unsettled.
was less feverish and erratic than on Friday,
and the fluctuations were narrower, as will
bo seen. The Kansas City Star said: "Sixty
million bushels less than last year for Nebras
ka, Kansas and Oklahoma."
The Chicago- wires of R. Brent Mitchell said:
"It was a hesitating but nervous market. The
opening was weak on further liquidation, but
the wheat seemed to be well taken and most of
the early loss regained. -Advices from the
Northwest crop are of the same 'general char
acter, but the market is getting Used to It a
little and the moderate statement given cut
by Jones yesterday has made a rather more
conservative estimate of the Northwest condi
tions. Northwest advices will continue to be
the principal influence for the time being-.
While the market has had a big advance, we
hardly feel like getting bearish' until the con
ditions are more definitely assured for - that '
section. Pending this we look for a hesita-9
ting market and are inclined to think we would
buy Wheat on the breaks." , -. t
In this market both cash grain aad futures
were quieter and not materially changed. The
cash grain showed an easy feeling, as buyers
were indifferent and held off. '

The fruit market was quite active under the
usual extra demand for Sunday, but the In
creased trading did not cause any advance in
prices of small tree fruits, as stocks of most
kinds were more than sufficient. Tha previous
high prices drew in free supplies of Peaches
in large open boxes and they were quoted
lower. while prices of smaller packages were
well maintained under a good call for. local use
and ehippitg purposes. The canners were of
fering 1 (25 per ton for bulk stock and secured
several lota of tho Mulr variety at that price.
They were also In the market for Plums at $7
