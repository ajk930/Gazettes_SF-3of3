*^-f PIANO organ was pouring the me
f tallic music through our open win
" i~~* clow s. while a voice of brass bray-
ed the words, which I have since
** obtained, and print above for iden
tification by such as know their Italy
better than I. They will not thank me
for reminding them of a tune so lately
tpidemic in that land of aloes and blue
skies, but at leaet it Is unlikely to run In
their heads as the ribald accompaniment
to a tragedy, and it does in mine.
It was in the early heat of August,
and the hour that of the lawful and
necessary siesta for such as turn night
into day. I was therefore shutting my
window in a rage and wondering whether
1 should do the same for Raffles, when
he appeared In the silk pajamas to Which
the chronic solicitude of Dr. Theobald
confined him from morning to night.
"Don't do that. Bunny." said he. "I
rather like that thing and want to listen.
"What sort of fellows are they to look
at, by the way?"
, I put my head out to see. it being a
primary rule of our quaint establishment
that Raffles must never show himself at
any of the \u25a0windows. I remember now
how hot the sill was to my elbows, as I
leaned' upon it and looked down in order
to satisfy a curiosity in which I could
see no' point.
"Dirty-looking beggars," said I over my
fchbulder; "dark as dark; blue china,
oleaginous curls and earrings; ragged as
they make them, but nothing picturesque
in their rags."
"Neapolitans all over," murmured
Ruffles behind me." and that's a char
acteristic touch, the one fellow singing
while the other grinds; they always have
that out there."
"He's rather a fine chap, the singer,
taid las the song ended. My hat, what
teeth! . ; He's looking up bere and grin
ning all round his head. Shall I chuck
them anything?" - * ' ; ;
"Well. 1 have no reason to love the
Nr vpolitans, but it takes me backâ it
takes me back! . Yes, here you are, one
each."
It was a couple of half-crowns that
.Raffles put into my hand, but I -had
thrown them into the street for pennies
btfore I saw what they were. Thereupon
1 left the Italians bowing to the mud,
4Â«s well they might, and I turned to pro
itst against such wanton waste. But
Raffles was walking up and .down, his
head bent, his eyes troubled, and his. one
<-xcute disarmed remonstrance.
"They took me back," he repeated. "My
<Joil, how they took me back!"
Suddenly ht stopped in his stride.
"You don't understand. Bunny*, old
chap, .but jf you like you shall. I always
meant to tell you some day, but never
felt worked up to it before, and lt'e not
the kind of thins one talks about for
talking's take. It isn't a nursery story,
liunny. and there isn't a laugh in it from
bta:t to finish. â¢ On the contrary. â¢ you
J;a\o often asked me what turned ray
luiir gray, and now you are going to
hear." ..
Thts was promising. . but Raffles'
manner was something more. It was
uniuue in my memory of the man.
fli-a fine face softened and. set .hard .by
turns.- 1 never knew it bo hard. I
never knew it so soft. And the same
.niight be snid of h!s. voice, now tender
as any woman's, now- flying to the
oilier extreme of equally unwonted fe
rocity. But this was toward the end
of his tale; the beginning he .treated
t-ltaractcrisically errough, though I
could have wished for a less cavalier
. account of the. lsland of Elba, where,
upon. Uis own showing, he had met with
much* humanity.
'"Deadly, my dear Bunny, is not* the
word for that glorified snag or for the
n:ollasks its inhabitants. But they
started by wounding my vanity, co per
hap* I am prejudiced after all.. I
epninK mjrsfll upon them as a ship

I didn't have to pick and steal for ii
square meal and a pair of trousers; it
would have befn more exciting If .1
had.' But what a place! Napoleon
couldn't stand 1t: you remember, but
held on lonarer than I did. . ,1 put in a

"From the garden behind the houseâ
E.W. HORNUNG
such a garden, Bunny â oleapders and mi
mosa, myrtles, rosemary and red tangles
of ttfry. untamed flowersâ -in a' corner of
thic garden was the top of a subterranean
stair down to the sea; at least there were
nearly >"0u gteps tunneled through- tlie
solid rock; then an iron gatei and another
eighty steps In the open air, and last of
ail a cave fit for pirates a-penny-plaln
and-twopence-cclored. This cave gave
upon the sv/cetest little, thing In coves,
all deep blue water and honest rocks; and
here I looked after the Vineyard shipping,
a pot-be!li<d tub with a- brown sail, Â«xid
a sort of dingy. The tub took the. wine to
Naples and the dingy was the tub's
tender.
"The house above was said to be on
the identical site of a. suburban retreat
of the admirable Tiberius. There was the
ole sinner's private theater, with the tiers
cut. clean to this day; the well where he
used to fatten his lampreys on his slaves,
and a ruined temple of those ripping old
Roman bricks, shallow as dominoes ', and
ruddier than . the cherry.- I; never ,was
mUch of an antiquary, but. l could have
become one there if I'd had nothing else
to do, but I had lots. .When I wasn't
bury with : the boats I had. to trinj the.
vinÂ«s or gather the srapss or even help
make tiie wine itself in a pool, dark,
musty vault underneath the temple that I
can see and smelUas I jaw.. And can't I
hear it and feel it. too! Squish, squash,
bubble: quash, squish, guggle; ami your
feet .is though you had been w&dins
through slaughter to a throne. Yes, Bun
ny, you mightn't think It; but this good
right foot, that never was on. the -wrong
side of the crease when.'the ball left my
hand, has also been' known to. \ - .
"crush the lees of pleasure ." \u25a0
From sanguine grapes of pain.". ,. ..-;\u25a0;

he had stumbled on the . truth in. Jest.

"I don't kiiow. Bunny, whether you're

Wormwood Scrubbs. Faustina and the
bay- of Naples were quite good enough
for me. And the prehistoric man in me
rather.jexuUed in the idea of fighting
for my desire. -
"On the gaturday. however., we were
to meet for the last time as heretoforeâ
just once more in secret, down there in
the cave, as soon as might be after
dark. Neither of us minded: it if we
were kept for hours; each knew that in
the end the other would come, and there
was a charm of its own ever* in waiting
for such knowledge- But that night I
did lose patience, not in the cave but
up above, where first on one pretext
and then on another the dlrettore kept
me going until I smelled a rat. . He waÂ»
not given to exacting overtime. thiÂ»
direttore, whose only fault was his serÂ»
vile subjection to our common boss. It
seemed pretty obvious, therefore, that
he was acting upon some secret in
structions from Corbucci himself, and
the moment I suspected this' I asked
him to his face if it was: not .the. casa.
And it was; he admitted it with many
shrugs, being a conveniently weak per
son, whom one felt almost ashamed ol
bullying as the occasion demanded.
"The fact was, however, that the Count
had sent for him on finding he had to go
to Rome, and had said he was very, sorry
to go just then, as among other things
he Intended to speak to me about jTaus
tlna. Stefano had told him all about his
row with her, and, moreover, that it jpraa
on my account, which Faustina Had
never told me. though I had guessed -as
much for myself. Well, the Count was
going to .take hi 3 jackal's part for ail. he
was worth, which was just exactly what
I expected him to do. 'lie intended going
for me on hi 3 return. â¢ but meanwhile "' I
" wai not to make hay in his absence; "and
co thl3 tool of direttore had. order* to
keep me. at it night and day. I-under
took not to give the poor beast away,
but at the same time told him. l had not
the faintest intention, of doing another
stroke of work that night. ;
"It was very dark, and I remember
knocking my head against the oranges as
I .ran up the long shallow steps which
ended the journey between the direttore's
lodge and the villa itself. But at the
' back of the villa was the garden I spoke
about, and also a bare chunk of the cliff
where it was bored by . that- subterranean
stair. So I saw the stars close overhead,
and .the fishermen's, torches far. beIQW,
the coastwise lights and the crimson
hieroglyph that spelt Vesuvius before' I
plunged into the darkness of the shaft.
And that was the last time I appreciated
the unique and peaceful charm of thi3
outlandish spot- ...'.* . ....
"The stair was in two long flights,
with an airhole or two at the top of
the upper one, but not another pin

June 15. '83.
My dear John
This letter Is the result of a bit of
eavesdropping. v\\ first explain how 1
came to be dating It from here. Father's
eister from New York came down a few
weeks ago. She is one of the rare few
**o with great wealth still understand
things. So with a .full perception of
what it would mean to me. she
kindly persuaded father that I
Wft s an indispensable adjunct to her
happiness in a three weeks' sojourn at
this, Virginia's fairest resort. It takes
Alt- the solidity of the smoky October
taountalns to convince me that the
\u25a0Â«&&nge Is a reality. The summer crowd
have nearly all deserted to their city
homes and last night at dinner the ad
vent of two guests was of curious inter
est. One was of the accepted type of the
average business man. but his com
panion was of the kind one looks at
twice â a heavy, flabby form with a mot
tled brutal face, out of which peeped
Â«yes cruel as those of a dozing serpent
he had all the calm malignity of a wait
ing hungry devilfish. In passing out I
glanced at the register. The two arrivals
\u25a0were a Jacob Poltz of New York and
M. C. Coleman of Unitah. . From your
letter I needed no guide to determine
which was Mr. Coleman. Passing Into
the parlor I joined my aunt. In a few
minutes the pair sauntered in. Mr.
Coleman's face held a strange fascination
for me. Your recital of the evil he has
wrought, of the pitiful emptiness of
strong hands, of the low walls of starv
ing mothers and children, and the black
pall hanging over hundreds of Innocent
homes, made him to me as a fabled
monster. Then as I thought of the time
when his soul would stand shivering be
fore his maker, a wave of curious pity
ewept through my heart. In a few
minutes they arose, Mr. Poltz with a
veary air remarking. "I'm very tired.
We will postpone our conversation until
morning. A nutting party had been ar
ranged for the next morning in which tho
lew remaining guests were to participate
en masse. You can realize my disappoint
ment \u25a0when the next morning. I awoke
with one of my nervous headaches.
Clearly the outing was not for me, so
tfter the ir.erry, noisy party had set out
I â¢withdrew to my room. It Is situated
in a secluded corner of the great building
â¢with a window cpenlng upon an always
ehady nook of the encircling gallery.
Closing the blinds I pulled a couch to the
\u25a0r indow. then with my head pillowed in
the window, prepared to "grin and bare"
my enforced solitude. The ripple of the
cool mountain airâ nature's healing fin
gersâhad nearly soothed me to sleep
when the sound of heavy footfalls was
followed by a heavy voice saying, "Here
is the very place. Now, Coleman, we
can come to an understanding. Pull your
chair out of the sun."
John. I know I should have got
up, but knowing tho character of the
VKpeakers gave me an intense curiosity
to hear their conversation. Well. I re
mained quiet, and. sir, I am very glad I
did to!
"Coleman," resumed Mr. Poltz. as the
pungent odor of two freshly lighted ci
gars filtered Into my nostrils, "it is my
unpleasiuit duty to Inform you that
your work upon the 'Inter-Mountain'
has been"! very unsatisfactory to the
6yndlcatej and. what is worse, has
placed me as your sponsor in an ex
tremely disagreeable position. When
you were, at a princely salary, ten
months since, placed in your present
position, it was with a full knowledge
of the service to be rendered. The road
- Is still solvent. Men like our English
.friends expect subordinates who can de
'.iver the goods. I stood for you as a
man capable of placing the road in the
reorganization class in six months.
" Your failure is mine. Blank still holds
a heavy block of stock, which, added to
â¢ his prestige, constitutes an ever-pres
" ent* menace. We will not be able to
keep the Allen Brothers quiet much
lpnger. Silence as to the true richness
'. of their mines is purchased at a ruinous
â¢ figure To me, knowing as Ido you
and your previous methods, your failure
- is Inexplicable."
A few moments* silence, then in a
sullen voice Mr. Coleman replied. "I'll
admit It docs look bad, but you are un
' aware of the conditions I was up
against. Blank was an hysterical senti
mentalist, and had left untried no
means to attach his entire force 4o the
road. Why. do, yov^ know that In case

"Dead?" I whispered.
And he nodded to the walL \u25a0
"There was not a sound in the cave.
There was no answer to my voice.
Then I went in, and my foot touched
hers, and it was colder than the rock
â¢ â¢ â¢ Bunny, they. had stabbed her
to the heart. She had fought them, and
they had stabbed her to the heart!"
"You cay 'they.' " I said gently. a.s he
stood in heavy silence, his back still
turned. "I thought Stefano had been
left behind?"
Raffles was round in a flash, his face
whitfc-hoU his cy<.s dancing dÂ«:ath.
"He was in the cave!" he shouted. "I
saw himâ l spotted him â it was broad
twilight after those stairsâ and 1 went
for him with my hare hands. Not fists,
Bunny; not fists for a thing like that;-
I meant getting' my fingers into his
vile little heart and tearing it out by
the roots. I was stark mad. But he
had the â¢ revolverâ hers. He bl.-ized it
at arm's length and missed. And that
steadied me. I had smashed his funny-,
bone against the rock before he could
blaze' again: the revolver fell with a
rattle, but without going off; In an
instant I had* it tight, and the little
cwine at my mercy at last."
"You didn't show him any?"
"Mercy? With Faustina dead at. my
feet?, I should, have deserved none In
the next world if I had shown him any

The vacancies were filled 'with the
cream of the country's slums. Mechan

of the required working capacity, soon

abled engines, the side tracks with
abandoned trains, while collisions, burst
or ruined engines were of daily becur

never been able to get below- water line.

hang over it. You know of the millions

"Never mind about that," interrupted
Mr. Poltz, harshly; "thinking aloud is a'
bad habit. Now as to the matter of
forcing a strike. You wrote of three
men, who, if properly handled, could be
used. I placed the extract in. my;memo
randum book. There it is â 'John Gray,
young. Intelligent, fully imbued with
the Blank' ideas; stands well with. the
men; could be approached only upon
wide grounds â betterment of condi
tions, return of road to the old high
standard and mutual respect of. both
sides. Brady, a product of the Chicago
yards, a splendid reputation profes
sionally, but quick-tempered and in
clined to be . rough In manner and
speech; could be handled on personal
grounds, along line of ill-treatment,
etc. Jasper, ex-master mechanic, a
Blank man, possessing to an unlimited
degree the' love and respect of all men

weird notions, but sufficient Intelligence
to grasp outline of our policy; might
be dangerous were it not that ideas are
Utopian to ludlcrousness; best to ap
proach on his duty as citizen to public
safety.
"These are the men you suggested.
I've taken all steps for our final move.
When the stage gets, in : a party will
join us. He is the general manager of
a new style of labor organization. He
has been successfully approached, and,
I think, if properly supported, ho will
land us a first-class strike. There is a
difference, of two hours and forty min
utes between New York and Unitah.
time. I want the final decision of the
strike to be made about 11 a. m. I'll
have all pipes laid at my end. Some of
the best slingers of lurid English In the
city are anxious for syndicate gold.
The dear public is to be taken into
their confidence, and when the panic
pushing fraternity, removes the limit
from their adjective machines the D. P.
will howl In a concert of horror. Then,
when the strike is declared by a body
of justly incensed employes who are
determined to rule or ruin they will fall
over themselves to sell out.. About

of stock on the floor of the exchange.
In the ensuing wreck I depend upon
drawfng old Blank's hoarded holdings,
if Inspired financial columns In all pa
pers â both evening and morning â are
of any Influence." .. .
Amid the ensuing silence came the
rumbling of the stage. A slouching,
hesitating series of footfalls was fol
lowed by, Mr. Poltz's uncertain voice In
low command: "All right. Weaver. Ex
plain to Mr. Coleman the plan we talked
over. It rests upon his. approval to re
ject or close the deal."
Thus adjured the labor leader began
glibly: "Our plan Is the formation of a
kind of labor trust in direct railway
service. We find the men of the West
are ruled to their detriment by the pre
ponderance of the conservative Eastern
membership. In the solution* of prob
lem directly affecting "
"Drop all that slush and come to busi
ness." growled Mr. Coleman.
"Well." resumed Weaver hesitatingly,
"I can do this if I can get in touch with
the fellows Mrl Poltz referred to. I can
get urÂ» a strike in twenty days."
"Then do It," said Mr. Poltz. as-lean
ing forward he transfixed the speaker
with lurid Semitic eyes, extending an
unsigned check. "As soon as a legitimate
strike is declared Mr. Coleman will at
tach his signature to this, hereby- bet-^
tering your condition $10,000." . .
The crack'.e of a crisp paper, then
Mr. Poltz.sald. "You can go now. JAnd
for each day you knock from your limit
I'll stand for an additional thousand."
At luncheon I had a good opportunity
of taking quiet note of. Mr.. Weaver's
appearance. He Is a tall, lanky .man of
about 40. with a long, livid scar on the
right cheek, but you will probably make/
his acquaintance with the receipt of this
letter. John, I'm very glad to be enabled
to nut* you and your friends on their
guard, and I would be very glad if my
unladylike action would result in perma
nent good to you all.
Sincerely, your friend,
MADGE DEANE.
A few days later a party of three were
seated unon the uorch of Mr. Jasper's
hospitable home. Under the smoke
wreaths they silently looked down over
the crowded yard.
"Same cars yet on No. 1," remarked
Brady.
"Didn't run a train all night," com-
back to that one and brought him down
with a bullet in his guts. :\: \
."'And I can spare you two or three
â¢more,' I said, for my poor girl could not
have fired a shot. "Take that one.- to
hell with you â and that â and that!'
"Then I started coughing and wheez

"Good," gasped Mr. Jasper, his face
very white and drawn.'
"Now, .John," he said, "I'll stand all

and I'll keep the expense sheet, against
the day. of Mr. Blank's return." â¢
Two . evenings later two forms dimly
outlined /under drooping boughs paused
in . a : long, eager conversation.' .The \ elder
said in a voice of wistful longing, "John,

An hour, later the friends were sepa

\u25a0 Jasper.' ;.'/ . . \u25a0 "\u25a0\u25a0 ?\u25a0 \u25a0
Comfortably seated before- the blazing
coal fire John was keenly conscious of
a pair of eyes furtively \u25a0 searching his .
face.*" Finally Mr. Jasper, broke the awa
ward silence by saying: > "John, Mr.
.Weaver represents , a new association of
railway ! employes-^the National Associa
tionâthe views presented meet "with our
approval. I Havinjr confidence in your
judgment, I would suggest that he kind
ly, for your, more 'perfect comprehen
sion, briefly outline his proposed plan."
. "Our association,' Mr., Gray," quickly
responded Weaver. In a dictatorial voice.
."is based uoon entirely new lines. As
at present constituted." the 'railway pro
tective orders are laid upon extremely
narrow â¢ lines; â¢ The different branches
of the service, havlns each individualized

tion in the interests . of a single order

is ' emphasized. Now our working motto
is 'Injustice to one is the' injury to all/
and our aim Is 'the formation of a
federated .whole. We- wish .to. gather
into a common, fold, the men , who pull
the. throttles: the men who throw coal:
the men who . carry the balls: the men
who set brakes, make' couplings' or jug
gle trains; the men who build -or repair:
tamp ties or \u25a0 pound brass. Now. I'll bo
perfectly- frank -.with you." the speaker
wondered at the strange gleam In Gray's
eyes, then dropping his voice to a low
confidential key, - resumed. "We have
done very well on ' the roads of the
Middle West, but It is very essential that
we bring â¢ ourselves prominently before
the public. The best way to' effect this
is by means of a successful strike. For
this purpose this road, the Inter-Moun
tain, has been selected. It is an open
secret that discipline is with you a farce;
that deliberate " and successful efforts
are being made to discharge all the
Blank men. Your personal â¢ experiences
prove this. The standard bearers of your
local lodges .- exist in name only. In
the chaotic blundering mass, the heavy
hand of your masters selects' unchecked
the victims ordained to the sacrifice.-
Towering over all our earthly brother
hoods is 'the sombÂ«r shadow of Calvary

battered against the throne of God and

This we are endeavoring to do.- Can l
count on your aid?" * \u25a0
, Here the speaker swept his flashing
eyes across the faces of his audience.
John looked toward "Mr. 'Jasper, who.
with a heightened- flush upon his face,
sat-moodily staring into- the fire.
A faint '-sneer running through his
words. , Brady asked: "If you have
worked off iall. your steam, suppose you
take the stack and get down to busi
ness? -You say that you wish to get
up a" strike and need our help. Let us
know â¢ plainly !oh what grounds you

. "Tho' grounds are easily found." re
turned Weaver quickly., "The oflicials

discipline resembles the weak unreason
of 'fitful children. Their continuance
In service perpetuates conditions under

With -a fierce gesture the speaker
arose, to stand, arm upon the mantel
piece, moodily gazing into the fire. For
a full minute the brooding silence re
mained unbroken. Then took place &
thins which caused Mr. Jasper to sink;
with gaping 'mouth, a huddled heap Into
his seat â Brady, with an oath to clutch
with crushlns force the arms of the>
chair, and Howe to sit ashen-faced with
quivering, lips.
This i 3 what they saw. Amid thÂ«
deep silence John arose slowly. Cross
ing to Weaver he stood looking' quietly
into his eyes. Then he said: "Mr. Wea
ver, you have termed us Blank men. In
this you are right. We are to him and
his interests sts the needle to the pole.
Personally, nothing would do me morn
Kooii than to ;Ud him in anyway, but
now it seems T stand before the great
est duty of my- life.
"Weaver," at the new note of earnest
compassion thrilling, threadlike along
the deep voice, each heart beat faster.
"I have listened closely to your words
and from the concluding ones I am led
to believe thai, you are standing at tha
parting of the ways. Standing as might
have lscariot when from a dark gate
way in old ' Jerusalem he saw the skulk
ing soldiers, priest led. puss into Geth
semane. Did you, ever think what it
would have meant to all men if he had
then â while \u25a0 Calvary was but obscure
Golgotha â passed into the - garden and.
standing by his Master's side, cast the
accursed silver into Calaphas' snaring
face?"
The head before him is bowed upon
the mantel. Placing his hand upon tha
convulsed shoulder ue says In a, voica
of wistful sympathy. "Mr. Weaver, once
to-night I refused your hand. Now I
extend mine. It's clean. Can you take
it?" \u25a0 . â¢ -
. Then under his eyes the craven form
rises, erect, to an equal height, the eyes
meet firmly, as the hands from an Inner
pocket brings forth a long, black pock
etbook. Then as a slip ot engraved pa
per flutters to the fioor a strange voice
rings out heartil>, "Yes, I can, or any
other, man's now." . . â ,
"What~are you going to do with the
check?" asked Mr. Jasper, a little later.
. " "You keep it." replied Weaver.
"When all U over I wish, to take Itâ
I have a boy at home to" whom I wish
some day to show it." ...
The conference ensuing was long and
careful. "Weaver's defection was an in
valuable aid. His .thorough knowledge
of Pol u"s plans, combined with his real
ability, made' the conspiracy almost an
assured' success. Dawn was breaking
as with the last detail well threshed
out the weary party separated to their
welcome beds. The task of arousing
the entire Inter-Mountain force to de
cisive action was extremely. easy. . Tho
force was almost to a man non-union,
men debarred ' for a variety of rea
sons from membership iv existing or
ganizations. They welcomed gladly tho
advent of the non-questioning, all em
bracing "association.". The 'high posi
tions held by Mr.. Jasper and his popular
associates was a most compelling-fac
tor. In less than ten days'M*r. Coleman
indited the following 'letter 'from Unl
tah: - \u25a0 :
"My Dear Poltz: Weaver must have

Mr. Poltz in the privacy of his inner
office ran his eye eagerly along the burn
ing lines. The editors had. evidently, jot
beyond | space, and annual considerations,
and were responding to the extent ' ot
their vocabulary of scathing adjectives to
the feverish beating of Â» the public pulse.
The most conservative , element, of the
Stateâ banks and pulpitsâ were . working
in unison with strange companions. Even
the most convincing "straw" was be

This is not the place to laugh.

Â« I am not trying to be cheaply ' smart
at the expense of so great and admir
tble.a personality.
â¢ X think, indeed, that the silly season
in relation to Susan B. Anthony Is over,
permanently over; that she has come
Into her own; that even the "funny
jr.an' % of our newspaper world finds the
point of his paragraph dulled by his
respect for her. that he has voluntarily
, blue-penciled her off the list of his
clock subjects.
. * â¢It is not an inadvertenceâ a slip of
the pencil â when I call her the Donna
'\u25a0 Quixote of the Nineteenth Century. It
â¢Is to the nineteenth century that her
activities and her story belong; it Is
upon the horizon of thÂ«t time that her
gaunt. X2uixotish figure is' scrawled â
" Indelibly.
Now she is but lingering on the sun

So you see now why I said, "Don't
laugh."
â¢ "Write," so runs trie Sunday Edi
tof's decree, "about Susan B. Anthony,
the woman."
No pleasanter task can be set.
There was a time before your day and
mineâ a time that is historical more be
cause of its medieval limitations aud
prejudices than Us remoteness, when that
' - x>oJnl of view, when the mere thought of
"Eusan B. Anthony, the woman," would
.' have raised a guffaw.
Perhaps even you and I can remember
âIf we try very hardâ a time when the
suggestion of Susan B. . Anthony as a
voman provoked a broad grin.
. There are even now among the millions
who know her as a public figure those
who feel called upon to express their
incredulity in a supercilious smile when
her womanliness is the topic.
Yet there never was a woman more. of
'\u2666 a woman than Susan B. Anthonyâ whose
reasons and reasoning, whose' methods
â¢â¢ and mental cast, whose tastes. aud Incli
nations more truly bespeak the woman.
~Hers is not, to be sure, the human
kitten sort of feminity that pre-empts
the warmest place oii the hearth. rug
or the eolftest lap and the biggest sauce
of cream, that purrs â and scratches. .
It is the capable, straightforward wom
anliness that with stanch heart and .will
ing hands htld together those first Amer
ican homes set Tip on the bleak New Eng
land shore between the sea and the wil
derness, i.
Anywhere where there is a frontier.
where there are nÂ«w and hard conditions
to bo met, tasks to be done, you may
find this Susan B. Anthony kind of worn
* enlineES.
IrK It Is the homespun, dyed-in-the-wool
brand, ac distinguished from the boudoir,
beauty-doctored brand.
Let me show her to you in her rocking
It is not without determined effort and
much expense of strenuosity that I can
do It. for Susan B. Anthony is the iive
licet girl of S5 that ever I pursued.
Although eighty-five are her birthdays,
â¢he has not reached the chimney-corner
age.
You cannot say to yourself, "When I
have finished this, that and 'the otherâ
attended to the' more pressing affairsâ
II /will drop in on Miss Anthony. She is
Si, and cure to be at home."
On the contrary, you will get up, fts I.

wise and would save time and_tr*vcl you

As for me. Miss Anthony had but one
bo&t the start of me, not more I'm sum,
and I followed ber trail to Oakland, to
Berkeley and back again to San Fran
cisco, with Miss Anthony always i-ne
jump, and sometimes two. ahead of K& \u25a0
She crowded into her rounds trip a
luncheon, a reception, a drive through
the university grounds; with a compre
hensive inspection of the university, ah^
other reception, a little talk, . a dinner
party and got to bed (and to sleep/ too,
no doubt) all before 1 could catch up
with her. . ,
.That's doing pretty well for a girl
Of.elghty-tive, isn't it?
So that, when at last I take you in
with mo and show her to you" In her
\u0084 rocking chair, I may be pardoned for"
regarding it as something 'of an
achievement,
* Well, here she' is, a fine, venerable.
SUSAN B ANTHONY THE WOMAN
command.lng figure, "Suaan B. Anthony,
the woman.**
Shells still tall and gaunt In her
long, busy life the has had no time to
acquire embonpoint and extra chins.
Perhaps because of her thinnesiâyet
I think |lt is . more likely , because of
the blending; of what is fine and true
and strong^ into an .Impressive I person
alityâsho recalls a Toledo blade my
fencing, master took pride In.
This Toledo blade, like Susan 8., was
fin* and true and : strong, with an edge
co keen it would cut a hair. Even I,
who was no connoisseur, could appreci
ate that It was something above - the
common .when the fencing master, In a
particularly gracious mood, would press
its point to the floor and bend it almost
to. a circle, then release It and let it fly
back like a flash of light.
Susan B, Anthony is like the Toledo
blade, we see as we sit' at her knee for
this close examination of her in her
rocking chair, for she has not snapped
or broken under the pressure of the
burdens of life. .
She Is Etill vivid, strong and mistress
of her mind, not dwelling remlnlscently
In the past, but pointing with com
manding hand to what must be done in
the present' and the future.
It is eight years, nearly nine, since
she was here last, since I have seen
her, and I am prepared for a falling
off, for the Uttle evidences of decay, for
the groplngs of memory, for that slight
loosening of the mental grasp that
marks the march of time. ' r . . â¢ \u25a0
I remember Historian Bancroft in his
beautiful silvery old age. T It was niy
.privilege 'to visit him in his big brown
house in Washington, where the hya
cinths in his garden told of the,com
ing of spring to all the neighbors. on
his block. He was younger then than
Susan B. Is now, but I^remember how,
when . memory failed him and bits of
knowledge slipped from the; grasp of
his mind, his watchful tender friends
quickly pieced out his thought; how
half-suspecting his deficiency he had
the forever-faithful Herman, who -was'
valet, guardian and secretary all to
gether, always on the Jump searching
for the books and documents that
would refresh the reminiscences which
he so loved to relate.
Not co with Susan B. ,
She needs no books nor documents to
piece out failing memory. That won
derful fazor-edged intellectuality is
as keen as ever, it was, the remarkable
memory as accurate.
Â£he needed no* notebook to reel oft
the past week's engagements chrono
logically.
She had to fall back on no reference
books or papers to tell me what had
been done In the suffrage movement
from the day she first stepped into it:
Her narrative Is as racy, her com
ment as caustic as ever.
So far from seeking aid's to memory
let me tell you one incident showing
how little she needs them.
She wanied me to lop k up the list of
woman's' disabilities as they existed
at the beginning of the suffrage move
ment. She gave me not only the name
of the workâ the mere general direc
tion for finding the passageâ but the
volume, and chapter as well,' and v would
have given the page, but torlmv in
capacity for figures.
No eccentricities or
singularities mark that
fine old figure in the
rocking chair.
She is "\u25a0 handsomely,
modishly, becomingly
and appropriately
gowned.
I like to dwell on
this fact, to go a little
Into detail, for her*
sweet good sense and
her sanity in this is: part of my pride
in Susan B.

[ there are probably more than twenty
| million women in the United States,
and more than two hundred thou
sand women and girls in the State
of California., who wear corsets every, day
in the year. It is therefore a matter of
interest to a very large number of people
to near something new on this Important
eubjee*.
The illustration marked figure 1 shows
s, corset that Is most unusual and won
derful. There Is probably not a replica
of it in America. Of course it is more a
curiosity than for "human natures* daily
use." It Is made of the very best and
finest pompadour silkâ the five little
clasps down the *ront are of solid gold,
and in each are three small but brilliant
diamonds. The skirt hook is also of pure
gold and also ha* three diamonds *et in
it. The garters alone are things of
beauty. They are of eighteen karat gold.
\u25a0with three diamonds in each clasp. The
top of the corset is trimmed with real
lace of the finest Quality. This remark
able creation can be bought for the sum
ef $3501
As the chief recommendations for a
corset ere that it should be well con
structed, made of good material, and that
It should fit the figure well, I had never,
in xay wildest dreams. Imagined a corset
with solid gold fastenings, decked with
precious Etones and adorned with real
lace trimmings.
Who will be the happy purchaser of
tM* really magnificent item of raiment
cannot, of course, be conjectured, but It
Is pleasant to fancy that it may form
one Item of some rich and elaborate
trousseau. One can Imagine the dismay
ef a husband at the idea of living up
to the standard of such extravagant be
longings* - â¢
But leaving aside this one especial gar
ment as being "hors concours," the sub
ject of corsets Is an Important and lnter
estir.gr one, and the different makes and
etyles are â¢worth reviewing. A personal
friend of mine went all over the city try-
Ing to find s. particular brand of corset,
and fortunately found It at last, but not
until after Â£he had inquired at a great
many Dlaces and was tired out' from her
exhausting search tor It. But hone other
wquid she have.
The French corset- makers, with
jc<Â»tie longings In their souls,; bestow
different names upon different styles of
corsets, Â£.nd they have christened the
wonderful corset of diamonds. and real
It Is Indeed a star!
There are really a good many things
to be said about *orsets â what to wear,
end how to 'wear them. All of which
may not be needed by women with good
figures, and a graceful carriage; but
with a tendency to grow stout, to
stoop, or to an ungraceful gait, it is im
portant to exercise great cure.
This is certainly a good corset,
and can be bought, to suit any fig
ure. The newest 'style this year is- the
â¢â¢nigh bust," but there are a 'great
many, people who cannot wear it, and
the corset-makers are trying: to.estab
lish the fashion of ' the very long
waist ffd corset, such as was worn a
good many/ years ago. , But it is not
likely that this style will be popular
in America. 'â¢ .- ,-
It Is desirable t> exercise a good deal
of care in patting on a corset, because
the adjustâ ent has a great effect on
the fit, and the fit has a great deal to
do. with/ keeping, the figure in good
shape. The corset should be made very
loose, and let away out. In the first
place, and the waist llne'of the corset
should correspond exactly with the
\u25a0waist line of^the wearer. Then, the
lines should be pulled in, and the cor
set made to fIV/the body, care being
taken not'th'mnko It too tight. If the
corset is too tight -it is apt to make
that particularly i unattractive figure ol
a very stout person .with a slim waist.
And the slimness of 'the waist serves
to emphasize the r^otundity^ of the fig
ure. There. is really no need of this
appearance, and no. excuse for it. The
"embonpoint", can' be. corrected by a
regular and systematic course of exer
cise, where this tendency is known to
be likely to happen....
A short exercise every night and morn
ing will improve the figure, in a very
short time. There are certain muscles
which, if not exercised sufficiently to re
tain their healthy vigor, become weak
and flabby, in which condition they are
apt to be overlaid with adipose tissue,
and the result is a figure of pronounced
and prominent stoutness.
It may be of Interest to briefly outline
some of the 'most beneficial of these ex
ercises.
Before retiring at night, and imme
diately after arising in the morning, these
muscles may be exercised by drawing
them in and out for about flve minutes.
Then, holding the stomach well in, beno.
the body until the hands touch the floor,
but without bending the knees, from five
to ten times. If this should be impossible
fit on the edge of a chair and throw the
hands from a position raised above' the
head to the floor. This can easily be done
a dozen times or more.
Another, exercise, which Is of great
benefit, is to lie fiat on the floor and raise
one leg after the other to a perpendicular
position for several times, and after
ward to raise them both together several
Thifl anil in fa**t rtlT *v*rtf*lciÂ»^
Thia exercise, and. in .fact, all exercises,
6hould be used- very gradually, to avoid
the fatigue and the lameness and stiff
ness which, as the exercises â¢ are contin
ued, will gradually diminish and nrtally
wear off altogether. -;.-...
Another exercise, which is also to be
practiced very gradually, is to, walk,
holding the stomach in, consciously, un
til after a while it will become easy and
natural to do so. This habit is no doubt
difficult to acquire, and for the first two
or three weeks it will be hard work, but
it will gradually and surely affect a great
change for the - better In the figure.' It
will also prove to be a general benefit to
health, as the carriage must be straighter
and the breathing better.
In figure 2 Is shown a corset model for
a large woman. It- is made high in the
bust, and - with side gores that fit ' the
hips to perfection. The* whalebones in
this corset are of remarkably good qual
ity "and are covered with tinfoil, oil slik
and kid, so that there is no danger, of
rusting. It is said that . these corsets,
have the -effect of- making the figure'pf
llhe wearer perfectly ' symmetrical. .
Figure 2 shows another corset, , being
made for a" slender woman with & small
waist. The bust is only medium in height,
and it Is a corset that not 'only gives a
pretty figure, but it is accordingly com-

fortable as well. It would not be
found difficult to make what is
called- the ribbon corsets at home,
although they can be bought in
any color that may , be becoming. . To
make them will require. about four and
a half yards of. two-inch-wide ribbon,
together with the best whalebone that
can be had, for the little side pieces/
These ribbon corsets are not only. very
comfortable, but they are very pretty.
Another ribbon corset is shown in Fig
ure i' . -
At cne time ( these ribbon corsets were'
very ' much -in vogue and â¢, were
worn'by many women in society, and it
is pleasant, to see; that they are coming
Into fashion again.. These short corsets
can be bought made of tape instead of
ribbon, and they are very' cheap, but It
is only a slender figure that can wear
them.
. , It- seems vStrange that the. efforts of a
fe w-."ad vanccd" women to introduce the
custom- of going without corsets mcet
with so little encouragement. Tho.rea
son is, no-doubt, that a corset is.anex
tremely comfortable garment, and that
to leave them off. would* involve an> en
tire change in the style of dress, and
besides, the bands of the skirts would
wound and cut the waist. Corsets have
been found to be desirable for too long
a period to attempt to do without theni.
They were probably in use in Homer's
time, and were certainly in use in Eu
rope .in the Middle Ages. .
In- individual cases corsets have been
.discarded, but, in those cases there are
other changes also. - Isldora Duncan, for
example,- has laid aside her corsets, but
she has also laid aside other items of
civilized dress and has adopted. the Gre
cian' garb altogether.' These isolated
instances do not form any criterion to
follow, and the vast majority of womeu
not only adhere to corsets, but follow
the styles of them as prescrlbed v by -

ity and flesh , rarely go together. Do
not ride over five miles each ..pleasant:
day, for the exertion of a ten mile ride

nis or croquet or similar* games, which
will keep you out of doors and which
; will bring all the muscles into, play
without too great fatigue: *or take a
leisurely walk; of one or two miles
daily. As you eat so â¢ much and still
are thin ; it is evident- that you are
overworking your digestive organs â¢ to
such an extent that they cannot prop
erly assimilate the food consumed.' and
which, If continued, will surely lead to
dyspepsia. Try this plan for a time,
and I think you will begin- to improve
in weight. Masticate all food thor
oughly; eat only that which Is nourish
ing, avoiding pickles, s lemons, fancy
pastry and the like. ' For breakfast
have - a bowl of well-cooked oatmeal,
which Is decidedly fattening,' and with
it have plenty of sweet cream. : In
dition eat one or two soft-boiled eggs,
gome graham bread, well buttered, and
a glass of milk, preferably warm. Vary
this' by having chops, baked apples,
berries and. different, cereals, with
cream. For luncheon, and' dinner eat
plenty of broiled and roasted beef,
mutton or fish, well- cooked vegetables,
such as potatoes, peas, beets and fresh
salads with oil dressing, but with lit
tle vinegar.. The bread -should be

the muscles bathe the bust freely with
cold water every morning and mas
sage, In a rotary movement, going over
the surface several times, using the
finger tips or a massage roller, which
you can get at any shop keeping toilet
articles. Before retiring bathe the
breasts with very warm water, dry

the finger tips below the bust and bring;
upward to tha center, then under the

manipulations must be gentle, as the
delicate muscles of the breasts are

To Remove Bunions
Any one who has been unwise enough
to wear tight or 111-fitting shoes usual
ly has a painful appreciation of the
fact in the tender feet developed. A
bunion Is a form of corn on the -Joint
of the great toe. Technically speak
ing, it is an enlargement and Irrita
tion' of what is called In anatomy
bursa" mucosa. The most Important
thing to do is to' remove all tha
pressure' on the bunion and to wear
only the . softest wide shoes "which
will allow perfect freedom oÂ£ move
ment. . The ; stockings should also' t>Â«
much larger -than those ordinarily
worn, that, there may not be tha
slightest contraction of the muscles*
To reduce the swelling and-surround
ing: Inflammation, .which is the seat of
the -severe pain, hold the foot in. a
warm.(n6t^hoty bath for fifteen mln
.utes. Dry, rub the foot with tincture
of arnica and alcohol, equal parts, and
remove carefully any callous. If the
bunion is very, much inflamed, before
retiring I ' bind on a warm poultice made
of flax seed and In the morning: apply
an ointment of twelve grains of iodine
and one-fourth- ounce of spermaceti
â¢ ointment.'
Arnica plasters are a convenient
form of treatment and will prove very
beneficial. Avoid â¢ harsh remedies
which blister, for they merely increase
the pain; soothing, astringent applica
tions are the most effectual" In treatlns
a bunion. SSÂ«

lightened Chinese â men who feel keenly the stigma thai attaches
to their nation by the state of affairs that exists in Chinatown.
The consensus of opinion upon the subject seems
:\u25a0 to settle dozvn to this: , // remains to be seen whether
: the Chinese ivill go. There is no logical reason why
; they should not go. ' Down on the bay shore, with the
taught them the simple arts of husbandry and ihe simphe trullu
of the Nasarenc. Here in this quiet â¢ vale iii Saty \Matc<y County,
far removed' from the simple truths of munieip,al y^olHies. it is
hoped that the Chinese will know more about simple truths in
general than they hair been permitted to know within the munici
pal influence. It is here that this inyv Chinatown, a modern Ori
ental city zvill be built. In short the United States Improvement
and Investment Company, embracing within its stockholders and
upon its board of directors some of the. wealthiest men of San
Francisco, has. incorporated and gone to work on a colossal scale to
push to an accomplishment a scheme that to the lay outsider seems
to be the incznlablc coming of a mighty step forward that
this city has long atvaitcd. A Heracles has arisen to clean the
Augean stables.

Looking at it from a more interested

appenrs to me to bo simnil liuslncss
sagacity, it would bring about quite a
atir in the labor , field- In' this district,
making a combination both pleasant*
nncl proiitable to all concerned.
.In other words." business would be
-combined -with .plofisurc, making oho

change.- . \u25a0/ . V;Vx::
making Pan Francisco what It was
originally Intended it should be; one of
the greatest cities in. our nation and
the distributing point for the West. It
:an only be accomplished by removing
and the nation more to the square inch
than all of the Chinese here and
nil of Chinatown could do to the square
mile. Kvery effort, should bo put forth
to thia end by all people desirous of
undorHtnnd. In many Instances owned,
by Chlnnmcn, Is property that ought to
be occupied by Americans conduct
ing American Institutions; Institutions
which wou'.d benefit tho city, the StÂ»Â«e
a manner Indlcntlve of an intention of
keeping away from our shores all un
deslrabl<r- Asiatics whether they' be Chi
noae or Japanese.
The property now occupied, and. as I
forth to their homes ought to apprecl
ato tho great value of the proposed
change, and doubtless will do so when
the vast undertaking becomes a succcaa,
but now la the time to agitate and sup
port ' Ihe movement, so that It may be
carried' .'through.
I have- heard* the remark soberly mado '
that tho crowning beauty of NobTHII, the
"Fairmont," ls.destlned ere long to be
come an / Integral part of <*hinatown.
What an Imposing, Oriental temple that
would make! And, I expect that it may

A KU of llltlicrÂ«Â« In written I'olKlcal
Ulvtary. '
The answer to the last question Is
now to'.J for tUe :irst time, and In or
der I<. make H plaia It is rtecess-ary t<Â»
pa Lac!: to the Jjys of 1597 when Mr.
McK'.nley was casting about for an able
lawyer uÂ» take the Cabinet portfolio of
Attorney General, 'soon to be vacated
by JcE<-:Â«h llclCtnna. who has beeu sei
aside as u:s Associate Justice of the Su
preme Court.
c Tlie iSeeietur;.- of Interior was then
that oid v.-hecihorsf of the Republican
party. Cornelius >:. Bliss. Kor many
years Mr. Bllo*. although tonslderably
older, has t*en one of Mr. Hoofs most
Intimate petsutud friends. Knowing full
well^llifc Uecp di3ir* of the President to
select for the Attorney Generalship a
mail wiio cjuld und would worthily fill
the post, and knowing equally well Mr.
Roofs profound legal attainments and
his unflinching devotion to any cause
lie espoused, Mr. Bliss suggested | Mr.
Roofs name io the President as that of
the next Attorney Gencial.
Xow It happened that Mr. Mclvlnley
had known Mr. Root and been ac
quainted with his legal talents quite a
number of years. The iriends of several
other candidates for the portfolio â
among the latter was John W. Grlggs â
were urging their, names upon the
President, but defepite these i insistent
pleas he. decided in favor of Mr. Uoot,
and Uu otncial messenger, a man prom
inent in the party. wa3 dispatched to
New York to sound Mr. Root as to
whether he would look favorably upon #
a tender of the portfolio.
When this messenger . arrived. he
learned that Mr. Root was spending a day
or two in the Long Island resort of
Southampton, so that more time than he
bad bargained for passed before he was
able to. communicate with Mr. Root. In
the meantime, and while Mr. Root was
thinking the matter over, the political
friends of Mr. Griggs greatly increased
their already herculean efforts In his be
half; Mr. McKinlcy held out as long
as. possible for his i,"t choice, and then
having received no word from Mr. Root,
cave in to the pressure and nominated
Mr. Grjggs as Attorney General.
Becatlse he had hesitated too long. Mr.
Root had lost his ' nrst certain oppor
tunity of becoming nationally known.
However, it was not to be his last, and
when Russell A. Algcr resigned as Sec
retary of \VÂ«r, Mr. McKinley at once set
about to recur* Mr. : Root for the port
folio. The President realized full well
that the War. Department was sadly In
reed of reorganization, and he felt cer
,c, c tain that Mr. Root was the one man in
* Ajnerk-a* who could accon plish properly
this task of reorganization, for he was
well aware of Mr. Roofs invariable habit
of getting to the bottom of a thing and
elf ting it thoioughly. no matter what the
con ,in time, energy and midnight oil.
Therefore, when Mr. Root, on being of
fered- the portfolio, answered that he
knew.: nothing about army matters and
the.i nsular ptoblems then to the fore and
thus *lK>wt d a d sinclination to accept the
position, great pressure vas brought to
bear, upon himâ how i-Â»ich he alone
kiiuli s. k S lirtk-e it to say that this time
Opportunity was finally grasped,* and
five years luur. when he resumed his law
pructice, Mr. Root was hailed from one
end of ihe v country to the other as th.;
man who had reorganized the army from
top to ijottcm ; secured a permanent in
crease ia the different branches; Insti
tuted the general staff and war college;
opened s-choo'.s cf instruction for the va
ricu*., br-ijuhts of tjie service: made a

of lh<rÂ«Â£taU: militia; broke up the vari

One day joung Root. Â»;ho lived in his'

,'"Mrr Root's with the Tweed

I who. had 'come * to-hlm f ln ; hia'sparse 1 * times

{protect l this '-â¢ client's ; Interests s under the

' lawyers -on the defense. "He has said
once und again (In private) that he did
in the Tweed affair no more than to urge
that not prejudice or -public outcry, but
the* law. should controlin the trtol and
the punishment of the offender.; . Many
of. the public statements in this.matter
are absurd. As Mr. Root was admitted
to the bar In 1567 he could hive had no
share whatever : In matters prior to the
Tweed breakup."
A Censure by the Trial Judge.
Whatever drew Root into the case,
from the moment he found himself lined
up on Tweed's side, he devoted himself
wholly to conserving hia client's Inter
ests In his usual thorough and pains
taking way: and It. was he who made tha
suggestion that Tweed's counsel should
join in h request to trial Judge Noah
"Davis that the case be sent to another
judge, on the ground that Tweed could
not get a fair trial before Judge Davis.
The request was made as suggested. Im
mediately the Judge- adjourned court to
consult with his- colleagues, and on con
vening It again he nned Messrs. Gra
ham. Fullerton .and W. O. Bartlett $50
each. Then, turning to the three younger
men, he said in' a voice that had mucl*^
of the sorrow of a father In It:
"I ask you young gentlemen to remem
ber that good faith to a client never can
justify nor require bad faith to your con
science, and however good a thing it may
be to bÂ« known. as successful and great
lawyers, it is even a better thing to be
known as honest men, and that there Is
no Incompatibility . whatever In the pos
session of both these titles."
They were not fined; many wondered at
the time v/hy Mr. Root had escaped with
a censure, and could only explain It by
saying that Judge' Davis was unaware
that Root had suggested the scheme.
Years later, however, the Judge made it
plain that he knew full well who was tha
author of the suggestion, and added that
be had refrained from fining Mr. Root on
the ground that he was a young man.
more or less Inexperiencecr, and had not
been .cautioned by his oider associates
against the .course which he proposed,
and hence they were the ones who were
really culpable in the matter.
In relating this incident, it should ba
added that Mr. Root really felt that' hl3
client could not obtain a fair trial before
Judge Davis, and. following out his usual
custom of protecting a client ti> the best
of his ability, he suggested the course
that brought him such a stinging rebuke.
All through the trial Mr. Root's advlea
and policy of defense were largely fol
lowed. Thia -became generally known, so
that, despite the fact that he wa* on the
exceedingly unpopular, side. Mr. Root, at
twenty-eight, found fcis services In greaer
demand than possibly be had ever hoped
fcr.
Ills connection with the Tweed defense
really marked the beginning of his period
of great activities, and since then his
n:inie"has been constantly associated with
numerous important le?aJ proceedings.
. ... Some of lI N Cls Client*.
. Three years after the trial he was coun
sel for the -Bank of North, America and
the Hannibal and St. Joseph. Railroad
â¢Company. In ISS6.* when the New "York
State Senate Investigated the notorious
Broadway franchise 3teal by Ja&e Sharp,
which-resulted in Sharp's dying in prison.
Mr. Root appeared for many of the
stockholders, and contended that, though
the franchise had be* n granted illegally,
it did not revert to the city hut belonged
to the stockholders. ! '
For a number of years he was counsel
for the Metropolitan Street Railway Com
pany .of â¢ New York City, when it was
controlled by William C. Whitney.; an
intimate friend, and as counsel opposed
any compromise with the Third Avenue
Railway Company, which ultimately
made it necessary for the people to go
before the Legislature In order to keep
four car tracks off Amsterdam avenue.
H# drew up for this same corporation its
proposltfon \u25a0to the Rapid Transit Com
mission to build the present subway. If
it were- given a perpetual franchise. The
Metropolitan Street Railway, until it was
taken over by the New York City Rail
way Company, a holding concern, con

- He was one of the senior pilot 3 of thÂ«
sugar trust in its various litigations la
the eighties and early nineties; he has
beon retained by the Consolidated Gas
Company of New York, controlled by the
Standard Oil Company, and tn 1592 ho
defended" the whisky trust In Massa
chusetts when an attempt was made to
have Its operations declared Illegal on the
jrround 'that its system of rebates to>
dealers. ' en condition that they did not
handle : the products of rival concerns,
was in restraint of trade.
These are a few of the many corpora
tions-whose lecal interests have . been,
looked after by Root since he was thirty.
toÂ»ay nothing of the corporations which
; retained him during the brief period that
elapsed between his resignation as Secre
tary :of War and ; his acceptance of^ thÂ«
portfolio of Secretary of War.
* Great Ranse of His Legal Aetlvttlea. f
But it should not be imagined that
Mr. Root's practice # has been, limited
these last* thirty years to that of cor
poration law. Such a supposition Is
far from the facts, as a perusal of hla
legal history, confirms. For, example,
he for Judge Hilton In the
world-famous litigation following tha
reading of A". T. Stewart's will and hi j
name is intimately associated with tha
Hoyt and Fairweather will ' contests. \u25a0
also famous in legal lore. It was Mr.
-Root . who '.'defended -Police Captain Wil
liams ~of New York, charged with: the"
murder of one of the gang; of toughs
infesting his district, and secured his
acquittal. Until he accepted his new
post he was personal counsel for. Mayor
Weaver of Philadelphia, and more than
once he has tlgured among .counsel* ln
â¢'political- contests brought into "court
for settlement, in this lust instance fre
quently giving his aervicts free gratia
to old-time friends.

-the great majority of the cases in whleU

Why He Broke Jack Hogan'Â»
XoÂ»eâ How the t**iÂ«co Sports Are
Ftungrâ -Verr Frnnse-tin for Battling
KcUobâ Some Dope on Pits That Una
Come True.
THERE was a great blowing of Her
bert Blade's bazoo when .the Maori
half-breed was imported to give me
the lullaby. A gent in New York
who was scraping the earth with' a
fine-tooth comb to get a man to lick me
-was the cause of taking Sla.de from his
hsppy home In Australia and we met in
Madison Square Garden, New York, in
August, ISS3.
"This Is the time the wind comes out
of your sails, and you'll go back to Bos
ton in an ice-box," was one of the mes
mges handed to me by the gent referred
to. That was before taking Slade on.
There was a crowd there to make your
head swim. Slade looked fit for his. part,
Mith â¬ feet 1 3-8 inches, carrying 236
pounds of beef. He could handle himself
v t 11, knew how to box, and entered the
ring cock-cure of doing me up. He looked
| as good as any man I ever faced, and the
crowd was ready to Bee assault-and-bat
tery, rough-house, explosions, and so
forth.
In the first round, after sparring a few
seconds.' I felt for him with a smash
full in the face, following it up with an
other in. the neck. Then I floored him
â¢with anctber. When he got up, we met
like a couple of bulls and I handed him
a punch that smashed him through the
ropes and off the platform, head first into
the crowd. In the eecond round I wal
loped him all over the ring. The third
round was chort and Slade was down and
out. . t
Captain Williams, with his famous slrte
whUkers, led his police into the ring to
stt-p the fight, but there wasn't any right
to etop, the importation being busy
dreaming of home. I afterward took
B!ade in my party on a tour of the coun
try. He stayed with us till we struck
Utah, where he Joined the Mormons, 'and
he's there yet, 1 guess.
Just Why He Broke Jack Hogan'* Xoae.
Jack Hogan of Providence was one of
the few-and-far-between men to. knock
me down in a bout. 1 have already told
how I -ran into his fist,, but I <iidri't ex
plain Juet why Jack got the chance to
get me off my guard. It was very early
in my career -when I had few friends to
open the way fop me to exhibit my punch,
and It wasn't easy to butt into the game.
Hewing that there were boxing matches
pulled off every week in. the Theater
Comlque In Providence, I got Billy Ma
hosy to give me a letter of introduction
to Decis O'Reilly, a. man of prominenge
in that city. Mr. O'Reilly was as good
a sport and as fine a gentleman as his
namestLke, Boyle O'Reilly of Boston. :.
. I found Mr. O'Reilly In a. big dry goods
\u25a0tore in Providence, where he was mana
ger. Pushing my letter at him, I asked
him to he!p me get -an engagement. That
evening he took roe to the manager of
the theater tind I was put on -through
Mr. O'Reilly's influence. That was a real C
etart for me, Â«.ud I owe a great deal to j
O'R*illy, for he was a friend when I \
needed one. He had a better idea of what
I could do than any of- the others, and
although Hogan was the champion - ot
A'rovWence and , the best, man "they had
down there, O'Reilly asked me to go easy
with him. Everybody else thought I. was
a ctech for Hogan. â . . J
When 1 ran into Hogan's fist and. was
knocked down, 'I forgot my promise to
O'Reilly and smashed ': Jack on the nose,
6epdins: him into the wines of the stage.
O'Hellly came over to me and reminded
roe that I had promised to. be easy, arid
after that we finished the bout in a light
way. We looked at . Hogan's nosi^alter
the bout and fwund it was broken. I felt
eorry.that 1 had been co streuuoi*.. as
Jack was a good fellow, and me and
O'Reilly took ltim in a hack to Dr. Gardi
ner's office, where the bum beak was set
said i>ut in a plaster east.
"You've got a terrible punch, ' young
fellow." teald Mr. O'Reilly after we hud'
got Jack safÂ«Jy home, "and all you need
to be the best fighter living is tb learn
Kow to deliver it before the other fellow
connects. You look to me like a coming
champion." I nevtr forgot Denis O'Reil
ly'g kindness. and encouragement. ' and 1

Steady Stlnplnsr of the Frisco Sport*.
â¢Wie Sau Francisco sports have been
stung - ortcner. than any bunch in the
land, but they seem to like it- : They got
it 'pushed Into them by Britt; who; is
playins bcip-ecotch with Nelpon. and.thei
heera tv get U>Â« worÂ«>t stlng"^ from ooxera
that are native to their soil.' In tne.Eupt,
a battle in San Francisco is expected '\u25a0- to
be a gct-rlcb-quick Job. The sports who
pay to pee fights on the coast are/, the
l>ejjt ever, free spenders, willing to pay
for the best tfiere is. yet getting .the \

to the square men on the coast, and I
don't know ' any j better way" to '\u25a0 even up

""I" confess that you are very different,
Mr. Sullivan, and hereafter I'm not going

reply. "I find you a good enough sort for

Important Points About the Nursery
THE HOME OF THE TINY HUMAN EEING AND HOW
IT SHOULD BE CARID FCR ). --'.'."
â¢ Copyright. irO6. by A. S. Barnes & Co.
BY DR. EMELYX L. COOLIDGE.
THE nursery should be a large,
hlgh-etudded roora, having plenty
. of eun and an open fire. If pos
sible. Everything In the nur
sery should be washable; painted walls,
which may be washed down occasion
ally, are much better than wall paper.
>Â»"o heavy carpets or upholstered furni
ture should be allowed here, and the
room should be kept scrupulously clean
and dusted each day with a damp
doth.
At least twice a day the nursery
\u25a0hould be thoroughly airedâ in the
morning after baby's bath, and before
he is put to bed at night. During the
winter, while baby is so young, the
Bleeping room may be ventilated at
night by leaving a window open in an
adjoining room, or, if the weather. Is
not very severe, a window board may
be used, or a frame on which is tacked
heavy muslin; this may be from one to
two feet high and shut into the window
like an ordinary mosquito screen. In v
summer the window may be left' open '
without any other means of protection !
than a screen around the baby's crib. ;
As before mentioned, the baby must
Bleep in a crib of his own, and not In
the bed with, his mother or any one
*slse. An iron or brass crib without
rockers is the best variety to select,
and is much better than a bassinet
covered with draperies which catch all
the dust. A Gcreen or*a plain white
curtain of some wash material may be
used to keep off possible draughts. If
one cannot afford a regular crib for
the child, he may sleep,, while very;
young, in a large clothes-basket placed
on two chairs. , /
Crib Furniture. ' -
The crib should have a good woven
\u25a0wire mattress, and on top of this should
be placed a pair of heavy army blankets â¢
folded so as to ftÂ£ the win; mattress;
Text a square of rubber or other water
proof material, then a cotton sheet, - a
quilted pad. a second sheet, a pair of
wool crib blankets and a light counter
pane, which should be removed at night,
a down cornfortcror afghan taking its
place in cold weather. . V ,"..-.
The baby's pillow \u25a0'should be about one
inch hiÂ«h and made of hair, never of
feathers or down. Great care should be
taken to thoroughly air the baby's bed
clothes,' and the heavy army blanket
should be washed occasionally. On
bright, sunny days let the blanket hang
on the line out of doors for an hour or
two. In- this way v the blanket can be
kept much cleaner than a mattress, and
will be quite as . comfortable for the
baby until he, is 3 years old at. least. ~

fore the child is put to bed, or place a
hot-water bag between them.
By the time the baby enters his sec
ond month he may wear simple little
"Bishop" dresses instead of the plain
slips he wore at first. All his dresses
should be very 'plain and made of line
material, the only trimming being a
few fine tucks or a little hemstitching,
feather stitching, or a very -little nar
row embroidery at -wrist or neck. A
lot of ruffles and heavy embroidery or
coarse lace always look very much out
of place on a baby and are in bad taste.
These dresses should not be over thirty,
or thirty-two \ inches â¢at the most, _ and
may be. even shorter.

The baby â¢ is'" now old enough to be

his head and back. This shoud be done
at exactly- the_ same hours every day.

after a meal. '.This training should' be

to do so, though she may with
propriety after a ? few years; revive the
use of her own- Christian- name, thus:
'Mrs. Mary Pembroke Brown." For
two years and a . half a widow gen
erally uses black-bordered cards. Strict
etiquette says that in the first year of
widowhood the black border "should be
about three-eighths of an inch in width,
diminishing -in the second year to a
quarter: of an inch; and in the third
year the border can be left off entirely
or narrowed tor the first six months to
one-eighth of. an Inch, and in the sec
ond six. months to ; one-sixteenth of an
inch, and : after that dispensed with en
tirely. But, of course, a mourning card -

Trie joint card of a mother and daugh
tei,?or daughters. Is more used than
any card of this sort. The strict eti
quette in very fashionable society is
for a debutante .during her ttrst year
of making formal calls to have no
separate card of her own. but to have
her name .engraved on a card below
that of her mother. If she is the,eld
est daughter.- or eldest unmarried
daughter, of a family the card ta thus
engraved:
Mrs. Thomas Lane Brown
Miss Crown
The address la, as In all other cards.
In the lower rlsht-hand corner. If the
debutante has nn older unmarried sis
ter, she appears on the card as "Miss
Margaret Brown." This card Is used by
mother and'daushter jointly when call-
Ing together. The mother never uses
such a card when calling atone. But
during her" first year In society, when
the daughter calls by -herself she uses
a joint card of this sort and runs a light
pencil mark through her mother's name.
If a mother has more than one daugh
ter who, has :been' introduced to society,
she has engraved under her/ownname
on a Joint card "The Misses Brown" or
"Miss Brown, Miss Eleanor Brown."

tree will fall tt tea time. Study
this point two days before the affair,
making note of the favorable spots
snd how long the shadows linger
upon therj. Set small, light tables
and wicker stands upon the rugs,
spread with dainty tea cloths and a
vase of flowers upon each. When
practicable have the same kind of
flower in each vase, and lay as many
boutonnicres of the same upon each
table as there are chairs beside it.
Upon a larger table near the house,
snd shut oil from the sight of cu
rious street gazers, arrange pitch
ers of iced coffee, iced tea, tea
punch, orange sherbet or ginger
aje julep, platters of fancy sand
wiches or rolls, cake baskets and a
couple of dishes of salad.
Receive your guests in the draw

these be roomy, run around three
sides of the house and be well
shaded by a network of vines. At
5 or 6 o'clock, or at whatever hour
was named upon the invitation
â¢â¢ards, propose adjournment to the
lnwn; lead the way, and give per
sonal supervision to the important
task of seating the guests. Besides
the flowers there is nothing upon
â¢ the tables. A waiter serves to each
titter a folded napkin and a plate of
salad with a fork laid upon it. An
other waiter passes sandwiches or
rolls. A pretty variation of the
conventional sandwich is a long .roll,

- Have quiet games alternating with

children aren't worn out by excitement;
and have plenty of refreshments, but
only simple kinds.
If everything in the way of refresh

Packing Away House
hold Goods is a Fine
Art Which, to be
Successful, Must be
Studied With Care
Miss M. E. Carter
Copyright. 1333. by A. 3. Barnes <ft Ox
T X 7 HEN ; packing begins In'- good
\/\f .. earnest there should. be plenty
V y of tissue paper and excelsior
on hand for that work. Any
economy in .the use of soft packing stud
usually eventuates in dire extravaganca
in the way of destruction ancT woeful
disappointment when unpacking la. ,don-v
Far better is it to use too much than
too little protection against breakage.
Begin always with a thick bed of ex
celsior at the bottom, and be sure that
every breakable article has a bed of its
own and touches nothing -else. â¢ â¢ Ex
clusivenessls the law of -safe packing.
Each thing should be immovable, when
once it 13 packed.no matter how roughly
the barret may be handled -by porters
or expressmen. Everything ehould be
wrapped in \u25a0 tissue paper before it is
laid in the axcelslor. China, and glass,
indeed all delicate or brittle things,
should be packed by themselves in one
case,, and strong articles by themselves.
Dainty bedroom belongings ought to
be put up in pasteboard boxesâevery
thing . first -nicely wrapped in whitÂ©
tissue paperâ each .box marked for thÂ»
owner's next room in the new home-
Then." no matter who opens and puts
things in order: all will find their own
belongings waiting for them instead of
having to begin an immediate rear
rangement of misplaced pincushions.
bureau 1 covers and the other various
toilet articles of different members of
the family. '"â¢"Ph. what a lot of trouble!"
1: hear ' some on exclaim. Well. Just
bear in mind that you will escape much
more trouble In settling; besides, those
who do not enjoy and cultivate orderly
methods will not be happy in heaven.
as order is the first law of the king
dom of harmony.
BE TIDY ALWAYS
Kitchen utensils ought to be wrapped
in very strong paper before they arÂ«
packed. Paper wrappers prevent thÂ«
.excelsior from getting into things and
'from being ' scattered at unpacking
times. Every utensil before it is put up
"should be. scrupulously cleaned for tha
sake of having it ready for use as soon
as unpacked and because. If stowed
.ar/ay from the air for a time when not
immaculately clean, it will be unpleas
ant when it does come forth into thÂ»
light and alr.and doubly hard to cleans*
after being packed.
Whenever and wherever packing may
be done it saves a great deal of trouble
to have a large square of unbleached
muslin first spread down and all the
barrels and packing stuff kept upon it-
Then, when the work is over, the four
corners of the muslin should be brought
to the centre and everything taken up
at once without any sweeping before
the waste material is sent to the- trash
heap. There Is neither reason nor ex
cuse for reckless untidiness while pack
ing is going on or after it is done. This
applies to packing of every sort. The
appearance of â¢ some rooms after tha
.last occupant has packed one trunk
and departed indicates the mad con
fusion which would characterize a house
Just vacated by one- so disorderly. If
conscience and a decent consideration
for others are not sufficiently influen
tial, one would suppose that self-respecc
would govern the moving out as much
as personal comfort and convenience.
In packing mattresses and pillows they
should be carefully guarded against pos
sible soil. They are difficult to clean,
and cannot be easily spared long enough,
for that to be done. They ought to beÂ»
tlrat sewed up in strong muslin, then
wrapped and firmly tied in heavy pa
per. This should be done whether they
are boxed or go in vans. One can
hardly lay too much emphasis upon the
care that should always be given to
everything pertaining to beds. Thesa
should also be marked with tags fast
ened securely. One side of the tags
should be legibly inscribed with the
name of the proprietor and the address
of the new house; the other with tha
room to which they belong. â¢Painstak
ing marking insures comparatively easy
settling and avoids extra lifting and
moving. ...
The muslin covers should be left on .
all mattresses until the house is in or
der. No nice housekeeper allows mat
tresses to be exposed to dust or soil of
any sort, either in moving or in housÂ«
iceepmg times. . . -â¢ ; Â«.;- ;These Are

FAIR YACHTSWOMAN
GIVES HERRESHOFF
A KNOTTY PROBLEM
Mrs. Turner Farley of England Has the
Yankee Builder Design Her a 52-
Footer of Great Speed.
Rhode Island Wizard Fills the Order and
With the Boat Its Fair Owner Is
Winning Many Races.
Special Cable to The Call.
LONDON*. July 29.â For the first time
In. tea years a yacht of American de
sign and build has come here for the ex
press purpose of competing against crack
British yachts in class racing. The fact
that It Is to a woman Herreshoff Is In
debted for the opportunity to show what
he can accomplish, \u25a0 even when restricted
tc purely British rules and conditions, is
not without a certain appropriateness. It
was to a woman Herreshoff was Indebted
for his first Introduction to the British
yacht racing public. Fourteen years ago
Miss Winifred Sutton, as she then wasâ
a daughter of that gallant sporting bar
onet, the late Sir Richard Suttonâor
dered a half-rater from him. A few
years previously Sir Richard had made
an unsuccessful attempt to recover the
America's cup with the Genesta. It
was natural, therefore, that his daugh
ter, a true chip of the old block with
all her father's love of the briny, should
have a great respect for the skill of
American designers. A half-rater Is a
tiny between fifteen and sixteen
feet on the water line onlyâ but that
made no difference to Herreshoff. Her
design was a revelation to the English
yachtsmen of those days. Miss Wini
fred named her the Wee Win. and win
she did, beating everything in her class.
Next year Miss Winifred's elder sister^
Miss Maud Sutton. being ambitious also
to hold first place for at least a season,
ordered a bigger boat of Herreshoffâ a
craft Fome eignteen feet on the water
line. She reaped the reward of her faith
In the Yankee designer, sporting more
\u25a0winning flags at the end of the season
than any of her competitors, among
whom were some of the keenest of
British yachtsmen. In the following year
Herreshoff again scored as signally with
the ten-rater Dacotah and in the suc
ceeding yiar Howard Gould, with a
â¢twenty-rater of his designâ the Niagara
âmade almost a clean sweep of all the
prizes to be won in that class.
QKDKHS TUB YACHT.
It was no doubt the recollection of
the**> '-icteric* over British comp.tltors
In British waters, and others "which
might be cited, that prompted Mrs. Tur
ner Farley to give Herreshoff an order
for a boat to race in the 52-foot linear
rating class, the largest class In which
opei* racing, as distinct from that de
cadept form of the sport, handicap rac
ing, is- still carried on. Mrs. Farley is
a member of the Royal Dorchester Yacht
Club and an experienced yachtswoman
who can handle a tiller or trim sheets
in the best nautical style. Heretofore
most of her racing has been done in the
handicap class. Last year she won sev
eral prizes with the yawl Nebula and
that fired her ambition to enter a class
in which each yacht sails on its own
merits without giving or receiving odds.
That is the kind of racing In which most
glory is to be won.
But the task she set the American wiz
ard was a stiff er one tfian any he had
previously tackled for British clients. He
\u25ba was unfamiliar with the present Yacht
Racing Association rules to which he was
required to conform. These rules have
been especially devised to eliminate that
type of boatâ the racing machine, pure
and simpleâ ln which Herreshoff won his
earlier triumphs in those waters. The ob
ject sought is not the production of the
fastest boat possible within the specified
dimensionsâ a boat, that is, in which all
other considerations are held secondary
to that of specd â but one that combines
seaworthiness, stanchnes's of construction
and comfortable accommodation with as
much speed as ir-Istenee on these re
quirements permits. A yacht of this kind
â¢does not become a useless hulk on' her
owner's hands after her racing is over,
like Sir Thomas Upton's three costly
Shamrocks. She can be transformed into
a comfortable cruiser.
COMPLF.X REQUIREMENTS.
The component parts of the formula by
which the racing is obtained are length,
beam, girth, fineness of cross section and
call area- The length on the water line,
the beam, three-quarteis of the girth
from water line to water line, measured
with a chain pulled taut, four times the
difference between the girth measured
with a taut chain and that measured
round the skin of the yacht, and half the
square root of the sail area are added to
â¢ frether and divided by 2.1. For the 52-foot
raters the result of all these complicated
calculations must not exceed that figure.
And this was the sort of Chinese puzzle
that was turned over to Herreshoff to
work out and build a yacht in accordance
with it that would beat the best prod
ucts of British designers who were famil
iar with it.
The yachts pitted against his design are
, the Fife boat Maymon. which last year
' was regarded as almost invincible; the
Moyana. designed by Mylne In 1303. and
a new Myine boat, the Britomart, built
fcr W. It. Burton to take the place of his
.L-ucica. Mylne used to be a pupil of
Watson and is generally regarded as the
man most likely to take the place left;
vacant by the death of the great Scotch
. designer. Herreshoff was never a
stickler for looks. It is no surprise to
find, therefore, that the Sonya, as Mrs.
Farley has christened the boat he has
built for her, is anything but a beauty.
She Is. in fact, the plainest of the quar
tet. Sne uas a ltish free-board and a
straight sheer, and, being some' four feet
shorter over all than most of the British
52-footers, has a decided "box-ended" ap
pearance. In working out the problem of
striking the best balance between the di
â¢ mensions involved Herreshoff has adopt
ed that solution which allows him the
greatest sail area, -n fact, she has the
largest, sails ever set by a yacht of her
length In this countryâ on the water line
ehe has a trifle over 46 feet- -and spreads
approximately SSSO square feet, which Is
50 square fett more than Britomart and
more than 300 square feet more than
Moy&na. She is fuller in section than
the other boat, which means a" large
body to drive through the water, but Her
r*-ch"iT Is evidently .of the opinion that
; her larger sail spread would more than
â¢ compensate for that disadvantage.
SPRIXGS, HOLLOW MAST.
Her debut was made under discour
aging circumstances. Having 'sprung
The San Francisco Call.
her hollow mast in a trial cruise, a
solid spar had to be substituted for it
and in consequence of this mishap her
crew before the first race had had no
sail drill whatever. The wind j was
light, with little windward work. She
finished third, a trifle over three min
utes behind the Britomart. That was
not a bad beating over a twenty-two
mile course, considering the disadvan
tages under which she labored. - In the
races she has sailed since her hollow
spar has been replaced she has given a
very different account of herself. Thrice
ehe has crossed the winning: line first,
though once she was disqualified for a
blunder. In windward work in a sea
wayâthat point of sailing in which
Herreshoff has won so many cup
races â she has conclusively demon
strated her superiority over her competi
tors. In a good breeze, despite her tre
mendous sail spread, she Is remarkably
stiff, and takes the seas easily. At
reaching and running the new Mylne
boat thus far has been able to show her
heels to the Yankee cutter. But it is
the boat that goes to the windward
best which wins most matches.
The Sonya has done much better than
was to have been expected of an un
tried boat that had had none of that
"tuning up" so necessary to get the
best out of her that she is cap.ible of.
That she will improve as the season
advances may be expected with cer
tainty. She will suffer nothing from
being in a woman's hands. Mrs. Tur
ner Farley will spare neither pains nor
expense to get her in the best pos
sible shape. She is the largest racing
yacht ever owned and raced by a
woman, and to that distinction Mrs.
Farley is. ambitious to add the still
more coveted one of standing at the top
of her class at the end of the season.
She has an excellent chance of realiz
ing her ambition. But if she does it
will not be by such a wide margin hs
was recorded In favor of â¢Herrcshoff's
earlier creations, the Oacbtah and the
Niagara. The rules impose- too: many
fetters on his genius. "He has had too
many "don'ts** to contend with.
RUSSIAX AVO3IEX WEARY
OF COSSACKS' BRUTALITY
L'rfje Citizens (n Orcunlie Municipal or
Rural Militia for Defense Against
Massacres.
MOSCOW, July 29. â The following
resolution, passed by the Women's
Union of All Russia, gives a terrible pic
ture of the real state of things in the
provinces, where the Cossacks on the
one hand And the police with their hired
bands of cutthroats on the other are
making life intolerable to all those
classes of the population which are
worth attacking. It runs as follows:
"We women have been stirred to the
depths of our souls with horror at the
events that happened at Ivanovo-Voz
nesensk on the 3d (16th) of June. When
shall we see an end of these brutalities?
When will the blood of the Russian
people cease to flow here at home and,
In the Far East? We are â¢In despair,
having no faith that our bureaucracy
will ever put an end to this bloodshed.
Inasmuch as the bureaucracy itself gives
facilities for all these brutalities.
"We appeal, to society at large, to all
public institutions, organizations,
groups and political parties, to take In
their own hands the defense of the Rus
sian citizens, to organize their own pub
lic municipal or rural militia from
among the people themselves, as other
wise we can never be sure from one day
to another that these massacres will
not be repeated. We are afraid to let
our children out of the house; we are
afraid to leave the house ourselves.". '
"Our lives are now In a continuous
agony of fear for ourselves, for â¢ our
children, for all those.dear to us, for the
whole people of Russia. It is as if we
lived, not at home in our own country,
but in -the midst of our bitterest ene
mies, for they are no better, these Cos
sacks, gendarmes, police, hooligans (the
Russian / language has adopted, our
word), and agents provocateurs.",
' The ostensible object of the ' Women's
Union of All Russia is to secure. In the
hope of reorganization of the system of
government, equal rights for women as
for men, and the rest of the resolution
is concerned with that question.
Set Traps for Automobiles.
PARIS, . July 29. â Police , traps for
automobilists are now In operation on
Sundays In various parts of France. At
Villeneuve and St. Georges, near Paris,
the speed limit has been fixed at twelve
kilometers (seven and a half miles)
an hour, but speed not exceedihg
twenty is tolerated. Beyond, this limit
\u25a0 automobilists are held up much In the
same manner, as at, St. Germain last
year. As Villeneuve lies on the.splen
did main road to Fontalnebleau, police
captures are many.
A trap also exists on the road from
Milan to Como, and drivers are treated
in a very high-handed fashion 'by the
local authorities. \u25a0' -K'^^

WHAT SHAW
WANTS IN A
PUBLISHER
Prefers a Business
Like Gambler

Famous Author Ex
presses Himself in
Caustic Review.
Says Writer Is to
Market Odds When He
Backs His Work.
Special Cable to The Call.
LONDON. July 29.â George Bernard
Shaw has just been telling what he wants
In a publisher. Incidentally, too, what he
doesn't want. .Mr. Shaw's desiies in this
respect are expressed in tile course of a
characteristically slashing and . satirical
review of the now famous "Confession"
of an American publisher, which he con
tributes to this month's issue of The Au
thor, the official organ of the British So
ciety off Authors.
"All I ask on the royalty system," says
Shawâ after making fun of the 10 per cent
rate which he says the Voice of Nature
suggests to the publisherâ "is a modest
20 per cent or so, a three years' trial, an
agreement drafted bymyself, and an un
affected bookseller. I don't want ajcom
pulsory partner for life. I don't want a
patron. I don't want an ' amateur col
laborator. I don't want a moralist.. I
don't want a Telemachus. I don't want
a pompous humbug, nor a pious humbug,
nor a literary humbug. 1 can dispense
with a restatement of the expenses, dis
appointments, trials and ingratitudes that
pave the publisher's weary path to a des
titute old age in a country house. ..with, j
nothing to relieve its monotony but three i
horses, a Mercedes. automobile and v flat
in. London. -;T X have, heard it so often J^;T
don;t expect absolute"; trqth, being myself
a professional manufacturer of. fiction;
indeed, I ' should not â¢ recognize perfect
truth If It -were_dXfercd to me. I don't"
demand entire; honesty, being only mod
estly honest myself. '" \u25a0 , ' \ '"-;â¢..
"What I Waht'is a. businesslike gambler
in books, who will give m^ the"- market
odds when we bet on the; success! of -my
latest work. No doubt this is a matter of
individual taste. Some authors like the
bland and bald-headed commercial Mae
cenas, who loathes a degraded commer
cialism; tenders a helping hand to the
young, and is, happy, if he. can give an
impulse to the march of humanity. I can
only say that: these benefactors do not
seem to get on with me. They are too
sensitive, too thin-skinned, too unprac
tical" for me. The moment they discover
that I .am a. capable man of business
they retreat, chilled and disillusioned.
THE TIE THAT BI.VDS.
'"Not long ago one of these affection â¢
ate friends of struggling authors, rep
resenting a . first-class. American, firm,
proposed to bind me to him for life. Not
by the ties of reciprocal esteem, but by
legal contract. Naturally I said: 'Sup
pose you go mad ! Suppose*" you take
to drink! Suppose you make a mess
of my business!' The wounded dignity
nnd forgiving sweetness with which he
retired, .remarking that it would be
better for the permanence of our agree
able relations if we let the matter
drop, are among my most cherished rec
ollections." : . . "
Evidently the "confessing" publisher
has greatly entertained ".. Mr. Shaw.
Especially his remarks about that
"stray dog In the publishing world," the
author who places his work in the
best market without regard to former
associations.
. "Now that I come' to think of it,"
says Shaw, "I have done this' very
thing my very self. Dare I add that I
would do it again .to-morrow, without
the slightest compunction if ~I thought
I could J better " myself â¢ that "way? My
publisher's consolation is that though I
have no bowels, at least I do not pose
as his benefactor, nor accuse him* of
disloyalty because "he publishes books
by other authors. Granted that an
author with two or three publishers
may seem (In America) as abandoned
a creature as a woman with two or
three husbands, what about a. ' Solo
monic publisher with half a hundred
authors ! , .
' . "Whenever a publisher gives me lit
11 erary advice," continues Shaw, "I take
I' an instant and hideous revenge on him.
I give him business; advice. I pose
as an economist, a financier, and a man
of affairs. I explain what I Would do
if "I were a publisher; and I urge him
to double his profits by adopting^ my
methods.* I- do so'as his personal friend
and wellwish^r, as' his patron, his
counselor, his . guardian, his -second
father: I strive to purify the'- atmos-'r
phere from every taint' of a." 'degrading
j commercialism' â¢ (that Is how the Con*
fession puts it), and to speak .as man
jto man. And it always makes "the
j stupid creature quite .furious. Thus do ]
â¢, men misunderstand one, another. Thus I
twill the amateur, -to the end -of the!

LADY BLOUNT
TO LECTURE
IN AMERICA
Proclaims Theory
That the Earth
Special Cable to ThÂ» Call.
' LONDON. July 29.â Lady Blount. wife of
Sir Walter Blount. Bart.* and chler cham
pion of the "flat earth" theory, is prepar
ing. for a visit to the United States. Ac-)
companied by her private secretary. Dr.
C. t de Lacy Evans. Ph.D., M.R.C.S.. Lady
Blount leaves England early in August,
hoping before her return to convince
1 large.;. numbers of Americans that tha
familiar doctrine of Columbus in regard
to-' the earth's shape is an absurd fallacy.
New" York' will be the first place visited
and' from there her lady 3h.ij> will go as
"far AVest , as , Clilcaso. stopping at most
of .the. principal intermediate cities to
deliver lectures and distribute literature.
- Lady" Blount" s principal fad for a num
bVr' of years has .been this belief that
we are living on a vast floating surface
with" a secure anchorage. Intrenched
behind some clever arguments she ha.3
carried on relentless war against the
orthodox teachings of science, from plat
fcrm'and in her writings declaring that
nothing Is farther from the truth than
astronomy as it Is now taught. At con
siderable expense she has made Inter
esting- tests to disprove the "globular"
Idea and is perfectly willing to undertake
the American campaign without any
guarantee. of oaisido,; financial help.
Lady Btount'a doctrine has been ac
cepted by many people in England and
the Unltsd States. These believers she*
has organized into "The Universal Zetetlc
Society," and for some time Lady Blount
has been that society's president. Dr. da
Lacy Evans, the. private secretary before
, mentioned. Is tiie organization's vieÂ»
president.
Besides being a scientist. Lady Blount
la i. an accomplished musician as /well as
a verse writer of some skill. Some of her
verses are \u25a0 set "to music of her own com
position.

Not very long ago J. E. Fisher became
a member of Winnemucca Tribe of this
city and a few weeks ago he met with
an'accident. a heavy piece of iron falling
on his foot, producing an injury, whlcfh
was followed by blood poisoning . and
erysipelas. For a time It was thought
that he would have to have his limb am
putated to save his lite. It was dis
covered that through neglect he / had
failed to keep himself in good standing
in the tribe, but the fraternal feeling
existing in Winnemucca Tribe set aside
the strict letter of the law when there
was a possibility of saving the life of
one who had been a. brother. The tribe
had him placed in a hospital at a cost
of $6 a day and when the critical point
turned in favÂ«r of the patient H was
announced . by the surgeon that the in
jury to the limb required for complete
healing the process of skin grafting. To
accomplish this it required fifty square
inches of skin. This was furnished by
five members of the tribe, C. Pccua, J.
Tavallari, F. Buehn. C. Petes and G..Hal
lem. each contributing ten inches of skin
from the left arm. The operation was a
perfect success, and in a short time
Fisher will be well' again, thanks to the
fraternal spirit of men who did not de
sert one of their number because he had
been neglectful. In addition to this the
members of ths tribe are getting up a
benefit to start him in life as soon as he
If able to leave the hospital. V I?
The social given on the third Friday in
July In the Odd Fellows' building by
Manzanlta Council was another of those
social successes for 'which this subordi
nate of the order is noted. \u25a0 Between
dances there were vocal selections by
Sadie Burke. Miss Fitzpatrick and Miss
Harrison. The affair was admirably
managed by the committee, composed of
Frankle Conroy, Ella Wyatl. May Bean,
Frona Thompson. Emma Celestlne Wede
meyer. Georjre Griffith. Arizona Nichols
and James Wyatt. Mis? Annie Conroy,
recently installed ac Pocahontas of this
council, is one of the young members of
the order, but her ability and the, most
satisfactory manner in which she has
filled the various positions previously was
taken as an evidence that she would
make a first-class presiding chief. Since
her assumption of the highest station In
thejCOuncll'she has not disappointed' her
most ardent supporters, and.lt Is the
belief of all that before the close of the
term she will demonstrate that she has
been one of. the most proficient and ef
fective Pocahontases that the council has
ever hnd. :

hashed b>- me. It was only -the Or-
Pheum. For seine twenty minutes I
had been In a Temple o* the Dance,
watching some passionate priestess at
her devotions-. tthe had danced 'dithy
rambs, wild hytr.ns of the joy of liv
isig. the credo Â«Â»f a Cannon. It was a
soul adanoe. and 1 was there to talk
with it.- At nay side, fascinated, stood
the two beautiful Do Serris women.
Opposite gathered most, of the other De
Serris models, jrorshlpful, as are al!
good French folk, before art. Their
gleaming marbles, cool, still, Greek,
â¢ were tho foil perfect :or the palpitant
ivory and scarlet of La Bstelllta. This,
again, sold clad and quivering; under
the mad black halrj flashed by me.
"I have no breathe." she laua-hed,
par.ttnt and swt-epfnj: back her Mack
mane aÂ«> we Raid how-Uye-do. Senor
Gabardon, the s-orgeous and toreador
like person who "assists," was then In
â¢ troduced, r.nd we all went down to a
: humble little room under the star-?.
The situation li.id its embarrassments
for me. On Sunday I i.ud seen the lady.
In the next day s par er 1 had "said
things.' It waj this way: My pro
gramme said "La Belle" Â»:?tellita would
dance and sing. I had said there were
other singers. That was trainly be
cause I could hear but one word in
five of the 6oi.g â the unpardonable ou
the vaudeville stage. True, 1 had said
â¢he danced as Â«yell as Carmencita. You
can say no handsomer than that. I had
said, too, that from the chin down I
had no quarrel with the programme,
for the dancer is exquisitely made. But
â and oh. the big, awful "but" of it â I
had said "La Belle" EsielMta was not
so "belle." What SHOULD I say?
What would SHE say? What would
you have said?.
Probably if l had known Senor Gabar
don better * 1 t-hould have hesitated
longer about chatting with this* younjr
woman. And 1 should ha-c been very
sorry. It came out in the most amiably
casual manner that the gentle and re
splendent little gentleman who "as
sists"" was a famous bullfighter of
Madrid â a real toreador, fully entitled
to the conquest of Carmen?. He had
left the trade because his mother did
not like it. Also, as he came away from
Spain. La Belle EsteJllta added. Senor
Gabardon had promised that he would
no longer carry a knife â
"Because." Senor Gabardon amiably
nodded it over to me. *"I have so bad !
temper."
And here we were:
I besmn by telling Lr.. Belle Estellita
that I had been looking for the string
that hold her to earth. Only that. I
thought, could account for htr not tloat
injj away. She was taking- oft' her
gown iÂ«= I sr-oice. and banded it over
to me. There :.re pounds of it. Laugh
ing (she is always laughing), she said
at ay protest chut it was sfo<Â»d UiÂ«it th>'.
dresÂ« v.is so Ju-uvy; it "h< Id her down."
Lau^hine -iga'a, she held out an absurd
little foot. Â«> ,
""One year I *vcar tho>Â»- shoes." she
said. There was hardly a scratch on
the soles. The hiUin upper alone showel
signs of vt.ir. "1 am very light on
my feet." she explained needlessly.
But I was still looking at the foot.
Just Uiu Rtfmiacst ankle, the tinies-t toe
und the proudest instep of all Spain
perfcod ujÂ» before me.
"What size." 1 askedâ "if any? 1
"Twos," said the owner.
"Handpainted," added Senor Gabar
don. This was the stockings. He pointed
then to the tall gilt heels. â¢â¢She." he
went onâ and don't forget the capital,
Mr. Printerâ "is the only dancer on the
stage who wears heels like that. Full
Louis." Translated, "full Louis" spells
a. 2Vs inch heel, in this case set about 3
inches from the toe. There must be quite
4 inches square of La Estellita touching
the earth.
"Awful, tent it?' laughed the lady,
"but I have to wear them on account of
my instep."
The dress that "held her down," she
told me came from Bombay. It might
have tome, with its stiff, jeweled splen
dor, strange scents still clinging to it,
directly out of- the Arabian Nights.
Senor Gabardon's coat, by Retana,
. Eastre de Tereros (tailor of toreadors)
Madrid, weighs twenty-eight pounds and
cost $4000. That the dancer is from Ma
laga, whence come the "vino" and rais
ins. I learned, and that she hau danced
since she was five years old.
Then it was: "Tell me:"
It had come:
"Tell you what?" I asked. "Uh, yes;
"I want to tell you." she began
"And I want to tell you first." I inter
rupted, "that I have changed my mind.
I think now that 'La Belle' Estellita may
call herself *La Belle.' but I do not
think that the smile *La Belle' Estellita j
wears in public is a pretty one." j
"That is what the other paper said."
put in Senor Gahardon, quite imper
sonally agreed. Just as. impersonally |
Estellita said: "Yes, that Is so. Tell me, I
what means this?" picking up a news
paper. "This" was the "Presidential
smile" in which my colleague Mr. Stev
ens picturesquely recorded his impres
sion of the Estellita laugh.
I explained.
"And what is "hard as rivets?" she
went on. still quoting, and simply cu
rious to know.
I explained.
"Oh:" She took it and laughed over at
the mirror. "Oh! Now," she asked me.

â¢my brother-in-law used to say that if
I had only half my mouth 1 should be
the prettiest girl in Malaga!'
I haven't been in Malaga, but this
J registers a long distance agreement with
I the brother-in-law. Miss Estellita's eyes
! would redeem anything but her smileâ
l her stage smile. They are deep, fiery
brown, gold-shot, large, passionate, child
like, in short, beautiful. They are lashed
and browed in handsomest fashion, and
the nose is nicely made. The mouthâ
j well, the mouth IS large. Yet tha upper
| lip is classically short and well cut. and
! one has seen larger mouthsâ if not larger
smiles. We talked it all over.
j Exactly as if she had been some one
' else we talked it over. And as we
I taiiced La Belle Estellita v.ou'.d nod
I and frown and laugh at herself in the
l mirror. Her lack of vanity amounts to
I genius. It was with a quite magnificent
| unconsciousness of any awkwardness for
me that she questioned me about her
mouth, her teeth, her smile. She simply
wanted to know. As simply I told her. I
was to her merely the power that gave
j her the gift to see herself as "ithers see
\u25a0 her." She was to me a young woman of
peculiar sense and wit to whom what I
had seen might be of value. And so 1
told her. I talked to her like a sister and
a Sunday supplement. .After she put her
hand on mine and said simply: "Those
I are Just the things I wanted to know." ."
Of course i knew after this that the
"La Belle" Estellita of the programme
was not hers. "They would sign my con
tract only as 'La Belle,' " she said. But
I always before she had been programmed
as "La Estellita."
"Wait until next time," 1 laughed.
We got down then to the serious busi
ness of dancing. Where had she studied?
I asked La Estellita.
"Studied! I never studied," she cried.
"I just danced. I have always danced.
1 n*:ver had any lessons. I just danced
like all the Spanish girls, but more, of
course. I have danced ever since I was
five years old. No, I nver practice. Can't.
J Perhaps I dance better if 1 practice? "
"Impossible!"
"You are so good I" she laughed, "but I
cannot play when I do not practice and
it seems I must dance better if 1 prac
tice."
I had not seen before Spanish dancing
quite like hers, 1 said.
"There is not any," said Senor Gabar
don # in his amiable, proprietary fashion.
"1 was most pleased you say she dance as
well as Caimencita. But it is not the
same. I dance with all of them. I know.
Carmencita throw her head back some
thing as Estellita, but the dance not the
same."
That La Estellita's dance is a compound
of various Spanish dances, the Senor ex
plained. The Sevillanas, La Jota, Fango,
El Jaleo, the bolero, the Manzanilla, have
all contributed motives.
"People don't like.," the dancer * ex
plained, "the set Spanish dance. It is too
slow. They want something more fantas
tic. And so 1 make up my dances. I
like best, myself, the slow Spanish dance.
Always in private I so dance. You know
I dance sometimes for Mrs. Stuyvesant
Fish. Mrs. Bradley Martin, at Delmoni
co's. Sherry's."
"May I know what they pay for that
kind of thing? I asked.
"Hundred dollars." said Estellita.
"Fifty," put in Senor Gabardon, "seven
ty-flva and one hundred. Mrs. Fish
came in the carriage for her. Very
nice."
"You play?" I reverted, but I knew she
must. Very music of movement, light
as the leap of flame, quick with the very
soul ot rhythm, is Estellita's dance.
"A little I play," she said. "But music
is my life. I hear it, and up and down
my arms, my all over. I creep with chills
of It. 1 love itâ l wanted to be grand
opera" singerâ you hear my voice. And it
costs at least $50,000 to learn to sing.
Then I wanted to be great actress. But
I could not be that. I was all disap
pointed. Then I had always danced a
little, and so Estellita is a dancer. Don't
you laugh."ât his was to herself in the j
glass. She laughed more as she said:
"I will sit in front of the glass all ni^ht !
and study. When I laugh my face slips: I
I laujh all over. 1 cannot help it. I
feel to laugh, what must I do!"
: "Laugh:" I said.
We had a good look at the. family j
shawls then. I admired first the thick
silken hieroglyphics, flowers, man
darins, of the one the dancer
wears. Of one in the Estellita family, i
with its 600 embroidered roses, 330 years I
of history in the Estellita house, and a
$15,000 (fifteen thousand, Mr. Printer)
price they told me. Of another J
belonging to "Aunt Tita Victoria," one ;
that Estellita has her black eyes upon. ]
they plso told me. this fringed a half yard ;
and more deep. "How much is it worth," i
asked Estellita. â¢ !
"About $5000," said the Senor. !
She has lace, too. made by the patient ;
nuns, and priceless. One buys it for!
charity. Estellita sayp. and advised that }
when I. went to Spain I should tell the:
nuns it was for charity when I bought {
lace, otherwise for the .church. One gets j;
It for almost nothing so! !
With Spain came the bullfights, and a !
flash In the Quiet blue eye of Senor Ga- I
bardon.
"You were a real bullfighter?" I asked,
very respectfully.
Senor Gabardcn bowed, then said: "And
times, what of Japan, the little Giant of
the West, a nation where the simplest of
household utensils is a work of art?
I doubt if there be any sane being
dense enough not to perceive the psycho
logical effect of the presence of beautiful

the growth of art among us, and the
growth of the appreciation of art here

Mt)TES OF PLAYERS
AND THEIH WORK-
Madame Bertha Kalich. the famous
Jewish actress, will be under the direc
tion of Harrison Grey Fiske. manager
of the Manhattan Theater, and of Mrs.
Fiske, for an extended period. The
pronounced success of Madame '" Ka
lich's recent appearance in. English,
which was in the nature of an experi
ment to determine whether she should
adopt the English -'.stage as a perma
n.ant medium for her talents, resulted
in a great number of offers of a' Hat
"te*Mng financial nature made to her by
managers.
.Madame Kalich, however, has high
artistic Ideals and her venture into the
English' drama was made solely with
an artistic hope and purpose.- Thus she
preferred to identify herself with .a
management .in line with her ambi- j
tions and the contract with Fiske Is
the. result. The announcement: is made
by i> iÂ»Ke . that "Monna Vanna" will be
the drama in which Madame Kalich
will be introduced in New York under
his management. When the announce
ment was made some time ago' that
Mr. Fiske had secured the English
rigms to this play of Maeterlinck's thÂ«
public at once began to associate Mrs.
Fiske with its leading character. No
authoritative statement,- either by Mr.
or -Mrs/ Fiske, however, nas ever con
firmed this impression. ;
The fact is that while both Mr. and
Mrs. Fiske believe;that "Monna Vanna"
is a dramatic and literary masterpiece,
Mrs. FiskÂ« felt that she was unsuited
to the requirements of its leading char
acter. *'\u25a0 On the other hand both Mr.
and Mrs. 'Fiskcv have long believed that

and in personality, is ideally fitted for

as a mosquito, "if you will but follow my
teachings: but you must study, and
starve yourself, and drive out your flesh
ly longings." And the poor little crea
ture believes him with a faith born of
simplicity. When I saw her last she was
religiously fasting, and expectantly wait
ing to find "the world at her feet"â
whatever that may mean.
Needless to say much of her pin-money
has feathered the cozy nest of this
'"psychic" vampire.
To be sure, there is an indisputable link
between the known and the unknown in
the spiritual and mental worlds, and dis
cussion of these phenomena are fascinat
ing to capable, cultivated minds.
But to turn silly, vapid, shallow women
loose upon such matters, led by unscrupu
lous men who dominate them by their
superior mental forces, and thus fatten
upon their credulity, is criminal.
And that is what is going on right un
der our noses among women of the leis
ure class. â¢
If you doubt it. look up any of the Â«o

A beautiful time Alice Roosevelt Is
having over the seas:
Such an education as she is imbibing
falls to ihe ; lot of few girls â or to lads,
for that matter.
Not only is she dallying in the golden
court of love, with three suitors at her
elbow, but she is learning much of
strange and strange peoplesâ
not the*least of which was her uncere
monious meeting with the Honolulu
i-Tnart set. which had aonned Immaculate
white to greet the distinguished guests
of the Governmentâ and Miss Alice in
particular.
What a lot of glamour this Taft party
would be minus if the chic, saucy, orig
inal young woman of the White House
were to dror> out:
' When the guests landed at Waikiki
Beach it was intended to give Miss Alice
an informal reception.
But with her usual independence Miss
Alice decreed otherwiseâ and who can
!j!ame her?â when she sallied forth in a
smashing bathing suit, prepared to ride
the breakers in a canoe. Great fun.
bucking the breakersâ a lot* more fun
than standing about smirking and hand
shaking, and very much more to the
laste of this dashing American maid.
But at Tokio w; a where Miss Alice
caw things. Here she. v.-as presented to
a lot of lovely geisha girls, sweet as
< herry blossoms in May. who danced for
thf fair visitor in their fetchingest
f jphion.
Oh. yes; Secretary Taft was there too.
LiKewise Congressman Longworth, young
Stuyvesant Fish, and a few other priv
ileged visitors, but the geishas say they
danced for Miss Aliceâ and they ought to
know.
What a pity the dashing Countess Cas
sinl. Miss Alice's companion in Washing
ton, is not with her on this exciting tour.
What a smashing good time they would
have!
However, there's little that is missed by
the coy pet of the nation.

So George Bernard Shaw is distressed
about smart women wearing dead birds
and parts of their carcasses upon their
heads at theaters. Why doesn't he insist
upon having the women remove their
hats In the theaters of London, even as
they do in this provincial burg? Then
would the poignant suffering to which he
is subjected be reduced.
However, there is much cf truth and
justice in what he saysâ this bilious
chronicler of the ways of menâ about the
absurdity and suggested cruelty in the
wearing of dead birds upon their hats.
To be sure, there is nothing new in
what he has said in his recent diatribe
against fashionable women's foibles.. All
that he has said has been ureached lo!
these many years by Audubon societies
all over the country, but it is only by
iteration and reiteration that the public
receives Impressions.
U Is not so many years ago since al
most every "girl subjected Herself to the

BERL-N. July. 29<â The story has just

Frauenlen. On the morning after the
arrival of the imperial yacht Hohen
zollern at Kiel with the Emperor
aboard orders were issued to all ves
sels to raise the flag.
The Kaiser, who was watching froro.^.
the bridge of his yacht saw the
Frauenlen-flying a piece of dirty linen. '
such as is used to swab the deck. An
officer, sent by^-the Kaiser for an ex
planation, was Informed that the crew
had hoisted the Cag in order to call,
the attention of the Emperor to them,
as they wished to complain of the ex
cessive severity ot their captain.
The sailors responsible for the re
bellion were severely punished by the
Emperor's orders, the whole crew was
placed under arrest, while the vessel
itself was sent six miles out to sea to
remain until the Hollenzollern's depart
ure from Kiel. On the following day Â»
the captain received a personal not#
from the Emperor dismissing him from
the navy. .

REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
THE judgment of eminent lawyers and politicians of all the lead
in? political parties was invoked by the Legislature in the fram
ing of the present primary election law. It is clearly the pur
pose of the law that each political party shall have ample right and
opportunity to create a nominating convention of its own members.
The provisions of law which are intended to guarantee a free ballot
and a fair count in general elections are made applicable to primary
contests. Men are already in the penitentiary for felonies committed
at primary election booth's, and this incident will have greater force
in protecting the future purity of the ballot than a thousand appeals
to the conscience of the ballot-box staffers' On the near approach
of another primary election it may not be out of place to mention
the fact that there' are still cells at San Quentin and Folsom to ac
commodate other staffers.
Methods of lawbreaking 'other than those which involve the
open act of perjury are surely contemplated by political gangsters
of San Francisco. The ultimate purpose, however, is just the same
in one case as in the other. There is clearly a design upon the part
of men who are acting as promoters of so-cailed Independent Re
publican Clubs to elect as delegates to the local convention of â¢ the
party obscure rounders arid job-holders who have already pledged
their support to the slated members of another political party. If
elected to represent Republicans they will participate in the proceed
ings of- the nominating body, using all the influence and trading op
portunity at their command to bring about the nomination of a weak
ling for the office of ?\layor. and when the convention adjourns they
wiil go where they now belong, to the camp of Ruef and Schmitz.
The proposed independent delegations, sailing under the old colors
oi tlie United Republican League or under the colors of .the older
Republican Primary League, or masquerading as "Regular Republi
cans,*' have been selected and put forward to do the political work
of the known boss of the Schmitz administration. In some districts
the Ruef disguise. is adroitly presented. In other districts there is no
disguise whatever. The candidates on the independent delegate
tickets stand out in the open as Ruefters. ready and willing to take
any programme, at any time or any place that the jaunty little boss
may exhibit. Whether such delegations if elected to a Republican
convention may not be cast aside or thrown out is an open question.
Protection to square Republicans is afforded in this section of the
primary election law:
"1368 â Xo convention shall be illegal because of a failure of any
precinct or political division to elect, delegates thereto. A majority
of delegates chosen shall constitute a quorum, and each convention
shall be the judge of the election and qualification of its members,
and no .convention shall be recognized as in law entitled to make
nominations unless the delegates thereto representing the territory
or political division where the provisions of this chapter are man
datory,' or in force and effect, were elected under and by virtue of
the provisions of this chapter."
Republican citizens of San Francisco who entertain the belief
that good municipal government can be obtained under the auspices
of the party should vote for the delegates proposed by the San Fran
cisco Republican League. ' In ever}' district these tickets will be des
ignated as Anti-Ruef.
INSTITUTIONAL CHILDHOOD.
, T^HE annual conference of the Charities and Corrections of the
{ United States is held this year in Portland, as one of the fea
**â¢ stures of the Lewis and Clark Exposition. Judged by the brref
press reports of its proceedings the conference is beyond the statis
tical stage and has taken up many.of the social problems of the day
that come within public charity and correction in a .spirit of prac
tical frankness.
I;. The people have abundant opportunity to know that these prob
lems exist. Many magazine writers have dealt with them. The
most' of what is written is merely descriptive and much of this is
touched up to the point of sensation,- in order to satisfy the growing
demand -of the magazines for rank reading. No attempt is made
to find the responsibility for juvenile crime and dependence, and
none is 1 made to find a remedy.
The "practical workers, who are immersed in the atmosphere
of despair which envelops the problem, find out some things. One
of these is .that juvenile indigence and incorrigibility have a ten
dency to perpetuate themselves. One need not go far to find out
that this is due to what Dr. Lindley of Whittier has aptly called
"institutional childhood." The child raised as part of a wholesale
. lot in an orphan asylum or reform school at the end of its term
goes txit to be ultimately responsible for children who will be in
corrigible or indigent in their turn. The reason of this is that the
only place in which children can be reared to good citizenship is
the home. As Mr. Lindley said, what can a child know about home
c that is reared with wholesale prayers, a wholesale bath, wholesale
meals and manners, as one item in a mass of children?
When children reach adult age and go out into the world to
o found homes for themselves they remember the domestic ways of
their parents. The son remembers how his father provided the
house and the daughter how her mother adapted the provision wise
ly to the use of the family; and all children remember how they
. gradually became contributors to the family welfare. Of these
things institutional children know nothing. They sleep at night
in a dormitory, with its double row of single beds. They all rise
at once when the signal sounds and cleanse themselves in the
common wash roonj. They march to a corrimon table and are
served with food, and so throughout the day, whatever they do is
dbne as part of a common machine programme.
The State has taken them from indigent or incorrigible con
ditions and furnishes what its law calls a "home." California stands
- in loco parentis to 7801 orphan and half-orphan children, and is rais
ing them, wholesale, at an annual cost of $454,872 94. The juvenile
incorrigibles at Whittier and lone bring the number up. to about
10.000. These children are being clothed and fed and somewhat
schooled, of course, but something more than meat and raiment is
required to convert this formidable number into good and equal
citizens. . â¢ \* '.
The first thing to do is the abatement of the wholesale feature
in institutions, as far as it is practicable. At the Portland conference
Michigan and California were contrasted in the matter of the num
-bcr of orphan children who arc adopted into homes. California
suffers in the comparison. This is not a matter of chance. There
is a reason for it. The Michigan State School at Coldwater has as
little wholesale feature as possible. The children are divided into
families. Each family has a cottage and a mother. The same plan
is followed in the State Orphans' Home at Davenport, lowa. The
cottages arc suited to the average family of five or seven children:
They consider it their home, to which they go and where- thev. arc
mothered by a good woman. Each child" has its room; ami;, those
priceless possessions of infancy, toys and playthings: When chil
dren have enjoyed that measure of home life they are more sought
for adoption by childless people, and good homes with the full
atmosphere of home are more easily found for them.,
Even in institutions for the" incorrigible, jin this' cottage plan,
there is no .trouble in finding good women who will, mother the'
families. So overflowing is mercy, and the mother heart in. women
that no child, whatever its faults, is outlawed.
It was the right conclusion of the Portland conference that
much money is wasted in multiplying institutions, to be run whole
sale and to raise children as cattle are raised in' herds. Where a
: widow, is struggling to rear a family,, instead of : letting necessity
compel* her to part' with* her children, let the State assist her in
maintaining a" home for them. This can be^done at less cost than
their maintenance in an institution, and with infinitelybetter, results.
Wherever it is possible to keep children out oÂ£ institutional life' this

TRICKS OF THE GROCERY TRADE
f/\/|OST people would be astonished
I^l If they knew how many London
â¢ shopkeepers are' compelled to
resort to all sorts of mean econo
mies," said a Londoner who. is now
visiting this country, but served many
years as an assistant in a large
provision store in the English capital.
"I don't believe there is any Yankee
shrewdness. to equal it. Even the Lo
ndoners would be incredulous if one told
them that many of the shopmen, espe
cially those in the provision depart
ments, are 'absolutely'- compelled to
practice the tricks of the trade. At the
shop I worked at, if any one of the as
sistants was discovered giving full
weight he would be at once. dismissed
and another man more expert at
'weighing up' put in his place.
"This seems, I know, â¢ a sensational

FREAKISH RULES
IN MARRIAGE
PORTIONS.
AMONG novel marriage portions that
with which He?r Duchat3chek. a na
tive of Konissratz. dowered his
daughter must lind place. Her weight
m silver was- th* promised dowry, so on
the wedding morn, before proceeding to
church, she was welshed in the drawing
room before the assembled guesta. The
scales registered sl.xty-two kilograms, a
weight which brought the lucky bride a
sack of LJ,iCO silver, coins..
Similar instances of a bride's dowry be
ing in direct ratio to her co.poreal avoir
dujwis are on record. Some time back a
citizen of Huntlnjton, Conn., who pos
sessed a daughter of the abnormal weight
of four hundred pounds agreed to bestow
upon her a portion of $5 for every pound
she weighed. This offer brought forward
a bold suitor in the person of a Mr. Ma
rang, who gallantly led bis weighty and
well dowered bride to the altar. In Peru,
too, the bride's dowry consists of her own
weight, not in gold or In silver, but inâ
susar.
Weight, too, influenced Mr. Batt. a pros
perous English tradesman, when he in
formed his daughter that, as he admired
big men, her dovyry, should be graduated
by the excess of her husband's bodily
weight above her ownâ this excess to be
calculated in srold. The day previous to
the wedding the parties went to scale.
and . that the husband was a man after
hfÂ« father-in-law's heart can be assumed
from" the fact that he received with her
more than J2U.000.
i An old Lancashire (England) paper
gives an amusing account of a small
farmer who agretd to give his daughter
for a marriage portion as many guineas
as she could walk miles a day. The feat
came off In the neighborhood ot Manches
ter, and -the sturdy lass tramped more
than seventy miles. When, however, the
time . for settlement arrived It was dis
covered that the father was not worth as
many shillings as he should have paid
guineas, whereupon a subscription was
opened by the neighboring gentry, who
' admired the girl's pluck, and an amount
: was collected that amply compensated
her for her exertion.
A wealthy London solicitor whose
daughter had received an expensive edu
cation promised on her becoming engaged
to give her fifty times thÂ« amount she
could earn In a year by her own exer
tions. Though she found that her ex
pensively acquired accomplishments were
more or less a drug Â«i the market, she
managed, oy giving music and drawing
lessons, to earn sufficient to entitle her
to receive on her marriage the handsome
sum of 125,000.
Another father, who had but small
faith in his prospective son-in-law's in
dustry, agreed to sjive his daughter on
her marriage an amount corresponding
to that which the bridegroom should
make in the course of twelve months. He
had, however, counted without his best,
for the young man, chancing to obtain
fume good Stock Exchange information,
tabled a sum that the other could only
cover on his daughter's sweetheart
agreeing to advance the Uericit.
On receiving a very handsome tip from
a customer a waiter at' a fashionable
LontTon restaurant begged to thank the
giver in his daughter's name, and, upon
being asked for an explanation, said that
he had agreed to bestow upon her as a,
wedding portion an anjount equivalent to'
the tips he should receive in a year. On
the gentleman subsequently making in
quiries he was told by the waiter that
his daughter's dot. had worked out at
more than- $700.
oVery original wa.Â« the idea of a barber
who. on his daughter becoming engaged
to his assistant, determined tv regulate
her dowry by her sweetheart's ability. A
certain sum was accordingly set aside,
from which a fine was deducted every
time the nance chanced to cut a customer
when wielding a razor. This had the
effect of putting him upon his mettle,
and his reputation as an easy shaver
soon so increased the shop's clientele that
on his daughter's marriage Figaro's ex
tra takings more than compensated for
the money he was called upon to dis
burse.

In relation to saluting the flag: "tc
is the. custom of foreign ships of war
on entering a harbor or passing near
a~ fortification to display at the ma?a
the flag of the country In whose waters
they are and to salute it. It is the
rule, however, in our own and foreign
navies to fire salutes only between '3
a. m. and sunset. On the completion
of the salute to the flag a salute of
the same number of guns will be
â¢ promptly returned by the designated
saluting. station. United States vesa-3i.j
return salutes, to the flag. In United
States waters only when there is no
fort or battery designated to tlo no.
United States vessels do not salute
United States forts or posts and the
converse. Saluting stations for tho
purpose of returning the salutes of tor
eign men of war in the ports and the
territorial waters of the United States .
are designated In orders from time to
time by the War Department. The sa
lute-to; the. flag is. the only one that 13
returned and this is Invariably done
as soon as possible. The intervening 1

Parsifal â that Is the briefest, quick
est explanation to gi\e any intending
reader who wondors what is the mean
ing, of the title, "The Fool Errant."
-which. Maurice Hewlett has given to his
new novel. Th^'Fool Errant is hard
ly flawless enough to be called a Par
sifal, but he is of that type; and he
\u25a0was ever striving to make his heart
"more simple-mindedly pure. Was he a
fool? You ask. Count Geraldi. fainting
from a wound got in a duel with the
* Sool errant, answered that question
when he said. "Exquisite, fool!" and
then groaned. "Gesu.'l die!" He was
â¢ telling the truth born of . intimate
knowledge, with what he believed was
his last breath. The unscrupulous
Count had reference to the folly of his
antagonist's abnormal purity of regard
for women. "Exquisite fool," that " is
what Maurice Hewlett meant this crea
tion of his to be. and all the finer spirit
of his art has been exercised to per
suade us that a higher emphasis should
be put upon the adjective of the cog-
I npmen than upon the noun.
Fool he undoubtedly was, but by the
time you have read to the end of his
â¢ story you will probably say he was al
most a sublime one*. If beautiful folly
be a possible paradox, then such was
.the folly of this errant and erring
youth. He certainly could not be called
a foci in the sense in which the word
is used eondemningly in the Bible Book
â¢Of Proverbs. Of himself he says=: "Fool
as I have been, and fool as I have de
: clared myself upon the forefront of this
book. I have never said in my heart,
There Is no God; but much and loudly
have maintained the affirmative And
although I have been sadly, wickedly,
detestably errant from his way. there
tis one divine precept which I have
never failed to keep, and that is â love
one another." The book is a well told
.history of an interesting soul. Stupid
." in a way, and yet wiser than many men \u25a0:
who are not stupid, he was also sinful j
in a way, and yet so comparative^' j
pure that he seems to us to have pun- I
"isheu himself for his iniquity more se- J
verely than heaven would have re- !
quired.
PThe fool in his exordium, which he !
calls a "justificatory piece." thinks he |
has furnished good reasons for his i
memoirs, and the facts of his lift com- j
m^nd their relation to the philosopher,
the poet, the divine and the man of
â¢ feeling. Unhesitatingly an O. K. can be
â¢ put to that commendation â the whole
wide sweep of it, for philosophy, poetry,
feeling and religion, in a very fine and
free from cant sense, are among the
things you can get from the memoirs'
pages. Besides, you can get enter- J
tainment just for entertainment's j
take. There is wit in it h*;Â«1 humor. ,
As for language, just for language's ;
own sake, th<- book is a trensur*-. Taken |
as a fcentence-maker. Hewlett is so ex- ,
that doffing his story's Import- t
ance aside you can enjoy him immense- \
ly just for his periods and phrases. To j
one who can do it trtth suc'a facility ;
and effleaey the employment; the en- j
sla-.ement. the acceptance of the will
ing and thronging ministry of words j
must be a,<ieliKht. In many of those;
â¢sentences hi* head and heart and ear j
all evidently combine, triumvirate like, ;
in compelling or persuading the words j
to fit themselves most aptly and sonor- ;
ouEly to- his thought and feeling, j
t&inly language !s to him a slave that i
rerves as if it loved its master.
"l*nncffÂ» Antony Streily, Tennis-Bali i
of Fate, is the way the fool errant sets <
down his name, by the time he reaches ;
the thirty-seventh chapter of his me- |
r.ioirs raid one of the bitterest periods j
of his pilgrimage. He says of himself. ,
and the author is so convincing that ]
you feel he does it both truly and mod- j
estly. "I Dive been bare to the shirt and
yet proved ray manhood, beaten like a i
thief and yet maintained myself hon- i
r.Et, scorned by men and women, and yet 1
been ready to Mm my fellows, held !
f atheist by the worldly and yet clung to j
ray Savior's cross." .The new novel is j
bo good that hereafter the publishers ;
should advertrse Maurice Hewlett as I
â¢ the author of "The Fool Errant" in
stead of giving raofti prominence to _
some of the other good things which lie
has done. It waÂ«s a difficult
beautiful thing which he .. under
took to' do, this showing of the \

Kles. â¢Â£> 1
Francis Strclly had a Dantc:an streak
in his temperament, which enabled him
to love v woman with a devotion at
once passion.". to and pktlonic. making a
Beatrice of her, and doUigr it as ador
ingrly as a poet might. He played the I
fool, however, by thus adoring a woman I
who was no Beatrice and could not be. j
â¢ Th" only kind of love she was capable j
of ' Giving him was a futility to ! them I
both, for she was a. married woman and J
he ivas a Parsifal. He was such a. fool
that he could not find this out until, as
the Bible expresses it, he was "brayed
in a mortar," and his folly did not-de
part from him until the woman he had j
idealized and adored "broke her own;
image and killed his love outright." - .
He was somewhat like Dante, too, in
this, that h<? could have a wife of his
bosom at home and yet adore another
â¢woman Beatricianly. One stage of our
hero's history was of like romance, or
iniquity, to that of the Inferno's author,
who, 'â¢lovingr Beatrice, married Gemma 1
Donati, and proved the reality of his'
tie by making her the mother of many
children." ThcTlescription of. that. part
of his soul .passage is "one of the fine
things in the book. Its chapter, is called
"Tempted in Sienna." Don't miss.it. He
did not take his double -loving so con
science easy as Dante and Plutarch did'
theivs but in the pain of the dilemmx
of It, because in a way he loveu nis wits
very dearly unu owed her high ailegi
ance, and because the fiood vi the recur
rence of his adoration for the otner
could not always be stayed, he weÂ§u to
pray at the altar of the Madonna of
Provenzano. Now this Madcnr.a was
reputed to be kind to all the unfortun
ate of the world, and to the "most un
fortunate of all she was mother and
friend." The foci errant asÃed the sa
cristan, "And whom do you call the
most unfortunate of all?" and received
this answer, "The most unfortunate of
all, sir, are those who have to pretend
to lq*-e when they do' not feel it."
So Francis Strelley kneeled /him
down and prayed, "O most tender ad
vocate of them that need tneel Cast
down thy compassionate eyes upon me
too. that in their light I may strive
again. ' N
Now Sienna, where the altar heard
his prayer, is a sacred city, and it was
the own city of that lair woman whom
the fool errant had adored as his Bea
trice. Shortly before.his prayer he had
stood under the star-strewn roof of
the great church where he knew she
worshiped. He "knelt where her knees
must have *>ressed the storied pave
ment."
, Soon after his prayer to the Ma
donna Provenzano he received a letter
fron his lost wife. It began thus:
"'Master, lord and excellent iiusband,"
and it ended so: "If you need her,
or what sbe hath of thins, thou wilt
find liÂ«-r at Arezzo, an honest woman,
who kisses thy hands. -
I omit signing the girl's name, be
cause when you begin to read the book,
and read it you must, I do not wish
you to know wuicli one of the women
became his wife. You should be kept
guessing about, that ana .find .it out
gradually as the story and the charac
ters develop." .It is Jtoo fine a story to
rev;il too much about It prematurely.
You will please-to note that little clause
in his w4fe'Â»-.4etter,i J *orâ what-slie -hjith
of thine." .It was .' n<ws" to him, you
know, or might grucss.
When the Fool Errant read that let
ter he carried It with him 6traight to
the altar of the' Madonna Provenzano
and held It up before the veiled image
of the mother of Christ: "Here, lady, is
my duty, here is my hire. 1 will never
shirk the yoke, put . upon me. Yet do
thou. patroness, make it sweet." He
kisred the letter and put it into his
bosom. He intended to go to Arezzo,
but fate, still' hard upon him, hindered.
However, the Madonna answered that
prayer most, bountifully, and the girl
for the love of whom he knelt at her
altar became, both his wife and his
Beatrice.
' From theso hints and fragments you
may guess whether you would like
"The Fool Errant" anÂ£ pardon him for
his sins and stupidities, for which he
punished himself so severely that much
of his life was bitter-sweet as purga
tory. Little more need be said. It is
a trite of an Englishman living in Italy
and lovirig Tuscan women. It is told
with ?O'.ne of that honest lack' of re
serve which Hewlett s.-rys is a trait of
the Tuscans. In it thcrp arc occa
sions when Francis 'fftrclley's extraor

NEW NOVEL BIZARRE
AS IS ITS TITLE.
Birarre as its title Is the new novel,
"Black Butterflies," by a local authoress,
Beuhe St. Luz. The black: butterflies
have little to do with the book beyond
making a strikingly odd name and hind
ing for it. Once they flit picturesquely
around a sundial Jn the presence of a
beantful, newly made widow, who is
ever co glad that her old husband is
dead, and that after seven yeara of hate
ful bondage to him she at last is free.
The story deals with the mystic and Is
dedicated to the order .of Mystic
Shriners. so the butterflies may symbolize
something,' but not knowing the signifi
cance we will leave them on the outside
of the book "and get to its Inside. Once
there we find that so far us the heart of j
the story goes it might be called "The |
Fair Lady, 'the Hindoo, and the Hunch- j
back." There are other people in the i
book, but\we will omit them to con
centrate attention on these three. . One I
of those left out I regret the omissfon j
of very much, namely Rosamund Arbuth- j
not- I am grateful to the author for the
creation of that sweet woman, \u25a0 and -so,
doubtless, will all her readers be. : '
First as to the fair lady. Her dead
husband had baen "a vile, graceless^ old
individual," and so we do not blame her
a bit for being* glad that her bondage
to him has been ended by deaths She
had stood \ it for. seven years and she
was young. : ; She is described as having
dauntless bearing, splendid physique.
There are "sundry incipient whimsical I
traits In the : lovely face wherein there â¢
Is a baffling, something, changeable as a
cloudy sky, unerringly' indicating â¢ frail
ness of character.". She Is magnificently
tall, and at a party dwarfs all the worn- I
en present. . She has red hair. In grace
of movement she Is of that style which
suggests comparison to .- a leopardess.

dramatic about this short story. It is
too ghastly: but hn mity have intended
if'to bo stropfrly that way In order, to
emphasize his point, which soenis to be
that- in a certain type of man there is
a .'Strange mixture of constancy and In
.-. constancy â thÂ«r. the}' arc capable of ter
r:blÂ«- frailtier. ;unl terrible voluntary ex
piations. One of the. expedients of mak
inpr_ii qroo<l ehort sttfry is to burst upon
the'reauer with n sudden surprise whei.
doe to finis. It is the art of this one
, to' end with -i double surprise. There
is riclevity nboutjt. Even the wager
was not for spurt, :>ut, almost solemn
ly .lone and for a, seriou? purpose as
motive- toeach woman. - i
The'rf is enoiu/h of beauty mixed in
the outcome in retleen; it from beinsr
unrcadnbly ghastly.
The story opens' with the man - sin
cerely ". mourning nt the burial of his
young wife. He is a baron and thirty
one years of p.jje.'. His grief isTpictured
us real, and of the intenser kind. .The
two women observe his sorrow. "Every
cnerealized the majesty, of this grief
that' cut him off from all intercourse
with, happier ones."
After he is ' gone the two women
remain . behind and talk over the
tvtnt. -They hnve been friends from
girlhood. .The younger- one i 3 happily
married and believes In man's con
stancy, and In this particular case feels
positively assured of it; that he j has
been deoplj- In love with his wlfe.and
will :not. soon recover- from : the^ blow
of ;her. doath. .This truster is, and al
ways has been, a gropti girl, i Not so the
singer. They, belong to "different "worlds,
but the. steadfast . friendship of the
young?: woman refuses to cut theac
quaintancc. ..The, singer : argues the
man's . gay past.; The â¢ married womun
claims that his life with his pure con
sort "must have :: influenced his ' char
acter. The purpose of the', worldly wise
one. is to make her yoting^friend--sen
sible enough to realize that it is' not
safe to. regard the world through rosy
spectticles. ' The r young ; wife expressed
her. motive ..thus:" "I know it is cruel
to*AvagerJc.bout;SO serious a thing; but
to cure you of your pessimistic opinion,
I consent." . . . . .; ;. .
.It .would be perhaps a difficult ques
tion in casuistry to ask. which one iof
the women wop. the wager. The very
circumstance of the man's sleepless
ness from; grief > gave the beauty .her
opportunity. She used It with consum
mate -cleverness. -The weakness of
seeking- for sympathy; -the force of an
old intimacy, and friendship; the power,
thÂ« i gleam of. bared white should
ers â all - these- got in, ;th^lr, ."work
against Jiis. constancy. Then he. went
quickly .to 'the grave of his wife and

mystepr^and ' the,' plots 'of [the politicians
there is^ one" that,, concerns la '.woman's
honor,:jahd;theinlial;dutyVof the- proud
son of a proud mother. In the desk of
the murdered man is found a sealed let
ter announcing that he was the illegiti
mate son of a prominent judge. The
judge himself writes the lettex and ar
ranges "that it shall not be opened till
after. his death.' He gives no clew to who
was the mother of this child born out
of wedlock forty years before, except to
say that she was of brilliant mind and
shrewd resource, which had carried her
far in the social world, and that she had
refused to accent the offered marriage
that would legitimatize the child. The
men who are working to unravel the
mystery of the murder are keen to find
out who this woman is, because they
think that behind that discovery they
may find a clew to the motive of the
crime and trace its perpetrator. The fine
point of honor and chivalry then comes
up as to whether a woman who has lived
down. the fault of her girlhood and main
tained-a place in the social world, and
probably with high family connections,
should be exposed and dragged down on
the bare chance that this revelation
would be of use in detecting the- mur
derer. Another complication comes from
the fact that In the investigations it is
learned that ijhe murderer had stolen a
batch of papers which contained infor
mation which some people, | though quite
innocent of the crime, very much wished
to prevent from becoming public. A
fstrona scene in the book is one between
or.c of the snrewdest and best of the men
who* are trying td trace the 'crime and
his mother. She, pleads with him with
great earne3tnes3 not to persist in his
endeavor to reveal-who was that woman,
high "in social life, who was the mother
of the .murdered man, and who had re
fused, to acknowledge that he was her
son. ; The story is told po as to cleverly
hold Its mystery until the last few pages.

NEW MAGAZINE HAS
VER V WIDE FIELD.
The new magazine, "American Homes
and Gardens," which succeeds the well
known - "Scientific American Building
Monthly." will probably 'attain a still
wider Buccess under its new title and
plan than was reached by the for
mer series. The name is much more at
tractive for one thing. The other title
.had a sound as.if it was for architects
only, but this new name will tend to
make the magazine wanted . by every
body who has a home either In reality
or prospect, and even by those who mere
ly wish for one. To this last class it
will have the potency of the unknown
quantity whose exact amount may never
be solved and yet we can easily guess it
must be great. It will certainly stimu
late aspiration, and that. is nearly always
the predecessor of attainment. XÂ» doubt
many of the most beautiful homes which
will. bp; illustrated In this magazine were
once as. visionary as: the dreams of hope.'
.The ; plan of combining - the subject of
building" with- that- of t gardening, so as
to make It cover, directions and sug
gestions for -'complete home: making, is
very good.; ;"For,-. the modern house is
hot o : structure. . standing apart by itself,
an "object 1 apart from. every other object,
but it, is distinctly related to everything
adjacent to it.'.' It Is claimed that ; the
best ; domestic work of our leading archi
tects is to ; be illustrated with a com
pleteness- of detail \u25a0 not attained by any
other "publication. - ..The programme laid
out is a- broad one, "for it leaves, noth
ing/untouched ithat relates, to the physi
cal ':asj>ect;: of -the' home, and Is directly
concerned ;with' the^ influences these con
ditions . have' upon' the home life itself."
That sentence \ will -som to remind us
that> there ."can \u25a0 l^e I little "doubt that beau
tiful /surroundlngs;tend to "induce beauti
ful ! thoughts, - sweet < emotions, and fine
conduct.'. So-;the~ enterprise of this ad
vancing -; magazine will, no doubt, help
greatly in imuUiplylrisri'the noble homes
of -the '."nationâ using the word noble to
apply both; to the abode and. to the abid
ers 1 therein. " .'.'>..
:Ohe* of Uhc many fine illustrations in
the ? first number^ is of " "Hllhouse." the
Italian villa -of Floyd Ferris, at Harts
dale,^ New ;Tork. There is said ', to be â¢\u25a0 no
more .attractive ;\u25a0* and : picturesque - bit ' of
country- within a radlU3 of twenty miles
of-! New.York City : than , is the. village of
Hartsdale. In th'js.- lovely environment
the house is situated on a plateau. : lit is
designed after the Italian style, and the
design is carried out with a beautiful
simplicity. The walla are grey stucco
and the roof harmonizes with it, being
of green copper. The columns of the
porch and loggia are made of cement
and molded into form. The capitals are
tinted in the color of terra cotta. The
blinds are of solid wood, and are painted
apple green. The copper roof has
changed its color to a mossy green that
harmonizes well with the varied greens
of the trees surrounding and overhang
ing it.

for fall .publication, through Paul Elder
& v Co.. San . Francisco, "Woman
hood in Art," a volume of essays In ap
preciation of the Venus de Mllo, Eve.
Mona Lisa. Madonna of the Chair and
the Slstlne Madonna. The. viewpoint Is
in analysis of the esthetic interest an*
the ethical message to women of these
noted art expressions rather than techni
cal art criticism. The publishers an
nounce that the volume is to be a gener
ous sized pags set in large faced primer
Caslon old style type and is to be illus
trated.
Another art work. . "Impressions of
Ukiyo-ye." by Dora Amsdon. recently
published by Paul Elder, & Co.. has
been very favorably received and
will soon so into a second edition. A
work of a different type, "Prosit, a Book
of Toasts." i 3 on the press for the third
edition, each of the preceding having been
of several thousand copies. A portion of
the new edition, will be bound in flexible
Spanish leather for holiday purposes.
Volume VII of the edition of "The
Prose Works of Jonathan- Swift,- D. D-,"
edited by Temple Scott, contains the
"Historical and Political Tractsâ lrish."
It will be welcome news to the owners of
the volumes of this* edition to know that
of the two volumes that have not yet
appeared. Vols. .XI and XII. both are
so far under way that their publication
may be looked for during the present
year.
Among the book 3 of this - season, few.
if any, are of greater educational import- 1
ance. than Peter Kroi>otkln*s "Russian
Literature." It Is the first volume *in
English dealing with the subject; and its
value lies not only in its historical and
biographical features but especially in its
large number of passages translated from"
Russian masterpieces never before ren
dered into our.language. Professor Maur
ice.. Francis Egan, at the head of the
English department in the, Catholic Uni- :
verslty, "Washington. D. C. says In a letter,
to the publishers: "In some of my classes
at this university I have been obliged to
suggest "to students books that- would
introduce them tc foreign literatures.
â¢ â¢. * For this purpose I found De
Vogue's "Roman Russe' very valuable,
but - 1 always felt that a more pompre^ 1
hensive book written from the Russian
point of view was .needed. Prince Kro
potkin's 'Russian Literature* quite satis
fies my needs, and I find it Indispensable. \u25a0
It is a necessity for every college and
university library."
. One of the last letters written by the'
late : Secretary Hay was received by
Colonel Clark . E. . Carr in reference -to
his book. "The IHini." ,Soon after thÂ«
publication of this work Mr. Hay had
written Colone! . Carr,. congratulating '-
.him on the book, and it , was in confir
mation of some comments he then made
that the second letter was sent. John
Hay Is onÂ«Â» of the prominent characters
in "'The ~lllini."* and the depiction of :
him .In early life Is perhaps ' the best ;
to be found anywhere.

CONTKACTOR OBJECTS j
TO "KATTLER" TESTJ
City Engineer's Rules as to
Basalt Blocks Subject of J
Complaint.
John W.McDonald.'of the City Street j
Improvement Company, complained j
yesterday to the Board of , Public j
Worksrthat' City Engineer Woodward (
was subjecting basalt blocks to the:
so-called "rattler" test, although the
board itself had not imposed that con
dition as necessary for the acceptance
of the blocks for street work. The
test consists in placing samples of the
blocks in a.machine which rattles them
together for some time. The blocks
are weighed .before and after the treat
ment and if lose more than fifteen
per cent they are rejected. Woodward
bays the test is; required because some
of the blocks* lose.- more than fifty per
cent in the "rattler, and therefore are
not fit for paving purposes. It is said
that McDonald has a quarry from which I
basalt blocks arf taken that will not ,
stand the "rattler"- test. |
Next Wednesday the board will
award contracts for the paving of Va- I
lenciti street with bitumen to the City j
Street; Improvement- Company, for im- j
proving XI street. from Forty-fifth ay- \u25a0
enuc to 'I the Great Highway to Owen j
Mcllugh,. and for the. oiling of Fulton j

SHERIFF BARNET GATHERS CROWHURST
INTO THE FOLD OF SUSPECTS.
OAKLAND. July 29. â Sheriff Barnet
has added James Crowhurst to his list
of suspects now held In the County
Jail for the assault on Thomas Cook
last Saturday night, making the fonrth
member now in custody of the gang, to
â¢which John Schneider, George . Blaker
' and Percy Pembroke belonged. An
other important development in the
case was a confession or statement
made by Pembroke to Sheriff Barnet
this morning, in which he gave him
certain information, concerning -some
plans he heard Schneider and Blaker
â¢making. .
It is known that Schneider, Blaker
and Pembroke were together early Sat
urday evening last and when a third
man was implicated by the statement
of Cook to his doctors the Sheriff im
mediately sent out and had Pembroke
arrested and to-day he followed- this
up by taking Crowhurst Into custody,
as he is known as the ringleader of
the" gang. In the meantime the Sheriff
is waiting anxiously for some word
from the bedside of the injurtd man,
from whom he is in hopes of getting a
statement shortly that will clear up all
his doubts.
In regard to the identification of
Schneider and Blaker by Cook, Dr.J.,
H. Callen said this morning: "Cook was
as clear in his head as you or I are
â¢when by words and signs he told us*
how many men assaulted , him and
stopped us when we struck upon the
rifht name in the suggestions we made
to him. The fact is that the part of
the brain having control of the nerves
of the tongue and vocal chords is seri
ously injured and he can only say yes
and no.
"There is no question that he knows
who the- men are and 'that if he re
covers will be able to tell their names, ,
but the fact of his terrible injuries at
the present time prevents us from ;
pressing our inquiries. He got so ex- j
cited in trying to make us understand
who the men were that we had to stop
talking to him and I have had 'him un
der opiates ever since. His temperature
went up immediately and I cannot af
ford to Lake another, such chance.. I
cannot say when we will be able to
talk to him again, as it will depend en- j
tirely upon his temperature and pulse. \u25a0
If it gets at all near' normal we might I
try again. lam as anxious as any one

was getting weaker. It Ms feared that I
there is little hope of his recovery.. His â¢
Inability to talk, it is feared, will pre- j
vent him from even making an ante

if he should die there is little or no evl- j
dence so far as he is concerned that can j
be used against the men now \u25a0 under j

this morning tends to throw suspicion j
on Crowhurst as being the' third? -one j
Implicated. While he states that he did i
not know of any conspiracy, he was \
with Schneider and Blaker 6bortly be- i
fore the assault on Cook and he said \
there was some mention made about j
their meeting Crowburst. One of the \
two, Pembroke says, said that he would j
have nothing to do with him. The two, j
however, be says, held a whispered con
versation, which he did not hear, and
about tipt time he left them.'
boke's Satement accounts for every
minute of the time that night "and
Sheriff Barnet is much impressed with
it. but until Cook dies or is able to
make a statement he intends to keep
all four where he can get them at a

party.. Willard is a very wealthy man.

OPPOSITION TO WILIJARD.
Manh' is' conducting a very vigorous
campaign. in- his State. He seems to be
a person of strong individuality and is
logical and direct. He has brought up
the alleged opposition of Willard to
what is known asthe "Jim Crow" -law.
This law is one that separates whites !
from blacks in street-car transit. The
negro question, rankles strong as of
yore In the Southern breast and. Mann
gained some headway with his argu
ment, "Willard .is in favor of letting
the: negroes ride with white people."

alleged effort to have the law. abolished

STRIKING GAINS

Shares Show Gain
DEALERS iRE CHEERFITL'
Exchange Feels the Effect
of the General Improve
ment in Crop Conditions
NEW YORK,' July 29.â Yesterday's re
vival of speculative animation on the
Stock Exchange was fully maintained to
day. There was a good volume oT busi
ness and some striking gains were re
corded. The market showed the effect to
some extent of the. desire to take profits
on the week's " gains " and the' principal
active stocks were not inclined to ad
vance with vigor. The news of the day
was not important and was of no ap
parent effect upon the prices. The net
result of the week's operations on .the
surplus reserves of the banks was small,
but this was due to the offsetting effect
of 6ome large gains in individual items'.
The $18,500,000 expansion in loans was
attributed largely to the taking over of
loans from the banks to the- trust cqm
panles as the call loan market offers
no greater profit than the, rate by banks
to trust : oompanies on their deposits. It
is Burtnlsed also stirring of speculative
interest in the. stock market has resulted
in I some increase of borrowing for that
account. The gain in cash of $5,942,700
was much larger than expected. 7 and
operated to conserve the margin of the
surplus. "Weekly reports of the mercan
tile agencies helped to foster the cheer
ful feeling over the business outlook
which has great weight in Wa-Jl street.
A feature of the day was the new record
price for Delaware. Lackawanna and
Western at 410. accompanied by rumors
of another intended ex.tra dividend on
that stock. The firm tone of the. marke-t
continued up to. the close. Bonds*were
steady. -Total sales.par value $1.660.000. - -

Is so variable a rule as to make the pres

the principal discussion has centered
about the spring wheat: Buying of stocks
early in the week, was attributed .to a
demand to cover "by shorts who had -sold
last: week when reports were current at
large damage by black rust. Conditions
during the week have been reported fa
vorable to the grain crop. Money has
remained very easy and the foreign ex
change rate, after an early advance,

The bond market has continued rather

[ LONDON, July 29.r- r .Wliatever Eng
j lishmen generally may .thjnk of the al
leged superiority of their railway sys
tems for passenger service,' there is but
one opinion on the part pf the man
Vwho pays the -freight." The farmers
land fruit growers of the -country have
special cause for complaint. . Some of
the most prominent of the latter are
likely to leave off cultivating fruit en
tirely^because 6f the poor railway ser
vice. In fact, the railways arc largely
responsible ' for- the" gradual desertion
of the land in England. ;. , â¢
This treight question has become
j more than usually prominent. ; at thp
i height qC the, .fruit marketing, season
and the' statement made by one- shipper
jis.Â£Â» fair reflection of -the entire, situa
tion. This producer says: "For several
years I ha\ y e cultivated a 500-acre farm
and would havu extended fruit cultiva
tion almost Indefinitely, as London pays
j the hisrhe'st price in the world for fruit.
, but the railway over which I have beeii
i compelled, to Bfiip* will not make suit
j able arrangements for cpnvcying pro-
I duce to market, although I am..prepared
jto ship in carload -lots. Tliig railway
will, for days-'At &\u25a0 time, miss the mar

j several weeks because of delayed ship
( ments, and this year the f ruit \u25a0 is ac
< tually spoiling without being picked for
â¢ want of. transportation, .facilities. 1
I have- no remedy.' 1 cannot 'right, a rail

$60,000,000 pÂ«r year,-, '.and-, there- is no
governmental 'department' which exer
! cfses'*Aiiy real 'cojitrol, '.over the rail
ways, 'The b'nly thing I'can do is to
leave off cultivating -the" land and find
some other occupation."
â¢ The -railtvay side' of the case resolves
itself into;on^ of pure rflnance. There
; is more â¢ money in catering to passen
ger: traffic than" fr'eigttt: If there was
more' land â¢ in England 1 it would be
worth' wh.ile : for the .railways, to en

VALLEJO. July 29.â As the smoke of
the terrible Bennington disaster -fs clear :

B. Fergeson, -chief machinist, was among
those. who lest their lives in the. Benning

it was not known that he had any par
ticular friend on this coast, although he
was well known in Vallejo and San Fran
cisco, It now develops that he was en
gaged to MiSs ida Alexander of Millbrae.
San Mateo County. The young lady vis
ited Adm.ral McCalla, .commandant of the
Mare.' lsland.. Navy Yard, to ascertain if
the Government would bear the expense
of bringing the body of Fergeson from
San Ditgo to San Francisco. The regu
lations provide that if any of the rel
atives of-, Fergeson had asxed that .the
body be brought north for interment the
request would be granted, but as all of
the deceased. machinist's relatives live in
the East the commandant could do noth
ing but refuse me request of j Fergeson's
fiancee, and Miss Alexander will have to
bear the expense, which is quite heavy.
She was to have married Fergeson on
the return of . the . Bennington from the
Isthmus of Panama, in October. The fu
neral will be held in San Francisco to
morrow and the band anu a detachment
of sailors and marines will be sent from

Jez reefs Tower' on Chatham Hill Falls Into
the Hands of Unbelieving Gentiles,
REEI/* WHICH IS TO BB
TURNED INTO A F^-CTORT.
ExmoUl QLbls to Tha Call.
LONDON, July 29. â After standing
for ' twenty years aa a monumental
memorial of human folly and credulity,
"Jezreel'a Tower," the unfinished sanoÂ«
tuary or the "New and Latter House of
Israel," 1* to suffer the crowning dese
cration of transformation into & faotory
at the hands of the unbelieving Gentile.
During all this period tho huge, square,
roofless framework of brick, dominat
ing the surrounding framework from
the top of Chatham Hill, has served as
a rallying point for the faithful few
who s till continued to believe In- the
dream of their prophet and founder.
The. announcement of tho Impending
Changs' has reduced them to silent de
spair.
James Whlto waa a private soldier In
the \u25a0 Sixteenth Regiment thirty years
ego, and sons of his companions
Imagined he would ever amount to any
thing. He was onoe confined to bar
racks for some breach of military dis
cipline and his sergeant taunted him
with being an Irreligious, reckless fel
low. "I shall leave the army," retorted
White, "and then I -will found a new
religion that will astonish the world."
He purchased his discharge a week
later, assumed the title of "James
Jershom Jezreel" and proclaimed him
self the founder of the "New and Latter
House' of Israel. " That It Is easy to
start a new faith In this boasted era'
of enlightenment, provided one makes
claims In Its behalf that are sufficiently
opposed to common sense, there are nu
merous Instances. White did not err on
the side of modesty. He announced
that from heaven, via, .Jerusalem, he
had received certain divine writings
which he called "The Flying RolL"
Even the most favored of his disciples
never got a peep of the originals with
the exception of one man, Joseph Head.
He was possessed of more literary abil
ity than the founder and White em
ployed him to prepare "extracts" and
"sermons for the Gentiles" from the
mystic revelations.
Contrary to. the usually accepted
maxim which declares that a prophet
finds no honor among his own kith and
kin. White obtained his first converts
from among his numerous relations and
established himself In Chatham, where
he was well known. There he Quickly
gathered around him a large band of
credulous followers, who allowed their
hair to grow long as an outward and
visible sign of their inward faith.
\u25a0Whether knave or fanaticâ or a mix
ture of both â White was evidently a
ehrewd man of business. He exercised
autocratic authority over his followers
and established a community of them
6t the top of Chatham Hill. With
farms, bakeries, clothing stores, print
ing offices and various workshops under
his control, he speedily amassed a for
tune out of the profits and for a con
siderable period It was estimated that
his Income was $250,000 a year. He
was in many respects an earlier edition
of Dowle. In return for cash gifts
"Jerrael" promised Immortality to such
as accepted his gospel and announced
that he himself would never die, just as
Mrs. Eddy did many years ago. He
married one of his converts, Esther
Rogers, a pretty young woman of Chat
ham, and everything went prosperously
with him.
At the height of his power he con
ceived the Idea of building In the midst
of his park a huge building for the in
gathering of the 144,000 elect of the
scattered twelve tribes of Israel â an
event which he announced was about
due. He also declared that It would
cave all their lives when the second
flood came. It was designed to hold
COOO people. How the remaining 139,000
were to be stowed away in it neither
"Jezreel" nor the "Flying, Roll" conde
scended to explain. But the greater
'the demands the prophet made on the
credulity of his followers the firmer
grew their faith in him. They ' sub
scribed liberally for the building of .the
temple. In the center was to be a huge
circular hall with four galleries run
ning around it and it was to be roofed
with a gilded dome. On the Interior
fixings and decorations $300,000 was to be
expanded.
The shell of the building only had
been completed when the ex-soldier
made the one mistake of his career
Eince he started In business as the
prophet of a new religion. He falsified
hJs claims to immortality by dying. The
sect would, have gone to pieces then
had not Mrs. "Jezreel" stepped Into the
breach. As "Queen Esther" she as
sumed the leadership of the elect. Her
husband, she said, had been a bit
blinded by the devil in his interpreta
tions of the "Flying Roll." She was the
divinely inspired one who would never
die and who would show when the time
came how 144.000 folk could be saved
from destruction in. a building built; to
hold 6000. It had been her husband's
mission to prepare the way forJher.: 7
The "Jezreelltes" had been' educated
Up to a point where they found no diffi
culty in swallowing that yarn. Not
only did she hold' the sect together, but
under her management its numbers in
creased and branches were established
In different parts of the world. But
after three years she repeated the mis
take her husband had made by going the
way of all flesh. Then her father tried to
take over the Jezreel job. But that was
making too much of a family affair of
it. The strain Imposed upon the faith
of the elect was more than most of
them oould stand. The sect disbanded.
A small remnant only accepted the old
man as the genuine "Jezreel." Their
contributions did not place him above
the necessity of working for a living
and. for years he .has run a grocery
business near the temple gates. But he
has always presided over the meetings
of the few who still retain confidence
in the "Flying Roll." They have been
held In a small hall in the big roofless
and wlndowless structure. Sacrilegious
bands will soon drive them from that
retreat, and that will be the end of the
Jezreelltes.'

Declares That Drunkenness
Among American Women
Has Increased 50 Per Cent
Special Dispatch ,to ThÂ» Call.
NEW YORK, July 29.â "There has
been more than 60 per cent increase In
drunkenness among the women ;. of
America during the past few years,"
announced the Rev. Harvey Wood in
his speech before the National Tem
perance Society in the Young People's
Temple at Ocean Grove to-day.'
Rev. Mr. Wood, who is the field and
financial secretary of tho society, said
there was a large amount of drunken
ness among women *In England, but
that the United States had i been com
paratively free from this vice until of
late years. In England 64 per cent of
deaths of children were caused directly
or indirectly by the drinking of "the
parents, ho declared. He asserted that
temperance lecturers often make state
ments which are not true and which
hurt the cause.
."There is much Ignorance -In the
minds of the people about the poisonous
"nature of alcohol," he declared. "Li
censing the traffic has failed to reduce â¢
the crimes resulting from it. To-day
an organized fight is on hand against
it, in which not only the churches, but
the Christian Endeavorers, " Young
Men's Christian Association and even
the young men in our colleges are en
gaged.
"Railroads and big corporations are
coming to our side, for they are refus
ing to employ men who drink. The
liquor traffic will run our country,4ftto
bankruptcy If it Is not stopped, for it
costs millions of dollars yearly to re
pair Its ravages and to care for its vic
,tims." \u25a0 ' - " \u25a0

ENGLAND USES
OUR METHODS
Britain's Greatest Building
Firm Finds It" Necessary
â¢ to Hire American Experts
MUCH BETTER WORKMEN
Genius for Management Dis
played by Yankees J^iits
I Them in the Front Rank
Epcclal Ulspaicb to Tlit Call. *
LONDON, July 29.â Hidden away. In
an annual . report "recently made to the
shareholders of . Waring' & Gillow,
Limited,. l happened on some rather
surprising admissions. It was flatly de
clared that American methods in "the
construction* of buildings in London
have proved superior to those of , any
other c6untry, including England. This
'firm Is taking a foremost part in s the
rebuilding of London," having erected
the new and imposing headquarters of
the International Mercantile Marine
Company 'and "being now- engaged in
putting up the Ritz Hotel in Piccadilly.
Questioned on" the above subject,
.Waring, head of the firm, said: "I'os,
we have finally come to th*e conclusion,,
perhaps somewhat; unwillingly, that
Americans are better builders than vie
are. Heretofore we. have believed' that
you erectedyour buildings too quickly,
but you have taught us that a sub
stantial structure can.be put up rapid
ly. The American* does it becau3& "of
his genius for management. Our chief
heads of department .arc now Amer
icans and by their inventiveness 'and
experience we get a third more labor
out. of the English workman than* w-e
ever could. We consider tUis a critical
moment in the " history *of British
trade, and the world has never yet ex
perienced such-a fight for commercial
supremacy. Our â¢ two great rivals,
America and Germany, have presented
great difficulties to .British* enterprise,
but we' have disposed of America by
adopting her system of direction of ac
tion, her nervous force, her ability for
reducing the- factor of labor to a mini
mum in every direction anfl her insati
able ambition to effect the greatest pos
sible result.
''Germany has entered" the interna
tional building contest with structural
iron materials, with keen intellectual
ability, patient and progresisve labor,
capacity to organize and standardize,
cohesion of effort in order to effect
great ends, and above all, alertness in
adapting her manufactures to the-re
quirements of her customers. We have,
however, the benefit of a great start in
the field. With continued oc-operation
of English and "American -capital and
brains .we should not, fear German com
petition within the British Isles. The
rivalry is healthy -and an additional in
centive to greater effort.
"There are many handicaps in Gr.eat
Britain, .largely 'of a legal character, to
quick construction, but here again we
have used the American way. 'We con
struct- first* and talk .about., it. after
.wardâln the. courts u-necessary. We
are quite equal to the United States in
manufacturing structural 'material
quickly and cheaply and now we have
solved the question of supervision and
labor -along American lines." , .
AMERICAN BOARDIiW
; HOUSE TOR LONDON
Plan Is on Foot to Build
Large Establishment on
Foundling. Estate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, July 29.â There is a fair
prospect that by next summer a huge
boarding-house conducted- on American
principles..: will be established in the
Bloomsbury. district." Edward C. Ren
shaw of New York and James John Duf
fie of Chlcaeo 'are the moving spirits in
this 'latest of American enterprises in
England. They have been exploring the
district named for the last week or two
with the object of finding a suitable site.
The Idea Is to buy out the proprietors of
some half dozen of the existing boarding
houses, demolish the old buildings, and
in their place erect a 'modernly equipped
establishment which will accomodate at
least 250 to 300 boarders. The promoters
of the scheme have come to the conclu
sion that there is a sufficient number of
young Americans in business in London
to keep such an establishment full all the
year round. 'If this should turn out to
be not the case, then they would depend
for a large proportion of the Income on
the annual American visitor to London
whose means do not permit of his putting
up at one or other of the ordinary ho
tels. With $50,000 they can buy out the
interest of the tenants of the houses they
have," inspected and with an additional
$375,000 they can erect the building they
are contemplating. The, land" on which
they , have fixed is on what is known as
the Foundling Estate, next to that of the
Duke of Bedford, and within easy ac
cess of 'the leading railway station and
every part of London. \u25a0

FRENCH AUTHORESS
WINS GREAT HONOR
Her Works Earn for Her the Vitet Prize
EceclaJ Cable to ThÂ« Call.
PARIS. Jul^ 29.â For the first time,
the Vitet prize, most coveted of all
literary awards made by the Academic
Francaise, has just been given to a
woman, Madame Henri Lapanze. who
writes under the name of "Daniel
Lesueur." Her latest novel, "La Force
dv Passe," â¢which has had a success
even greater than that of her previous
works, doubtless contributed to win
ning for her this honor. But what
makes the Vitet prize particularly val
uable is that it is not awarded for any
6ingle work, but for the whole of one's
literary production to date, which must
consequently be maintained at a high
level of excellence. Only the most emi
nent French authors have received this
prize since its foundation twenty-nine
years ago. Among the former bene
ficiaries may be mentioned Paul Bour
get, Pierre Lotl, Guy de Maupassant,

taints of carelessness which mar the
works of many- contemporaneous
French authors. Her. stories. are more
over clean and optimistic in tone, so as
to appeal particularly to Americans.
She possesses in common,: with most
women the art of telling stories well.
But whereas the characters usually de
veloped by women in .their stories are
fantastical and lend themselves to im
probable situations, "Daniel' Lesueur"
has the instinct of the few truly great
women writers for comprehension of .
character and analysis of sentiment.
She believes not simply in constructing
plots, but in allowing events to follow
their logical sequence. Her strongest
trait as revealed in her writings is con
fidence in mankind a"s â¢a . whole, and
where she must deal with unpleasant
people, she opposes to them others loyal
and healthy In mind, who can live and
love and suffer without being embit
tered or weakened. /
Though still a young woman, "Daniel
Lesueur" has written no less than
twenty novels, among the most popular
being "A Tragic Life," "Invincible
Charm," "A . Woman's Honor," '"The
Marquis .de Valcor" and "Madame de
Freneuse." "
"Daniel Lesueur" was among the pio
neers of the Feminist movement in
France, not encouraging Women's
Rights in the vulgar acceptation of the
term, but Insisting upon the recognition
of woman's Intellectual ability. Her
husband, Henri Lapauze, Is a noted.lit
erary and art critic, and the two enjoy
the distinction of being the only mar
ried couple of whom each is a Knight
of the Legion of Honor. Wi'h Rosa
Bonheur and Mrs. Potter Palmer, Mmc,
Lapauze is, indeed, one of the few
women ever decorated | with the h lgtieet
â¢order at the disposal of the French
Government.

DEATH ROLL
FROM FEVER
IS GROWING
Health Authorities at New
Orleans Believe, However,
That Yellow Jack's Hold
on City Is Nearly Broken
PANICKY. FEELING
EXISTS IN SOUTH
Suspects Taken Off Steamer)
Seguranca at New York
Are Doing Well and Show
No Symptoms of Scourge
M3W ORLEA.VS, July 29. â Following:
Is the report of the health authorities
on yellow ff\fT up to 6 p.m. to-day t
IVevv cases, 28.
Caw* to date, 256.
I>eaths tc>-rl:iy. 7.
Deaths to date, 54.
Â»w loci, 2.
Deducting the number of deaths and
the number of recoveries, it is believed
that there are not more than 75 cases
under treatment, if that many.
Much encouragement is drawn from,
the fact that only two new foci havv;
developed* One of these is a nurse who
aiter.ded a patient at a hospital, and
the other is in the vicinity of Milne
burg, where there had been a suspicious
case recently, but which had been
spirited atraj- before the authorities got
hold of it. The railroads continue to
be seriously hampered by quarantines.
The decision of the conference of health
authorities at Memphis to recommend
a quarantine of the entire State of Ten
nessee against infected points is evi
dence of the spread of panicky feeling
outside of New Orleans. Every day
now some half-dozen little towns are
suddenly scratched off the list of open
towns, and very often the embargo is
slapped on so suddenliy that passengers
are left there with tickets already pur
chased.
It was said at the Marine Hospital
office that passengers from New Or
leans were no longer permitted to
travel in Texas and only the most in
significant stations are open to Louisi
ana. Quarantines have been estab
lished so thoroughly along the line of
some roads that big cards bearing bold
black letters have been posted in the
ticket offices and depots announcing
that all tickets bought for any point
out of New Orleans are purchased at
at the purchaser's risk and subject to
restrictions of Quarantine. \
Local representatives of lines -which
run through Mississippi were advised
in telegrams to-day that no person
from New Orleans would be permitted
to travel on a train through that State
without a health certificate. This af
fects through passengers bound for the
North, East and "West. Before they
had received these orders ticket offices
here had sold-iarsfe~numbers oftickeis
to people who were to leave to-morrow
and Monday, and were busy trying to
locate these ticket-holders in order to
save them from being taken from New
Orleans and thrown into detention
camps in the adjoining States.
The increase In the number of deaths
and cases of yellow fever to-day is not
causing any anxiety. All but one of
the dead are Italians or Australians
\u25a0who hailed from the original focus cf
infection. Of the new cases there is
only one point of Infection among the
best element of the population, and
that has been traced to the original in
fection.
MISSISSIPPI IS ALARMED.
Quarantine to Be Maintained* at the
Point of the Bayonet.
GULP PORT, Miss., July 29.â Governor
Vardaman. acting for the State Board of
Mississippi, has placed Adjutant General
Fridge In charge of the State Quaran
tine Service and all future aggressions
against the yellow plague in Mississippi
will be conducted under the auspices of
the Adjutant, General's office. The ad
vance detail of officers and men stationed
at Camp B. F. "Ward, who were pre
paring the camp grounds, for the en
campment of the Mississippi National
Guard, will be utilized to supplant the
civil force now on duty throughout the
State and the most stringent quarantine
will be maintained In the State. General
Fridge has issued imperative orders Â£o
the soldiery to, maintain/ the quarantine
at the point of the bayonet The coast
lino has been divided Into divisions. A
platoon of Cameroon artillery of Meridian
will arrive to do duty as quarantine
guards.
A doctor here stated yesterday that he
had a case of yellow fever. The health
authorities Interviewed him with the re
sult that he acknowledged he had told
an untruth. The authorities thereupon
made him sign a statement to that effect
An ordinance was passed to the effect
that any person making a statement
about yellow fever at Gulf Port that was
proved to be untrue would-be fined $50
to $100. The citizens of Gulf Port have
offered money to protect the coast.
Dra. Wasdin and Donald of the United
States Marine -Hospital service are here
and state that under present conditions
there is no chance for yellow fever to
get on the coast The yellow fever pa
tient in a- house about a mile from Lum
berton has been surrounded with soldiers
to pre\-ent the disease from spreading.
JACKSON. Miss., July 29.â Although
Governor Vardaman has placed Adjutant
General Fridge in charge of the quaran
tine against Louisiana, he has not called
out the State militia. General Fridge has
been given several officers and privates of
the National Guard to aid him In enforc-

ed to be doing. â¢'Well and showing no
symptoms of yellow - fever except in the
two of the crew whose cases are . still
doubtful. , .
"With twenty-five cases of possible yel
low fever detained under observation on i
the quarantine Islands, ' Dr. A. H. Doty,
Health Officer of the port," said to-night
that twenty-four hours must elapse be
fore it could be absolutely determined, by
bacteriological tests, whether any of . the
suspects were infected with the dread
plague. !
Two sailors, both "apparently seriously
111, were taken to-day from the steamer
Seguranca, which arrived from Colon,
and isolated in the pesthouse on Swin
burne Island. Eight J more of j the crew,
who had been ill during the voyage,,; but
were convalescing, and seven passengers,
two from the cabin, all: of whom showed
increased temperatures,' were ; taken to
to Hoffman Island for detention until the
results of blood examinations are known.
In addition to these, i two suspects were
taken to Hoffman Island to-day from the
steamer Eldorado, | from New Orleans,
and there remain on the island six cases
from â¢; the steamer -Avon, (which recently
arrived from ; Colon. All the ,; suspects
held yesterday,' from ';^he steamer Alamo,
from - Galyeston,-: Texas, were released to
day.'. -â¢ \u25a0/ ' \u25a0 \u25a0'\u25a0Â». -â¢; -\u25a0;\u25a0'. / . - -\u25a0
'None, of the patients now under deten
tion is regarded as -being dangerously,
111, but , there Is apprehension that there
may exist among them cases : of an : in
sidiously.; dangerous ; form of yellow fever,
the ambulant stage, in which the sufferer
walks abroad, feeling only slightly ill,
but imperiling all.^with whom 'he comes
in : contact ,':â¢\u25a0\u25a0'.".â¢ v* -' :
The health" officials tb-nlght are making
the most thorough tests for, this â¢ type ; of
yellow -fever, among; the I ten; members of
the : Seguranca'Si crew^ because ? four? of
this crew were 'taken off at Colon actually,
i suffering with yellow jack. â¢
Health : Officer, Doty .believes that within
twenty-four % hours s his } tests "'\u25a0 will ; show
', that â¢' the '; remaining \u25a0 sick < from : the . Segur
anca are' merely.-; suffering from an iep}-'

/'The two ; worst cases," he said, "may
.possibly be yellow "fever, but even, this
is; notviikely.^ Eight lof :'thei,crew t were
' about \u25a0 as 'i sick 1 five 1 days : ago .* as, are > the
.two". who were- carried i to ; the hospital . to
5 day.v: These J eight Â£ are Â»rÂ» r now,'^ much ' lm
?proved," a' condition ; which : would be ' quite
i unlikely; if 5 yellow /, fever.; had i been ; their
; ailment. ; 'There is good reason to believe,
\u25a0 therefore; that - the other two sick men,-
who became 111 only two or three days
ago, have the same complaint, and will
recover Just as* rapidly. "I feel quite con
fident that the eight convalescents are not
yellow, fever cases, but I "will make no
definite statement either that it is or is
not , yellow, fever j until the blood and
other tests; settle the matter conclu
sively."

LONDON. July 29.â 1n Â«pltÂ« of Mr.
Roosevelt's repudiation of any inten
tion to become Involved In the peace
negotiations beyond the task of for
mally Introducing: Baron Komura and
M. do \Vltte. there Is a persistent belief
in London and Paris among persons not
disposed to guess recklessly that if an
impasse should be reumeo the "export
diplomatist of the .White House," who
is a good friend of both belligerents,
would rind a way to peace with honor
for each.
rt It' would b* a calamity of . almost
endless complications were the nego
tiations to come to Nothing-." says n
Week's End writer. "There would bo
three â perhaps five â years more of
war, and then the whole business oC
negotiations to be gone through with
again. But ran any one imagine what
embroilments would occur during th>i
prolongation? Rather than that suoh
world-wide disaster should come,
wÂ£>uld It not be a stroke of celestial
wisdom for the envoys, as a last re
sort, to advise their governments to
submit the ultimate issues to Mr.
Rooeevelt without argument and take
the arbitration as a finality? It may
sound Quixotic, but there is sense
In it." '
The reports from Washington that
Japan may agree not to fortify Port
Arthur .in case Russia will consent to
the neutralization of Vladivostok are
interpreted as showing that American
influence in moderating Japanese terms
may already be operative, and the
strongly optimistic tone of the Wash
ington Government is considered a "re
flection of Roosevelt's exact knowledge
of tjte situation rather than of his
.benevolent interest."
"We- may take it for a certainty,"
says the Paris Matin, "that the states
man; who is best informed as to the
irreducible minimum of the Japanese
and. the maximum of Russia Is the
American President, who is directly re
sponsible for the negotiations and the
man best Qualified in all the world to
keep the envoys together, once having
got them there. Things are coming
out Â«atisfactorily unless European mar
plots become perniciously active In
their own interests."

"Peace on the terms outlined by Mr.
Sato," says the Russ, which is the first
paper to comment seriously on the Sato
interview, "can only be an armistice."
The Russ, which has the largest Lib
eral following, calls, the Japanese terms
far from \u25a0 liberal and says that : the
chances for the conference ending satis
factorily aas not. good, if Sato has cor
rectly stated the Japanese position, but
It appears to believe that Baron Ko
mura's spokesman is acting on "his own
responsibility," or soents a possible
bluff to pave the way - for the accept
ance of actual and more moderate terms
by Japan. . ,
The Svlet continues its fault-finding

CHINA TO DEMAND INDEMNITY.
Will Ask Russia to Pay: for the Occu
pation of Manchuria.
BERLIN, July 30.â The' Lokal An
zieger prints an lnterlvew with a prom
inent Chinese J diplomatist, erideiitly
the Chinese Minister at Berlin, who
says that the ' Dowager Empress and
the Emperor have sent a circular let
ter to all Viceroys and Governors and to
Chinese Ministers abroad asking them
to state fully their views as to what at
titude China should take In the set
tlement of 'the Manchurian question.
The diplomatist further. . states g that
China, in determining what Indemnity
to demand from Russia, will Include not
only the reduction In, public revenues
during the war, but a* sum sufficient to
cover damages suffered through years
of illegal occupation- of that. country.
He assumes) that Japan will keep her
word and hand, over Manchuria to
China, but thinks it. will be impossible
for China to install . the old -form of
government .'there,; since the improve;
ments the Russians ahd Japanese have
introduced make a, modern . system of
administration necessary.' The dip
lomatist concludes: \u25a0
"China will no longer play the role
of a mere spectator, but will assert its
claims with energy in the Portsmouth
negotiations: and interesting develop-;
ments will certainly follow."

DOCTORS WILL
INSPECT MILK
Medical Society Appoints
a Commission to Examine
and issiie Certificates
EIXEOED . GIVES^ PLAN
Snys Bacterial Colonies by
Millions Exist in the
Fluid This City Drinks
Dr. 'Emmet -Rixford, president of the
San Francisco County , Medical : Society,
announces that the following physicians j
will act as the first milk commission of i
the County Medical Society: t>r. George'
H. Evans, Dr. W. *F. Cheney, Dr. W. B.
Lewltt, Dr A. B Spaldlng and the presi
dent of the society, ex offlclo.
The duties of the commission will be to
prescribe rules "for the conduct of dairies
on an outlined plan r and to- Issue cer
tificates to those dairies which fulfill re
quirements, and certificates will be of
ficial indorsements of the dairies that
possess them. A certificate will be issued
to a dairy only. after it has been shown,
to. the satisfaction- of the commission,
that it fulfills the conditions prescribed
by the rules and it will be revoked when
the conduct of the dairy becomes lax.
Laboratory experts will be employed to
determine and to keep a check upon the
bacterial content of the milk that la cer
tified!
Dr. Rixford has prepared an article for
the Merchants' Association Review in
which he makes various interesting state
ments. Some extracts are as follows:
"The sporadic attempts toward assur
ing a pure milk supply on the part of
successive Boards .of Health, . through
their political milk inspectors, by" spas
modic midnight arrests of . drivers deliv
ering milk which â¢to the portable mid
night laboratory was below standard,
followed by the unsightly ' proof next
morning of the inspector's nocturnal In
dustry in the shape of streams of the
fluid .running down the streets to the
Infinite satisfaction of swarms . of ma
tutinal flies, have utterly failed to reach
the source' of the evil.
"While it is of manifest importance to
have the milk served of a standard cream
content, the really vital condition for
milk to be wholesome is that it should
be free from disease germs.
DAIRYMEN TO CO-OPERATE.
"The technical difficulties of excluding
bacteria from milk, and of preventing
their subsequent multiplication, are so
great that any system of inspection . and
control must fall unless it is carried out
with the entire co-operation of the dairy
men. * Such co-operation is only possible
when the dairyman finds that It is di
rectly to his pecuniary interest to ob
serve the required precautions. And, Just
as it Is to the Interest of the dairyman
to prevent his milk from souring by
seeing to it that the milk. â¢is rapidly
cooled and the cans properly; scalded,
so also, .if lt.be clearly to his pecuniary
advantage to keep filth out of his milk,
he, will need no urging to carry out.ef
flcient measures to attain th^t end/
"While theoretically it'ls"a iBimpre*'mat
ter'.to'.p.re'aerve milk 'from infectionj for
from the healthy cow. the milk, as drawn.
Is sterile, practically It is a difficult mat
ter to collect milk without 'serious | con
tamination, and to do it successfully and
on a. commercial "scale is expensive.
"Now as this matter is : of vital im
portance to the- community, and. since the
greater part of the digestive ills of in
fancy and many of the troubles of later
life are directly traceable to infected
milk, the San Francisco County Medi
cal Society unanimously resolved to take
up the matter, which is after all a medi
cal question rather than a political, and
adopt the plan of the 'certification' of
milk which. has been most successfully
carried out In New York,' Philadelphia
and other Eastern cities. Our sister city,
Portland, .haa a dairy such as is here
contemplated.
BOON TO DEALERS.
"It Is believed that it will be clearly
to the pecuniary 'interest of a number
of dairies to conform to the rules of the
commission, because the indorsement of
the medical profession will enable them
to meet the competition/ of cheaper and
poorer .milk. 'Certified/m ilk will natur
ally be more expensive' than other milk,
but It has been shown in 1 New York and
other cities that the price need not be
excessive. A great many people would
be willing to pay two or three times the
ordinary price if they could be assured
that the milk was wholesome.
"At present, no matter what the people
of San Francisco may be willing to pay,
they cannot get milk that haa less than
from 200.000 to 300,000 colonies of bacteria
to the cubic centimeter, or about 800,000
to 1.200,000 colonies .to the teaspoonf ul,
which is about the bacterial content of
average samples of sewage, i
"Under the system of certification, as
practiced under the authority of the New
York County. Medical Society, parents In
that city can get milk which on exami
nation contains less than 30,000 colonies
per cubic centimeter, which is. the maxi
mum limit permitted by that society.- In
â¢Philadelphia, 10,000 is the maximum, but
experience has shown that from a prac
tical standpoint that <lhnit -is too 'near
the ideal to be practicable. Milk which
does not contain more than 20,000 colonies
of bacteria per cubic centimeter \u25a0is of ex-

STATUE OF GENERAL SIGEL BY GERMAN
SCULPTOR TO STAND IN ST. LOUIS.
Tribute to Be Paid to the JMemory of \u25a0'-. iWar ;. .-H'erp
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, July 29. â Germans from all
over the .United States -will gather In
St. Louis next spring to honor the
memory of General Franz Sigel, the
dashing cavalry leader who organized
four regiments of young Germans for
the Felcral army in 1861 and "saved
Missouri" for the Union. The statue,
for which $10,000 was subscribed by
patriotic residents of the World's Fair
city, will probably stand In Forest
Park. It Is the work of Robert Caver,
a German- American sculptor who now
has his studio In Berlin.- ':\u25a0 a
Caver went to St. Louis last year
and modeled the facial likeness from
photographs of General Sigel taken at
the time of the war, which accounts for
the remarkably life-like resemblance
which all who knew him will find In
this magnificent equestrian statue.
Sigrel is shown at the Battle of Pea
Ridge, scanning the approaching enemy
jusj before he made the famous rally
of his German "boys" and turned seem
ing: rout Into a glorious victory for the
boys, fn blue. It was around this en
gagement that the famous humorous
djtty "Me fought mlt Sigel" was writ
ten-r-an unfailing source of patriotic
mirth at every, gathering of Krieger
vereiris in America.
. General Sigel was a military man of
experience before he emigrated to the
United States as a "forty-elghter." He
took a prominent part In the Baden'
revolution of that year and was com
pelled to flee the country on account
of it. He was a schoolmaster in the
. Western' States when the war broke
out, but his old-time military spirit
asserted itself and he went to St: Louis
to organize into four regiments the
young German-American patriots resi
dent there. History commonly ascribes
the failure of Missouri to side with the
Confederacy to this German support of
the Northern cause.
Besides being the first equestrian
statue in St. Louis, the Sigel monyment
\u25a0will -be the first raised to the memory
of the services of German-Americans In
the' Civil War.
Congressman Richard Bartholdt of St.
Louis, president of the Memorial Asso
ciation, was in Berlin this month to
â¢Inspect the statue In Caver's studio and
Bays that the subscribers to the memo
rlaj' fund will be more than delighted
- with the sculptor's production, which Is
one and a half times life-size. The
statue will be of bronze and will rest
on an" appropriately sized pedestal of
American granite.-.
.Secretary Gates Will Speak.
W. A. Gates, secretary of the State
Board of Charities and Corrections,
â¢who has recently returned from the
National Conference held at Portland,
"Or-, will speak at the Fourth Congre
. gational Church, Green street, near
\u0084 Stockton, this evening at 7:45 o'clock.

How Lone Whales Live.
"As to the age to which whales live,"
pays Dr. True, curator of biology of the
National Museum, "there is no accurate
data, but I am Inclined to the oplnlpn.
that some of them live to an age In ex
cess of forty years. This theory is borne
out by the finding in a whale in IS9O of a
harpoon which had belonged to a ship Qiat
was sunk during the civil war. Ten y*eara
before the war the ship had cruised as a
whaler. The estimates that whales live
to be a thousand years old are fanclJul;

One of the Men Who Escaped
From Alcatraz on a Forged

BETRAYED BY A MARINE
Serving Two Years for Steal

ceiving Ship Independence
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO. July 29.â George Francis
Ewlng Price, who, with the aid of forged
orders of release, escaped with several
other soldier prisoners from Alcatraz
Island some time ago, is ' a prisoner at
the Mare Island prison. Shortly after his
sensational escape, he came to the
navy yard and enlisted as a coal passer.
In time he became a yeoman. Shortly
after he' had been rated he disappeared
with $500 belonging to the crew of the
receiving Â»hlp Independence. He was
caught wltAin a few days at the Cliff
House in San Francisco, whither he had
gone to spend some of the sailors' cash.
Upon his return to Mare Island he was
courtmartialed \u25a0 and sentenced to.. serve
five years in prison. This sentence was (
cut to two years by the Navy Depart-*
ment. Price would have been released In
a short time but for the fact that a
marine who had served with him at Alca
traz saw and recognized him. The ma
rine reported -his discovery to the officials
and they In turn reported the matter to
the Alcatraz .officers, who sent a lieuten
ant up to take a look at the prisoner.
"That's Price," the' officer said, -and
forthwith the department at Washington
was notified. Â«Only a few days ago the
navy officials were notified to hold Price
upon his release and â¢to turn " him over
to the Alcatraz officers for trial on the
charge of escaping from Alcatraz by
means of. a forged order. - :
When Price enlisted in the navy but a
few days after his sensational escape
he gave his name as Ewing, and- by. that
name he has been carried upon the books
of the navy. . ' - â¢

tlew off and entered " Christ Reformed
Church by the bay. window. Rev. Charles
Shaffer of Thurmount was reading his
text, when the. bird lit on the edge of
the Bible. He gently waved it off. and it
flew down to the edge of the pulpit and
came back and stood on the text. . The
reverend gentleman read.;,.- though, and
the bird \u25a0 flew to the top of the \u25a0 organ
and sat awhile, and then came back and
perched ' right over the l preacher . until - he
was through his sermon. It seemed very
attentive. When the . organ opened It

When Evidence of Fugitive
Is Presented to the Court
PORTLAND, July 29â The defense in
the trial of Williamson, .Gessner and
Biggs closed to-day, after, the testimony
of Congressman Williamson was submit
ted and four acquaintances of the defen
dants testified to their good character.
The prosecution examined two stockmen
and tried to establish its contention that
Instead of being threatened by nearby
cattlemen and under orders to leave the
range they were then using, that the.de
fendants were on friendly terms with the
cattlemen and that Biggs was president
of the Cattlemen's Association.' The court
ruled that this evidence concerning Biggs
was immaterial..^
The prosecution rested with the under
standing-that Ernest Starr, the runaway
witness, may be put on the stand. Starr,
who has been hiding In the I Cascades, -
was captured last night and Is now on
his way to Portland. He will be put
on the stand Monday. . . *
Congressman Williamson admitted that
heÂ»was in Prineville in' June, 1902, but
maintained that the - only . way he' could
recall it was by looking up his effects
and finding. In a telephone bill charges

Blow to the Ministerial
Union of\Â£ity of Portland
. PORTLAND, July 29. â Judge Fraxer.
of the State Circuit Court. to-day
granted a temporary ; Injunction re
straining: the management of the Lewis
and Clark Centennial Exposition from
Interfering with the Sunday opening
of concessions on' "The Trail" at tha
exposition.
The exposition management at the
inception of the exposition idea had
the local ministerial body to contend
With, the clergymen being utterly op
posed to the opening of any portion of
the exposition to the public on* Sun
days, and as a compromise the exposi
tion officials guaranteed that the Trail"
concessions would not be permitted, to
open. Two months of losing business,
with financial ruin facing many of the
shows, caused the Concessionaires' .As
sociation to announce that their shows
would operate regardless of the officials
of the exposition.
A compromise resulted in the cass
being taken to court, with the result
that Judge Fraser decided In favor of
Sunday opening pending the final deter
mination of the suit.

A LETTER FROM A PATHTVT.
San Francisco. Cal.. Feb. 20. 1903. .
During; an illness with which I have suf-
fered from heart and stomach trouble for
nearly eight years I have treated with
prominent physicians in Los Angeles. ' San
Francisco and Seattle. They failed to cure
or even diagnose my case. My condition
gradually became worse, until I was pro-
nounced Incurable by them. I was In a
low state, scarcely able to stand, when I
decided as a last resort to try Chinese
treatment and consulted with Dr. . Wong
Htm of 607 Geary street. He diagnosed
my case by the simple feelin? of the
pulse, describing every symptom of my af-
fliction. I took his Herb medicine, when
I immediately ' began to improve.' - After
continuing his treatment for five months I
became a well woman.

LOXDOX, July 29. â Bfeerbohra Tree's
remarkable production of. "Oliver
\u25a0Twist" doesn't shed much light' on the
\u25a0Ã¼bjtct of whether or not DlckenÂ» Cau

orable figure to the .gallery of Tree

A more crafty, cruel, slimy, snuffling,

a human being. He and Nancy and Bill
fe'ykes are the whole show, and poor

low and the lay figures who supply th*
pretty sentiment wherewith to- offset
the villainies going on In Fagin's
ftphere of action are comparatively no
where. â¢ . \u25a0-' â¢
I discussed. tliis point with a grand
daughter of Charles Dickens yesterday,
and. she agreed that no dramatist, how
ever sklllfuL would ever be likely to
rr.alie a real play out of Dickens' novel
without building It around some one
group;- of characters, ruthlessly cut
ting ort everything that did not per
tain to oi;e set cf Incidents -and -filling
in the gaps from his own imagination.
"I expect," she added, "that we would
all rise up in wrath and sayi This'lsn't
Dickens'; yet it might be done- with
out the sacrifice of any of the real
spirit of the novel."
Miss Dickens supplies a suggestion
that is interesting. ;She believes that
a play of the sort outlined could be
made from "Our Mutual Friend." a
novel rarely If ever dramatized. That
novel consists of two stories which
have scarcely anything to do with each
other. One of the two is the strong,
simple, dramatic story of the Jove of
3JugÂ£ne Wrayburn and Bra-Jley Head
stone for lizzie Hexam; witn Charlie
Kexa.m. Jennie Wren. Jennie's, "bad
bo>," Rogue Kiderhood, and the land
lady of the "Six. Jolly Fellowship Por
ters" fcr the nÂ»st of the cast â in other
ivords, "Our Mutual Friend." with the
mutual friend left out. ar.d Xoddy Bof
fin and Silas "W&gg sacrificed,
-OLIVER TWIST" A SUCCESS.
Any American dramatist is welcome
to the idea, but I thinkhe ought to
print acknowledgments on his playbill
to Miss Dirktns. He might enter into
fen arrangement like tne or.c made by
J. M. Barric with a small boy friend
of his who supplied one linÂ« in "Peter
Pan," and to whom, in cor.se<iuenee. the
dramatist religiously paid a royalty of
one ptr.ny a night throughout the run
oi tue piece.
Comyns Carr's dramatization of "Oli
vtr Twist" is probubly ai good a play
as any one could makÂ«; out of a Dick
ens book in. the orthodox fashion, and
it wu.s received with so much applause
lhai Tree announced after- that-it would
be Dut on for a run next 6e;>_son.
Taking opera aird concerts ..together,
this has probably byen the biggest year
on record for American musician* in i
Lor.don. The latest and perhaps the
most ir_ter< a stini4 item from this source
is the *nnoai>cement that Whitney
Tew, who enrnts from Jamestown, N.
V.. but has been prominent among vo
cal soloif-ts here for several years, is
going to produce in October at one of
the West End theaters an opera to be
called "Gwenevere." the musl'c of
which was wrjiven for him by Vincent
Thomas and the book by Ernest Rhys,
a well-known Welshman of letters,
author of several romances and vol
umes of verse. Tew will ta.ke'the part
of Merlin in this version of the Ar
thurian legend.

COLOGNE, July 29.â Joh&nn Simon, a
tanner of Ulm, has been cured of a rheu
matic complaint of several years* stand
ing a* a result of falling Into a tan pit.
Simon remained in the pit for more
than half an hour before he was rescied.
He then found himself completely cured
of his illness, with a feeling: of rejuvena
tion permeating his limbs.
The work of tanning at Ulm being car
ried out by an electrical process, the local
medical faculty attribute the strange
curie to the combined effects of electricity
anÂ«i tannic acid in expelling the uric acid
from thÂ« man's body.
Simon's tanning yard Is attracting hosts
of visitors, and already eighty-five " rheu
matic subjects have plunged Into his dip,
paying fees from 5 shillings to Â£2 each.

Despite the heavy expense, every
thing would have grone well had the at

there has been a falling off of 115 from
the enrollment of last year. This is
attributed to the large number of va

ulties that the Eastern universities this
summer got some of the best prizes in
the way of old-world scholars.
Whatever may be the real cause of
the falling off in attendance, the fact
remains that the enrollment has not

COBURN GETS FIVE
MONTHS IN PRISON
Severe Punishment Meted
Out to a Youth Who
Robbed Friend.
OAKLAND, July 29. â Sixteen-year
old Charles Coburn, a brother of
"Monk" Coburn, the once famous
Jockey, having been found guilty of
stealing $35 from Mrs. Wilhelmina
Schneider while a guest at her home,
was sentenced to a term of five months
in the City Prison* to-day by. Acting
Police Judge Geary. The case had been
twice postponed on the promise of Co
burn's relatives to repay the money to
Mrs. Schneider and to send the youth
to sea.
Mrs. Schneider called at the office of
the prosecuting attorney yesterday and
said that the money had \u25a0 not yet been
paid and that she did not think it likely
she would ever get it. As there had
been plenty of time to repay the money,
the authorities decided that further
delay was useless, and when the case
was called this morning Judge Geary,
after severely lecturing Coburn, im
posed the sentence of five months.

FOUND DYING

Grief Over Loss of House
by Fire Hastens Death
of Lonely Katherine Ryan
HER MIND UNBALANCED
After Destruction of Home
She Attempts to Live in
Charred Rooms Standing
OAKLAND, July 29.â Seeking still to
make a home in the charred remains
of her house at 1703. Union street,
which burned down several weeks ago,
Mrs. Catherine Ryan was found in a
dying- condition this morning and re
moved to the Receiving Hospital, where
it is not expected she will survive the
night.
Shortly after the fire she gave indi
cations that her mind was failing and
she was confined for several days In
the Insane ward at the hospital, but
was afterward sent out to the County
Infirmary. She improved somewhat,
but when given her liberty went back
to her home and has been living in one
of the charred rooms, the walls of
which escaped complete destruction.
To-day neighbors found her without
food and penniless. She is suffering
from uremic poisoning.
\Â«'AGES PAID I'.\CI,E
SAM'S BLUEJACKETS
Ilisher Than Those Abroad or the
Averase on
Sbore.
The variety of methods whereby petty ]
officers and men in the various navies of
the world are compensated renders diffi
cult any exact comparison of their re
muneration. The average cost of main
tenance of enlisted men in the various
navies Is regarded, however, as a fair
criterion of tne financial treatment af
forded them. Under the head of main
tenance is included pay, clothing, food
and allowances, but even after including
these there is no way in which the in
creased pay for length of service, tne
prospects of a pension af fcer a given pe
riod of service, and the education which
enables the enlisted men of the navy to
command increased pay in other occupa
tions when their terms of service have
expired can be expressed in dollars and
cents. .. /
Taking only the cost of maintenance of
an enlisted man, the English naval and
military record of October 1, makes the
following showing: j;
Russian navy ......$250
French navy ...350
English navy 500
United States navy 665/
' Germany. France and Russia have com
pulsory enlistment, short-term service
with certain prescribed periods In the
reserve with pay, varying in amount ac
cording to country and circumstances.
Some estimate of the pay received by
men and petty officers in the American
navy can be based on the payroll of a
single battleship. The Maryland, for In
stance, one of the latest battleships \to
go into commission, has '73l enlisted men,
of whom 25 per cent are petty officers.
The lowest wage paid is $19 a month,
and the highest is $75 47. Seven receive
more than $75, a month; seventeen more
than $70 and less than $75; four more than
$60 and less than $70; twenty-five more
than 50 and less than $60; thirty-nine
more than $40 and less than $50; 184 more
than $30 and less than $40, and 139 more
than $25 a month. No foreign battleship
compares with that record for the pay
of its enlisted force, and this does not in
clude the extra pay allowances such
as are received by seamen , in charge of
holds,' qualified gun pointers, who get
from 12 to $10 additional to their regular
pay, the $5 a month allowed to the gun
captains and the holders of good-conduct
pins, each of which entitles its owner to
75 cents a month. The pay compares
more than favorably with the wages of
employes In other occupations, when the
allowances during an enlistment and the
provision for retirement after thirty
years are taken into consideration and
In computing which certain kinds of ser
vice count double. A man on the retired
list gets three-fourths of his active pay.
It is entirely possibleâ and there are
many Instancesâ for enlisted men to ob
tain homes and -raise families in greater
comfort and with better facilities than Is
the case with the average wageworker
In \u25a0 other lines, even the more expert.â

Weeds as Food.
Every little while we hear of some
food expert advocating the value of va
rious weeds as material for salads and
cooked "greens.", In a recent " article in
the Philadelphia Bulletin. Cornelia Bed
ford gives quite an extended list of nasty
weeds that she asserts may be utilized
for food. Aside from the milkweed and
dandelion, . there is . nothing in tha : list
that may not be regarded with suspicion.
For instance, the", plantain may be men
tioned as _one of the most dangerous to
fool .with, as some varieties ara alleged
to be poisonous. Persons not familiar
with the properties of the various weeds
that annoy the farmer and gardener will
do. well to confine their diet to well
known vegetables, even at a limited va
riety. While the weed enthusiast may
not be taking the chance of the party
who eats toadstools for .mushrooms, the
indulgence in green stuff .that animals

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALO ALTO, July 29.â Dr. R. S. Wood
ward, president . of the Carnegie Institu
tion of Washington, was In Palo Alto to
day and visited Stanford University. Dr.
Woodward Is on the coast inspecting the
work the institution Is having done, here.
This Includes the erection of a large ob
servatory on Mount Wilson, near Pasa
dena, which is to be used for general as
tronomical work, but is to be devoted spe
cially to a study of the sun. Special lines
of scientific research are also being done
at the State University and at Stanford
and Dr. Woodward is giving his personal
attention to the supervision of this work.
" In an interview he 1 spoke with particu
lar praise of the work being done by
Luther Burbank, and deplored the inter
ference with Mr. Burbank's work that so
many visitors to his Santa Rosa home are
creating. . .
Dr. Woodward is perhaps the leading
educator in America. For the last twelve
years he has been professor of mechanics
and mathematical physics and dean ' of
the school of pure scienoe at Columbia
University. In "Who's Who" he is
ranked among the few great scientists of
the present generation.
Dr. Woodward is accompanied by his
wife and Bon, William L. Woodward; his
private secretary, Mr. Reeder, and Miss
L. D. Gill, dean of Barnard College for

DIMINISHING SUPPLY
OF OAPITAIi METALS
Time When Iron and Copper De
, posits Mny Be Ex
â¢â¢ hausted. >\u25a0 -\
.Of the metals two are cardinal In im
portance, iron and copper. The rest may
be of great utility, but they are not abso
lutely necessary to civilization and do not
materially affect- its course. The "main
stays of our existing civilization among
the metals are iron and copper."
Now, how about the supply? 'ln Europe
the deposits of minable iron ores, "long
r'in service, are beginning to "be ex
hausted." "Great Britain has practically
consumed its store," and now practically
all the supply for its furnaces is im
ported. The Mediterranean supply, Pro
fessor Shaler computes, cannot # last for
many decades to come. The ore beds of
Central Europe are "not likely to meet
the demands of a hundred years." Ex
tensive deposits of rich ores In Scandi
navia and in Belgium and France have
hardly, begun to be drawn on- yet at any
thing like the present rate, of .increase, in
the consumption of 'metallic iron. Pro
fessor Shaler estimates that _even with
these the European' sources of supply
will not hold out for \ a century.
In this country \the conditions for a long
continuance of iron production are more
promising, and the "best placed field" for
It in North America or in the world, save
Northern China, is "the central section of
the Mississippi Valley, mainly between
the great river and the Appalachian sys
tem of mountains and northward beyond
the Great Lakes to the headwaters of the
streams flowing into Hudson Bay" ; yet
"it is a question" if even this â¢ store * will
supply the demands of the future, and
"It is in'a high measure Improbable that
within the United States \ any new fields
of notable value remain to be dis
covered," In addition to those which have
been known for thirty years and more.
The only other known field in the other
continents than Europe and America is
in China, "under conditions of climate
and of labor which promise a cheaper
product - than has been obtained In any
other district" ; and it is this condition
which to Professor Shaler's mind gives
to the Japanese-Russo war Its ! greatest
importance to the world, for on the con
trol of these resources "depends in large
measure the economic mastery of the
Pacific Ocean." He I computes that s the
deposits other than those of China which
can produce iron at the present low labor
cost "will almost certainly be exhausted
within one hundred years."
What will become of civilization with
out iron and copper? There may succeed
an ' 'aluminum age." which will carry us
"almost as far beyond that of iron as we
advanced when that metal replaced
bronze in the mechanic arts." Within
fifty years the market price 1 of aluminum
has fallen till It is -now only about one
tenth of what \u25a0 It was, yet ? Professor
Shaler says that "he" would be a con
fident man who, on this basis of compu
tation, looked forward to a time when
aluminum could ~be . economically pro
duced for Jess than $200 a \ ton," and he
reaches the conclusion that Vwlth any
methods now conceivable we have to
recKon that; while aluminum Is ;, likely In
time to take the dominant place now, held
by iron, it will do so at a cost \ln terms
of labor far higher, than what * men . now
pay for their, capital metal."
As to gold,, the gain In, the world's store
of it Is going forward so rapidly that Pro
fessor Shaler thinks - that "within a few
decades" we shall "contrive ? some other
'means of measuring .values than. by; the
| ancient device of balancing ; Viem . against
! a substance of which the supply is exces
sive.' ' ' Silver he j calls % Vnow a forlorn
element, a very pauper, among ? metals'.' ;
"valueless In . the arts" ; "the . station it
retains due to eentimental considerations,
which 1 are likely to soon pass away", ; "In
a century, save for' use as fractional cur
rency,, it is; Hkelyi to be quite neglected."

Objects to San > Francisco
Eyidence Because Copies of
Originals Are Presented
ARGUMENTS ARE HEARD
Lawyer Takes Exception to
Henry's Explanation of
Story About Witnesses
VICTORIA, B. C.; July 28,-Oeorge D.
Collins, who Is fighting extradition, to
day argued objections, raised to the ad
missibility of the depositions and state
ment submitted by the San Francisco
authorities which, he contended, were not
properly authenticated. He argued at
length and cited numerous authorities In
contending that the depositions sent from
San Francisco were \ stated to be orig
inals, but the certificates authenticating
them stated them to be copies. The ob
jections were still being argued when the
case was adjourned until Monday.
, Collins also took exceptions to the pub
lished statements of A. J. Henry, the
San Francisco notary, who stated that
Collins' version of the allegation of tam
pering with witnesses was untrue and
that he had given a statement to Collins
only on the representation It was wanted
for Judge Duff. The court did not take
any action In this matter. â¢
The charge that Collins had tampered
with a witness, A. J. Henry, notary of
San Francisco, may yet be Investigated,
although Judge Lampman has not tak
en cognizance of the matter. To-day
when Collins' counsel was- objecting to
an Interview with Henry /published In
the Victoria Colonist claiming, that
both Henry and the newspapers were
In contempt of court. Attorney Hig
glns, counsel for the prosecution, said
he did not propose to go Into this mat
ter now to delay the proceedings. The
matter now to be considered was
whether Collins was to be extradited,
but he said he could prove by three
witnesses under oath that Collins bad
tampered with the witness.
"And yojj'll be called upon to prove
it," said Collins. \u25a0
"I am quite prepared to prove It,"
replied Hlggins.
Hlggins said that Collins had given
the first Interview and Henry had given
another contradicting the statements
the; accused made. Higgins said Col
lins had been continually going to the
local press with statements. Judge
Lampman said these Interviews were,
he supposed, designed to be telegraphed
to San Francisco. He did not go into
the matter, which he said was one
which touched Justice Duff.
SANDY HOOK MONSTER
ONLY 16-INCH GUN
Planned to Have Forty, but Cost of
Operating Proved Too
Great.
General Crozler, chief of ordnance of the
army, recently said that while the 16
lnch gun at Sandy Hook, N. jT, will con
tinue as a part of the defense of New'
York harbor, . it is not at all likely that
the Government will build any more guns'
of that caliber. The 16-lnch gun was
-built- at. the .WatervUet arsenal and is the
only one in existence. It weighs 126 tons,
or about 252,000 pounds, its length being
49^ feet and the diameter at the breech
6 feet 2 inches. In the early" experiments
it was found that more than half a ton
of powder, costing $265, was needed to
fire the projectile. The latter cost $600.
The Government might have stood this
outlay were it not for the discovery that
a small regiment of men was. required to
handle the piece properly and also that
it ; was next to impossible to got a safe
carriage for the enormous weapon. About
three times as many men were required
to handle the 16-inch* gun as were needed
to care for a 12-inch.
The Government had planned to build
forty such guns, eighteen to be placed at
Sandy Hook, ten at San Francisco, eight
at Boston and four at Hampton Roads.
The great point made for the gun was
that its projectile would sink . a battle
ship If it hit. - Its range was about twen
ty-one mlles.^or in other words, if fired
with the proper elevation the gun could
send a â¢ projectile ' from Sandy Hook to
City Hall Park. The projectile is sixty
four inches long and weighs 2370 pounds.
The largest army ', guns in use now are
the 12-inch guns.. /
Colonel Greer, the ; ordnance officer in
charge of the Sandy Hook proving #
grounds, says that the experiments with
this gun, ; while showing that the' gun
could do all '.that' was expected of It in
one way, have nevertheless convinced the
experts that as a weapon it is too costly.
"The gun now at Fort Hancock," said
he. "was i ordered,; l think, about seven
years atco.' - when ; it was decided 'to In
crease the caliber of our largest weapon
for coast defense from. twelve to' sixteen
Inches. At that time , England was hav
ing ?. a number of such ; guns made and
great things were predicted for ; them. All
of the English guns were failures. ; Our.
own gun was completed \u25a0 several years
ago and * has . been fired perhaps \u25a0 half a
dozen times In proving It. \u25a0 In : one Vay
it was a success, as it has done all that
was predicted -for it In rangÂ© and effect
iveness/ There is no; doubt of the result
if it ever hit anything.
"On the \u25a0 other hand, ~ however, every
discharge of I -the (gun is tremendously
costly In ? the 'amount, of labor; required
and >in the - expense ; of the charge: The
gun is \u25a0 a little * more likely, : perhaps, \to
miss the j targetthan a smaller gun, and
am iss is : pretty costly. ; Taking it all In
all. It would seem as though several guns
of smaller caliber would be more effect
ive ; than one \u25a0* 16-lnch gun. s . That ., Is the
conclusion j drawn," I think, by most ex
perts who' have looked Into the matter.
It Is hot at all likely,' in my opinion.* that
the. Government : will - Â©ver , build ; another
one, although, of i course," the gun now 'at
Sandy Hook will probably be kept there."

WOMAN IS MADE
CHIEF OPERATOR
Has Chant* of Springfield (Mass.) Of
fice of 'Western Union Com
pany.
Unusual preferment has coma to , Mrs.
Elisabeth Cody, a Great Barrlngton
young woman recently appointed chief
operator of the Springfield (Mass.) office
of tha Western Union Telegraph Com
pany.
The position Is ona that nas taxed tha
brain and nerves of well-endowed men,
yet so far Mrs. Cody has shown that she
can capably fill It. Since shortly after
she. left high school a few years ago she
knows the work from the bottom up.
Manager Horace Rlggleman of tha local
office of the Western Union Company
appointed Mrs. Cody chief operator of
the office to succeed William Fellows.
To the general public this implies little,
but to thoso familiar with the. work of a
telegraph office the appointment of a
woman to a position of such responsibil
ity is significant and possibly has been
looked upon rather skeptically by some
men.
The Springfield office of tha Western
Union Is one of the most Important be
tween New York and Boston, on ac
count of being situated midway between
these cities and carrying all the trunk
and local wires between tnese points.
All of the Chicago and Western wires
from "\u25a0, Boston also pass through the
office. ' -*
The position of chief operator which
has been taken .by Mrs. Cody Is a very
complex -one, as all the -wires demand
more or less attention, and there are 120
local and through wlretMpasslng through
Springfield, which carry a major part of
the leased wires \u25a0 for the .broker service
between New York and Boston. Among
other duties the chief operator Is called
up to test all 'trouble on wires within a
radius of twenty-flyÂ© miles of the city
on all the various routes, and if trouble
is found to see that It is immediately
remedied. She also has to look out for
the traffic of all. the /telegrams and see
that they are sent out promptly, and she
has charge of the alarm and night
watch service, which is an Important
feature.
By this system safes, such as that In
the office of the City Treasurer, are safe
guarded by wires and the moment the
safe is tampered with In the least way
announcement Is made by a big gong
ringing at the telegraph office and the
chief operator hurries a man post-haste
to see what the trouble is. A record has
to be kept also of the closing and opening
of the safes.
The office, with Us seven local
branches, handles 1000 messages a day,
and the main office has under Mrs.
Cody's charge eleven operators, five clerks
and fifteen messengers. The chief oper
ator has charge, too, of the local ticker
service used by local ' brokers. It also
takes care of the automatic repeaters and
of the dynamo plant that supplies tha
current for the various wires. Tha posi
tion of Mrs. Cody Is, In fact, an unusual
one for a woman, as there are very few
men in the telegraph service, says Mr.
Rlggleman, capable of doing the duties
that Mrs. Cody Is called upon to per
form.âBaltimore American. â¢

BOLD ATTEMPT

Bakersfield Authorities Foil
a Plan to Steal the Wife

EX-CONVICT IN PLOT
Officers Refuse to Recog

BAKERSFIELD, July 33.â WTutt ap

attempt to kidnap thÂ« young wlfÂ« of
Quong Chae. a Chinese Interpreter, was
perpetrated yesterday when Constable J.
J. Toomey of San Jose, accompanied by
two Chinese, . arrived In thÂ» city with a
warrant and took steps to arrest th*
woman on a charge of grand larceny.
The local authorities refused absolutely
to 00-operatÂ« with the Santa Clara con

The fact has since been pro vÂ«n that
the woman was never In San Jose Â«.m<

COMMERCIAL VALTTE

To* commercial valua et an Sosbers

annual product of thÂ« Greenland fiords
a result -would bo obtained that would
paralyse tha . thinking faculties of tha
averag* amatsur statistician. Tha good,
salable, frash water, germless coolness
that goes to waste In tha gult stream In
a day would more than pay tha public
debt of the United States, which In 1304
amounted to $367,321,773 73.
Ponder on tha resources and possibili
ties wrapped in an arctic crystal raft 800
feet long. 500 feet from base to summit
and 500 feet thickâ a size by no means
exaggerated. These dimensions mean
200,000,000 cubic feet. Forty-five cublo
feet in the wholesale trade In New York
Is allowed for a ton of congealed water,
but generously call it fifty cubic feet to
the ton. The floating slab would furnish
4,000.001} tons of ice.
An average-sized family In tha temper
ate zone can struggle along with a ton
of ice a year. At the present retail prtco .
of 30 cants a hundred pounds a ton rep
resents $8. The Iceberg, of 4,000.000 tons.
would therefore be worth tha moderate
fortune of $24,000,000.
Estimating the average family as con
taining six persons and each of 4.000,000
households as consuming a ton a year,
the polar island would supply domestlo
refrigerating for 24,000.000 persons for 385
days. One hundred pounds of Ice will
freeze tan gallons of ice cream. A ton
will freeze 200 gallons. The suppositlous
Ice chunk would freeze 4,000,000 times 200
gallons, which equals 800,000.000 gallons.
A gallon .of â¢ cream at one sitting' pro?
vides sufficient helping for twenty-four
persons If the guests are not all. women.
Hence this solitary lump, which Is only
one of a thousand born every month dur

circle, would provide enough lea to fur

He is a native of Lodz, Poland, where
he made a competence as a merchant,

BILL RAISERS
ARE IN PRISON
Detectives Succeed in Arrest
ing the Third of a Trio
of Crooks Long Sought
OPERATIONS EXTENSIVE
Western Country Is Flooded
With Bank Notes Raised
From One to Ten Dollars
Frederick . Johnson, the' last of a trio
of crooks who have flooded the Western
country with $1 note's raised to '$10, was
placed under arrest yesterday afternoon
by Detectives Graham and Harrison and
SÂ«cret Service Agent Foster and placed
in the City Prison. Frank Hastings, the
first Df the trio, was arrested in San
Jose; Leo Greiggs, .. the - second, was ar-.
rested in this city Friday, and, Johnson's
arrest was accomplished when he at
tempted to pass one of the bills in a
Mission store. All will be held to answer
before the United States authorities.
The operations of the men have been
very extensive during the past six
months. The secret service agents
throughout the Western States have been
unable to detect the bill raisers although
they trailed them from city to city. The
crooks used genuine $1 notes and cut
ciphers and letters from Confederate and
New Brunswick bills. The latter they
pasted on the good bill. The work was
not of a delicate character, but the notes
passed in most cases and several thou
sand of them were placed in circulation.
At the beginning of the Portland Exposi
tion the authorities experienced much
trouble and the bill raisers changed the
seat of their operations to California.
About two weeks ago Johnson and Hast
ings were trailed to San Jose and the
officials succeeded In arresting Hastings,
but Johnson made his escape. The
search was kept up and the' arrest of
Greiggs and Johnson followed in this
city. V >

Distinguished Officers of

The Salvation Army soldiers and ad
herents scattered around â¢ the bay are
looking forward with considerable eager
ness* to the arrival, of the Oceanic liner
Sonoma, which is due, on .Monday next.
This expectation is caused by the news
which has been received at the provincial
headquarters here that there are on
board this steamer a party of distin
guished Salvation Army officers, namely,
Colonel and Mrs. Kyle, Colonel and Mrs.
Peart, Brigadier and Mrs. plover and
their respective families.. \u25a0 .\ v : \u25a0 .
Colonel and Mrs. Peart are not known
here except by \u25a0 reputation, this being
their first visit to America, the colonel's
entire service in the army having been

I has Just given up the 'chief secretaryship
to take up a similar position at the na
tional headquarters in New York.
\ Brigadier and Mrs. Glover are also new
comers,' the appointment to which' they.
i are proceeding being that of commanding
officers of the work in the colony of New
foundland, but it is more particularly to
the return of Colonel and Mrs. Kyle that
the . local workers are looking forward.
The Kyles, at that time holding the rank
of majors, had charge of all the Salva
tion Army work up and down the Pacific
Coast some twelve years ago, and during
their stay here endeared themselves very
I much, not only to the Salvationists, but
i also to the other Christian workers, by
j their thorough sincerity, hard . toil and
i zeal. . \u25a0' . -. :\u25a0 " ... - ' . .
During their stay hare ' different new
ventures were inaugurated, such as the
Cavalcade Brigade, which was a party
of Salvation Army officers who toured
California on horseback,, holding revival
services in the cities, and villages 'and
through the mining \ and lumber . camps
and cut of the way places. They also
put on thÂ« road' a special brigade known
as the "Charioteers" who. did similar
work, but traveled in one of the old-time
stage coaches. ; . , . ; v, '
Doubtless a number ;of . Salvationists
will be at the wharf .bright' and early
Monday morning; to give a Jiearty wel
come to these visitors. <fr
-Besides this,, a. welcome reception" is

will be presided 'over by Colonel French, |
the provincial ..offlcpr,:. located 'here, and

an' interesting one. '

says that his superiors did not know. his

captors would spare her honor In liberat
ing him. Then a search of his pockets
brought to light $5 75 in cash, a counter
felt quarter dollar, two mutilated silver
coins and four keys, all of which were
subsequently \ proved to have been ab
stracted from the shattered cash register.
He. was taken back to the store, where
the note signed "Raffles" brought upon
him the derisive laughter of the police
men. * â¢ ' â¢ Â»
"Why did you go Into the lodging-house
when' you might -tiave escaped by staying
on the street?" Patrolman McCormick
Inquired. ,
Mr. Lesenby blasted-. the fence-scaling
theory by replying that he was captured
ere he reached the street. He had
escaped from the grocery by ascending
.to .the roof, and passing thence to the
roof of the lodging-house, which hÂ» en
tered through a skylight, and was head-
Ing for the street ,when the ofHcera
caught him. â¢ \u0084 â¢\u25a0 .
In the court of Police Judge Friti the
would-be emulator of Raffles was ar
raigned for burglary, and next Tuesday
he will be given opportunity to put up

Indignation' mantled^the ' brow and
vitrlolized the voice of Mary Bowen as
she Informed Judge Conlan that the
charge of stealing William Edwards'
$27 suit of clothing was trumped up
and had basis only In the spiteful tem
perament of William's sister, name not
disclosed In court.
"She's raad at me." Miss Bowen de
clared, alluding to the anonymous one,
"simply because I wouldn't give. her a
drink from the can of beer with which
I was going from the grocery to my
home when she met me on the. street.
I'm not stingy with my beer, but I'd
never encourage the gall of any one
who would ask me for it. especially on
THE -SAN; : ; FRANCISCO . ; CALL:, ; -SUNDAY r % JULY v 30,'; 1905. .-'-'\u25a0>
the street. There was no morg beer In
the can than was needed at my, home,"
but even if I had gallons to, spare ' I
wouldn't give a drop to any one who'd
ask me for it. particularly on the street.
I think that treats should be waited for,
and not asked for. and if the same thing
was to happen again it would be no dif
ferent. Steal his clothes? What do I
know about his clothes? If he ever had
a $27 suit I never saw It."
Mr. Edwards, who dwells at 224
Fifth street, averred he had every rea
son to warrant belief, and hoped to be
able to prove beyond shadow of doubt
that Miss Bowen "lifted" the $27 suit
which was stolen from him on June 30,
as no other person than she, outside his
own family circle, every member of
which was above even a shadow of sus
picion, had opportunity^ steal and get
away with his garments. True, the
missing apparel had not been found,
but with the assistance of Patrolman J.
E. Ward, who arrested the defendant,
Mr. Edwards hoped not only to discover
the whereabouts of the plunder,, but
also' to firmly fasten upon Miss Bowen
the guilt of having pilfered It. Would

MAY HADE FOUND MICROBE
WHICH GIVES HEALTH.
Dr. Burke of England Talks of His, "Radiobes"
EseciaJ Cable to The Call.
LONDON. July 29.â srnce the first
'sensational report that he had discov
ered a part of the greatest secret In
the world â the origin of life â J. Butler
Burke has been onÂ© of the busiest men
to b,e found anywhere. His rooms near
the famous Cavendish" Laboratory at
Cambridge, where he has conducted
most of his Investigations for the last
three years, have been fairly flooded
with letters, cable messages, curious
inquirers, photographers' and reporters.
The brilliant young Irish scientist
\u25a0was not used to reporters and let them
haye 1 their way with him for, a short
time after his modest announcement of
his discovery. But some of them be
. came a bit confused in their* struggles
with the technicalities of the conduct
of â¢'radiobes" arid similar mysteries, and
the -result was a version of the matter
that- considerably astonished Mr. Burke
and made him virtually shut down on
the .interviewing business. Therefore,
â¢ !t : was by a special dispensation that
the writer was permitted to spend sev
eral, hours with Mr. Burke in his rooms
. in that historic lace known as Trinity
street, Cambridge, and to gain from
"him fuller and later Information than
has yet been printed concerning the
nature and scope of what seems likely
to prpve the greatest scientific discov
ery of tha century.
I. found Mr. Burke in his suite of
rooms above a book store at the corner
of Trinity and Green streets; a stone's
throw from old Trinity College, where
many of the monarchs of England, got
their university education. The outlook
from his window is hardly inspiring,
the .shops on the other side of the lane
Tjeing so close that a boy could touch
thÂ«m with a fish-pole. But, surrounded
by his books and his test tubes, and
tvitli r.ot only Darwin and Huxley but
NV'wman and even Ruskin looking down
u}Â»on him from the walls of his'roo'm,
and working in a scientific university
a'tmpsphere ripened by ages, Mr. Burke
needs nb elaborate landscape to Inspire
him' In his investigations. ' |
t A MODEST SCIENTIST. . .
Like many other .famous scientists,
the discoverer of "radiobes" is an ex
cetdinsriy modest and unassuming man.
On meeting him casually, one would
say thai he was simply a good fellow,
wlio toÂ«k iht world as he found It and
helped things out' with a sense-of hu
mor; of medium' height, with bronzed
face, piump chucks and a good-humored
expression. He would be selected as a \u25a0
congenial companion rather than as the
man whose, discoveries bid fair to turn,
up*ide down the theories of the world's
greatest physicists and biologists.
John Butler. N Burke. is an ; Irishman,
with 1 the Irishman's fighting spirit, but"
he has turned his pugnacity to nature
and his record shows his determination
t6 wrest from her some of her great
secrtts. The Burkes of Ower are one
of the oldest families In Gal way. When
16 years old, John Butler left his home
and went to Trinity College, Dublin,
and there took his degree, working- un
der Professor Fitzgerald in scientific
research. Afterward he went to Ma
son's College., Birmingham, as a lec
turer, and subsequently . gained a fel
lowship at Owens College. Manchester, .
where he was a colleague of. Professor
Schuster. Three years ago, after work
ing with Professor Thomson, he took
a degree in research at Cambridge.
1 asked Mr. Burke how it was that
he came to take up the work' that led,
to the discovery that uas so suddenly
made him famous. . . r .
"I have been interested for many,
years in making conjectures concern
ing a possible means of connecting the
Inanimate with the animate," " replied
Mr. Burke. "About three years ago .it
occured to me that. cyanogen might- be.
a source of life, according to Pfluger's .
theory." ..' .-..'. v-*v. " ..\u25a0 ;-'..
"And did you try. at., that -tins*:-' to'",

MAKES tJSB OP RADniÃf. â¢
"After my failure to produce results
with cyanogen, about six or seven
months ago; I began to try a similar
experiment with culture medium . and,
radium* Tom understand' that by cul-'
ture medium I mean what. is frequently
called bouillon, and which is not. much
more or less than sterilized beef tea.'
"I thought of trying radium Instead
of cyanogen because of the vast store
of energy displayed hy this substance,
and the unstability. or what may be
* called the decay, of its atoms. There
Is a striking analogy between its be
havior and that of some organic matter.
"In preparing the experiment I made
my beef tea by adding to the extract of
one pound of beef, one litre of water,
together with 1 per cent of Wltter-Pep
tone. 1 per cent of common salt and
about 10 per cent of gelatine. I, sterll
llzed this mixture by heating It under;
pressure at a temperature of 130 de- ;
grees Centigrade (equivalent to 256 de- i
grees above zero on our. Fahrenheit i
thermometer) for thirty minutes. This !
sterilization was made in test tubes :
stopped up with cotton wool and each
one containing also a small, hermetlca.l- \u25a0
ly scaled tube, one end of which was
drawn out to a fine point, so that it;
would be easily broken, and Inside j
which was a little radium bromide. ,)
When the sterilization had been com- I
pleted. by means of a . wire I broke the j
tube containing the radium salt, which \u25a0\u25a0
then fell Into the bouillon. . After about
twenty-four hours a peculiar bacteria-;
like growth appeared on the surface of;,
the'liquid and gradually made -Its way!
downward- until after a fortnight,. In j
some cases It had grown fully acentl--;
meter beneath the surface. .A number;
of test tubes, also containing sterilized |
bouillon, Tv'blch had been set -aside* the';

WANTS TO WED
AN APT PUPIL
A. T. Isola Teaches Italian
Language to Miss Sprunck
and Falls Madly in Love
HIS SUIT IS REJECTED
She Applies for a Warrant
for His Arrest for Annoy
ing Her With Attentions
} A. T. Isola is a persistent wooer, but
.unless he restrains himself he'wlllsoou
be in" a prison. Miss" H. Sprunck, , the
object of his adoration, called -at the
oifice of the Bond, and Warrant Clerk
\ on Friday and asked' for a warrant for
Isola's arrest. She said he was making
life a burden to her after he had pro
posed marriage and she. had given him
lan unequivocal refusal.. He would not
take no for an answer, and for some
months ahe had noticed an entire
change in his demeanor and conduct.
She said she became acquainted with
him about. two years ago. He is an
Italian, well connected, and, as she was
desirous of learning the Italian 1 lan
guage, he 1 "- agreed to teach her i ah"d â¢ she
assumed the responsibility of teaching'
him the English language. She proved
an apt pupil, but he was the reverse.
From teacher laola became lover, ami
about eight months ago he offered her
his hand and heart. She -refused him,
and her mother chided him for hts pre
sumption. He has been annoying her
ever since, and she was'afrald that hÂ«
migut do her serious injury.
\u25a0 A letter was sent to Isola to be at
the Bond and 'Warrant Clerk's office '
yesterday afternoon,, and he was .there, j
Miss Sprunck was also present. Miss
Sprunck 'eald> tnat Isola" -had rung the
door bell of their house on Sacramento
street about .3 olclock ,in,. the- morning
and' had shoved the note sent to him :
under the door. On the, back of the :
note he had written' that If she want
ed to tbring suit against- him she could
do so. out she was to remember that j
he had money and It would 1 -b'e-r seen
which would win. When she,, left the ;
broker's office where . she is'- employed]
intending to go to her -'lunch
eon, Isola was standing in a.doorway. doorway
adjoining, and as she passed he. raised
his hat and followed her.
Isola aQted so queerly that Miss
Sprunck was advised to have him taken
before the Insanity Commissioners. L . He
became angry and shouted: v "I am': no
Torturlcl; I am an Italian "gentleman."'
He finally promised not; to .-innoy ;Miss:
Sprunck .again, -and^, left .the -following
addresses/where^- he said, the police
could * flnd .him if -he broke his word;;
634 Green street.; 702 Front street and :

she would give him another chance, and

GAME LAWS MAY
BE SHAKEN UP.
Los Angeles District Court Makes an
Important Ruling Agamst the
Supervisors of State.
â¢LOS ANGELES, July 29.â 1f the Dis
trict Court of Appeals carries to the
expected conclusion*' a decision ren
dered to-day, all acts of Board of Su
pervisors throughout, the State, limit
ing the game laws below what is pro
vided by the State law will be null and
void and sportsmen will only be gov
erned by the laws which the Legisla
ture may enact. In a test case of the
dove law the court decided against the
Board of Supervisors, . declaring that'
the action of that body in reducing the
open season for doves in* this county is
unconstitutional. The decision ren
dered ' was a verDal one, intended ' to
grant only a writ of habeas corpus, but
it will be followed by a full opinion
In which the court, will clearly define
its position. - . .Â»
Recently -;the Los Angeles .Super
visors passed an ordinance limiting the
open season for doves to- only one day
and it was* this .ordinance that the
sportsmen here attacked.- One-of their
number was arrested, remained in Jail
and sought release by means. of habeas
corpus'proceedings. The case was bit
terly jfought, . but the court granted the
writ and seV-the man at liberty. \u25a0
,i The effect of the decision-is to set at
naught all efforts of Supervisors to
limit the open season. The reasonable
conclusion drawn from -the action of
the court Is that any limitation is un
constitutional and that the Legislature
alona-has power to fix the time within
which game may or may not be killed.
The effect of this decision is far
reaching, inasmuch as It applies to the
whole State, unless the Supreme Court
reverses'the action of the Appellate
Court, which is not probable. ..;' ,
A Rellartoiui Epidemic.
. It Is reported by one of the mission
aries in the work of the Presbyterian
Foreign Board that In the districts of
Kaoml and Kiaochou, in China, there is
a sort of -religious epidemic similar to
those occurring in Europe In the Middle
Ages. Abelief has started among the
people that the gods are passing
through the skies, and that, if besought,
they will provide remedies with which
the sick may be healed. The belief has
spread with remarkable '-. rapidity from
village to vllla'ge, and ln the fields hun
dreds of people may be seen kneeling In
prayer in front of burning incense, witlv
some cake and wine as offerings. It is
said that in one village 2000 people were
thus engaged. When the Incense la
burned the ashes are taken and given to
the sick to eat. The officials are fear
ing- that disturbances may result, and
are seeking to* put a stop to the prac

RAIDS CHICAGO POOLROOM?*

CHICAGO. 3uly 29.â After a day of ac
tivity against hand books ] and poker 9 .
rooms, Chief of Police Collins* .men. JaÂ»t
night attacked the poolroom and gam
bling-house cf James O'Lear/ at 4187-4135? ri
Halsted street., Telephon#Â»* a big tele- \'
phone switchboard and five poker tables **
were smashed and confiscated. BP"fiE
- Entrance to the place was effected
after almost two hours of work by the
policemen.' who battered down five heavy *.
oak doors and a doaen trap doors with,
sledge | hammers - and rams.
â¢ Before the police reached the room, bet
ting sheets and other paraphernalia were â¢ '
destroyed. The persons in the place when
the police made their attack escaped, it
is thought, down a shaft three feet wideÂ»
which extended from the fourth floor to
the basement. * Trap doors and other se
cret exits were found. One trap door led
to an exit to an adjoining building.
Earlier in the day gambling raids un
der Chief Collins' direction resulted in
the arrest of forty men. keepers of poSer
room?, handbook men and the inmates
of the resorts. To show that the "clean-Â»
up" is not desultory and for effect only.*
the Chief's "flying squadron" went over
the ground covered on Thursday and
again raided two places that previously
had been closed. The proprietors had
thought they were Immune from further
arrest when they had pleaded guilty and
paid their fines.
Seventeen keepers of gambling resorts *
and thirty-five Inmates of the places werÂ«
fined in the Harrison Street Police Court.
With one exception the keepers were
fined $25 and costs each and the "guests'*

Of General Oglethorpe. the founder or
the State of Georgia. Boswell, Dr.
Johnson's biographer. relates this
story: "When a very young: man. only
fifteen, serving under Prince Eugene of
Sa.voy. he was sitting at table in com
pany with a Prince of the House of
Wurttemberg. who took up a glass of
wine and by a fillip made some of It
fly into Oglethorpe's face. The young
soldier was in a dilemma. He dara
not challenge so distinguished* a per
sonage, yet he must notice the affront.
Therefore, keeping? his eye fixed on
his Highness and smiling at the time.
as if he took what had been done in
Jest. Offlethorpa. exclaimed: "That's a
good joke, but we. do It much better in
England." Whereupon he flung a whole
g-laS3ful of wine ln the Prince's face.
The affair ended in good humor."
Destiny* is decided'not by definitions but
by deeds. ,WHITE CAR BREAKS RECORD
HENSLEY BEATS NARES' TIME
MORE THAN THREE HOURS
Machine Covers the Entire Distance Without Mishap
I/>S AXQETLES, Xaly 29.â TbÂ« automo
bile record betvreen San Francisco and
this city â¢went glimmering this evening
vhÂ«n George Henaley, A. H. Plepenberg.
B. Siesfred and H. D. P.yua dashed into
town.' after covering the entire distance
In twenty-ono hours and twelve minutes
in their big fifteen horsepower White
â¢teazner. The men were dust covered
and worn looking, but bright and cheer
ful and full of enthusiasm after having
broken the record without meeting with
the ellgnteet mishap.
The run was the greatest triumph In
the auto breaking record line ever known
on the coast. The White car cut more
than thre hours off the best previous
time made on the run, which was ac
complished by I*. A. Nares and his party
on July 17. when they made the run in
twenty-four hours and fifty-four minutes.
This was considered remarkable time,
but the run of the White car is so mucli
better that all the motor world is now
talking about it.
Had not Hensley and his party gone
estray near Salinas they would have
made the run in much better time. Early
this morning while they were makfng a
chort cur from San Juan to Natlvidad
they took the wrong road and they had
progressed ten miles before they dis
covered their mistake. This blunder con
sumed some time, but the game Hc-n
cley was not a bit daunted by the mis
fortune as he felt sure he could break
the record even with such a handicap.
ir The machine ran along at a breakneck
pace all the way and not an accident
marred Its course. The tires held out in
perfect style end the motor never gave
the slightest bit of trouble. But three
stops were made en route and these
were rery brief. Hensley and his com
panions ate their meals on the car and
thought not a thought of sleep during
the long, tedious trip!
Ryus and fÂ»iepenberg presided at the
wheel during the entire run. They would
alternate every few miles, and In this
way they managed to get an occasional
rest and the switching worked . perfectly,
much better results being attained than
if one man ran the machine all the way.
Hensley and Slegfred occupied the rear
eeat of the machine, the latter looking
after .the mechanism of the auto and
oiling the bearings when needed, which
was not often.
The trip from San Francisco to Los
Angeles is much more difllcult than the
one from Los Angeles to San Francisco,
bo the record made by the White car is
all the more creditable, as Nares' run
â¢wes made in the opposite direction over
a road that Is less hilly. Many thought
that Hensley would never break the re
cord over the hilly road, but his game
ness and the staying powers of the White
car knocked all these prophecies sky
high.
The White car steamed through Santa
. Barbara at 2:20 this afternoon, well
ahead of the record. Hensley knew then I
he would beat Nares' time, but instead
Cf taking it easy, he had the machine
' cent through at top speed with the In
tention of making the entire run In
twenty hours if possible. The machine
made the dangerous run over the much j
dreaded Casltas Pass in five hours and
minutes, plowing through the dust
without the slightest difficulty.
A great crowd was on hand to greet i
Hensley and his companions when they i
tore into town at 7:27 this evening. The |
trip of the car had been bulletined all j
along the line, and those in waiting knew
', the record was broken and they gave the
party a fitting reception.
"All I can cay about the trip," said
Hehsley. "Is that we- left The Call bulld-
Jng In, San Francisco at 10:15 last night
1 and here we are a little worn out and
dusty looking but full of life and en
thusiasm. The trip was a great, success j
In every sense of the word. The machine I
v^tood, the test in great style and we did j
have the slightest bit of trouble j
i!ath It. I knew I could break the record I
and now I . have shown the world that
, l am there.
"And we are not through yet, either.
We will start back to San Francisco and
try to make the return trip In record j
tim*. As- the road is much easier the I
â¢ other way, I think we shall be able to ;
cover the distance yin twenty hours, i
The machine is In perfect trim and will \
.stand the going on the return trip as j
well as it did the first onel" ,
'" The car that Hensley and his party j
â¢ broke the record with Is a 1905 model !

boilerleÂ£3 type and compound engine. It j
is a regular touring .machine and had i
mucn hard usage before it shattered the
record.

CATTLE TO BE KILLED
IN J HUMANE MANNER
United States . Consul ut London Re
ports .Yew Invention for
- the Purpose.
Ice and Cold Storage prints a picture of
a humane cattle-slaughtering pistol which
has recently- been Introduced at a Putney
(London) slaughter-house, and comments
on various applances of a humane char
acter which have been developed for the
rapid and painless dlspatch-of animals
used for food. It says the most familiar
of such appliances, now In use in many
abattoirs In Europe, is . the Brunrieau
mask, which" has. however, the - incon
venience of not being readily attached
for use. A number 'of . inventions have:
since been made which have the same \u25a0
idea,, viz: a hollow tube fixed in the cen
ter of a leather hood. to cover the eyes
of the animal; but while the Brunneau
mask has a tube inclosing a bolt which
can be .driven readily into the skull, the
more modern Instruments are gun .barrels
which discharge a shot intotthe'skull and
cause - instantaneous j stupefaction. As the
shot frequently lodges â¢ in the vertebral
column and ' otherwise destroys the head
for practical use, it is not "thoroughly
satisfactory. . . .
The device in use at Putney Is like an
ordinary single-barrel pistol of' large cal
iber; but Instead of discharging a shot
it drives out with great . force a j bolt,
which has occupied the full length of the
pistol barrel, and . this,, entering the skull
of an animal, I produces instantaneous
stupefaction, without- lodging a shot In
the brainpan to lessen the sale, value of
the head. ' When the animal \ falls the
operator pulls" out the -bolt, which has
pierced to a depth of about three inches,
and returns It to the pistol, the gas from
the explosion escaping both by the cham
ber opened to eject the cartridge before
putting In a fresh one ana by a channel
provided in the bolt. ,
The advantages the inventor claims for
the pistol are: (1) After the shot the ani
mal falls to the ground dead; (2) all dan
ger of stray shots to people in the slaugh
ter-house are absolutely avoided; (3) the
discharging of the pistol takes place with
out any objectionable noise; (4) only one
hand is required for using the pistol, and
this is regarded as of great importance
in killing pigs, as the left hand is free
for fixing the animal's head; (5) the easy
and rapid working of the pxstol makes it
capable of being used in slaughter-houses
cf any size; (6) the apparatus never gets
hot, even after hundreds of shots; have
been fired In quick succession; (7). it may
be cleaned and oiled rapidly and easily,
and the cartridges are protected against
dampness, which has to be reckoned with
In slaughter-houses. '

CHIXKSR EMPIRE FILLED - .-
WITH SECRET SOCIETIES
Real Frrrma<onrr, However, Does Not
Exist In (he Celestial '
Kingdom. . - .
The installation of a grand master of
the Chinese secret orders in the United
States, popularly known ' as the "Chi
nese Freemasons," has aroused Inter
est in the question of "th connection
between the Chinese " secret societies
and the Masonic body. Allusions to
"Chinese Freemasonry" appear periodi
cally in the newspapers, though ac
cording to the Cyclopedia of Fraterni
ties there is ;no such thing as Free
masonry among the Chinese. ' V r
;.' The only Masonic lodges in China are
1 in the foreign concessions' at\ the* sea
ports. Their membership is composed
exclusively of others, than Chinese and
they are conducted under foreign war
rants. The* rites of the Chinese secret
societies bear \ some â¢ resemblance to
those of ; the Freemasons",, which ac
counts for the popular supposition of a
connection between the two. .The simi
larity, though more apparent than real ;
'Is remarkable In view of the antiquity
of both, and the Impossibility of either
to have been patterned after the other.
China is filled with secret societies,
most of which have for "their . object
the overthrow of , the 9 Tslng dynasty,
with a' pretended' benevolent purpose to
veil the. political. signiflcaTTce of the or
ganization. The most powerful of
these societies, the Kalao Hui, num
bers more than 1,000,000.
. 'The Cyclopedia of Fraternities con
tains an account of an initiation cere
mony at a Chinese lodge in Spokane,
Wash., at which four white men, Free
masons, â¢ were present by invitation.
The lodge" represented a benevolent
branch of the: Kalao, Hul. There were
references to the "Immortal three," cir
cumambulatlon, four stations at which
questions were asked and answers re
turned, kneeling on crossed swords, tea
drinking, burning incense, a traditional
season o*Â»refreshment and sign In
which \u25a0 the head and hands were unable
to detect anything which resembled the
Masonry with which they were fa
miliar. V '

count of the secret; signs used by the
Triad Sooiety, : which was at the bot
tom of the Talplng. rebellion:

The Seals can win ball games when it
is too late. They performed like a bunch
of world's champs yesterday and sent
the Tigers away without a look-in at the
pan. Everybody on the team was play
ing the game and there were no boots,
nor dropping of pop flies or anything of
that sort. v
Busher Henley had everything a young
pitcher needs. He kept twisting 'em
around the necks of the Tigers and had
them going out a foot after his big
breaks, but still they never could make
good. In fact they were, never dangerous i
and did not figure in any inning save
the first, -when Nordyke .doubled after
two were already gone.
Emerson, the boy wonder from San
Jose, was the candy in every inning save
the fifth, when the Seals walloped him
for three of. those kind of hits that al
ways brings runs * through. He also
escaped luckily in the next period, when
three more were rolled up, but a dummy
play at third base spoiled .the Seals"
chances for a run or more.
Wheeler began the rally in the fifth
by knocking one through the infield and.
Spencer responded with a drive to left,
sending Wheeler around to third.
: Spencer chased down to second and when
Waldron ripped one over the third sack
they all came home and broke up the
game there without any more ceremony.
Mike Fisher got a bunch of telegrams
from the enthusiastic fans of Tacoma,

THE INCO JffPARABLE WHITE
STEAM CAR
THE AUTOMOBILE FOR SERVICE
The car^ driven by George A. Hensley from San Francisco to
Los Angeles, which so decisively beat all previous records, was the
regular 15-horsepower stock car of the 1905 -pattern.
The White Automobile has so repeatedly demonstrated its su-
periority over all other cars that its marvelous achievements are
known to all who take. the slightest interest in automobihng. In
racrs against tf me, in endurance contests, in hill climbing, in cross-
country touring, and in meeting the most exacting demands of or-
dinary use, its accomplishments have ' been so uniformly successful
that its reliability- is established beyond dispute. The White Steamer
is absolutely" incomparable, because its many triumphs have been
scored with stock cars-r-cars in every respect identical with those
obtainable by the general public. This emphasizes and proves the
claims of its manufacturers that in efficiency one car is the equal of
another, and that each buyer of a White receives the fullest possible
value for theÂ» money expended.
The White Steam Automobile is the most durable machine on
the market, and its wonderful simplicity and flexibility of control,
combined with economy of maintenance, make It the most desirable
of cars. It is not only noiseless, but it is vibrationless, and in every
other requirement it has attained a degree of perfection that places
it in a class by itself. Those elements of danger so plentiful m the
average, car have been entirely eliminated from the White, making
it a safe vehicle for all purposes, for all times and under, all condi-
tions. There is no complicated or delicate mechanism to get out
of order, and there are consequently no annoying breakdowns to
marine pleasure of an outing. It runs quietly and smoothly, re-
sponds instantly to every touch, and with all its sensitiveness is so
sturdy that it withstands rough usage to a greater extent than any
other car known. It requires only a few brief instructions for. the
novice to manipulate it, and women operate it with the same feeling
of security as men. The White is deservedly the most popular auto-
mobile manufactured, and it is worthy # of note that whoever owns a
White becomes an enthusiastic champion.
The White is the standard steam automobile of the world, made,
so by years of improvement and development, and the fact . that it
easily defeats gas cars of greater Indicated horsepower is conclusive
that steam as a motive power, when utilized in the manner peculiar
to the White, is more certain of satisfactory results than any other
existing force. Talk to" the owner of a White and you will readily
understand why it holds first place in his esteem. You will learn
that while it furnishes comfort to passengers it is capable of great
speed; that it will, without hesitation, mount the steepest inclines;
that it carries itself through mud and .mire, overcomes . all obstacles
and will go any place you want to go. There are reasons for these
points of excellence that are easily explained.
Note a Few Late Victories:
v On July 4th a{ Morris Park, New York, Webb Jay, driving a
15 h. p. White steam car, broke the world's record for a mile, re-
ducing the figures to 48 3-5 seconds, x^: . *
At the same meet the White Avon every race in which it was en-
tered.
It carried, off the "Morris" cup.
Won the" heavyweight championship of the world by defeating
the champion of France.
*Won the "Diamond", cup and won the National Circuit Cham-
pionship, making a record ! never approached by any make of car.
Webb Jay. with a White Steamer, had orcviously defeated Bar-
ney Oldfield at Chicago, June 30th, and has not only beaten his
records, but has defeated him a number of times on the track, leav-
ing Jay and the White Steamer, the undisputed champion of the
world; and this, against gasoline cars rated up to 120 h. p. .
The White won the $10,000 cup at the Chicago Automobile
Meet June 30. 1005, and carried off all the honors of that meet.
White car on the Pacific Coast has won over thirty cups in
important racing events, which is more than all other cars com-
bjned of it's class, md in many of these races cars claiming twice
to three times the horsepower and selling for a great deal more
'mbrievj -were "among the "also-ran."
The White. car defeated all American cars in the Eagle Rock
hill-climbing.- contest; it won first and second place in the endur-
ance run- from Chicapo to St. Paul on July Ist, 1905, one White
car starting 24 hours behind and finishing 12 hours ahead of all other
contestants, including many gasoline cars of higher price and claim-
ing-, greater power. \u0084â¢

about 1280 feet. At that level plants,

DETROIT. July 29.â Rain tills after
noon prevented the horsemen at the
Grosse Point track from finishing the
three races that were unfinished yester
day afternoon when rain began falling 1 .
It was .therefore decided to settle the
2:06 pace and 2:10 trot according to
the standing of the horsea after the
second heat yesterday and to trot the
third and final heat of the Merchants'
and Manufacturers' Consolation Stake
Monday afternoon.
In the 2: OS pace Baron Orattan was
accorded the race, with Winfleld Strat
ton second; Riley B third and Hazel
Patch fourth. AnodrosU finished fourth
and third yesterday, and was also a
money winner. Inthe 2:10 trot Zephyr
was given the race. Second money was
awarded to Norman B. Brown; WUter
was given third money.
It Is possible that the owners of the
three horses left in the M. & M. conso
lation may get together and agree to a
division of the money to obviate the
necessity for trotting a third heat Mon- â¢

the foothills,, are to be found the ideal loca-
tions for homes. . :VÂ£j^" V i
Cut off as it is by the wide semicircle of
foothills from the winds and the fogs from the
Golden Gate and by its natural drainage. East
Oakland la conceded to have the moat health-
glvlag cllmattt In the world, where sickness
is almost unknown.
From the terraced alopea is afforded the
grandeat panorama of aurrounding landscape.
No other place on the Paclflo Coast com-
blnea so much natural beauty.
The shore of the eastern crescent of. the
harbor Is being rapidly altered by the work
now In progressâ the bulkheadlng of the water,
front for the reclamation of the land about
the bay, affording additional sites for factory
building and with the deepening of the chan-
nel for large vessels makes this an unexcelled
harbor. â¢:â¢'\u25a0
On the flat of East Oakland along the water
front are now -locs ted factories having over a
thousand employes, while other factories are
in course of construction at the present time.
The streets of East Oakland are well paved
with macadam and with asphalt. Many miles
of cement sidewalks have been laid. The
grades are not steep, following the natural
terraces. - ___
East Oakland is supplied by an excellent
twenty-minute train service by the Southern
Pacific and ia but thirty-five minutes from
San Francisco. _ \u25a0
The coming of the Western Pacific means
' the shortening of ten minutes in the time -
between East Oakland and San Francisco and
an Increase of twenty thousand in the popula-
tion of this locality. - ;

street railways connecting it with Oakland.

AUSTIN DECLARES HE WAS SHANGHAIED
Nearly Goes to Sea
on the Battle
Â» 'ix. kJ kJ y â¢
Drinks Tainted Li
quor and Wakes
Up on Ship:
Alfred J. Austin, a house painter from
Pennsylvania, who arrived in this city
a few days ago in search of work, says
he- was shanghaied Friday evening: by
Warren P. Herman, a shipping ;naster
in business at 27 Steuart street. Aus
tin was. "broke." He had sold his
clothes and with part of the proceeds
purchased a second hand khaki uni
form. He was living on the remnant
of the difference when he encountered ,
Herman. The story is best told by Aus
tin himself.
' "I sot a job to go to work Monday
with a grading outnt. I was walking;
down Market street about dusk on Fri- I
c day when Herman stopped me. '
c "'Looking for work?' he said. |
" 'Bet I am.' I told him.
" "Come and have a drink,' said Her
man.
" -Sure.' said I. "We went Into a sa
loon and we had one, j
â¢"Have another." insisted Herman.
"Then somebody shook me and I !
heard a voice, 'Get out of this you ;
bloody stiffs. Get on deck and sign \u25a0
articles. Look lively, now.*' j
- ri was in the forecastle of the Brit- I
ish ship Battle Abbey, about to sail for j
Fremantle, Australia. My throat I
burned, my eyes felt too big for their |
sockets and such a head. Phew!" ,
"Say 'yep' to everything the captain
asks you," whispered somebody in his j
car as he walked along the deck. j
Austin refused to sign articles. He
explained to Captain Davison that he j
was not a sailor and had no desire to .
learn how. In the parlance of the. sea j
he was a "stiff" and as Captain Davison \u25a0
has a sailor man's aversion to the j
"stiff" and as there was still time to .
gret a sailor in his place, he ordered |
Herman, who was on board, to take
Austin ashore.
- "I'll come back and get him," said
Herman. The shipping master went
ashore, hunted up Policeman. McGreevy
and told him there was an army de
serter on' the British ship Battle Abbey.
He would bring him ashore, he said,
anti McGreevy could arrest him.
By the time Austin reached land his
htad was fairly clear. He accompanied
McGreevy to the Harbor Police station
and there told so fair a tale that Cap
tain Martin would have let him go had
he beeti attired in "anything but that
khaki uniform. The Presidio authori
ties were notified and about three
hours later informed the police that as
far as the army was concerned Aus- i
tin was not wanted. The painter, was j
released. He will prosecute Herman, \u25a0
he says, if there is any way to reach >
that individual. And then, as soon as i
he earns enough, he will return to I
Pennsylvania. '

Considerable anxiety is being mani

Centennial, which left here June 12 for
the Russian port of N'icolaefskl with &.
cargo of sajt. She arrived safely at
Dutch Harbor on July 23 and July 26
resumed her voyage. Since then noth
ing has been heard of her. There is
cable communication with Nicolaefski,
and her arrival there would have been
<~ reported had she put in an appearance.
It is feared that either she has got into
trouble in the ice or that the Japanese
have gathered her in. She is well
known to the Japanese. During their
war with China the little brown men
used the- Centennial, then the Takasago
Mtiiu, as an army transport: She was
built in 1859 in London for the Penin
sular .and Oriental Steamship Company
J and as the side-wheeler Delta she was

QUIETLY DROPS
INTO THE CITY
Traffic Manager Schumacher
of Oregon Short Line to
to Attend the Conference
COMING IS UNEXPECTED
Is Harrimaii's Choice for a
Place in Clark Road if
Its Control Is Secured
T. M. Schumacher, traffic manager, of
the Oregon Short Line, dropped quietly,
into' the city yesterday from . Salt Laice
City and is staying at the Palace. His
coming at this particular time, just prior
to \u25a0' the : conference to be held here .this
week between the officials of the Ban
Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake road
ard of the Southern Pacific Company,
who are at \u25a0 outs over the refusal of the
latter road to enter into an agreement
! for an interchange of traffic at their
terminals in Southern California, is re
garded us very significant by local rail
road . men.
When seen yesterday Schumacher at
tributed his visit to San Francisco to a
desire on his part to enjoy a little recrea
tion, but as E. H. Harrimari is known
to be a strong objector to his employes
wandering away from their duties on
pleasure ' missions it is generally believed
that the Oregon Short Line official Is here
in connection with the approaching j con
ference and will take an active part in it.
As was stated several days ago, Schu
macher is regarded as Harriman's logi
cal selection for the position of traffic
manager of the Salt Lake road, in the
event of that newly constructed line be
coming part of the Harriman syndicate
of roads, which is looked upon as one
of the possibilities of the near future.
The Short Line man is well acquainted
with the inner affairs of the Salt Lake
road, and especially regarding its traffic
business, and it is supposed that he will
greatly aid Freight Traffic Manager
Sproule of the Southern Pacific Company
in combating the arguments that will be
set up by the representatives of â¢ the
Clark road.
The conference precedes the arrival of
President Harriman, who is due in this
city on August 16, according to informa
tion received yesterday at the Southern
Pacific Company's offices. He. is ex
pected to remain here several days prior
to his departure to the Orient, and during
that time the wily railroad magnate may
find time to review any important points
developing out . of the controversy be
tween the representatives of the Clark
road and his own, and perhaps definitely
settle the trouble that has provoked
much ill feeling between the officials of
both roads.
Detroit a Cradle, of Romance.
Fort '-Wayne, three and a half miles be
low Detroit at the only bend In the' river,
on the site where Black Hawk camped
In the war of 1838, and the old time set
tlement of ' Hamtramck at the upper end
guard their memories as the old soldiers
,dld the right and left flanks of yore.
In those days Colonel Hamtramck loved
beautiful Marianne Navarre, Â«a direct de
scendant of theDuc de VendV)me, father
of Henry IV of France. For some reason,
buried In the sanctity of the centuries,
they never married, but before he died
Colonel Hamtramck, vowed , that in -death
he ' would rest" within the ; shadow of his
love's tomb. This prophecy has almost
been verified, for both are sepultured ; in
old - Mount Elliot Cemetery, though they
passed away over forty years apart.* â¢
Writers, artists, \u25ba musicians, million
measured passions of, many-natured races,
the great tonnage of mighty vessels that
silently pass through the haunted water,
the spell of a tranquil hour, the strife and
loves of those who have gone, have made
peaceful Detroit a cradle of romanceâ a
throbbing legacy to the prosperous pres
ent.âFour-Track News. -

WHAT HE CONSIDERED ,
' HIS JOB WAS WORTH
Corporation Official Given a Plain Hint
. by Well Wishing Director
' Friend.
t' Some months ago an officer holding 1 an
important executive- post in one of the
greater \ corporations received a kindly,
almost neighborly, call .from one of his
fellow directors.. '.This officer had return
ed from a brief vacation trip. The fellow
director said to him that in view of their
long friendship and their respect and ad
, miration each for the ability and achieve
ments of the other, he was " going to
"speak somewhat plainly to that officer.
Then he put this question bluntly to
him:
. "What will you be willing to pay to
keep your peace?" . J.
.It. seemed a strange question. The
executive officer did not &now at first
what to make of it. He saw, of course,
that there' was some kindly, although
hidden, purpose in the question and so
he answered in the spirit in which the In
quiry was put-. He said that, of course,
if -it were necessary and was the proper'
thing to do, he would rather pay a large
sum of money than to lose . that office,
f ov it â¢ represented his . ambition and . was
in dine .with his achievements. "But Ido
not know what you are driving at," this
officer continued. .
1 Then the officer was told that while, of
course, it was Impossible to [ take serious
ly ..=. the .- question' ."What money ' are* you
willing to take to hold , the office,".' never
theless there ; was a price which he would
have to, pay and that price was this: He
must give 'up ostentatious living; he must"
be especially 'careful -to"observe local or
dinances , not : driving ' recklessly, with his
automobile, . he , must be , careful to keep
all the appearances of propriety, he must
do ;all things that a sober-minded, self
respecting t citizen" should I do, '- and . if . his
disposition led him to'genteel dissipation,
riotous^Uving or: to. ostentation then the
givingup'of these things was the price
he would : [ have to pay * if he desired to
keep his office!: ;And the reason why that
price .was extracted 'was that : as , officer
of ; a corporation in \u25a0 which the \u25a0 public . has
invested heavily, he must necessarily heed
public opinion even' in the conduct of hla
private life.â Philadelphia Press.

Government and Private Enterprise*.
The reason governments should leava
as wide a field as possible for the/opera
tion of private enterprise i 3 that govern
ment operations perpetually lack the one
test-.which is the mainspring of all suc
cessful! private business life: "Does it
pay?". Aa soon as private business con
cerns, find that they are doing something
which, is? not worth while they shut it oft.
They may make mistakes in thl3 line, but
their attempt is to regulate the life of
business projects and enterprises by their
return..by whether they pay or not. In
the government failures and successes
flourish side by'side. There is no motive
for cutting oft the useless, because its
cost-does .not come out of anybody in
particular, and the beneficiaries of any
appropriation \ cling to it like grim dÂ«ath.COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL

Let* mail advices from New York say:
'The market closed fairly strong on all
varieties. The general situation was some

previous week, and business had assumed a

tions had much to do with creating the firm

LEAGUE GAINS
IN MEMBERSHIP
Citizens Who Have Enlisted
in the Cause of Clean
Politics Are Encouraged
EEVIEW OF THE FOBCES
Gratters Are Putting Up an
Active Opposition in Some
of the Assembly Districts
Accessions to the* membership of the
San Francisco Republican League sig
nify to v the leaders of the organization
that a remarkably large vote will be
cast at the primary election on August
8. Everywhere the fact Is advertised
that the league is antl-Ruef. In every
Assembly district the league delega
tions are designated as anti-Ruef. The
\u25a0' : forces opposed ..to -the- movement for a
dean city andaclean administration of .
public afrairskre.jusins.'the: terms VR.eg- ]
ular Republican,' 1 . \u25a0â¢â¢United" RepjlbHcaii :
League" and â¢â¢lDdepenaent..:Rep;ubli<Jan''. ;
for the purpose of confusshg;thÂ«; voters,,
hence the genuine tickets- of 'the^..San;
Francisco Republican League 'are iflfs; .
tlnctly designated as antl-Ruef tickets..
A genuine Republican ticket will be
mailed to every voter of the city.
It may interest the friends of organised
labor to know that 169 of the 399 delegates
proposed by the Republican League are
trades union members. It Is a significant
fact also that a large number of union
men belong to the league, and others are
making diligent Inquiry with the Inten
tion of aiding the cause of clear munici
pal government by Joining the column
of progressive citizenship.
The governing body of the present
Union Labor party is not regarded by the
weke-earners am an organlzaUon that
represents the cause of labor, but is com
monly supposed jto be a mere chattel of
Ruef. therefore anti-Ruef labor Uckets
will be placed In the field In every As
sembly district of the city.
The methods employed by Mayor
6chmitz and Thomas Egan to capture
the meeting at Teutonia Hall, and the
subsequent proceedings to oust Tim R.
Sullivan from the United Labor League
and to manipulate the Building Trades
Council for political purposes, have
aroused a spirit of resentment among
the wage earners. Mayor Schmltz's
prospects of re-election are not re
garded by his followers as so promis
ing as they were two weeks" ago. Pol
iticians who have made a close study of
the situation assert that the Mayor's
stock Is on the decline. .*Â»;\u25a0,'
In the Thirty-ninth District. Maestrettl
and his followers are represenUng that
the San Francisco Republican League is
identified or associated with the Citizens'
Alliance. The voters of the district are
told in resolutions adopted;" by; the Ma
estretti gang that the, Merchants'. Asso
ciation. Citizens' Alliance and J the San
Francisco Republican League are endeaT-;
oring to get possession or. the. municipal;
government to re-establish ji a day wages
and soup houses. Intelligent progressive
citizens of the Thirty-ninth ' comprehend
the absurdity of the Maestretti campaign
for "vindication.**. The' signs now arÂ«
that the Republican League ticket will
win out in the district. The vote cast by J
the citizens who are interested in the de
velopment of the district will be so .large
that the solid almshouse vote In favor' of
the Maestretti ticket may be overcome.
The Republican League delegates of
the Forty-fourth Assembly District will
meet to-morrow night at organization
headquarters. 638 Market street. The Ruef
men are making desperate efforts to win
in the Thirty-ninth, . Forty-fourth and
Forty-fifth districts. The last namel is
classed as a Ruef vest pocket district.
The league forces are quite confident of
success in the Twenty-eighth, Twenty
ninth, Thirtieth, Thirty-first. Thirty-sec
ond, Thirty-third, Thirty-fourth. ' Thirty
fifth, Thirty-sixth. Thirty-seventh, Thir
ty-eighth, Fortieth. Forty-first and For
ty-third districts. If the predictions of a
voting avalanche are verified the league
will win also In the Thirty-ninth and
Forty-fourth.
I The magnitude of the vote "on August
8 may surprise the politicians.* The cur
rent of public sentiment at the a present
time is running strongly In favor of the
league tickets. It Is reported that many,
citizens who are out of town on vacation
will return for one -day to vote. ' In sev- ,
eral districts the league foroes are mak
ing a house-to-house, or door-bell, can
vass. * Every registered voter Is called
on and asked to vote to redeem the city
from the rule of graft.
Colored Voters In LJne.
A number of colored 5 voters of the
Forty-third Assembly District met at
114 William street last Friday night
and organized for the purpose of Sup

Perasnal Visitation of Voters In Dis
trict Desna bjr Campaign Committee.
Practical working plans for the corning
primary election were formulated at a
rousing, meeting of the Thirty -ninth Dis
trict United Independent Club at Rich
mond Hall last night. A campaign com
mittee was announced to the members,
and it will co-operate with the Republi
can League in carrying on the work of
organizing that district. A circular let
ter will be sent out to all the voters and
election pasters will be given them on
the day of the election.
Beginning to-day the personal visitation
of all the voters will be begun. A house
to house canvass Is planned and an in
defatigable effort will be made to get out
the hitherto silent vote in this way. On
the day of the primary election workers
will be placed near every voting booth
to supply every one with the literature
advocating a "clean city, clean politics
and a clean administration." Each little
crowd of workers will have its captain
and'ihe labor will be directed wir.h all
the effective organization of a miittary
body.
Many members of the Thirty-ninth Dis
trict expressed themselves as highly in
censed over the work of the Maestretti
forces In having the polling booth in the
Fifteenth Precinct moved back after It
had once beerr' changed. Many of the
voters will be forced to go fully two
miles in order to be able to vote on the
day of. the primaries.

CONDEMN RCEF'SPOLICY.
Anti-Bo** Clnb< Scores -Faction of Union
Labor Party.' *.
" A* meeting of the United m Labor Anti-
Boss Club of the Twenty-eighth District
was held last nigrht' and amid applause
a" scorching resolution was adopted con
demning the policy t of one : faction of the
Union Labor party. .'Chairman John
Vance-Thompson ' presided. The resolu
tion Is as follows?: ? -.â¢,.;'\u25a0 *{-''â¢
"Whereas, Realizing that Abe Ruef,
boss" of the .present Union -Labor party,
and Its so-called- County, Committee' were
making no effort to organize for; the com
ing political' campaign, but were endeav
oring to use the party for the purpose of
executing the plans of 'the said ' Abe Ruef
at the primary election.' a', representative
gathering of trade unionists organized the
United Labor League ,! for -the expressed
purpose of combating the . Citizens'
Alliance in politics.; These,; plans did
not meet with the, approval; *bf.. the
boss and -his henchmen,, and' from Its
inception attempts were made- to disrupt
tne United Labor League. These attempts
were, unsuccessful until. 'the advent ,of
P. H. McCarthy, who prostituted his of
ficial position- In the ranks of organized
labor by surrendering himseif^ and his
principles to the service of the/aforesaid
political boss. By his efforts. the organi
zation of the United Labor League was
captured and the rolls closed .to ; prevent
those who were In favor of clean :*: * pol
itics from again controling- their \u25a0; organi
zation and again following; the principles
for^ which the league {war.; organized.
Therefore we, the union -men" of the
Tvrenty-elghth Assembly .District, desir
ing a clean Union, Labor ticket, will sup
port that faction of the,: United Labor
League which adhered "to the f principles
of -clean politics | and refused | to wear the
collar of , Boss Abe" Ruef;- therefore be It
"Resolved, That we ' condemn the
policy of malfactloh of the. United-.La
bor League .which; capitulated : ~ to the
Inducements of the wily -boss < and.al
lied itself with the -City. Hall job-chas
ers and grafters,' who obey the'dictates ".
of the said Abe Ruef," as'bringing dis
credit upon the Union LaborTvpters of,
San Francisco: andbeilt. further,
- "Resolved; That ; we .condemn ! the vlf
