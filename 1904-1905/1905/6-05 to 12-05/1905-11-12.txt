\u25a0ad the oaes irblcb made Dr.

* a \u2666 HAVS-Bome papers here," said
I niy friend Sherlock Holmes, as
* we sat one winter's night on
* either side of the fire, "which
I really think, Watson, that it
would be worth your while to glance
Â©ver. These are the documents in the
extraordinary case of the Gloria Scott,
asd this is the xness&ge which struck
Justice of the Peace Trevor dead with
horror when he read it."
He had. picked from a drawer a llt
tde tarnished cylinder, and, undoing
the tt-v^. he handed me a short note
\u25a0crawled upon a half sheet of slate
gray paper.

Keeper Hudson, roe -believe, has been
now- told to-rÂ«Â«ive all orders . fcfr fly
piper ami for preservation -of your ben
pheasants' life."
As I glanced up from reading this
nlgmatical message, I saw Holmes
chuckling at the expression upon my
face. jSÂ±s[j
"You look a little bewildered,*'
zald he.
"I cannot see how such a message
as this could Inspire horror. It seems
to me to be rather grotesque than,
otherwise..'
"Very likely. Yet the fact remains
that the reader, who was a fine, ro
bust old man, was knocked clean down
by it as if it had been 'the butt end
of a pistol.** >
"You arouse my curiosity," said I.
"But why did you say just now that
there were very particular reasons why
I should stufly this caseT* '
"Because it was the first in which
I was ever engaged."
I had often endeavored to elicit from
ray- companion what had first turned
his mind In the direction of criminal
research, bat . had never caught him
before In a communicative humor. Now
he sat forward In his armchair BndL
tpreafl out "the "documents^ *upon"*~lil3
knees. Then he lit his pipe and sat for '
some time smoking and turning them
over. â¢
"Tcu never heara me talk of Victor
Trevor?" he asked. "He was the only
friend I made during the two years I
â¢was at college. _I was never a very so
ciable fellow, "Watson, always rather fond
cf moping In my rooms and working out
my own little methods of thought/ so
that I never mixed much with the men
of my year. Bar fencing and boxing I
had few athletic tastes, and then my line
cf study was Quite distict from that of
the other fellows, so that, we had no
points of contact at aIL Trevor was the
only man I knew, and that only through
the accident of his bull- terrier freezing
on to my ankle one morning as I went
down to the chapel.
*'It was a prosaic way of forming a
friendship, but it was effective. I was
laid by tbe heels for ten days and Tre
vor used to 'come and inquire after me.
At first it was only a minute's chat, but
soon his visits lengthened, and before the
end of the term we were close friends.
He was a hearty, full-blooded fellow, full
of spirits and energy, the very opposite
to me in most respects, but we had 'some
subjects in common, and it was a bond
of union when I found that he was as
friendless as L Finally he invited me
down to his father's place at Donnithorpe,
in Norfolk, and I accepted his hospitality
for a month of the long vacation. â¢
"Old Trevor was evidently a man of
some wealth and ' Consideration, a J. P.,
and a landed proprietor. Donnlthofpe Is
a little hamlet just to tbe north of Lang
mere, in the country of the Broads. The
house was an old-fashioned, wide-spread,
oak-beamed brick building, - with : a ; fine,
llme-llned avenue leading up to it. There
was excellent wild-duck shooting in the
fens, remarkably good fishing, a small
but select library, â¢ taken over, as I-un
derstood, from a former occupant, and
a tolerable cook, so that he would be a
fastidious man who could not put in a
pleasant month , there.
-Trevor senior was a widower, and my
friend his only son.
"There had been a daughter, I heard,
but she had died of diphtheria' while on
a visit to Birmingham. The father, in
terested me extremely.' . He was a'man of
little culture, but a considerable amount
of rude strength, both mentany and phys
ically. He knew hardly, any books, 'but
he had traveled far.' and seen muchoi
the world, and had remembered all* that
lie had learned. In person he , was : a
thick-set, . burly man with a shock of
grizzled hair, a brown, weather r beaten
face and blue eyes, which were; keen to
the verge of fierceness. Yet he had a
reputation for kindness 'and charity on_
the countryside, and was noted for the
leniency cf hi 3 sentences from the bench.
"One evening shortly after my arrival
we were sitting over a glass of port after
dinner, when young Trevor.. began to"
talk about those habits of,; observation
and inference which â¢ ' I . had already
formed into % a system, although '"' I; had*
not yet appreciated the: part . ; which V
they were'to play, in my life. The~old
man evidently thought that his son
was exaggerating; in his description of
one or two trivial feats which I had:
performed. . â¢
" 'Come, now, \u25a0 Mr. Holia'es,'. said he,
laughing grobd-humoredly, .'l'm an ex
cellent subject, if you can deduce any
thing from me.*
"'I fear there is not very much,' I
answered. 'I .might suggest; that | you

"The laugh faded from his lips, and:

me. Even his son ' remarked. It: "You've
given the governor such ; a -turn," said
he. 'that he'll never be "sure ; again ot^
what i you : know ' and what - you don't ,
k^ow.'/ He did not mean! to show It. V"
am sure, but It : was so ; strongly In hl3 .
mind that It peeped tout at every action.
At last I 'became'so convinced that ,1
was "causing him uneasiness -^thitt- 1 â¢
drew my .vislt ; tb~a close. On the very
day, however." before I; left, an Incident
occurred which proved ilni In the sequel to
be of Importance. . .
M WÂ« were 'sitting out ] upon the lawn
on /garden *'\u25a0 chairs, . the \; three -of r us,
basking In the sun \u25a0 and admiring the
view "across \u25a0 the Broads, . when a maid
came out to say that there was a man
at the- door ;who wanted to see Mr.
"'What la his name?* asked my host.
"'He would not give any.*
" "What does he want, then?*,
"'He says that you know him, and
that he only . wants a moment's con- .
versation.' â¢ J.
-"'Show him round here.' An Instant
afterward there appeared ' a little wix
eaed - fellow*; 1 with ' ; a v^cringing
arid ; a shambling- style of '.walking. He
wore an open Jacket, with a splotch of
tar ; on' the . sleeve, a red-and-blaclc
check shirt, dungaree trousers, and
heavy boots badly .worn; His face was
thin and brown and crafty, with a
perpetual smile upon - It, which showed
an Irregular line of : yellow* teeth, and
his crinkled hands were, half closed In
a way,, that- Is distinctive of, sailors. As "
he. came slouching across the, lawn I
heard \u25a0 Mr. Trevor make a, sort of hic
coughing noise In his throat,'' and.
Jumping out . of his ciwlr, ha ran into
. the* house. He was back In a moment.
and I smelt a strong reek. of brandy as
he passed me.
"'"Well, . my man,* . said ; he, ."what can <
I do for you?*,
"The sailor stood looking, at him
â¢with puckered . eyes, and with the same
loose-lipped smile upon his face.
â¢â¢â¢You : doh'ti know mc V he asked.
V *Wby,\ dear me. It Is surely Hudson.'
\u25a0aid Mr. Trevor In atonea 'tone of surprise.
\" .'Hudson ' it Is, sir,' -. said the seaman.__
.â¢Why, ' it's\ thirty years and more "since I
law- you "last- Here 1 , you are In your
house, and "me still picking my salt meat
out of > the harness cask."
'-. ".Tut, you will find that I have not for
gotten old 'times,' cried -Mr. Trevor,, and,

""Thank you, ,*s|r,'"*said rr * the : seaman,
\u25a0touching hisJor-tlock. ; Tni just off a two
yeafer inf an < eight-knot ;' tramp, ; short-,
handed at - that,- and' 1 ' wants *a rest. I
thought I'd" get' It either with Mr. Beddoes
or with you.' . L
.*VAh!' cried Mr. Trevor. Tou " know
where Mr. Beddoes is?*
'\u25a0'*.**. 'Bless you,- sir, ', I know where , all my
old frlend3* are/ .said the fellow 'with' a
sinister -: smile, and he slouched off . after ,
the -maid to" the kitchen. Mr. Trevor
"mumbled something /.to us about ; having
been shipmate 'with the man when he was
going back to the diggings, and then. leav.
ing us on the lawn, he went lndo6rs v ;Arx
\u25a0 hour, later," when we entered the - house,
we found him stretched dead drunk upon
the dining-room sofa. The "whole incident
left a: most ugly impression upon ray
mind, and I was^ not "sorry next day tto
leave ' Donnithorpe behind: me, for I felt
that my presence must be a source of em
barrassment to my friend.
"All this occurred during the first month
of the ; long vacation. I went iip to my
London rooms, where I spent seven weeks
working out a few experiments in organic
chemistry- -One day, \u25a0 however, when the
autumn was far advanced and the vaca
tion /drawing to a close, I received "a tele
gram, from my. friend imploring me to re
turn \to Donnithorpe, and saying .that he
was in. great need "of my advice and as
sistance. ' Of course I "dropped everything
and set out for the ; north once more.
"He met' me -with the dog-cart at 'the
- station, and I saw at a glance that the
two last months had ,been very - trying
one's for him. He . had grown thin and
careworn, and had lost ; loud, cheery
manner for "which he had been remark
able.JflHÃ
" Tbe is dying,' were the first
words he , said.
"â¢lmpossible!- I cried. 'What Is thÂ»
matter?', ,
"'Apoplexy. Nervous. shock. .He'a_ been
-onfthe verge aIL day. I doubt If we shall
find him alive.'"
VI was, as you may think, "Watson, hor
rified at this unexpected news.
" 'What has caused it V I , asked.
\u25a0â¢ 'Ah, that is the point. Jump in and
we'eari talk it over while we drive. You "
remember Â»that fellow who came upon th*
evening before you left us?".
."'DO7OU know who it was that we let
into the house that day?*
" *I have no idea."
" " .'lt was , the devil. Holmes,' he 1 cried. -
"I' stared at him in < astonishment.
* ". *Yes; \u25a0It was . the "devil : himself. We
have not had a peaceful -hour; sinceâ not
one." â¢ The/Governor has never .held up his
bead f rom ' that evening, and "now" the life
hast been crushed ouU'bf ; him ;â¢ and - his
heart > brokenV : all : through this accursed
Hudson.'- : *â¢ - \u25a0â \u25a0;\u25a0

â¢ " *Ah 7 that 'is'.whattl' would: give so
much .to ; know. The kindly, charitable,

fian : -But ' l Tam : "so glad j that"' you have
come; Holmes." I trust "very much to your
Judgment and discretion, and I know 'that
you\will advise me for the best."
v; VWe were dashing "along (the smooth
white country road, with , the^ long etch
of *the Broads â¢in \u25a0 front of us glimmering
in* the Ved light of : the setting sun. ' From
"a grove upon our. ief:- 1 could already see
the";--igh 'chimneys' ana', the : flag-staft
which marked ' the squire's dwelling." .'^
" " 'My ' father, made ' the fellow gar-dcner, J said my companion, 'and then,
as that< did # -not satisfy - him he" was
promoted; to be _butler; The house
seemed to be at his mercy and.. he did
what he chose in Itâ The maids-com
plained of h[s drunken^.habits and his
vile language. The dad raised' their
wages 'all round- to recompense them,
for the annoyance. The fellow would
take the boat and my fathers' best gun
and treat himself to little shooting
trips. And all this with such a sneer-
Ing, leering, insolent face that I would
have knocked him down twenty times
over if he had been a man of my own
age. I tell you, Holmes, I have had to
keep a tight hold upon myself all this
time; and now I am asking myself
whether, if I had let myself go a little
more, I might not have been a wiser
man. â¢ ,
"'Well, matters went from bad to
worse with us, and this animal Hud
son became more and more intrusive,
until at last, on his making some In
solent reply to my father in my pres
ence one day. I took him by the shoul
ders and turned him out of the room.
He clunk away with a livid face and two
venomous eyes, which uttered more
threats than his tongue could do. \u0084 ; 1
don't know what passed between the
poor dad and him after that, but the^
dad came to me next day and asked me
whether I would mind apologizingâ to
Hudson. I refused, as you may
Imagine, and aeked my father how, he
could allow such a wretch to take such
liberties with himself and his house
hold.
Ah, my boy," said he, "it is all
very well to talk, but you don't know
how I am placed. But you shall know,
Victor. I'll see that you shall know,
come what may. You wouldn't believe
harm of your poor old father, would
you, lad?". He was very much moved
and shut himself uri in the study all
day.' where I could" see through the
window that he was! writing busily.
"'That evening there came what
seemed to me to' be a grand release, for
Hudson told us that he was going to
leave us. He walked into the dining
room as we sat after dinner and an
nounced his Intention in the thick voice
of a half-drunken man.
I've had enough of Norfolk," he
said. "I'll run down to Mr. Beddoes
In Hampshire. He'll be glad to see me
is you were. I dare say."
" ' "You're not going away in an un
kind spirit. Hudson, I hope," said ray
father, with" a tameness wliich made
my blood boil. â¢ .

sulkily, glancing in my

you have used .ths worthy ..fellow

to me. . " \u25a0; ', J ' \u25a0'\u25a0:\u25a0 '
On the contrary", r think that we
have both shown extraordinary pa
tience toward him," I answered. ,
"'"Oh, you do, do you?" he snarled.
"Very good, mate. We'll see about
that!" v
" 'He slouched out of the room, and
half an hour afterward "left tne house,
leaving my father In a state pf;pltiable
nervousness. Night af tet night , I heard
him pacing his room, and It. was just
as he was recovering his "confidence
that the blow did at last fall.' ;
"'And how?* I asked eagerly.
" 'In a most extraordinary fashion.
A letter arrived for my father yester
day evening, bearing the Fordingbrldge
postmark. My father read It, clapped
both his hands to his head, and began
running round the room in little cir
cles like a man who has been driven
out of his senses. When lat last drew
him down on to tire sofa his mouth and
eyelids were all puckered on one side,
and I saw that he had a stroke. Dr.
Fordham came over at once. We put
him to bed; but the paralysis has
spread, he has shown no sign of re
turning consciousness, and I think that
we shall hardly find him alive.' ': ' \u0084
"'You horrify me, Trevor!' I cried.
'What then could have been in this
letter to cause so dreadful a result?*

\;"M,r friend! asceWcd; with". the i doctor^
to;the ; chamber -of -deaths while -I rei-'
malned in the study, turning' the whole
matter' over and over : in .my .head, and
feeling as somber as eVer I had done in
my life. What was the past of this
Trevor, pugilist, traveler and gold dig
ger, and how had he placed himself In
the power of this acid-faced seaman?
Why, too, should he faint at an allusion
to the half-effaced " initials upon his
arm, and die of fright: when he had _a
letter from FordSngham? Then : I re
membered Fordinghafn was ; In
shire, and tbatthis Mr. Beddoes, wAom
the seama'n'had Â£^lÃit^iuad.yjirÂ«^
Rurpably to blackmail,. .had als v o.. been
mcntloriedas living In Hampshire. The'
letter,* thftn, might either conic from*
Hudson, the seanian, saying that "he
had betrayed the "guilty secret 'which
appeared to exist, or it might com?
J:rom B^eddoes, ; warning. an f pld^^co^nfed-
tnite* that such *a betrayal ,w a . s im ? n '*
Mut âSo 'far \u25a0 it-Â«eÂ«mÂ«<l clear^-enougrh.
But tben how could this letter be tri
vial and grotesque, as described by the
son? He must have misread it. â¢;; If so,
it must have been, one of thosef ingen
ious secret codes which mean one thing
while they seem to mean another. VI
must see .this letter.. If there'' were\a
hidden meaning in it, I was confident
that. l could pluck It 'forth. For an
hour I sat pondering over it ln-^the
gloom, until at last a- weeping ; maid,
brought in a' lamp, and close at . her
heels came my; friend Trevor,- pal e^ but
composed, with these very papers
which lie upon my knee held in h|s
grasp. He sat down opposite,. to me,
dre.w the , lamp to ttie edge; of the table
anil handed me a short note, scrlbbjed,
as you see, upon, a single sheet,'of gray
paper. 'The supply of game for." Lon
don is sroing iteadlly up,' it ran ; 'Head
keeper Hudson, we believe,, has been
now"; told 'to receive all, orders for;fly
paper and for preservation of your hen
pheasant's life.' .
"I dare say; my. face -looked as.bewild
ered as yours did just now .when first : l.
read this message. > Then I reread it very
carefully - It | was evidently â¢ as .'I \u0084, na d
thought, and some secret meaning must
lie burii d in this strange combination of
wards. -\u25a0; Or. could it:bc that' there- was. a"
prearranged significance to " svich : phrases',
as 'fly-paper' and /hen-pheasan t' ? : Such a
meaning would bei! arbitrary could npf
be deducted In any way. - -And^ye.t-1 .was!
loth to believe that this was 'the ;caee,
and the presence of- the word .'Hudson/
seemed to show that , 'the subject of the
message was as I had sruessed,; and that
It was from Beddoes rather, than tho
sailor. ,1 tried It backward, but the com
bination 'life" pheasant's hen\was not en-:
.cguraging. . Then I tried alternate words,
bnt neither ,'tjie-' of fot^por 'supply game
promised toY throw any light
upon it . , "\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0 1 ''"f.l
"And then in ah instant the key of the
riddle was In my hands, and . I saw that
eVeryl third word, beginning with the
first,' would give', a message; which might
well "."drive .old Trevor' to despair.
' "It was short and terse, the* warning,
as I now read It to my. companion:* '
." 'The game Is up. Hudson has told all.
Fly for your life.' . -;t .
"Victor Trevor sank :â¢ his face into his
shaking hands, fit must be that, I sup
pose,' said ; he. 'This is worse than death,
for it mYfans disgrace as well. But what
Is the meaning of these \u25a0 "head-keepers",
and "hen-pheasants"?' ' \u25a0 . 'â¢; *.' : ;.,'
"'lt means nothing to the message, but
it might mean a good deal -to us if v we
had no â¢ other mean 3 jof ""discovering the
sender. You. see that he has begun by
writing - "The â¢ â¢ .* game â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ is,*;
and so on. Afterward he had, to fulfill
the prearranged cipher,- to fill in any two
words in each epace. .He would naturally
uso the first words which came .to,' his 1
minu. and if there" were so many , which
referred to sport among them; , you may
be tole rably sure that he;ls either an
ardent "shot "or interested in breeding.

he. "I remember that my. poor : father

â¢were 7shot - while trying, -to fix their :

'captain's cabin, but as we pushed, open
the'Moori there waa an 'explosion from ,<
'. wJthini'V: arid there' " he^ lay with * hi 3 :

"Atlantic, which was .'pinned upon the ;
\u25a0'table, while the chaplain- stood with a
; smoking'':: pistol In his' hand at his el- '.
bQw.t The. two mates had 'both been
seized by the crew, and the whole busi
ness seemed to be settled.
"The stateroom was next, the cabin, and
we nocked in there and- flopped down : on \.
the settees, all speaking together, for we ;
were just mad wltn me feeling that we
were free once more. Taere were lockers Fi
all'around, and Wilson, the sham chap
lain, knocked, Qne;of < them I ;in. and .pulled
out "a '"dozen of brown sherry. We cracked
off the necks of tne^bottles.^poured the
stuff our Into* tumbiers and were ' just
tossing them off when In an Instant .with
out warning there came the roar of mus
kets In bur . ears, and the. saloon wa3" so
full of smoke that we could not see across
the table. When it cleared again the
place. was a shambles. Wilson and. eight
others ;were wriggling S on the top. of each
other onÂ«the floor, and the blood and the
brown. sherry on that table turn me sick
now when I .think of; it." We .were
so cowed by the sight that I think we
should r have given the job up If â¢it had
not been for Prendergast. He bellowed
like a'bull. and rushed for the door with
all that were left alive at his heels. Out
we. rah, and there on the poop were the
lieutenant and ten of his men. The swing-
Ing skylights above the saloon table had
been a bit open, and they had fired on
us through the silt. We got on them,
before \ they could load, and they ; stood
to it like men; but we had the upper
hand of them, and in five minutes irwas
all over. My God! was there ever a
slaughter-house like that ship! Prender
gast was like a; raging devil, and he
picked the soldiers up as If they had been
children 'and threw them overboard alive
or dtad. ; There \u25a0 was one sergeant that'
was ; horribly wounded and yet : kept , on
swimming for a surprising time, until
some one in mercy blew out his brains.
When the fighting was over there was no
one left of our. enemies txcept just the
wardens, the mates and the doctor. ,
" 'lt was over them that the great
quarrel arose. There. were many of us
who were glad enough to win back our
freedom, and yet who had no wish to
have- murder on , our: souls. It was .the
thlnjr to knock the soldiers over with
their>muskets in" their: hands, and it
was "another to stand by while men
werebcing killed incold blood. Eight
of uCfllvc convicts and .three sailors,
said that we wouldnot see.it done. But
there" .was no moving Prendergast and J
those; who were .with him. Our- only
chance of safety lay* in making a clean
job of It, said he, and- he would . not :
leave-!a" torig'ue with. 'power. to wagrMn^a ,:,

sharing, the. fate of .the prisoners. .but r at? >

offer, for we were already sick of these "
bloodthirsty doings; ; and we saw thai ;
thert; -would be y/orse. before it . was ,
"done.;" We were /given a suit of sailor ;
togs each, a barrel of water, two casks,
one of junk arid one; of biscuits,' and a
compass. Prendergast" threw \us over . a "

swe-pt the boat'sjfhead around again
and pulled with Tall our strength for

over the water marked the scene of
this catastrophe.
* ." "It was a long honr before we reached
It, and at first we feared that we had
come too late to save "any one. A splin
tered I boat and a number â¢ of . crates | arid
fragments of spars rising and falling on
the wave 3 showed us where the vessel had
foundered: but there was no sign of life,
and we had. turned away in despair when
we heard a cry for help, and saw at some
distance a piece of wreckage with a man
lying stretched across It.. When we pulled
him aboard the boat he proved to be a
young seaman of the name of Hudson;
who was so burned and exhausted that
he could sive us no account of what had
happened until the following morning.
".'lt seemed that after we had left
Prendergast and his gang had proceeded
to put to death the five remaining . pris
oners. The two warders had been shot
and thrown overboard, and so also had
the third mate. Prendergast then de
scended Into the 'tween-decks and with
his own hands cut the throat of the un
fortunate "surgeon. There only remained
' the, first . mate, who was a bold and ac
tive, man. When he saw the convict.ap
proaching him. with the bloody knife in
his hand he kicked off his bonds, which
he had somehow contrived to loosen, and
rushing down the deck he plunged into
the after-hold. A dozen convicts. . who
descended with their plstol3 in search of
him, found him with a matchbox in his
hand seated beside an open powder bar
rel, which was one of the ' hundred . car
ried on board, and swearing that he
would blow all hands up if he were, ln any
way molested. An instant later) the ex
plosion occurred, though Hudson thought
it . was caused by the misdirected bullet
of on* of the convicts rather than the
mate's match. Be the cause what It
may, it was the end of the Gloria Scott
and of the rabble who held command of
her. - ;
" 'Such^ln-a few words, my dear boy,
is the history of this terrible business
In which I was involved. Next day we
were picked up by the brig Hotspur,
bound for. Australia, whose . captain
found no difficulty in believing that we
were the survivors of a passenger ship
which had foundered. The transport
ship Gloria. Scott was set down by the
Admiralty as being lost at sea. and no
word has 'ever leaked out as to her
true fate.. After an excellent voyage
the Hotspur..' landed us / at Sydney,
where Evans and 'l changed our names
and made our way to the diggings,
where, among the crowds "wno were
gathered .from all nations, we had no
difflcultity In losing our former iden
tities. The rest I. need not relate. We
prospered, we traveled, we came back
as rich colonials to England, and we
bought country estates. For more
than twenty, years we have led peace
ful and useful lives, and we hoped
that our- past was forever burled.
Imagine, then, my. feelings when in the
seaman who came to us I recognized
Instantly theman who had been picked
off the wreck. He had tracked us down
somehow, and had set "himself to live
upon our fears. You- will understand
'now.' how it. was that I strove to'keep
.the-rpeaci 1 with him,. and youywill. in
â¢some measure" sympathize' with me in,
the fears .which nil me, noMr^thafc he
has gone ; from me to hls^othelr- victim
with threats' upon his lon^ue." '
"Underneath is written in a' hand so
shaky as to-be hardly legible. "Bed
does writes in cipher to say H. has told
all. Sweet Lord, have mercy on our
souls!' . .
"That was the narrative which I read
that night to young Trevor, and I
think, Watson, that under the circum
stances-it was a dramatic one. The
good' fellow . I was heartbroken at it,
and went'out to the Terai tea planting,
where I .hear that he is doing well.
As t to the sailor and Beddoes, neither
of them was -ever heard of again after
that day on which the letter of warn
ing was written. They both dis
appeared ".utterly and completely. No
complaint' had been lodged with the
police, so that Beddoes had mistaken
a threat for a deed. Hudson had been
seen lurking about, and it was believed
by the police that he had done away
with Beddoes and had fled. For myself
I believe that the truth was eactly the
opposite. I think that it, is most prob
able" that; Beddoes, pushed to despera
tion and believing himself to have been
already betrayed, had revenged him
self upon Hudson;" and had fled from
the country with as much money as he
could layvhis) hands on. Those are the
facts of the cast, doctor, . and if, they
are of any use to your collection, I am
sure that they are very heartily at your
service." y

SRISTOL and Hampton were to meet
It was the last big game of the
year. Bristol men, after their
splendid showing against Ktngston.
were confident of \ictory. Already
Hampton men stood shoulder to shoulder
and were ready to stake their last dollar
on their eleven. Such an air of con
. fider.ee was extremely pleasing to the
public and awakened an uncommon
amount of Interest in the approaching
struggle.
It was late Friday afternoon. Before a
big grate fire In their fraternity house sat
Stub Simpson and some six or seven of
Ms companions. Stub Simpson was a
cotable character In Bristol life. Simp
eon had worked his way through college
by writing for the New York papers. |
His articles on football were widely read.
"How many of you fellows have money
up on to-morrow's game?" Inquired Stub.
Everybody answered affirmatively.
Then Simpson entered Into a discussion
\u25a0of the relative merits of the two teams.
He had not progressed very far when the
colored butler pushed his head through
the door end cried "Dinner!" and every
one 6cramb!ed away. Stub had no more
than seated himself at the table when
a note was handed him. This Is what
It Eald:
"Stub, come to training quarters at
once. Must see you before we are all
packed off to bed. Drop everything and
come. ARCHIE."
-The devil!" muttered Stuti, crushing
the note and pushing.- back his chair.
Stub made his way to the training
quarters and found the men just rising
from the table. It was not long before
the newspaper correspondent was closeted
with the captain of the Bristol eleven.
Stub was the first to speak. .
"No\r, Archie, don't make a fool of
yourself."
"Stub, you know as wen as I do that
Bristol can't possibly lose."
"Why, Archie. Bristol has lost before,
and why not now?" queried Stub.
"You will never understand. Stub," an
swered the big fullback, drawing up his
large frame. "Just look at Bristol's de
fensive play in the Kingston game. Why.
man alive, we held the Maroon on our
one-yard line right under our goal posts.
You know, Stub, that Kingston can play
all around Hampton. You told me that
yourself only last week, before the Bris
tol-Kingston game.! What is Bristol's
standing, then? Then, besides, have you
seen Shorty King drop goals from * the
field? Maybe he won't surprise all good
people to-morrow! No, Stub, my mind
is made up. I'm going to bet every cent -
I have. and. what is mor^, I've borrowed
sonicâ and up that goes, too. Here is
$500." And us he Epoke young Ferbert
pulled a. wad of bills from his waistcoat
pocket and shoved, it at Stub, adding: J
"You know, Stub, that my position on
the team prevents me from going Into
the betting ring*and putting this money
up myself, co I'm trusting you to place
this amount for me at even money."
"Archie, I can't do this," answered
Simpson,, dropping his eyes to the floor
and snaking his head.
"Quit it. Stub; for pity's sake, quit It,"
entreated Archie.
"No, Archie, you don't understand me,"
answered Stub, speaking earnestly. "I
would do this willingly for you If you
could afford It But you can't
"Think how y^u have had to work to
put yourself through Bristol. Before you
commit such a rash act think of your
mother and sister, who are making every
sacrifice for you? And what do they do
It for? That you may spend lots of
money and have a good time? No, Ar
chie, you know^ better. It Is not for
that It Is because your father's last re
quest was that you get a college educa
tion and study law. It makes me sick
at heart to see you risk everything on
this one game. Just think for a minute
what It means. Should Hampton win. If
means that you quit college, for you
could not possibly afford to go on. That
â¢would nearly kill your poor mother.
Think better of what I have said, old
man."
"Stub," said Archie, and one could plain
ly see that young Ferbert was having a
hard time keeping back the tears, "I
know that only the highest motives
prompt you to say what you have. I
know you are my strongest and best
friend. You have been kind to my
mother, to Rosamond and to me. And I
honestly thank you for It If I really
thought there was a possibility of Bris
tol's losing I might hesitateâ but no such
possibility exists, Stub. Why, man,' 1 and
Archie began to warm to his subject,
"lfs a perfect cinch, and If I could bor
row $500 more I would put It up without
the slightest hesitation. But, say. Stub,
answer me this question truthfullyâ
truthfully, I say: Do you expect to bet
yourself r*
-For a moment Stub did not reply. He
was painfully counting the seams in the
hardwood floor. Then he muttered some
thing about that being different, and that
their two cases were riot parallel. Archie
kept on pressing the matter, until Stub
finally admitted that he had determined
to back Bristol at even money. Stub tried
to show Archie* that he had no mother
and no sister to support, and that it madÂ«
little difference no the people at home
whether he continued in college or not
However, It was all to no purpose. "
Archie rose when he heard the head
coacb inquiring for him. lie told Stub
that unless he posted his money for him
he would get Billy Hawkins or Jerry
Rich to perform the task.- This brought
Simpson to terms.
"I'll do it, Archie," Stub added; "but
only under the heaviest kind of a protest
I see your mind is made up, but those two
spendthrifts must not handle your
money.**. "
The Hampton team, with its coaches,
trainers and rubbers, with over forty
men In the party, reached New York
Friday night. The "next morning they
moved into New England. The Hampton
eleven had engaged quarters at the Ven
dome. As Captain Harding pushed * his
big, burly form through the doorway .
there was a big demonstration. Each
man on the Hampton team was cheered
as be came into view.
"An even $500 on Hampton," shcuted a
large man with a big diamond stud, and
Harding did not even try to suppress a
smile.'
"Taken." came the quick response.
Immediately there was a big rush. The
betting was on in earnest.
"Got any more?" asked Stub. The two_
entered a small room and took seats at a'
table. Simpson knew his friend to be an
old Hampton "grad" who was dealing in
Wall street stock for a livelihood. Stub
knew he was up against a real live
plunger, but he never quailed. He had
$1000, so he told McPherson, which he
wanted to put up. He did not tell the
Scotchman that 5500 of it belonged to the
Bristol captain and $500 to himself.
Neither did he tell his companion that
only the day before he had received m,
letter from home telling him of his
father's failure in business. What good
would it have done? It was finally agreed
that $500 apiece, should be wagered. Stub
took a large roll of bills from his pocket
and carefully counted out $500. The other
$500 he put in his pocket McPherson had
come with his money done iip in packets
of $500. In hie business he had adopted
such time-saving devices. So the broker
was not - forced to count* The two men
left the table and; sought^ out the clerk
at the office desk.^ The/ v money was
counted again by the^eierk, who placed
the bills in an envelope. Then the en
velope was carefully marked and stowed
away In the safe of the Vendome. As
Stub was leaving McPherson, Johnny
Snow, the stroke oar of the Bristol crew.
hurried up. ",'v- . * '*' â¢ "ji :^
"Give me $500. Stub. I can get odds et
ten to seven for you."
"Where?" asked Stub excitedly.
"It's a snap and I can't give it away,"
answered Johnny hurriedly.
"You're sure of your man, Johnny?*"
questioned Stub, fumbling In his,, pockets.
"Perfectly." And off trotted the bold
stroke oar with Simpson's other $500.
Stub hastened to a writing table and
scratched these hurried lines:
"Archie, your 500 up. Now go In and
win. STUB." -
Calling a messenger boy. Stub dis
patched him, with instructions to deliver
this note to Captain Jtrchie Ferbert with-,
out fail. Then Stub got ready to report
the game. . ,
It was nearly 2 o'clock. . For the last
three hours big crowds had been passing
through the gates. Fully 20,000 people had
been seated,' and more were still coming.
On one side of the field were massed the
supporters of the Purple, with colors wav
ing and streamers flying. Just opposite
them were located the strong cohorts who
came all the way from Hampton to cheer
their warriors on. Pretty girls in tailor
made jackets, wearing the colors of old
Bristol, vied with the smart Southern set,
who were decked out from head to foot ln~
flaming, cardinal. Men prominent in all .
walks of life studded the stands. From
Washington came Cabinet officers *with
their wives;" Judges of the highest courts
in the land found time to once more rally
around the flag they loved so well; An
napolis and West Point were represented;
men whose faces are familiar in the halls
of Congress shouted their old college bat
tle-cry- In the Hampton delegation sat. an
ex-President of the United States. From
one of the Middle States came a noted
Governor to lead the cheering for his
alma mater. Across the field came float
ing the notes to "A hot time in Hampton
to-night."
Bristol answered vociferously with her
sharp, stubborn "U- rah-rah!" It was a
grand sight, and one that would stir the
most sluggish blood. Every one was anx
ious for the fray to begin. Already the
officials were on the Bide lines. In the.
press box sat Stub Simpson with his -hand
on the tickÂ«r.
It was Just 2.02 when the Bristol eleven
jumped the ropes and bounded into the
field. A mighty roar arose. One might
have thought that the dogs of war had
been let loose, so terrific was the din. The
noise had just started to subside when
McPherson shouted through his mega
phone:
"Here comes Hampton 1" _
like a flash every Hampton man was
on his feet, frantically waving his arms
and shouting madly. Out' trotted'* a long
file of warriors belonging to that "dys
peptic Ice water drinking nation." Striped
stockings marked each man. " ' .
After a preliminary skirmish the ref
eree's whistle brought the two teams to
gether and the crowd to their senses. The
ball was In position -and, Archie Ferbert
stepped back to kick off. As he did : so
Stub Simpson, turned ' In his, seat 'and
caught sight of Archie's mother and sis
ter. He was ready to swear that he had
never seen the girl ; look prettier. ; Rosa
mond's black, wavy hair * and dark eyes
were muffled somewhat *by. tbe_upturned
collar of her jacket, The brisk,; cutting
air had brought a bright, healthy ! color
to her cheeks. Stub took time to notice
that she wore the flowers which he had
sent her that morning. . - . /,;/ .
"Are you ready, Bristol ?" called out
the official.
"We are." came the determined re
sponse. EmSBSSppBGSESS!
"Hampton, , are you ready?"
"We are ready, sir," ana In that ' reply
there was much of the tenacity f of the
bulldog displayed. Bristol braced â¢ herself
on the 55-yard line ready ror the whistle.
On each man's . face was written Eome
thlng Indescribable. You may call It
what you will. Men are: at their best
when they can fight on "nerve." It ; was
"nerve" that was to pull these two teams
through to-day!
A shrill soundâ and the whistle has
blown.
"They're off 3" excitedly shouted a Bris
tol man who had horses ; on the track.
"Just watch that pole horse : \ kick," he
continued, by way" of explanation to his
companion. As the old war horse finished
cpeaklng Ferbert started rorward: ..There
was a slight thud; ; ,Down ; the ' field \u25a0 flew
the ball,/ right ; Into the arms of - Hamp
ton's 1 star halfback. .Wright started for-,
ward; arid by ;' 'splendid doCging . ran the
oval back twenty-five ; yards. How those
Hampton' rooters cleared , their lungs ! The'
game" was "on ; In' earnest
"9-42-3-8!" */; shouted Hampton's little
quarter/ // . \u25a0.'_â¢ , .â¢; / r .. * :

the envelope, and this Is what it said:

as Archie's and the other $250 as his own. .
~iThat'certalnly;would be the square tmng.

Bristol doctor. The players gathered
around the " apparently - lifeless form,
waiting the return of consciousness. The
crowd was grimly v silent and awaited
tidings from the battlefield. ' It Is sur

"What's the matter. Stanley r* shouted
Simpson from , the pres3 box.
"Nothing much." ; came back the an

Bristol men heaved a big sigh of relief
as they heard this - comfortable assur
ance. Three minutes were > given to re
pairs, and at the expiration of the al
lotted time the two elevens were at It
again.
Time was rapidly drawing to a close.
Only a few minutes were: left to play.
On the side lines, wrapped in a blanket,
lay Teddy. Wright,' crying. Long before
he had been removed from the game on
account of Injuries. He fought when the
coaches carried him off the field, and he
had a lot of fight in him yet It was
Bristol's game, so everybody said. Bris
tol held. the ball on her own 25-yard line.
A kickâ and her goal would be out of
danger. But, no! Captain Ferbert de
termined to keep possession of the balL
Jusfone year, before. Bonny Kerr. King
ston's doughty. right end, had picked the
oval up and sprinted the entire length
of the field for a touchdown. " Ferbert did
not intend that any Hampton man should
repeat the trick, so he determined to hold
on to the ball. Bristol made three fierce
assaults on the Cardinal line, and then
was forced to hand the pigskin over to
Hampton on her 23-yard line. But one
minute was left to play. '
"Good God! Can't some thins; be done?"
walled a Hampton coach.
But four of Hampton's . regular men
were In the line-up. . Captain Harding
called his men back for a conference.
Stub could not help admiring the splendid
nerve of the men as he saw them file
back. ,
"Look out for a fake play," warned one.
/Captain Harding saw that, with but onÂ«
minute left, something : must : be done.
"A goal from the field," and as he gave
the order he looked nervously at the men
grouped around him clamoring for recog
nition. . Camp claimed the right, a* being
the only; kicker left after the regulars
.had been retired.
"Camp willâ " -/â¢
But he got no farther, for by that tjmÂ«
little " Blake " had pushed himself through
and,, reaching hold of Harding.' hotly ex
claimed:
"Camp will do nothing of the sort. Pm
the ; only j senior left on. this* battered up
team. It's my last year in college, and
you've Just got to. let me kick this goal."
Captain Harding looked at the lad, wav
ered a minute and then. "remembering thÂ»
nerveof the young3ter and his previous
record." replied:
"Blake will kick - the * goal." :
The men" Jumped back Into the line wlta
the alacrity .which , carries a battery into
action. Their faces were pale, but their
legs were steady. This kick would de
cide \ the \u25a0 game. That ; Hampton line had
one more "duty to perform. ; That line
must hold and not a Bristol man must get
through. , When the crowd saw Blake
drop back * some one started , to cheer.
Then as Blake held out his hands for the
ball the stillness was something awful.
Back came the ball true, as /could be.
ATstep forward, a 'swing, a tensUn In
the line,' a snap as when \u25a0 a string on a
banjo breaksâ ah, that Bristol : line was
throughâ but just a second- too -late. Up
rose , the ball in its mad flight and with

It was flying between â¢ the coveted

and his hands:. deep; In ; his' 1 pockets.'; he >
stalked out tof the grounds. Stub was
intensely absorbed in thought.' "Why

whose names are oftener. on â¢ our
tongues than those of the heroes In the
Hall of Fame, â¢ , â¢\u25a0;
There was such a time and. we have
forgotten it already, although -it was
only ten years- ago. ..
Nowadays the lucky youpgster'of the
family sneaks down the front stairs
on his tippy-toes, in his little nightie,
at the first crack of day, on a Sunday
morning â while the oldsters are taking
their weekly "late sleep"â opens ' the
front "door as softly, as the most ac
complished burglar, grabs the fat wad
of morning papers and sneaks up the
stairs and into bed again. There his
mamma ' finds \u25a0 him when she comes in
to wake him lip in time for the epe*
clal Sunday morning, breakfast, sitting
up among his pillows with all the
"funny papers" carefully sorted ~. out
from' the ponderous Â» printed mass,
chuckling himself purple as lie follows
the adventures of his favorites from
their almost complete annihilation of
the Sunday morning before.
Lucky youngster! This is an age
of opulence and Indulgence, and he
doesn't know, as he discovers what
new deviltry the Katzenjammers have
gotten into, what new mischief Buster
Brown has Invented, what a childhood
of privations his papa and mamma
suffered, what a barren youth was
\u25a0theirs without the Sunday morning
"funny papers." He doesn't know that
they had to grow up without the aid of
the comic supplement.
Perhaps if he did he would harbor
less resentment against those oldsters
who hang on to the "funny paper"
from breakfast to bedtime, and make it
necessary for him to get up bo early
to find out what the "funny paper"
people are doing.
Perhaps if he did be wouldn't give
his surreptitious snort of scorn when
papa explains to the callers that % he
takes so many Sunday papers because
the youngsters want to see the comic
supplements.
However that may be. the comic
supplement is an American Institution,
recognized and established, like the
trolley car and the quick lunch counter.
It is only ten years old, yet it is
firm as though it had been established
forever. The public doesn't, subscribe
for the newspaper that doesn't have
one. and no postofflce is so remote that
the comic supplement doesn't reach it
and find youngsters eagerly waiting to
receive it on the day that it's due.
Yet the comic supplement did not spring
into being as , the responsive supply to
a demand.
On- the contrary, it is a creation that
has created its own demand."
Ten years ago there were no comic sup
plements nor comic supplement artists.
â¢ Ten years ago, or, to be punctiliously
exact, eleven years ago, in the evolution
of the 'newspaper the color press was pro
.duced, that Is a press that would print
.in several colors and that would register;
that, means, that it would print those
colors where the artist in drawing his
picture had designated they should go.
Before that there were experimental color
presses that would print in colors, but
jthe colors would land in the most unex
pected places, placing the red. of Hooli
gan* nose and of .Buster Brown's ..tie
had thero been a Hooligan or a Buster
In those daysâ quite without the outlines
defining either nose or tie.
. When at last the color press was per
fected so that It- would print the red of
Hooligan's nose where Hooligan wore his
nose, there was . a conclave of editors
in the editorial sanctum of the newspaper
that had secured -the first color press.
They had gathered to decide the mo
mentous Question:
"What shall we do with the color press,
now that wÂ» have it?"
One was for this thing, one was for
that, and almost the fate befell it of
being used for printing a '..'woman's'sup
plement" of fashions. The day was saved
for the comic supplement by a young man
whose observant eyes had noted the fact
that most of the men coming down town
on the cars in the morning had their
morning papers folded over to make the
"funny column" easy reading,. and most
of them when going home at night turned
to 'the funny columns of their evening
papers after reading the sports or finan
cial news, â¢ according to their particular
tastes and interests. \u25a0 '
- "What's the matter with American
humor-7-and. humorists? What's the mat
ter with making a color- supplement of
humor?" he asked. " ' . - \u25a0
His fellow-editors fell upon his neck In
Joy for. his solutionâ as rapidly as they
could resign their, own pet : schemes; and
thus the comic eupplement scheme came
into being. . " .' .. ' â¢

Because of his little '."comics" In Truth
the editor of the first comic supplement
' seized upon him as the likeliest material
to manufacture Into a., comic supplement
artist. -It was"' wonderful editorial pre-
BCiehce. . * . . " $:_
For â¢ the first comic " supplement -Dick '
Outcault . borrowed , a . suggestion from
stage* comedy, .from' the song "Maggie â¢
Murphy's Home" , In an Ed^Harrlgan
play. One line In this'SOng", "Down ih-\
Hogan's alley," gave Outcault: his' coe.-.
He created- a .number of characters \ for
Hogan's alley, and with them* reproduced'
every, current event fram~ttie_.Hogan's
alley point of view.-' The idea caught on
just enough to be accepted as "good.".
It had almost run its course, and was;
getting ready to give way to sc .nething -
else when Outcault's first hit "was. made. .;
In his. workroom. -in his : Harlem flat he
was .biting his ipencJl: quite.: vHlnly nor. j
some new twist to" give to' Hogan's- alley \
for that, week. -When in'the. midst of hia/5
publicity his small . son walked | in in .; his 7
little nightie grinning -happily and 1 idls- Â»
playing ~ his n^w, teeth, j Outcault popped
him into the Hogan's Alley Companyâ :,
nightie, two teeth, grin and all. A happy
inspiration led the color man to print the .;â¢'
new kiddy's nighife"yell6w,"ahdlo! 'upon
the next Sunday morning the Yellow Kid |
was bornâ the most famous kid, in litera
ture," if we. may stretch'the term so far
as to include the comic supplement â¢ in"'
literature. . . . . . - - '$\u25a0->'.
The Yellow Kid. was born and' "Dick" .
Outcault's fortune was 'made.
By accident)' \u25a0' ' , . ' , " ' .

it was an accident that depended upon .

Think how many kiddles, .with two ,
teeth, a nightie and a grin have been
seen by their papas.lwithout^ ever before
producing a Yellow Kid. \u25a0' \ . '. !
The Yellow Kid meant everything to ';.' ',
the man who made him. " ' . ; :
* Before. the: day of the comic" supple-. '
ment Outcault was glad enough to get â¢
$15 for a page drawing 1 .. The. comic j
supplement- tacked a cipher to,- theV (
value of. his page drawings and - made ,
it worth $150 to him to'be funny' where ' A
it had been onlyl worth 5 1 5 t o be ser lr ,
ous, but the Yellow Kid "brought opu.- y
lence.. ,-.-.. yWii / : ,* :' ' â¢ 'S. : ': â¢ ] \u25a0
He became a furore ,, with the public.
Rival papers each 'other for
Outcault and wrangled over *hlm. Infl
tators stole . his j creation, and brought
lawsuits upon their, heads.: The Yellow
Kid was dramatized-' and placarded
upon billboards ; and. 'breakfast foods,
on. dry*. goods t and # wet. .There were
Yellow Kid neckties 'and games, ,' Ye
llow .'Kid commodities of '\ every : kind
that hoped, to, float Into notice with. his
popularity, and the.. Yellow, Kid, -being
copyrighted, Dick Outcault had a rake
down, on. his every appearance -In the
way of Â» ... - .
But the Yellow Kid,. ln'the very na
ture :of ; things," , : wore . himself out Â»ahd
ilr. Outcault was left:- In , the lurch .for
a successor -while successful \u25a0', comic
supplement artists , were ; tickling I his
public and getting the laughs and the
dollars. â¢ 'â¢ . ;
Again there was a lucky accident.
Again Mr. Outcault realized - the ad
vantage \u25a0of being a family man. " ;
The original of the Yellow Kid, like
the pictured imp of popularity, had dis
appeared.' A . little - disconsolately he
admitted it to, himself.?. Butâ what was
this in his place? What funny,* sturdy
little chap was this, everlastingly in
venting iniquities to drive - his father

of his 1 pranks .In! your drawings, jit's
just the other way. This small boy of
mine waits all week for Buster to ap
pear in "the Sunday papers so that he
.can get inspiration for some new prank.
Whatever^ Buster does in [ the pictures
my boy .tries to imitate; and" he does It
train, " never : had my pocket picked
or lost my ticket, put up at good hotels

I -'rather. 'live* after being

of course^â in New York or Chicago,
pretty successfully, too. I don't mind
telling you. But it's all right, for the
pranks, as a rule, are just plain, good,
boyish mischief.
."â¢Now, However, I've got a scheme,
and if you fall into it I'll make it worth
your vrnlie. My next door neighbor
, is a crank, and, what's worse, he seem,
to single me out as his special pÂ»Â«/.
I'm a law-abiding citizen and don't
want to retaliate, but I've got a plan to
get even. If I could get the idea into
" my small boy's head to play a series of
tricks' on the* old chap his life might
get so miserable that he'd mov*. ' Now,
-here's, where you come in. I can't go -
to* my boy and put- these ideas into his
headâ that wouldn't .be. fatherly. .But
if. you will have/Buster play some
tricks of the kind I*ll indicate my kid
will follow them to' the letter and' he's
sure to pick-out the man next door as
his victim. . \u0084 . v â¢>
.-." 'You go ahead on my ideas, make
the "pictures and -print 'em and if thÂ«
plan works I'll give you jÂ» ' thousand
dollars. "What say*-' ' ' . '.
âMuch as I like money," said Mr. Out
cault. "I was obliged! to i turn the man's â¢
proposition down. For all 'l know, my
own boy would : Imitate the Buster
tricks and I might be picked as thÂ«
victim.":. . ..-. , '. Â»\u25a0'
Still Mr. 'Outcault doesn't . hold., any
grudge against the original of Buster.
He seems to think' pretty well of him,
as this "credit" that- he gives to him
will show: . ...
"There is, nothing, that -you can la
vent about children half so. funny aÂ»~
the things they,, really do," he says.
"Try* as jrou- may,! 1 yoix can't Imagine
stranger pranks than those they invent
for themselves. For ' instance, I ; hayÂ»
sat at my table for- hours at a time try
ing to think of something for Buster
to do, only to . give â¢ it _, up In despair,
when at the - last \u25a0- moment something
that my. youthful, son, Dicky, has donÂ«
will reach mjr ears and' Til mako a page
drawing of the incident.' -
â¢ recall one - time to particular. I
was digging away at my brain in vain,
when Mrs.*- -Outcault^ rushed- Into thÂ»
room, exclaiming. 'Oh. Dickey has Just
done a dreadful thing .and I told him
you'd punish . him dreadfully ' for it.'
"What : is " it?" I *asked. X wondering
whether, he 'had .set' flre to- thÂ» baxn or
painted the j horse ; green again.' ;
'â¢"He's dressed the cat and her four kit
tens up in Mary, Jane* dolls* clothe*, and
they're down in thÂ© village sauara. scar
ing horses and" everything. Tha hired
man can't catch them."
"Qood!'" I shouted, to my wife*Â»'aston
ishment. ."Do'h't. interrupt me- again for
an , horn-."; â¢ And .without further argument
or explanation I began to make a ; series ,
of I drawings- about the incident, giving
Buster credit for It. - It turned out to bÂ«
one of the funniest I ever . made. ;
"As to punishing Dickey.' l bought him
a' Bicycle for having, furnished mo with
the- inspiration. . It was worth j it."
.Dick Outcault has a fin a home, and so
much money invested and sOU rolling in
that he needs a secretary and a lawyer,
as j well as his clever wife, to look after
it ' for himâ while he' goes', on making
more. '.:!'.- r " '-"-^ \u25a0" I '..-
* He owes it all to the comic supplement.
If it hadn't. been for that lucky invention
and , perfection of the "color press, if it
hadn't,, been '": for. that , fax-seeing comic
supplement' editor, . if it hadn't been for
the great American" public that takes to

hadn't been for. Dick Outcault's knack of
seeing things, Yellow Kids and r ~ Buster

CURE CONSUMPTION
q>HE hepes of aa interested world
1 have been made buoyant by the re
1 cent declaration of that distln
i guished German scientist, Profes-
A sor Emil yon Behring. that he has
discovered a curative treatment for the
dreaded disease of consumption. At the
final sitting of the International Con
gress on Tuberculosis, held in Paris last
month. Professor Behring, as the cable
news briefly told at the time, announced
to an audience that Included some of the
most noted scientists of a dozen different
civilized countries, the details of what
he regards as aa absolute cure for tu
berculosis, and upon which he has been
working for several years. The announce
ment from any authoritative source that
a cure for consumption has been found
Is usually commented on with a great
fleal of skepticism by the medical profes
sion throughout the world and this has
been the case in the most recent instance.
Btlll Professor Behring's prominence In
the world of science, especially in the
matter of experiments with various
6read disease*, with which be has been
combating, and with which he has been
remarkably successful, has caused his re
cent remarks before the congress in
Paris to be weighed with greater serious
ness than might have been done had the
news of his discoveries come from some
otaer source.
When the German savant recited to
bis eager listeners in the congress his
\u25a0trongest convictions as to the merits of
big ; discoveries, he mildly- reminded its
members that they had been slow to ac
cept his theories and the results of his
experiments? with diphtheria a few years
aro, and he might expect that they would
Co likewise In the present case. In fact
he admitted that he had not as yet thor
oughly tested his remedy upon the human
being, bat had derived the most satis-,
factory results . from experiments in, the
animal world, and would not be prepared
to make further announcement regarding
the progress of his work In developing a
thorough consumption cure until August
next. In rex-iewing his past work, cov
ering a period of more than two years,

the professor said that he had been rorced
to the conclusion that there exists, an
absolute curative principle, e/itirely dif
ferent from what is known as the anti
toxin In which he appeared so deeply In
terested about fifteen years ago.
During- the course of his remarks
before the congress Professor Behrinff
explained that his new principle deals
â¢with the tuberculosis virus, which he
aims to break up. Briefly his plan of
experiment has been as follows: The
virus is first isolated and then stripped
of three allied substances, each of
which is differently soluble. By \u25a0 this
means he secures a pure bacillus which
can be so neutralized as to form a
curative substance wholly new to
science, and one that has so far re
warded his experiments with it on
various animals. \u25a0 v-v?*
His promise^ to have a more definite
report as to the curative effects of his
remedy on the human race eleven
months hence was not receivod; with a
great deal of enthusiasm. by his fellow
scientists, for they are a peculiar lot
and do not relish the Idea of accepting
the results of scientific research in a
piecemeal way. But. as 'stated before,
the congress â showed its respect for
Professor Behring's well-known ability
and former achievements and seeming
ly shared with '.him- his hope .that his
present work -would end in a-solutlon
of the great scientific problem that' has
troubled the world for centuries and
which some day promises relief, to 'the
many sadly afflicted men, .women and
children in all parts of the universe.
It is an accepted . theory, among the
noted scientists of the world that the
day is not far distant when a cure for
consumption will have been' discovered,"
and this fact has had a tendency to in
crease the confidence in the work" of
Professor Behring., Few of us have
probably, ever "given a serious thought
to the ravaging effects of consumption
upln the population- of the world and
what- it means :to the future genera
tions. "To - the men of science .the
disease ranks. with the" horrors of; war

counteract its effects has resolved itself
into aÂ» great 'social problem that; the

for nine months . prior to his death the
unfortunate victim of tuberculosis is un
able to : work and the loss of services,
reckoned at $1 a day, to 'which 'is added
Jl 60/ the estimated cost of food, attend
ance and medicines, brings the actual
los 3 to the city up to $25,000,000. The same
rule of reckoning is followed by * Dr.
BiggsMn determining the loss of $230,009,
000 to the nation.
The modern methods of, prevention,
among them the oat-door or fresh-air
cure, - such as Is now being ' encouraged
by this Government and those of Eng
land. Germany and France, is expected
to greatly diminish this frightful death
rate and lessen the enormous expense
that attends it. It is conceded that thÂ«
fight asainst tuberculosis is not a fight
against disease alone; but also famine, for
pauperism Is known to have no more
productive source than tuberculosis,
which destroys thei sinew of the country
and deprives parents /of their natural
dependency when their offspring are cut
down in the \ prim* of life.
'It , then." declared one of the leading
spirits 'in the movement in London to
aid ; in , the ' prevention of consumption,
"war. pestilence and famine be the great*
â¢st \u25a0 foes of mankind, there is nothin j
which will go further toward their even
tual overthrow in the civilized world
than onllghtened public efforts, directed
to the extinction of tuberculosis."
It is possible that Professor Behring's
present -undertaking may end in this
achievement. He has. the ability and ex
perience and also the 'confidence of :a
man who feels that ha is on the vergs
of a great' discovery that bode 3' health
and happiness to a world of,, people and
greater, stability to their respective gov
ernments. In his statement before the
Paris- convention Professor Bearing im
pressed upon* the minds of his colleagues
that he 'has. nothing to conceal in con
nection \ with ". his experiments with
tubercle bacilli, and that ,he will with-,
hold nothing in the event of his finally
discovering a permanent cure for con
sumption. He simply < made what some
have been pleased *to \ term a premature
disclosure regarding his experiments .with,
a view of interesting fellow-sclentlsts In
the subject and with the hope that they
will, be prepared to give credence to
â¢whatever " statement he I makes publlo
when his present task has. been finished.
Professor , Behring enjoys the high . re
gard of his" Emperor as a scientist," a
' fact that evidenced in 1901. when hÂ«
received the predicate Tvon" to -his
name. He >is comparatively a youn*
man, being only 61 ears of age. HÂ«
received his degree in medicine in Ber
lin iin 1873 and entered on h.s profes
sional career as an army surgeon.
Eventually' he. was appointed .to ; \thÂ«

AUGUSTA PRESCOTT.
NEW YORK. Nov. 4.
THE best dressed bride of the win
ter is Mrs. Ralph Pulitzer, who
was Miss Frederiea Webb,
daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Seward
Webb. Young Mrs. Pulitzer, who
is the prettiest and proudest of all the
Vanderbili granddaughters, has a pen
chant for tbe 'orchid colors.
Her trousseau gowns, most of them
imported, bear imprint of the rare taste
for which she Is remarkable. Many^of^
the gowns were kept secret and are ~
now just being- brought out, and a rare
etndy In color they furnish. \u25a0
A very Wely dress Is in violet, the
very sbado which Mrs. Clarence
Mackay wears so much. It is a'violet
broadcloth, made with tight fitting
bodice and full skirt. Over it is worn
en Empire coat, very short- walsted, very
full and caught at the belt line with a
very wide grlrdle of silk. This is one
of the most stunning gowns and it well
deserves the name of being the pret
tiest In a very elaborate trousseau.
Fancy a violet Empire coat coming al
most to the ground over a suit of
violet cloth.
Mrs. Pulitzer has several very hand
some black dresses, for It is now con
sidered smart for a bride to dress a
great deal in black. And one of her love
liest costumes is a black silk, very elab
orately trimmed with ruffles of Irish point
and with embroidered silk flounces. This
Is a bolero suit with the bolero cut very,
short and very round over a very high
Princess skirt, made as snug as it can
be. There is no color at all except a
tiny line of white in the pipings.
The most magnificent gowns of the sea
son have been In town recently for the
fall chopping and for tbe horse show and
the other autumn shows at Madison
Square Garden. One elaborate dress was
made of pale lavender doth trimmed v4th
white. It was as pale as could be, Eton
coat and all. And with It there was
\u25a0worn one of the big tilted hats, coming
well forward over the face and trimmed
with masses of white , ostrich feathers.
Such a hat is lovely, as it can be worn
with all the pale gowns of the year.
Probably the greatest study of the sea-
Eon Is afforded by the variety In furs and
the wars in which they are used as trim
taints. Never were furs seen in such a
number of shapes. There aT* the tiny lit
tle collarettes which clasp around tbe
neck and are finished with two little
ttolcs In front. And there are the wide
collars which lie around the neck and
form a handsome finish for the gown.^
Ermine ScU'of Ail Kinds.
Ermine is by all odds the favorite, and
women who can afford to buy this fur are
fairly reveling "in it. One woman has no
less than three sets of ermine. One con
sists of a two-piece set. This is In the
chape of a little four-in-hand necktie
which comes under the chin in necktie
fashion. With this neck piece is carried
a flat muff of modified size. This is
called a shopping set of, ermine.
A much more elaborate set has a
deep collar lying around 1 the neck and
clasping in the front. It is , shoulder
deep and is trimmed with a very hand
come deep white silk fringe. This is a
very beautiful piece of : fur ..arid. -one
which looks well with' all the velvet
cults of the season. With this is car
ried an Immense pillow muff, flat and
as large as the pillow upon which one
rests at night. The big pillow muff
can be decorated with a few black
flowers cut out of fur. *.
Then there is 'a third 'ermine set
which la also very popular. This Is the
old-fashioned ermine pelerine, .with a
collar as deep -as the shoulders, and
very wide ends hanging almost to the
floor. The ends are finished (with tails
and the entire piece of fur is lined with
white satin. (With this there is carried
an ermine \u25a0 muff of moderate size
trimmed with a big bunch of violets. -
\u0084 The" hats of . the winter (are not((as
freaky as those of summer. 'The many
odd shapes of the past two seasons
have been, riierged Into half a'dozen
"whiclC, while ' riot along ' the old-fash-,
ioned lines, are far from being freaky.
They are charmingly, becoming- to most
faces.
The all-black hat is extremely popu
lar, again. '."And the black headgear of
moderate size' is seen" upon every fash
ionable thoroughfare. ( There 'are ; some
very, pretty black ' hats, of fancy shape, 1
trimmed with plumes and worn with
costumes of different: colors.. V : ;

(One j can .buy. (a .shirt .waist . that is

as one wishes. There is no limit to the
cost. " Shirt waists com* at an prices,
from the dollar waist, which . Is rood
enough for dally 'wear, to the elaborate
waist which forms part of the hundred

come In checks which match almost
any checked skirt, and It Is a possible
thing to buy a silk checked shirt waist
to go with your silk checked skirt or
with your skirt of checked doth.
A very charming 1 little check which
might be worn by almost .any on*
showed colors In deep blue and black.
The check Itself was scarcely mor*
than a pin check, while the material
was a mercerized Scottish, suiting, vary
heavy and almost glossy. They-mer
cerize these materials now so that they
air* rainproof. This takes away a, little
from their brilliancy, but makes them
more durable. This suit was made In
tha box plaited style to be worn with a
belt. It was trimmed with strappings
of gray leather, and there wer* leather
buttons upon it-
Norfolk suits are smart for day year
and for roughing It. It was no less a
personage than. Mrs. Anthony Drexel
who went forth the other day dressed
in a Norfolk suit. Thar* was a Norfolk
Jacket with a wide pleat in front and a
narrower one each side of tha front. In
the back ther* was a very wld* box
pleat and around the waist ther* was a
patent leather belt in brown. Tha
whole suit showed a wood brown color,
while the trimmings and belt wer* of
bark brown, which Is a deeper, shade.
The skirt was a box-pleated skirt with
the pleats well stitched around the
hips, and, as the* suiting: was very
heavy, it Is quite probable that the pleats
v were cut ' away underneath, -so as to
lighten the skirts a little. With this
gown ther* wer* buttoned -leather
shoes, with brown uppers,' and to com
plete the whole there was a littl*
brown toque, '-trimmed with a very nar
row band of sable. One could imagine
that at home In the reserve ther* re
posed a great sablo muff and a sab!*
boa. to be brought out with the advent
of cold weather.
Miss Margaret Anglln is wearing a love
ly ermine set. The collarette Is wide and
at the belt line it Is brought in and bound
under a clasp. The stol*-*nds hang a
little below the .belt, all of ermine. With
this she carries a granny muff also of
ermine, and sha wears a black cloth
toque trimmed with the same fur.
In Paris they go to the*, theater to learn

in America It Is the "women . of fashion
who lead tbVstyles. . They Import hand
some gowns or. design them themselves,

handsome in a street dress you cannot
do' better; than study the fashionable,
thoroughfares on a pleasant day.

Of course, you must bays on* whit*

of this description -Is a white" peau dÂ©

made with \u25a0 narrow plaits extending all
around the hips jmd have them stitched
two finders deep., Then let the skirt Cars
evenly all - the ' way around. - This skirt,
while' beautiful, Is never too dressy for '
nice" wear. >It can be put on for those
occasions when one does not know what
to wear. A white peau d* cygne skirt
often saves ' a dressier gown and makes
a nice appearance at - the same time.
"Few : women provide a sufficient num
ber of white dresses," said a modiste. The
trouble lis that white soils. But It can

which divides every life into the
same eize of provinces, but varies with
each person. Some children arc old at
fifteen, with precocious talk and weird
solemn faces, and some men at thirty
have the air of fifty. They are stout in
body, they amble in their walk, they
drop oracular remarks, they endure with
an effort the gayety of youth. There ar*
others who defy time, and put the record
cf the Registrar General to confusion. It
is entered In a Government book that my
friend George Bolton was born In 1522.
end he has presented extracts from that
registrar for legal purposes without a
smile and without a blush. If one were
to believe black and white when written
by an official, and bebound by red tape.
George Is now well In the eighties, but
any one who knows George, and every
one who meets .him, is aware that that
entry Is a joke.
A IVrrnnlnl Yonngster.
For one thing all his friends speak
about him by the name of George, al
though I hasten to add he is a man of
substance and social position, of the
finest courtesy, and the most spotless life.
A gentleman of the old school, one would
â¢ay, except that you must. leave out the
word "old." They speak about him by
his Christian name because though they
may be men cf fifty, George Bolton is a
boy beside them, a mere youngster, who
is hardly entitled except in formal ad
dress to be called "Mr." By and by he
nill trow up and come Into his rights,
meanwhile ft were absurd to think of
him as more than a young fellow. He is
fo smartly dressed, with the flower of the
season In his buttonhole; he has such a
ruddy color through living In the open
air; his manner Is so cheery with a
"never so fit in my life," or "glorious
â¢winter weathCr." He Is not skating this
year, but that is just because of a tguch
of rheumatism, nothing to mention, oth
erwise he would be on the ice with the
best of them. He. finds a good word to
cay of every person, and there Is sym
pathy and charity in the grasp of his
hand. He goes everywhere, and every
body likes him, especially the young folk,
\u25a0with whom he Is most at home. The only
people who don't appreciate him are aged
and pompous persons, who are forty
years old, and have made a little money,
or have recently been included among
his Majesty's Justices oX the Peace. They
cannot say anything against him. but
they consider him frivolous. George will
never, I am afraid, make old bones; we
have given up hope of seeing him reach
middle-age. We shall* be buried before
that day comes, and George will be at
tending our funeral and be genuinely
concerned, dear old (I mean young) fel
low. "Last evening I met him at a con
versazione, and while the mlddle-agers
were trying to secure a comfortable cor
ner, and iriving up their seats to ladies
with a grudge, George was bounding vp T
stairs taking two steps at a time, and
complimenting the young women on their
appearance, and insisting upon a dance
before the night was over, and making
tvery one glad.

DOROTHY, Agnes, Katharine,
Gladys, Mary, Helen, Florence,
Gertrude, Elizabeth, Grace,
Anne, Marion, .Amy, Margaret,
Constance, Edith, Alice, Ruth,
Ethel; how pretty these names .and
fathers are, and how irresistibly they
suggest the rosebud garden of girls.
\u25a0Nothing is prettier than a girl's name,
except a girl herself. The 'names of
girls are as sweet as flowers in bloom.
Who Is Quern of Your Class 1
Who is queen; in your class garden?
Eome girls are born with popular gifts,
and have the ' magnetism that makes
them leaders, and among these there is
often one who Is sure to be liked by
everybody, and who excites the loyalty
and admiration of the entire class. You
know this to be true. In your class
there is the clever girl who is always
ready with an answer, and there is her
opposite, the rather slow girl who can
not think what to say until the -occa
sion has passed. There is the girl
whose claim to distinction is her
beauty. She is so pretty that the class
la proud of her. Another girl wears
beautiful dresses and becoming hats,
aud yet another has a manner that is
fco gentle aud refined that it wins
praise from every one.
'In a -class of twenty-five or thirty
girls there will always be as many dif
ferent characters. For though to the
casual observer girls look much alike,
to one who studies them they are very,
different. " Just as, no two children in
a* family are precisely similar, and no
two days in the year -are altogether^
alike, bo no two girls conform together
in every particular.
The difference saves the class from
monotony. Although thirty girls have
the same lessons and come under the
some discipline, their natural charac
teristics are not crushed. A ro.se Is al
ways a rose, and a lily is always a Illy.
Who is the' queen of your class" gar

"With most of us there is a turning point
in life like the watershed on a railway
journey.* For so many years we are
climbing up, for a. little we run on a
level, and now we are beginning to \u25a0" go
down, only beginning, but going down.
Say at fifty years if- an exact and "pedan

Impressive.
Callousness or W'lndoin.
We are not' old now, but we are not
young, we ar? half and '-between, we are
middle-aged, and our moods correspond.
For one- thing we have grown. insensible,
or very; largely so. to praise and blame.
Twenty years ago and less "my friend
Forsey, ' who is a writing man and has
done Quite as well as ' he .deserved,- used
to be very much concerned about reviews.
If the Times spoke favorably of nis last
story he was almost unendurable, and car
ried the extract In his pocket for public
reading, and if the Saturday Scarifier
had one of its amusing slashing articles <
on him he had the appearance of a
broken man. and believed' that fellow
travelers on the railway- were regarding
him with compassion. To-day when a
candid friend shows ' him a notice, in
which he is faithfully dealt with for his
faults, his manners afford no reward, and
the chances are he will answer, "Do you
know I think that man is quite right? 1
have always felt I was rather weak In
dialogue." Recently his wife handed him
the Spectator, with a column and a half
of almost unmixed praise on one of his
books, and he read It languidly; even ten"
years ago it would have lifted him to the
skies. If any one finds fault with a man \u25a0
at thirty he is convinced that the writer
has a persona! grudge against him, and
will watch for his revenge, and if the re
viewer happens to praise him the author
will have difficulty In distinguishing him
self from Shakespeare. His skin is very
tender in callow youth, but it grows
thicker with the years, and at middle age
he is neither much lifted up nor cast
down. His \u25a0â¢" susceptibility to pain ard
pleasure has lessened, and if he cannot
taste the sweetness of success as once;he
did, neither does he feel the bltternss of .
failure. If one desires, to take the worst
view of this mood he" would; call it;cal
lousness, but a more hopeful judgment
would be that it is wisdom.
The Death of Illusion.
The man has come to know himself,
and that Is the first great necessity of
successful living. "\u25a0" He knows what he can
do, and what he can't do, and therefore
he is not Intoxicated when he Is praised,
because thi.s.wvas his strong point," and
every man surely has some strong point;
and if he is not dashed when he is cen
sured, if a neighbor blames him, the
chances are he is quite right, for that was
his weak point, and every man is weak
somewhere. If he were to praise him
why that would be too friendly. The fact
is the man has' no illusions. They have

About Your Class Reunion.
But about -'your class reunion.- The
girls In a high school graduating class
have been together long enbugh'to have
a common fund of traditions,.associa
tions and anecdotes, on which they may
draw. They - have done the same', work
and enjoyed the same' play tor several
years. It is the greatest of" pities if,
leaving the schoolroom, they' are
obliged to give- one another up. / They
ought to get- together" from* time* to
time and : have a ' pleasant , afternoon,
and" once 'a year all 1 who .can should
meet in a reunion. -ââ¢ The best ' way is , to
have a luncheon; at. the house of > one of
the girls. . To, the expense of this feast
let the class 'contribute. By the pay
ment of a small annual fee there will
always s be ; money enough in the treas
ury to meet \u25a0 such -a demand. .There
â¢should .be a, simple 'but choice bill- of
fare,, not forgetting \u25a0; the sweets ',- that*
girls arc fond . of.; ; As class reunions
generally \u25a0 take . place In the summer
there may be plenty^of flowers jto deco
rate" the ,. table. " The i artistic -. member
of the class may paint the menu cards;
or the ; place 'cards. "Whoever :Is class
president will * take ; the Vhead of ** the
table. - and . she; may ; or. ' may ;not '. act , as

been finished 'the; toasts' will be offered
been dispelled as morning dreams. He has
weighed"; himself,; and*;understands" how -
he stands, and where he is, and so. there
comes over middle, age a certain mood of
calmness, which has not of; course in fit : ;
the force of youth, but has its own com^ "
pensation in contentment. Instead of the '
flush of" spring there is the mellowness
of autumn. ' '.'\u25a0' :" ' ' '"' . ~ v
Akin to this mood is a gracious mag
nanimity. When one is young he is of
necessity fighting" for his own . hand to
win a prize, to obtain his degree, to es
tablish a business, to acquire a practice, V
to make himself secure. 'Every- man 'is .
his rival, if not his enemy, and he Is' not;
inclined to rejoice in j other people's suc
cess, for it may be at his expense, or at
least it may be a reflection on his' fail
ure. Nor has he leisure to concern him
self about other ;; men's reverses or to \
give them pity. He was down himself
-yesterday, and 'if he! does not take care .
he may be : down again to-morrow In the
dust of defeat. When his battle has-been
. fought and the struggle is ever,' espe
cially when he has won and reached the'
crest of the hill. -; then he " has ; time to*
rest and to observe, and to"; take an un
sellish interest . in : his j When a
man is running his race.it is not possible
for him to considerable other runners, or
to wish them ; well. .. He ; needs all .his
breath for his '\u25a0 own race. "When \he "has';'

or lost, but all the more^if;he hasiwonU

me," he used to say."."l say, 'Pass, Mon- -

he grew old he wag entirely satisfied. "His
unimpaired curiosity continued to inter
rogate the universe," but, he was' full of.
rest. He suffered terribly, but he never
complained. â¢ He Â« was dying,., but ] he had
not abdicated. "I have done my work,"
he said to Madame* Renan,, "l die happy." ;
This mood > of satisfaction life be
gins at middle age,',- and is connected with
a delight in younger people. "My Ideal,"
to quote Renan : again, A'would . be ', an old
patriarchal country house,* - full of ' chil-\
dren singing, full of lads .and lasses [ light X

C W. Sturdevant repeats
my question and then says, "That
is not hard to answer. Our .mer
chants do not give .as long time
for the payment ;of accounts '.as
foreign dealers do, and so the foreigner
gets the business. Of course it Is not as
simple as that might sound, for credit
rulings are determined by various consid
erations influencing .the volume and di
rection of trade."
Mr. Sturdevant is in charge of the
Spanish-American department of the Pa
cific Commercial Museum, and he speaks
from experience gained in an intimate
study of commercial conditions in the
countries*^about ;.trhlcli 'X '"^qulreTrt "/He*
seems as loyal to the citizens of the far
South as to the Americans of this colder
continent, and Is, I think, as proud of
the development of Peru and Chile as of
California's own.
"I should say," he continues/ "the great
trouble has been that our merchants have
\u25a0 generally understood neither- the people
nor the countries they sought "to serve.
Only a few have made a careful study of j
conditions, and the others make very i
natural mistake* In consequence of their'
lack of information. For example, many
shippers to Central American dealers are
In the .habit of crating their shipments
precisely as If they were Intended for a
European port where are all the best
facilities for hwwrtijwy Â»n^ trans-shipment.
"But In Central America there Is' very
little business at the ports except the
mere loading and unloading of cargoes.
The titles of commercial importance, are
located inland where the climate Is cooler
and more healthful, and to these cities
the consignments of goods must be trans
ferred. Sometimes there are railroads,
but usually there are only the mule trains
to handle freight, and that Is where the
Imports nee of right packing comes *n.
"TbÂ« eases must be small and compact
weighing not more than ISO pounds, so
they may be swung one on each side of
the little burros, 800 pounds making a
load. English shippers are so careful on
this point uiat vtry often they have the
packing cases fitted with special handles
or loops by which they can the more
. easily be swung Into position.
"If a shipper sends down a great case
of crockery or rough glassware, weighing
half a. ton or more. It has to be repacked
at the port of entry. That means loss by
breakage and theft, ana Inferior crating
and . further breakage en route, so that
when the purchaser finally receives the
toods he finds the order is short many
pieces, for which he wants an allowance.
"It takes weeks for his â¢ complaint to
reach the exporter) the mails all going
via New York, and for the exporter to
. advise nun of the refusal of the claim,
but this lapse of time does not soften his
anger. Meanwhile! the sixty or ninety dajv
credit limit has expired and he has to pay
the bill before he bas~ an opportunity to
realize on the stock. He has had to pay
the transportation and import charges
when Xho shipment arrived, so the entire
transaction becomes practically cash.
â¢The result is that the next order Is
placed elsewhere, whero the goods will
Le. proyeily packed and where he can
receive a commercial dating that will
suit his convenience. It is by. no means
unusual for foreign houses. German,
Unglish or French, to allow 'six months
or a year. to. reliable dealers in this
territory, the prices they get enabling
them to make these liberal adjust
ments. @3B
"One reason our merchants do not of
fer more liberal terms to the Central
and South American buyers is that, af
a general thins, they distrust thenvâ
perhaps on account of one or more un
fortunate experiences that might have
been avoided with care.
. "There is a glamour surrounding a nice
export , order that affects the entire
office force of the receiving firm, from
. the president down to the errand boy.'
see the imposing: letterhead, the
enumeration of the lines of goods
handled, the telegraphic code word and
all the details that give to the bit of
paper Its substantial appearance. So as
promptly as possible the ; shipment is
made, and .when payment is \ not forth
coming the services of the American
Consul are invoked. He reports in diiw
time . that . the 'Importer* is, 'insolvent
,or has removed to a pew"' field, and was
not entitled' to credit ' in" the first place.
"EeallElng the difficulties of collect
ing by the lonÃ and expensive legal pro
cesses of the. little republic,' the mer
chant pockets his loss ' and 'makes /his
next export quotation -for cash agniWt
shipping: papers." tVhen he doesn't get
the order he doesn't worry-much,, be
cause; he feels that at least he has not
lost anything*. â¢ ' â¢ . â¢

"Central American wants are. very
simple. "-"- The - people . are either very.
rich or pitiably poor, so there is' no mid
dle classâ the great buyers \u25a0in . most
countries. Nevertheless ithey import
quantities of mining and industrial ma
chinery, sewing, machines, hardware,
glassware, canned goods, paper, leather,
i hams, whisky and wines,; The United
''States has a good share of this trade,
and, though more' goes to New Yoric
and the Eastern 6 - cities than comes'to
San Francisco, the proportion .can be
changed by careful work on the part
of our people. A great ; many dealers
here seem to consider the' Central Amer
ican trade only when" they deplore the
fact that this city gets so little of it." r
"Perhaps there are so many of thesa'
difficulties, special adjustments ; and
concessions, they do not feel the busi
ness down there is-* worth:, while/ I
offer.â * â---.-\u25a0; .... .;- :â¢.: ,.
"But it is worth while," Mr. Sturde
vant Insists, "and other nations give it
their attention* with profitl - .Some *of
our- commission men have succeeded
splendidly in handling coffee, hard
woods and the fruits from- that sec
tion, sending down a 'general line of
merchandise In exchange, and 'they find
as few complications, relatively, as in
their domestic trade. The reason la
that they understand the markets and
the people. Material prosperity is on
the Increase* and a higher standard of
living will open new markets for our
goods. In Nicaragua, for example, the
Government recently granted a conces
sion covering the use of waterfalls of
the Tipltapa River for electric energy,
and a new railroad Is planned for early
construction. The Tehuantepec Rail
way will be opened this year and there
are abundant evidences that the little
republics are making rapid progress in
all lines." . ...
"Will the Panama canal â \u25a0," I begin.
"In my Judgment," says ' Mr. . Sturde
vant. "the canal and its building will
tend to make . conditions in the whole
of Central America more settled and
when it is finished San Francisco will
have a short cut to the eastern coun
tries of South America. But that is in
the future and Just .now we should; be
paying more attention to the coun
tries on the west slope. One thing the
canal will mean to usâ a market for
our redwood. California redwood Is
the ideal .timber for use in the* build
ings to be constructed by, the Govern
ment throughout the canal zone, for its
fiber resists destruction by the ants
and other insects better than any other
wood.. Our lumber interests."have-se
cured good contracts already and. there
will be others as the; work 'progresses.
"In South America there is practic-
ally no limit for the business if we
want to ; fgo after it. The countries
along . the Pacific are . most progressive,
notably Peru and , Chile. .[ It; would; sur
prise you to, see what handsome cities
they : have, what^ Imposing public build
ings, libraries, parks : and .monuments.
The Governments of these two coun^.
tries are on sound financial "/ footing
and their citizens, the Yankees'(bf
South America, are forging ahead at a
rapid' rate. :/.*'\u25a0 '; .l<y\:y. I â¢ ; '.~-' : ' : â¢ '-\u25a0'-' :"\u25a0: "\u25a0

U\T 0T that there
i^U i Â£nt something
X. t| to be said on the
other- side of the
matter/ Bridget resumes,
after a deprecatory little
cough behind her lisle thread
glove. "The mistresses are on
the lookout for faults as well
as the maids. And, if you will
let mo say it, ma'am, they talk
us over and tell their experi
ences to one another pretty
much as the maids do â and
we know it! The queerest
thing is that, when they are
agreed that servant girls are
a Lad lot, they are so 'soft' in
giving references. I've often
turned over in my mind
whether that's because, so
long as they get rid of 'rub
bish' themselves, they don't
care who gets it next, or be
cause, as I've, heard them say
over and over again, they
think it's cruel tc stand in
the way of a girl's making an
honest living, and what
doesn't suit one may suit an
other.
"llien, again, the most of .
them don't like a fuss, and girls talk very violent
sometimes, and when once a lady has pot a name
for being unjust in turning a servant off without a
character, or saying something in the 'confidential'
books at the Intelligence Office that stands in the
way of her getting a place â the story goes like .wild
fire, and it ain't easy for that lady to get anybody
to come to her, much less to stay with her. It's
'most like a smallpox card tacked up on the door
for the word to be passed around from cne kitchen
to another that any madam is a 'hard mistreSs.'
"It ain't to be wondered at, either. I wouldn't
take a hard place if I could get one where things
were likely to be more satisfactory.
"But about this reference business ! There isn't
a girl in the city who doesn't know that, no matter
how ladies may talk down servant girls among
themselves, they don't hold together when the pinch
comes, as the maids do. Every little while there's a
big talk in the newspapers of Housekeepers' Unions
and the like that ere going to band themselves to
gether all over the country and alter everything.
And how members are to take a pledge not to em
ploy a girl that hasn't clean papers from' her last
place. And how diplomas are to be given to girls
who have studied cooking and housework in schools
and classes, and the like, and th^se scholars are to
have the pick of the best places, and all that. And
how wrong it is/ to give greenhorns such large
wages, and they with everything to learn, and so
forth, and so forth.
GIRLS LAUGH ABOUT IT
**This sort of talk doesn't change matters one
bit! You know it yourself, ma'am! Girls read some
of the newspaper Â£ lories of what's going to be done,
and make fun among themselves about the'diplomas
and suck-like. If they/ had ever seen any of the
housekeepers sticking together and taking one an
other's part â anything like a real union, or a strike,
or the likes" of" that â they might take it serious.

I HAVE a dear little baby eleven months
old. and when ehe is one year old I
am going to give her a party. "Would
you give me any suggestions as to what
â¢would be appropriate for favors for such
little folks, also what refreshments?
Mrs. W. R. (Wilmington, Del. ).
When the babye-st of our flock was 1
year old we sent out cards for a "white
tea." Twenty-five babies, from 1 to 2
years of ape, were bidden with the pro
viso that mother or older sister or capa
ble nurse should accompany each. We
had soft balls, jumping-jacks, dolls, pic
ture-blocks and picture-cards to amuse
them, with a live dog, two tiny kittens
and two toy rabbits. For refreshments
there were "cambric tea," milk, . bread
and butter, plain home-made cookies in
fanciful shapes and hard biscuits. For
favors there were small boxes, each
holding a doll toy bird with yellow feath
ers, which the babies took home with
them. Unfortunately, we were In town,
the weather being cold, and could not
turn the party loose upon a clean-shav
en, sun-warmed lawn to frolic But
they had a merry time, and behaved so
well as to elicit the surprised commen
dations of their elders.
Having received much help from your
column. I would like to help It along In
some way. I will tell how I cut off sweet
corn from the cob for the table. FlrÂ»t,
chave the topfe off the grains, then, with
the back of the knife, ecrspe the corn out.
Thin it with a little co!d water, drain
through a colander and cook the corn. Add
the milk and water that oozes from the
corn: eeason with salt, pepper and. a good
lump of butter.
Pleaee excuse me for troubling you so
much, but would you tell your readers who
have books and magazines to give away
that I would be pleased to have themâ or
a few? We are not able*Lo buy them, as
there are no book stores within eighteen
miles of us. We only take one paper; that
is an ever-welcome visitor, made more co

There were three soegs I asked for some
Xitne ago. I thought maybe tome of your
reader* had them and would copy them
for me. These are what I wanted: "Under
the Bamboo Tree." "Coon! Coon! Coon!"
"Dairy Bell."
I will add two more to my list: "Whist
ling Rufus." -Ticklish Reuben."
If I lived near a newsstand I would not
trouble you. Mrs. B. l-\ B. (Pennsylvania).
. I shall . hold your address, and hope
that your needs and modest request will
be responded to generously.
Will those who would like to send
magazines and books write to me for
"Mrs. B. F. B.s" address? Copies of
the songs may be sent direct to me,

But they know that, when one cuts up so/that her
madam packs her off without a stiff ticket, and sends
word to the Intelligence Office she got her from
that she is impudent, or a thief, or so violent tem
pered that she's dangerous in a family, the* girl can
get another place as good as that she left without
never a scrap of a recommend." There are plenty of
other offices where her dollar will' be taken and no
''Why, in one place where I was, in an out-of'
town village, an office sent out a cook that had no
stiffticket less than two years old. But Janeâ that
was her name â had been known in the office for
four or five years, and had often worked in the fam
ilies of the ladies as run it. Well, ma'am; as thrue
as I'm sitting here, the woman was so drunk when
she got to us that I and the chambermaid -had to
put her right to bed, and there she stayed for a day
and a night, and the mistress had to pay for her
railroad ticket back to town. Ypu may, depend the
lady sent a strong letter(to that office ! And all they
could say was that they were 'fair astonished; after
knowing the woman so -well and for. so long, and
there was a clergyman who had her once in his fam
ily and stood ready^to pay her $35 a month: if -she
would come-back,' and a lot more stuff. of the. same
kind. \u0084
> "If ever I saw a regular-bum, that Jane.(which
I'm not mentioning her last name) was one! She
slept in the same room with me, and, saving your
presence, ma'am" (with another modest. cough and :
looking down), "the state of that bed was such that
gasoline and camphor 'shut in it for two days hardly
got rid of 'em." -\u25a0'\u25a0': .V Â«
"Did not the lady get back the fee that she paid
at the office?" I ask, interestedly, I'or the money she
spent for the drunken woman's fare?"
"Not a cent, ma'am! They offered to send her
out another cookâ which she , wouldn't have. She
my friends have used It with success. Car
pets, rugs. etc.. we have cleaned, and
even ' an old' sofa that was covered with
what I -'think was brussels. We put It
afterward where the . air could strike It
and it was Just like new. I would choose
a bright day. open all doors and windows j
and the carpet will soon dry. I know it
Â» there Is any color whatever in the carpet
it will be as bright as new., I always
swept the carpets well and then scrubbed
them with the following mixture: \u25a0
Three gallons of water: two bars of white,
.soap: 5 cents' worth of borax: S cent6'worth
of saltpetre; one-half pint of ammonia. -
Heat the water; phave the soap fine; add
borax. *altpÂ«>tre. and -boil until -everything
has dissolved. When It has ceased boiling,
add the ammonia, and use the liquid as
warm as you can bear your hand in it.
With a soft scrubbing brush clean a small
space that can be covered equally and
scrub Just as you would a .bare floor. Do
not use too much water. I use about one-^
half of a bucketful at a time, so that the
\u25a0water is always clean and hot. Take thÂ«
..wood edge of the brush or the back of a
knife : to scrape up what water is left on
' the surface. ...
I have tried to make: it plain, and' I
am afraid I have taken up too much . of
your valuable time. But I would like to
know if the lady uses the recipe and what
kind of luck she has with it.
Could you tell me through your ; column
how to clean a tapestry table cover, with
out sending it to the cleaner's? I have had
so many helps from your page that I could
hardly do without It. It has saved me
quite a lot. Being an orphan since 5 years
old I had no one to teach me to be saving,
and now that I am married I find myself
doing many things. that I had no idea I
could ever do. .-â¢.-. \u0084

"There is the other kind, you know, ma'am!
Them. who never praise a girl, or take any more
notice of her. than if she was a machine, and not
flesh and blood, with a heart and a soul. The kind
that's always keen to see that a servant does her
full moneys worth, and don't eat too much, and so
watchful for pilfering and waste and breakages
that she often sees what never happens. Now,
there's other kinds that scold when they are pro
voked, and find fault even when they ain't vexed,
and think any cuddy-hole is good enough for a girl's
room. You wouldn't believe the places decent maids
are put into sometimes, or the becb and covers they

j BEn. Â«'Formal Breakfasts and Luncheons
How the Hostess Conducts Them and How the
Guests May Help
Eleanor B. Clapp
Copyright, I*os. by A. 8. Barr.es & Co.
AT & luncheon the hostess always
walks into the dining room last,
unless it is necessary for her to
show the way to the guests. Ex
cept when the party Is very large and
rather formal, it is not usual to have
favors. In any case they should be
simple; a bunch of violets, a single
long-stemmed rose or carnation, or a
tiny bonbonnlere is all that is ever given
nowadays. At big luncheons, name
cards are used, but menu cards are
sever seen on the tablo at these, func
tions.
The fashionable hour for luncheons Is
et 1 or half -past.
The guests should arrive a few min
utes before the time specified in the in
vitations. They remove their wraps
and rloves. but wear their hats to the
table. About half an hour after the
meal Is finished they should begin to
take their departure, as an invitation to
a luncheon does not Include a bidding
to spend the afternoon.
The Breakfast ,
The noonday breakfast, with the ex
ception of the wedding breakfast, is an,
entertainment only customary in ex
tremely fashionable society. About all
the difference that exists between this
and a luncheon is that men are allowed
to be present and the hour of the en
tertainment is at 12 o'clock.
Suppers.
Euppers are of many kinds; the most
usual are the supper after the theatre,
either at a restaurant or a private
house, and the chafing dish supper,
which may take the place of the latter
function or may form a separate fes
tivity by Itself. In many places In the
country, and in email towns and vil
lages where the dinner is In the middle
of the day, the evening meal very prop
erly goes by this name, and almost all
invitations, except on Sundays and holi
days, are given for this repast.
A supper after the play is the usual
way of winding up a theatre party, and
In large cities It Is customary to have
this at a fashionable restaurant. Ar-
Those in Need of Good Words
PROFOUND, indeed, is the grief of
relatives and friends of the de
ceased. Mournful hearts send to
kens of sympathy to the Imme
diately bereavedâ sweet flowers, elo
quent notes 01 consolation. In the dim
lighted chamber of death tearful faces
nod together solemnly about the virtues
of the departed. They speak of this
kind act. of that noble self denial, of
those generous responses to all appeals
for help; they tell how deeply they ap
preciate this and that and the other
good trait. But what cares' that quiet
form now that lies so still ypnder in
the shadows? Can that white face be
stirred now by a smile of pleasure at
a krdly word? Can those calm, cold
hands clasp with delight euch a bunch
of lovely fragrance as rests by her
feetâ those violets, or roses, or delicate
fern?
But waitâ Jt all may be perfectly true
about the good that Is spoken, 'i'ne
spirit that has gone may well have de
servpd every word of praise and more.
The flowers that make a bower of the
ehadowy room with their sweet, bright
laces are indeed a lovely .NOtn
lnr Is more eloquent of spiritual peace
and promise of eternal beauty than
they. There is no corner of earth wnere
rangements are made with ' the pro
prietor beforehand, the table is selected,
and the dishes are decided upon. Neither
a very long nor elaborate menu should
be chosen, as the guests have naturally
dined earlier In the â¢ evening, and so
cannot get through many - courses.
Oysters or game are usually selected,
followed by a salad or an ice of some
sort. Black coffee, wine, or champagne
is served. When this affair Is held in
the home of the host or hostess the
menu is practically the same, if to
give a smart supper, party is the aim,
but if something jolly and more or less
informal is intended, then It partakes of ,
the character of the chattng-dlsh sup-~
per, and oysters, Welsh rabbit, lobster
New-burg or some dish of the kind is
cooked by the mistress of the house her
self In the chatlng-dlsh.
To give a chafing-dish supper by itself,
unconnected with a theatre party, is
a very easy way to entertain a few in
timate friends. About a week before the
evening set for the event cordial notes
of invitation should be sent out, or, as
this sort of party Is always very In
formal, It Is perfectly allowable to give
the 'lnvitations verbally or even call
one's friends up by telephone and ask
them to come over and spend the even
ing and eat a Welsh rabbit, or what
ever is to be the piece de resistance of
the feast, on such and such a night.
Beer is generally served with rabbit or
golden buck and - wine accompanies
oysters or lobster. No 6weets . are re
quired at such suppers. It Is usual for the
guests to arrive at about half past eight
or nine, and the supper can begin at any
time after 10 o'clock.
A country supper at which friends are
entertained when the dinner hour is at
noon, or a Sunday-night tea In a large
city, often consists of but two courses;
in the first course are a hot dish, escal
loped oysters, cold meat, or a salad,
as chicken, lobster, potato, etc. Tea,
coffee or chocolate is the beverage, and
bread or hot rolls are passed from time
to time. In the /second course are the
sweet dishes, cake, preserves, jellies,
etc
llowers are out of place. Their bright,
rosy' sweetness, be it modest or gay,
looks up into human faces welcome in
sadness or joy alike, fitting every mood
and every place." â¢ :

OM F. STENOGRAPHY . and ; type
writing, a real profession, which
deserves |an article by Itself, I
can say that: I hope no self-re
specting young woman making a ca
reer for â¢herself, will, be either attracted
to : this field or repelled from it by the
peculiar, attention, it' Has received â¢ from
American humorists. \u25a0 Like any other
occupation in which a woman works
for men and^ls brought Into' contact
with men. It demands of the worker
dignity â¢ and common sense. The
girl who should seek, the field because
of the "humorously alleged,- champagne
suppers and theatre tickets as ' per
quisites would, in nlne'cases out of ten,
be entirely disappointed, and in the
tenth would be far worse off. \The girl
who should put aside the idea of learn
ing because she feared masculine ag
gression would be equally foolish. .' The
fact is that American men are by in
stinct courteous to .women, even in
business. You have nothing ' unpleas
ant to apprehend unless you invite it.
This is the rule. The exceptions are so
few and bo far between as to be prac
tically negligible. :
The remuneration of the stenographer

cases where competent women are
making as* much as $35 a week. I am

Coil's "Weekly Cartoon on American Society
Care of the Baby; the Sixth Month
His Weight, Intelligence and Summer Food
Discussed for Mothers
Dr. Emelyn L. Coolidge
\u25a0-. Copyrljht. 1905. by A. S. Barnea & Co.
THE average baby at "6 months of
age weighs , from fifteen to six
teen pounds. During the second
half of , his first year the baby
will not gain quite so much each week
as he did during the first hour. From
two to four ounces is generally the
amount gained each week at this time.
In very hot weather the gain In weight
is less, and may cease entirely for a
short time:
The baby should now sleep about two
thirdsof the time and continue to show
signs of Increasing intelligence. If moth
er, father or the nurse Is called, he will
frequently look at the person named
and seem to recognize him or, her. As
he Aa now in" short clothes, he will
greatly enjoy rolling about on a wide
bed and may even attempt to creep a
little. \u25a0 -';
As the mortality among infants la
greater in hot weather than in cold, the
baby's summerâ either the first or sec
ond oneâ is a thing to be considered.
If possible, a baby should spend the
hot months but of the city. The moun
tains or Inland country 'are to be pre
ferred to the . seashore while the - baDy
Is under two years old. In selecting a
summer home do ; not choose one near
ponds <\u25a0 or '\u25a0 stagnant water of any Kind.
Unless it is absolutely , necessary, do not
take a'baby or young child. to ahotei
or large boarding house for his summer
Little Household Suggestions
HERE are a -few little. suggestions
that will help out when many an
- annoying- wrinkle -disturbs the
.housewife's smoothly running:
machinery ; also, a few* ideas that per
haps are new to many, and will serve to
oil Â« ; wheel here and there sln the [ said,
machinery." i
To remove rust from steel fenders or
fire-irons, cover with sweet oil. rub well.
AfteVforty-elglit hours take "some" un- .
slaked lime, {powdered very : finely/ and
rub till the rust has disappeared. Some
times ; Jn; the summer, when fireplaces
and stoves are cold and cheerless, damp
ness -will creep in^ from "the chimney,
above. '.Often from continued damp
weather moisture settles upon :e.very-,
thing. At .this time : , there is no heat to
dry out the metal wprk.
V; At moving: .; time '-. or housecleanlng * a
woman cannot be too careful as to how
she reaches and pushes and pulls and
lifts. " Her exertions should be . directed
with \u25a0 never-f ailing ; caution. ' Mistakes . in
this matter; are. responsible for 'more
physical - troublesâ serious injuries â than
one : would realize. :s: s When lifting i pic
tures down from the walls, a stick with
a notch cut in the end will be found to
save : a great ' deal ; of exertion in going
up and down : steps. ; : ;*, /

cracks and | crannies. : it seems Â»to â¢ delight
in y catching ;; all i manner X of ? stain y and
dlrt.>A i narrow e neck protects the ac
cumulations within. " *â¢*\u25a0"'
A I labor-saving | device | for .housewives
who 1 wish-; to j make * currant and r other
fruit -jellies is "thus; described :;,When the
fruit pulp Â£Â» Is r placed s In ' the ; bag for
squeezing the juice â¢ out \u25a0of it.; the .bag
outing. "' The smallest cottage ifl tna
most unfashionable country place Is to
be preferred to a hotel full of noise ana
excitement,' where numerous people stop
,to admire the baby or to whom be la
far too ofttn "shown oil" by his mptner
or nurse. iThen. too, the kitchen ana
laundry arrangements In. hotels are apt
to be inconvenient, and often are very
expensive If special privileges are re
quested.
If the baby must be kept in the city,
keep him In the parks before 9 or Vi
A. M., and between 5 and 7 f. M. The
rest of the time he Is better off In the
house. When in the house let him spena
the hottest hours of the day on the bed,
or on a mattress ' or pact on the floor,
and dressed In his little shirt, band, and
diaper only.
Be sure to give the baby cool, water
that has been boiled, and plenty of It.
He needs" it now even more than he did
in cool, weather. Make a practice or
giving him an ounce at least between
his meals.
Even in summer the baby should have
clothing which contains some wool. A.
mixture of silk and wool or cotton and
wool may. be used for shirt, band and
skirt. The band should never bÂ« left
off; in the hottest - weather the shirt
may be omitted, and the long riooect
band having shoulder straps may taica
Its place, but It is absolutely necessary
to keep the abdomen covered by means
of . the * band.
U firmly attached to the edge of the
table by a- strong. cord. : after a heavy
iron ring has been placed over the neck.
The weight of the. ring naturally
causes it to press down on the fruit
pulp, and It thus automatically per
forms the process ! of squeezing which
demands , so much effort from the jam
or â¢ jelly maker.
When peeling onions hold them under
cold water, a* that -.will keep them
from / smarting the . eyes. This is a
most exasperating experience when the
housewife 'Is , preparing a meal.- Usu
ally-she patiently endures.' and mopa
her eyes with professional indifference.
Potatoes - In , their â¢ jackets are \u25a0 more
nutritious \u25a0 than when peeled, because
right - under tho skin .is all the rich
potash which is so beneficial to the
body." If peeled. It must be very, thin,
and- they should be steamed, not boiled.
. Kitchen ' paints will ' soon ' acquire Â£.'
shabby, dull look from the frequent
cleaning that Is necessary In this room!
The use of soap only Increases the dii
ficulty. especially if the paints are var

pound" of 'bran* In a gallon, of water for
an hour, then wash the paint with this
bran water, and it .will -not .only be
kept; clean, but: bright and glossy. A

AMERICAN GIRL MAY BE THE FIRST LADY OF FRANCE
JAY GOULD'S DAUGtimR DESIRES P^m^ COUNT BON I
Countess Would Out
rank Duchess of
Mariborough.
\u2666
Will Spend Fortune
to Insure His
Election.
Spedial C*blÂ« UÂ» The Calk
PARIS, Nov. 11 â In a few. months, or
perhaps even in a few weeks, if hear
say is to be credited, France will have
a. new President, though his identity is
still so lost amid the host of candidates
that no one can guess shrewdly what
his name may be. For, according to the
French constitution, the new President
Is not elected from among a few nomi
nees pointed out by political parties,
but is chosen directly by the members
of the Senate and Chamber, meeting at
what is called the Congress of Ver
sailles. The number of candidates is
consequently unlimited, and the one
winning the most votes becomes Presi
dent. .The system is much the same as
that of the party conventions preceding
elections in America, and the surprises
are generally as great.
Several men Have already* been men
tioned as favorites, but, to judge by
precedent, this would almost suffice to
bar them out. and to render all the
more eager the search for the dark
horse who will win. In the latter cate
gory, one of the names. is none other
than that of Count Boni de Castellan*?.
husband of Anna Gould. Those who
know Bonl best say that his horses and
his club are much nearer to his heart
than would be the glories of holding
the helm of the ship of state. But his
Countess has been stirred by the ac
counts of what Consuelo Vanderbilt has
been doing to further the political in
terests of the Duke of Mariborough.
The Countess It is who has been largely
responsible for Boni's recent entrance
into active .politics.
THOH> IX THE FLESH.
\u25a0While, however, ' Boni's Parliamentary
life has in a way gratified Anna Gould's
vanity, it Is a core thorn in her flesh that
she is still beneath the social prominence
of the Duchess of Mariborough, who
ranks above all Americans married
to titled foreigners. But as the, wife of
the President of France would outrank all
the Duchesses In the. world. Anna Gould
has set her heart upon climbing to this
pinnacle, and she hopes to succeed by dint
of dollars spent In giving an unprecedent
ed series of dinners, balls and entertain
ments generally for the members of Par
liament. Many of the members of both
Senate and Chamber. Indeed, the vast ma
jority of them, are obscure men from the
provinces who have taken up politics be
cause they make a living out of It, and
who, however liberal may be the prin
ciples which they proclaim, consider it a
privilege and a Joy to be received by a
Count backed by an American million
airess. And as, . In France, the future
President has to count solely with mem
bers of Parliament, the Countess de Cas
tellane's idea Is not a bad one.
And Boni may stand more chance than
would be supposed from anything he has
accomplished so far. The one achieve
ment of his life has been capturing the
Gould minions, which in Itself was a mas
terful performance perhaps Justifying a
man in resting: thenceforth on laurels
mixed with rose leaves. This Indolence
is precisely what counts for him. There
is nothing which the third republic fears
as much as popularity or surpassing
merit. The lessons of Louis ; Napoleon's
coup d'etat end of Genera! Boulanger's
plot have sunk deep. And so whenever a
Frenchman shows himself to be intellect
ually head and shoulders above his fel
lows, thr- whole Government coalition Is
turned against him to oust him before he
can do anything or become anybody.
FORCED TO nESIGX.
As soon as Citfimir Perier showed
himself to be an able, sincere and ener- {
getic man, his entourage forced him '\u25a0
into such a position, that he had to re-!
sign. When Colonel Marchand re- â¢
turned to France after the Fashado ex- j
cltement, he was put under arrest and '
ordered for three months to a" deserted '
' orner of the Forest of Fontainebleau .
and not allowed to come to. Paris even 1
on private business until popular en- I
thusiasm had calmed down. When!

idol, his prestige was â¢ considered a
threat to the navy, arid 'his ship was

the Levant so the Viaud should not re
turn to France.
When Paul Deschanel was recognized
as the most- popular president which
the Chamber of Deputies had ever, had,
and pointed out as sure . to be the next
President, a plot for his overthrow was
forthwith developed - and \bo skillfully
executed that he does not receive atten
tion now even when he addresses \u25a0 the
Chamber as. a: humble Deputy, and no
one would dream of putting him for
ward for any official position whatever.

PAUL DOIIMER'S STRENGTH.
Of the various favorites . now ' pro T
posed, only one is a man of exceptional
strength,, and that jis Paul Doumer,
president of, the | Chamber of * Deputies.
And on this account, . while ,he would
make, an ideal President for a truly re
publican country like the United States,
energetic, enterprising, intelligent arid
experienced in many ways, he 'will meet
with more "organized opposition" than
anybody else.
But â¢ Doumer | has : friends in I all j politi
cal parties and has not had ' a . single
serious charge brought against him .in
the course of his long- public career;
and no. other politician\ in France 'can
pretend to either of . these distinctions.
Doumer lsnow-47, years old, and has
been president of the Chamber since
the beginning of the year. Before ".that,"
he had been Governor of Indo-China,
and Is - acknowledged to be .the best
colonial Governor France has everjhad.
Energetic enough to investigate j- for
himself and see where possfbillties,'for
improvement lay, he . â¢: was . < courageous
enough. to carry out the reforms which
he considered necessary. -He reorgan
ized the entire . administration ,. of Uhe
colony,' improved the material conditon
of the residents, suppressed abuses of
authority and irregularities among; the
petty/ officials, and made himself, 1 ; In a
word, the active a* well as the nominal
head."^BÂ»
That' is why his advent to the Elysee
Is so dreaded. The President of France
has 'enough power, on paper to do some
thing ' with the state if ' he has the am
bition or i the: ability, but this /is pre
cisely what Parliament wishes â¢ to ' render
impossible;- A . weak \or ..incompetent
President, who will never have â¢ either
suggestions or objections to make,'] but
will docilely sign- everything: .put;be
fore him, -is the "safe" man' being
sought after. . For the executive . power

It is a remarkable fact that whenever
the councils of the Degree of Pocahontaa
give free socials the members of many
of the tribes of the Improved Order of
Red Men of this city are In evidence in
large numbers to take part in the pleas
ure of entertainments and dances, like
wise ice cream and cakes and collations,
but when there is an appeal for a do
nation to assist the Degree of Pocahontas
in a social function the tribes forget.
This is notable in the fact that when
the Degree of Pocahontas some time ago
decided to have a public _ rising up the
tribes as well as the councils in this
c'ty were asked for a donation to help
defray the expenses for the hiring of
Native Sons' Hall, music for dancing to
follow the raising up and incidental ex
penses. { The councils responded liberally,
but of the twenty-nine tribes in this city
only seven responded to the appeal for
the good of the order. Six donated one
dollar each and one seventy-flve cents.
Tribes are readjj to accept the courte
sies of the councils, which are a part
of the general order, and axe ready to
ask the councils to assist them in the car
rying out of social functions, but when
they are called upon to do something that
will help bring that branch of the order
prominently before the public eye, why.
the amount of contributions tell the tale.

Justified. Her own claim to perhaps sev
enteen isâ well, feay amusing.
One haa Mii-pocted it ever since her
lios'.na, mischievous, tlfish. bubbling with
youth. Her Dinorah; her favorite role,
eynlirms the ghastly suspicionJ Whence
\u2666yhis Vfnins person gets her trick of trag
edy isÂ«ihe "Traviata" is, therefore, an
insoluble mysiery. One may say that the
tradition isâ Tetrazziui warren for itâ
that she studied for six months when she
was nineteen, and" thereupon dropped into
n career now fourteen years old. but this
Is of the incredible things. Why, she
has even the child-trick of calling herself
"poor Tetrazzini." "little Tetrazzini'"
Perhaps I did not quite expect pinafores
when t went to chat with the little prima
donna the other day the day after her
triumphant farewell performance. In
deed, Tetrazzini looked almost grown up
as she came into the room, wearing a
warm, red silk plaid waist and cheerful
brown skirt. To settle a moot point, here
to say that Tetrazzini's hair is a. fine,
warm Florentine gold, edited perhaps, but
by an excellent editorâ Seraphina, most
likely, the dark-eyed and very competent
young waiting-woman. Most pathetically,
as she sat down, the little diva's head
went to one side, the eyes drooped and
the corners of the mouth went down. She
was so tired, she said. There was the
Chronicle fire â oh! she had watched it
'until 2 o'clock, terrible!â there was 'su
much excitement at the theater last
night; and the fireworks, zip' zip! zip!
made her so nervous. Ah, Tetrazzini! A
minute afterward the eyes were dancing,
the mouth all mirth, the hands making
all sorts of fun of my Italian. But I had
duly sympathized, and like other chil
dren she had forgotten the play. Tired!
She does not know the meaning of the
word.
The interpreter, the obliging Mr. Tosi,
had brought with him a new photograph
of the singer. Critically she regarded it,
decided that she did not look so "stu
pida," said it was very fineâ if you cut
â¢ iff the head: all with the utmost good
nature, "t was then she told me* with
great horror, that she had heard some
people say "ha! ha! ha!" when they had
Keen the big fire the night before. She
thought it was perhaps because the
Chronicle had been "against of Schmitz?"
of whom Miss Tetrazzini is an ardent
supporter
â¢All night I did not sleep." she told
me. "looking at my window until the
finale. I saw first, puff, puff, then great
rta meâ terrible, terrible!"
"After all the excitement before," I
rubscribed; "but you are not nervous."
Not nervous! Tetrazzini laid claim
then to enough nerves to satisfy the most
exacting American woman. Oh, yes, she
wa^ nervous, and the firecrackers last
Bight made her very nervous. In the
mad scene now, didn't I remember?
Clinking with laughter, she stood up to
this, and alternately sang and spat,
â¢Edgurdo, Edgar-rdo. mio"'â pt! pt! ut!â
â¢Vplendido sarrificio"â pt! pt! pt!â"Ed
gar-rdo'âpt:â"ah phantasma"â pt! pt!
jjt: All, she was very nervous!
"Was that why you did not sing the
â¢Home. Sweet Home?' " I asked. I knew
:hat she had practiced the song with an
industry that threatened the largest ol
vl..- Patti laurels.
"No, no," she laughed, "it was the pro
nunciation The 'publico* would say "Te
trazzini no -good, no fine/ " She -was
afraid. Oh, but she was so happy last
night. Would I not please tell the public
how much she loved them. Especially
the ladies. They had flung "violetti" all
over her. Kiss them for her. And after
the performance many people had come
te kiss her hands. They said "No, good
by. Tetrazzini. no good - by." Never,
never, would she forget.
"Ah yes, you will, when yotr go to New
York." I protested.
"No, never," she vowed.
"Perhaps I do not go to New York,"
Eaid Miss Tetrazzini then. "It is like
this"â she balanced her hands like a pair
of sciUesâ "New York. Mexico; New York,
ilexico."
Many people* had told her not to go to
New York. It was not at the Metropoli
tan as at the Tivoli. one fine family.
Forefingers jabbing at each other ex
pressed Tetrazzini's idea of the family re
lations at the Metropolitan.
"Ah, Mr. Goerlltz, idiot; when ho
brought the contract to me to sign Iw
paid: 'You are not & 15-year-old child.,
'uecause some of it I wanted changed.
Never was I so insulted in my life." Te
trezzinl's eyes narrowed here and her
lips tightened In the only serious moment
of the chat. "I threw my shoe at him,"
the added, Jerking her head like 'a. vicious
cmaiy. Her. sense cf having done the
r!ght thing was nothing short of ador
able. * I'VvA
I sympathized with hrr against the
vrptrhed Gocrlitz and asked if it were a
Tetrazzini thoe she had thrown. She had
before told me, beaming, that she had
i< en a "Tetrazzini" shoeâ very "piccolo,"
very bella, sure!â ln a shop window. In
a 'moment she forgot the tragedy, but a
moment later returned to It.
At the Metropolitan was it not this
way. so she had heard? "Eames"â up
went the forefinger; "Scmbrich" â the
middle finger: the rim? finger to "Nordi?
ca"; "M>;ba" next, to the little finger:

In the contract tlie Â«."oniird manager had
not eaid whui roles shi should sing.
They had said "Rigoletto"â but not Gllda

reliability of Meinherr Conried. But all
is fair in love and war. .They want Te
trazzinl very btdly down in 'Mexico. There
she has suns, and there she has left a
trail of adorers San Franciscan In size.
They know that if Tetraszini gats to New
York she will not return^ to Mexico.
Therefore with ferocious pictures of opera
as she is sung in New York some one has
taken care to supply her. Child-like,' she
believes. Still, she may go to New, York.
She has artistic ambitions, that perhaps
Mexico, with its demand for "La Paloma"
as encore to a "Fcrs c Lvi," can hardly
supply. In four days l'avvocato would
tell her if she must go. On November 22
the opera season begins. Â»
"She had sung with Caruso?" I reverted
then. - ':' : 'TV,
"Yes, in 'Rigoletto,' 'Lucia," 'Travia
ta,'." she told. me. "He is a great artist."
Dinorah is her favored role. "It is mol
to difficile," she cried, very hard to be the
little mad girl. "It is not madness like
Lucia's, tragic" (a suggestive elk! and a
stab at her bosom illustrated), '.'but like
Ophelia, pretty, simple, thinking of her
flowers and sheep." â¢'
Norma, she says she can singâ behind
the scenes it is the joke that Tetrazzini
sings everything. She booms bass with
Dado, turns a barytone fling . with Gre
goretti, tops the crest of the chorusâ
and then talks of being tired! But "they
would laugh if she sang Xorma." She
is too little. Aida, too, she can sing. But
they would say. "te! te! te! te! oh, fine!
baby!" if she tried to sing big role like
that. Â» .'
"I prefer the lyric, of course," she said.
"Marta I love, Julietta too, and oh, but
much I want to sing Susanna ('The Mar
riage of Figaro'), and Zerlina ("Don Gio
vanni'). Perhaps Mozart is the greatest
after all." . v â¢
By the grace of God Tetrazzini sings.
Six. months enly did this wonder
ful little woman study,' with one
Giuseppe Ceccherini. That was in Flor
ence, where she was, born. Her debut. she
made there at 19 years of age, as Inez in
"L'Africaine." "Didn't know the role at
all," she laughed: But there is a broad
brow not unlike a Beethoven's above Te
trazzini's golden brown eyes, and one can
imagine her initial Inez not unworthy.
Musical also is the family ! Tetrazzini.
Proudly she dragged out a Milan musical
paper, with under the "Maestri dl- Canto"
Elvira Tetrazzini, arid elsewhere the
name of .Eva Tetrazzini-Campaninl. wife
of the distinguished conductor, and her
self a distinguished, musician.
v As I was coming away, Tetrazzini told
me that her wildest dream was of sing
ing Dinorah at a thousand dollars a night,
that she would be, quite satisfied with
that. But her last Injunction was a "big
thanks to San Francisco and to Mr. Leahy
for bringing her here"â "sure!"

Duchess of Roxburgh? Makes It a
Point to Cultivate Her Rela
\u25a0 tlves-in-Law.
LONDON, Nov. 11.â The Duchess of
Roxburghe had issued invitations for a
succession ; of house ' parties at Floors
Castle which were to have lasted over
Christmas,' but . owing ; to ' the \u25a0 sad >. death
of her sister-in-law,' Lady Isabel Wil
son;, they > have all been canceled. Like
the typical American .woman who mar
ries over here, the Duchess has the. ca
pacity of being always on the best of
terms with her husband's family. This
isVconsidered to be essentially a' gift
of -Jonathan's .daughters, and is ad
mired and marveled at in turn ; for as
a rule c fifteen . British women " out of
twenty 'make up, their minds to be dis
agreeable- to .their husband's relations.
The Duchess of Roxburghe is 'greatly
distressed over Lady: lsabel's death, for
theywere the closest of friends. When
Lady Isabel was married the presents
she received from' the Duchess were
said 'to .-be worth $25,000.
The -fact; that Floors Castle will be
practically closed for three or four
months, ' owing ;to the -. mourning, will
give .the ; architect ; an -opportunity of
completing the, renovations in the Nor
man; arches -'and broken . buttressed
choir. The "Duchess of Roxburghe,; be

DUCHESSE DE TALLEYRAND
DIES OF DISAPPOIXTME.NT
Never Gets Over Failure of What She
Planned a* Cronnlni; Triumph
of Her Life.
LONDON, Nov. ILâ That the Duchesse
de Talleyrand should pass over to the
great majority before her husband.
who for the last eight years has been
a \u25a0 hopeless paralytic, affords a strik
ing illustration of the irony of destiny.
The Duchesse never got over the mis
carriage of what she had fondly hoped
would prove the crowning triumph of
her life. That was the marriage of her
favorite and second son. Comte Boson
de Talleyrand to a rich American iirl.
Miss Helen Morton, daughter of Levl P.
Morton, â¢ former ' Vice President of the
United States. Her money, added to
that which the Ducbesse settled on the
Comte, enabled them' to revive the
glories of the historic Chateau de
Valancay. But, like many men of aris
tocratic rank, the Comte failed to rec
ognize that matrimony placed him
under certain restraints, according to
American notions, from which as a
bachelor he had bean free. The result
was that after two years his wife ob
tained a. divorce and returned to
America. .
, That would have caused the Dttcbesse
no great shock, had she left her for
tune behind her. But she took It
home with her and the loss of the lucre,
preyed so heavily on the Duchease that
â¢ she had a severe nervous breakdown,
followed by frequent recurrent attacks,
\u25a0which completely , sapped her vitality.
Her .wreck of a husband hated her.
This paralytic seizure deprived him of
allpower of speech save one word. It
expressed ' the most malignant dislike,
which her presence never failed to
wring from him. Apparently It was
that passion which keptlhim alive.
PARIS MANAGER BARS
CRITIC FROM THEATER
Declare* It Will Xot Be Safe < tor
Writer Who Vexed Him to Enter
. * House.
PARIS, Nov. 11. â An * Interesting
quarrel is at present being waged be
tween M. Antolne, the well-known the
atrical manager. \u25a0 and M. de Nlon, the
dramatic critic of the Echo de Paris.
The critic has been barred from M.
Antoine's .threater as, a result of sev
eral articles which \u25a0 M. de Nion wrote.
In these the critic spoke of the theater
in. terms which displeased the man
ager. When the time. came for M.,An
toine to produce hi 3 first piece this
season he intimated to M. de Lion that
tickets would not be sent to him for
any of ' the . performances. Asked to
explain his action. M. Antolne replied:
"In refusing to issue an . Invitation
to M-.de Nion to. visit my theater I
have acted as a commercial man- The
house. Antolne & Co.. has taken, as it
had: a right to do. a measure of secur
ity which Is necessary to a firm." It
was suggested -to M. Antoine that the
dramatic critic might pay for his seat
and still write an account of the play
for his paper.
Vl. would deny ljim permission.'* said
M. Antoine. "If he entered the theater
and wrote, even eulogistically, of my
piece, he would do so at his own risk.
A theatrical manager is master of hU
own house, to which he invites who
ever, pleases him. ,It is a question of
commercial responsibility."
Blame the Radium Ray:*.
- GENEVA. Nov. 11. â The parents of a
young girl from Morzine have begun
suit against the' Geneva Hospital,
claiming the death of their daughter
by- subjecting her too long to radium
rays while endeavoring to relieve her
of a cancerous tumor. . ,
The hospital authorities will call sev
eral famous Paris and London special
ists on radium treatment to testify in
their behalf, and medical men here and
elsewhere look forward with great
interest 'to the outcome of the suit. .

THE DEBUTANTE
OF TO DAY
The debutante as we know her in the
year of our Lord 1905 is the product of
social evolution, as is wireless telegraphy
of the physical world, suggestive thera
peutics of the mental, and Browningism
of the spiritual.
Unlike her motherâ who courtesled to so
ciety, cay, a quarter of a century agoâ
this modern maid has a definite person
ality. She dresses her hair, plans her
clothes, formulates her type of language
âparticularly her expletives and her
Blangâ according to her own particular
personality. And in these thingsâbar
ring the slangâ she has been encouraged
in her fashionable school or college,
where personality Is nurtured as the sole
element that saves society from paralyz
ing stupidity. And by the quality and
quantity of her personality is the popu
larity of the debutante measuredâ yes, In
finitely more than by her mere beauty.
Now, all this is contrary to the plans
and specifications upon which her mother
\u25a0was educated.
According to the old regime, that had
its origin in the fashionable schools of
yesteryear, when our grandames were
wooable, "deportment" was the funda
mental object of the school curriculum.
And that "deportment" was acquired by
rote, even as were the "accomplishments"
of arithmetic, grammar, geography, em
broidery and "hand" paintingâ as distin
guished from that which might be done
by the feet or the teeth.
Thus the "deportment" - so acquiredâ
this external expression of "manners"â
leveled all to a bell-sheep similarity
of conduct, destroying, for the time,
the natural expression of personal
ity. Fortunately, after a few years'
seasoning in society, away from the crit
ical censoring of the schoolroom, the
strongest elements of individuality reap
peared.
In the old days when the daughter of
the house was about to make her cute
little courtesy to society she was fluttered
and frightened as a baby sparrowâ for
might not something happen that
wouldn't fit any of the "rules of conduct"
she had been taught so laboriously?
Thus this Buperflciality of training
brought woe to the poor little debutante,
whose own personality was rubbed down
to the dead level of the commonplace,
and whose natural intelligence and * ebul
lition of spirit would have saved her grief
In social crises.
But blessings on the debutante of to
dayâche is herself, pre-eminently her
selfâfreed from the old-time interroga
tory slam, "Why don't you actâ or talkâ
or walkâ or dress like Mary Jopes?"
She does these things exactly the way
ebÂ« wishesâ and bo may Mary Jones.
This independence of thought and ac
tion, particularly amVmg Western maids.
Is directly a result of a growth of natur
alism, with a corresponding' contempt for
shamâ which is but another term for the
old-fashioned "manners," where only the
tongue, and not the heart and head, was
under training. Generally speaking, the de
butante is sincere, natural and well poised;
she preserves her individuality, and he>r
head and her heart direct her attitude,
her words and her actions. And thus
does she ring trueâ this dear, dashing,
daring little maid of the West.
And blessings on her for her sincerity
of character! Bhe is what she seemsâ
be it angel or devil! or something of both!

COLLINS RESUMES ARGUMENT
TO SET ASIDE IXDICT3IEVT
Advance* Two New Poiata In Attack
on Grand Jury- and Continuance
!â¢ Ordered.
The argument on the motion of
George D. Collins to set aside the In
dictment charging him with perjury
was resumed before Judge Lennon in
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday. Col
lins advanced two new points. He
argued that the box from which the
names of the grand jurors had been
drawn had been stuffed. In support of
that argument he filed a copy of the
reporter's notes of the proceedings be
fore Judge Kerrigan at the lmpanel
ment of the Grand Jury.
His other point was that the last
Legislature had repealed the laws gov
erning grand Juries and passed a new
law which went into effect on April 1
last, but no provision was made re
garding any grand Juries between the
repeal of the old laws and the com
ing into effect of the new law. There
fore, he contended, the Grand Jury
which indicted him had no legal exist
ence.
As it was impossible to get any trace
of the the order of the Judges for the
formation of the Grand Jury it was
decided to continue the case till next
Wednesday to give the District Attor
ney ample time and opportunity to
eearch for the order.

ACTION TAKEN AGAINST TWO
YOUTHS OUT OX PHO NATION
Oae Sentenced to Serve - Three. Years
and the Other Will Be Dealt
With In March.
Judge Dunne- had two cases before
him yesterday in which the defendants
had been allowed to go on probation
and had fallen again into criminal
ways. John Nelson had pleaded guilty
in June, 1904, to a charge of burglary
for entering the room of Edward Rol
klns in the Winchester Hotel and was
allowed to go on probation on his
promise that he would leave the State
forever. He went to Australia in a
sailing vessel, but returned recently
and began to associate with evil com
panions. He was arrested and yester
day the Judge sentenced him to serve
three years in San Quentin.
Louis Delnari was allowed to go on
probation after pleading guilty to a
charge of robbery in November, 1904.
He and George Batteate held ud a num
ber of people at North Beach. Bat
teate was convicted and sentenced to
serve eight years in San Quentin. The
arrests were made by Detectives.Bun
ner and Freel and yesterday they in
formed Judge Dunne that Delnari was
serving a sentence of eighteen months
In Folsom penitentiary for burglary in
Fresno under the name of Louis Burns.
The Judge instructed the officers to ar
rest Delnari on his release from Fol
som next March and bring him into
court, when setence would be passed
upon him on the robbery charge. The
Judge waa indignant that the proba
tionary officer had not notified him of
Delnarl's fall from grace.

During: the month of December there
will not be any drills in the. armories
of the, National Guard of California
and there is little, else i doing. From
the inactivity that haslbeen manifest
in the last few weeks Jt, looks as if the
members ot ' the several ; organizations
are preparing for, the coming- vacation.
A few evenings rsiuee Companies *B
and C of the ',First : Battalion of Coast

clusively for the'- old-time and new
members of the organization. At the
close of the supper there was , the' pre
sentation of a valuable gold, watch to
Captain George Petty of Company C in
appreciation of | what . he ' has done: for
; the organization since he has been con?
nected with- It, and there was presented
to Captain William .T.~ Grattan of Com
pany B a handsome parade sword as a
token of esteem from the members. of
his company, I
Colonel Wilhelm, inspector on the
staff of the commander in chief, has
prepared a new set of â¢ rules and " regu
lations for the guard and the .same are
no w " in the hands of the adjutant gen
eral of the State, .who.will shortly Is
sue them for the guidance of those
most interested. These are to replace
the "red book,", of which Brigade In
spector Major. J. W. F. Diss said.: "It
is a source of perturbation to . officers
arid men. .Of all combinations of -mis-'
information ! the rules and regulations
of the National Guard of California^
commonly known as 'the red. book,'
this is unquestionably the worst; It Is
a complete, compendium of military in
accuracy, supplemented by a >mass of
obsolete and useless precautions and
rules and regulations formulated by
successive adjutant generals and added
to -what there was before' they, came
Into office.' On every seven out of ten
pages there are rules ~ prescribed for
guidance, which are diametrically op
posed to the regulations of the army of
the United States, which should be; the
rule of conduct, as far as practicable."
The new rules have been thoroughly
revised by Colonel Wilhelm, who is a
retired United States army officer, aud
he has seen to It that they are in con
formity with the rules and regulations
of the army, so far as they are. ap
plicable to the National Guard and that
they are within the laws of the State."
On the first Sunday in the current
month the First Regiment of .Infantry
went to the range at Glen Park to fin
ish its State shoot at the new 300-yard
range. The range was all right, but
the wind was so fierce that none of the
men could make a. good score.
The officers and members of Company
B of the Fifth went to the range of
Company I of Llvermore to finish their
scores, but there the wind Interfered
with the possibilites.for a good show
ing at the targets. '. -"
First Lieutenant- A. *W. \Foater Jr..
battalion adjutant of the Fifth.lnfan
try, has tendered his resignation. It is
said that there is not that military
entente cordial c between the colonel
of the regiment and many of the of
ficers which should exist and that quite
a number of the latter will ask to be
relieved from active duty by resign
ing.
Major J. P. Dunn of the Hospital
Corps of the Fifth has asked to be
placed on the retired list.
Lieutenant C. L. Hewes, adjutant on
*the staff of Brigadier General Koster,
has on account of business engage
ments gone to Seattle, where he will
probably remain for an indefinite
period. Major Jones Is fllling his place
on the staff.
An election has been ordered in Com-
I of the Fifth Infantry, located at
Llvermore, to .fill the vacancy caused
by the resignation of Captain Mc-

OUTPUT AND PRICES.
MENTION has been made of the rise in wages followed by; a
rise in the cost of living. The reports of the Federal Labor
Bureau shows that rents and the other elements that enter
into the cost of living have -advanced close upon the advance in
wages. There are certain economic laws from which no organiza
tion of men can escape. If advance" in wages meant increase in
'output, the wages would keep far ahead of the cost of living. But
it has been made to mean a decrease in output, and the result is
'â¢that prices are close to wages and in some cases overtake them.
When a bricklayer's wages are doubled and he lays only half as
. many bricks as before, the limitation of output finally works through
: jnany mutations until it strikes at the cost of food, fuel and rents.
In this country we have had two causes apparently antagonistic
but working in economic harmony to the same end, and that end
- â¢ is a rise in the cost of the necessaries of life. On one side is the
reduction of output of products by labor and on the other the trust
. control of such products as it monopolizes. Its control has been
made easier by the limitation of production. The effect would not
be as generally felt if .superior skill in workmanship were differen
tiated from inferior skill and permitted to get its superior reward.
In the last analysis labor is rewarded according to its productive
power. The skiflful man, permitted to freely enjoy his greater earn
ing power, finds that his wages command more of the necessaries of
life than those of the less skillful. But when all are compelled to
take the same wage and all are compelled to the same limitation of
output, all share in the disadvantage of the increased cost of Jiving.
Against inflexible economic law there are men who continually
insist that the remedy for increased cost of living is the further
limitation of output. Hundreds of thousands in this country be
lieve in this remedy when it is proposed to them, and adopt it to
their further undoing. The owners of the products which are the
necessaries of life watch this process with keen eyes. They know
. that limitation of output means scarcity, and that scarcity means
higher price, and whenever they can they demand prices in prospect
of the threatened scarcity.
If the rise of wages were under such conditions as to connect
it with the increased output, it would far outrun any resulting in
' crease in prices. Especially would this be true in the case of work
men of superior skill. Their example would incite all men of their
trade to acquire the same degree of skill in order to get its higher
\ reward. Their output would increase with 'wages, and prices of
products would move upward but little.
When the operation of economic law is better understood there
-. will be less tendency to consider wages merely in the number of
dollars earned in a day, but in their purchasing power, and then the
relation between output and price will be better understood. In the
discussions of our economic policy and in comparison of wages
here and abroad, too little attention has been given to the purchas
â¢ ing power of wages. If 25 cents a day wages in China purchase as
much of the Chinese necessaries of life as can be bought of the
American necessaries of life with $3 a day here, the two wages are
equal, because they command the same amount of the necessaries of
life required by their respective earners.
Looked in the face it seems a very complicated problem. But
the elision of some of its factors and the readjustment of some
others will make it plain. Large output means increased supply
and increased supply means prices stationary. . Small output means
decreased supply and prices rise. Unfortunately it, is a problem
attractive to those who look at it superficially and consider the in
terest of only one section of the community.' If all? will learn to
measure the wages of labor by their command of the necessaries
\u25a0 of life, then it will be seen that such wages and such output as
command the most of those necessaries are the best wages. In
other words, the true measure of wages is not in dollars but in food,
clothing, fuel and rent.
In spite of our blunders and our sad differences and wrangling,
i' American wages still command more of the necessaries and com
forts of life than wages anywhere else in the world. When we better
* understand and more faithfully obey unchangeable economic laws
the present situation will be greatly improved upon and conditions
now portentous will be canceled out.
GEORGE BERNARD SHAW /has been scintillating again.
He is nothing if not spectacular. He goes off this time like
a blazing comet in comment on the recent suppression by the
police department in New York of his play, ".Airs. Warren's Pro
fession," which Arnold Daly tried to produce there after immense
cost of preparing its staging. He has shot his comet of criticism at
all America, but incidentally he gets a carom lick at Comstock, presi
dent of the Society for the Suppression of Vice. .We may deny the
wisdom of Shaw, we may doubt the excellence of his ethics, but it
would be inhuman not to acknowledge his wit. In his latest pyro
tcchnical interview he has shot at the American nation and aimed
a dazzling shaft at Comstock â these may go wide of the mark, but
the thing he has done to Arnold Daly is a most palpable hit.
The London correspondent showed Shaw the / telegram intimat
ing that his play was Â£0 be suppressed. Whereat the brilliant Irish
man's wits go off instantly thus: "You tell me Anthony Corn
stock threatens to put Arnold Daly in prison if he produces 'Mrs.
W r arren's Profession,' and ask me what I have to say. Do you
remember the classic telegram sent by Lord Clanricarde to his
tenants in Ireland? 'If you think you can intimidate me by shoot
ing my agent you are much "mistaken/ Let them imprison Daly by
all means. A few months' rest and quiet would do Daly a great deal
of good."
Then he aims this at the president of the S. S. V.: "It is con
cluded that Comstock's mind is in such a condition of crystal purity
that any American who reads, sees, writes or. says Anything of
which he disapproves or which he is 'doggoned if he understands,'
must be put in prison."
That is of course harking back to the incident some weeks ago
when a New York reporter asked Comstock what he thought of
Shaw's saying that marriage is the most licentious thing there is.
The dignified president of the Society for the Suppression of Vice
dared not hazard a judgment, but replied he'd "be doggoned if he
knew what Shaw meant by it."
Shaw's present pose is that we Americans are too dull to know
what he meant in "Mrs. Warren's Profession." He claims that the
reason for the being of that play is that bad men pay women well
for being evil and show them some affection, while pious men pay
women infamously little for being good. The playwright's plea i 3
that he and Arnold Da,ly are appealing to the good sense of people
who want to have the traffic in women stopped instead of. concealed
underground. But, alas, even if the playwright were sincere in this
case, he has in creating his literary style so confused his ethics in
an erratic striving for brilliance that no one can trust he is not
posing. When he professes to be fighting sham we can never be
sure .that he is not himself shamming.
THE ARMY CANTEEN.
- Â»
TT is evident that Congress must again take up the question of
I the army canteen. When it had been for some time in operation
\u25a0*â¢ it was condemned by the prohibitionists on the ground ' that it
permitted use of light vinous and malt liquors laid-rthe foundation
of an appetite for distilled and highly alcoholic beverages. To this
risk the young recruits were supposed to be exposed. This -view
was supported by Generals Miles and Wheeler- and other old army
officers. It seemed to the advocates of the canteen, however, that the
young recruits were exposed to far worse conditionsin the low sa-

A TENDERFOOT come toilin' into Dobbins' Camp one day,

GREAT FEAT
OF A FAMOUS
WOLF HUNTER
IN a couple of miles I was close enough
to see what was going on. But one
greyhound was left with Abernethy.
The coyote was obviously tired, and Aber
netliy. with the aid of his perfectly trained
horse, was helping the greyhound catch
it. Twice he headed it. and this enabled
me to gain rapidly. They had reached a
smalTunwooded creek * by . the . time I was
within fifty yards; the little wolf tried
to break\back 'to the left; Abernethy
headed it and rode almost,, over,
it,' and it gave a wicked snap at
his foot/ cutting the boot. Then he
wheeled and came toward it; again it gal
loped j back* and just as it* crossed the
creek the greyhound made a rush, pinned
if by the hind leg and threw It. There
was a scuffle, then a yell from the grey
hound &s- the wolf bit it. /
At the bite the hound let go and jumped
back a few feet, and at the same moment
Abernethy,' who " had ridden his horse
right on them as they struggled, leaped
off and sprang on top of the wolf. He
held the reins of the horse with one hand
and thrust the other, with a rapidity and
precision even greater than the rapidity
of the wolf's snap, into the wolfs mouth,
jamming his hand down, crosswise be
tween the jaws, seizing the lower jaw and
bending It down so that the wolf could
not bite him. He had a stout glove on
his hand, but this would have been of no
avail whatever had he.not seized the ani
mal just as he did; that Is. behind the
canines, while his hand pressed the lips
against the teeth; with his knees he kept
the wolf from using Its fore paws to
break the hold, until it gave up strug
gling. When he thus leaped on and cap
tured this coyote it was entirely free, the
dog having let go of: It: and he was
obliged to keep hold of the reins of his
horse with one hand. I was not twenty
yards distant at the time, and as I leaped
off the horse he was sitting placidly on
the live. wolf, his hand between its jaws,
the-greyhound standing beside him, and
his horse standing by as placid as he was.
In a couple of minutes For tescue and
Lambert came up. It was as remarkable
a feat of the kind as I have ever seen.â

TWAINONHAY'S
PIKE COUNTY
BALLADS.
IN his article in tho North American
Review Mr. Howells expresses uncer
tainty In a matter concerning the
Ballads In the following remarks:
"It was contemporaneously supposed
that the Pike County Ballads were in
spired or provoked by the Pike County
balladry of Bret Harte, and they were
first accepted as imitations or parodies.
I believe they were actually written
earlier, but If they were written later,"
etc.
They were not written later, they
were written (and printed in news
papers) earlier. Mr. Hay told me this
himself â In 1870 or 1871, 1 should say,
I believeâ indeed I am quite sureâ
that he added that the newspapersjre
ferred to were obscure Western back
woods journals, and that .the ballads
were not widely copied. Also, he said
this: That by and by, when Hartes
ballads began to sweep the country the
noise wok* his (Hay's) buried waifs,
and ' they rose and . walked. I think
that that detail is interesting, now. It
oompels one to realize to oneself the
difficult fact that there .was a time
when another person could advertise
John Hay Into notice better than he
could do it himself. Hay made men
tion of the current notion that he was
an Imitator; he did not enlarge upon
it, but he was not better pleased by It
than you or I would be.
He was aware that I had been a Missis
sippi pilot, and he asked me if he had '
made any technical errors In the "Prairie
Belle" ballad, and said he wanted to cor
rect them If any existed. There was one
very slight one, but it could not have
been corrected without dividing the hero
ism between two persons, and that would
have spoiled the poem; so Hay left it as
It was.
It is -true that "in later life he wished
people would forget the Ballads," for he
said the equivalent of that to a friend of
mine before 1880; but at the time of which
I , have, been sr>eakingr they had not yet
become an Inconvenience to him by ob
structing his road to a graver fame. It
was another case of "Heathen Chinee."
When Harte was editing the Oveland, and
moving gradually and confidently along:
toward a coveted place in high-grade lit
erature, an accident happened, one day,
which blocked his progress for a time:
the. office boy brought an urgent call for
â¢'copy" to' fill a vacancy on the eve of
going to press, and Harte. for lack of
anything more to his taste, flsbed his H.
C. ballad out of the waste basket where
he had thrown It, and gave it to the boy.
Harte' 3 reputation had been local, before;
in a single day the Heathen Chinee made
it universal. Then the Eastern world
called for more Chinee, and was frantic
to get it.
Harte tried to appease it with higher
literature, and got only censure In re
turn, and reminders that he was wast
ing his time upon a sort of work which
was out of his line and above his abil
ity. He told me these things long aft
erward, and still showed a bitter ana
hostile -feeling against that ballad, be
cause It had stopped his lofty march
when he was making such good prog
ress, and had remained stubbornly in
his road so long that he had begun to
fear that he would never get a start
again. Then relief and rescue came
at last, and the "Luck of Roaring:
Camp" blasted the "Heathen Chinee"
out of the way and opened the road.
I always recall that talk with Hay
with pleasure, not only for its ova
sake, but because it was Incidentally
the occasion of my getting acquainted
with Horace Greeley. a man whom (\u25a0
greatly admired and longed to see. an.l
whose memory I still revere. It wti
difficult to get an Interview with him,
for he was a busy man. he was irascible
and he had an aversion to strangers;
but I hot only had the good fortune to
meet htm, but also had the
great privilege of hearing him talk.
The Tribune was In its early horn*
at that time, and Hay was a leader
writer on its staff. I had an appointment
with him, and went there to look him up.
I did not know my way, and entered Mr.
Greeley's room by mistake. I recognized
his back, and stood mute and rejoicing.
After a little he swung slowly around in
his chair, with his head slightly tilted
backward and the great moons of his
spectacles glaring with Intercepted light;
after about a yearâ though It may have
been less, perhapsâ he arranged his firm,
mouth with care and said with Tirile in
terest:
"Well? What in the hell do you want?"
So I think It must have been in IS7O or
â¢71 that I had the talk with Hay about
the ballads, because both he and Mr.
Greeley were doing editorial duty on the
Tribune in those years.â Mark Twain, in
Harper's Weekly. ,â
ROOSEVELT'S VISIT.
If anything were needed to obliterate
the last trace of sectional feeling in "the
South. President Roosevelt's visit has
done the work. The splendid hospitality,
characteristic of Its people, with which
the South received the President, has
made a profound impression on the entire
country. That It Impressed the President
most deeply ' is evidenced by the elo
quence and earnestness with which
he recognized -it in all his speeches.
If any one had said twenty â yes,
even ten years ago that a Re
publican President, speaking in the capi
tal of "Virginia, would pay a glowing trib
ute of admiration to General Lee and
"Stonewall" Jackson and to the brave
men who fought under these immortal
leaders in the bloody* "sixties," he would
have been regarded as a fool or a fanatic.
But President Roosevelt. In his speech at
Richmond, did not hesitate to proclaim
the gospel of hrotherhood and affection
between the North and the South. Hia
thrilling tribute of admiration was patil
to the bravery alike of those who wore
the blue and the gray. No one could more
fitly address the people of the South In
this strain than the President, whose own
mother was a Southern woman, and two
of whose uncles were among the bravest
officers in the Confederate navy.â Leslie's

AND SOME OTHER
BOOKS.
IT IS NOT UNMIXED ROMANTIC
BEAUTYâ "The Loves of the Great
Composers,*' as written by Gustav
Xajobbc And yet there is romance in
the .thought that all the great cre
ators of music teem to have been in
spired to do their finest work by their
love for women. Seven of them have '
their 1.-#vo affairs intimately told in the I
little volume. The most romantic and !
beautiful is that of Chopin, which was j
an '.iii<.onsi]ii:malod,paÂ£f!on. The least'
beautiful is that of Liszt, which was |
fulfilled by liaison. Very curiously the ]
special one of Wagner's loves which is j
ihuson tor lliis collection is that wild
Cosirrsa. although in another book by
the same author v.c arc told that the
great inspiring: passion of Wagner's J
life was for Mathilda, the wife of his .
111 1 ienel. W'cFsendonlc. But let us take j
them serially: :
Mozart's romance was a quite regular J
i.r.d sirooth-liowjng affair with his wife, j
I ".">nstarÂ»eo, w ho was a charming woman, ",
.Hjd by her sweetness she greatly i
tmcothed the moodiness of Mozart and
vas beloved by him all his life. The i
beauty of the affair seems perfect so far ]
a* the great musician-lover is concerned: j
but, inasmuch as Constance married j
ii^ain after Mozart's death, the sift of J
woman's love that the gods gave him can !
hardly be called ideal. i
Bopthover; â¢oine? next, and his love
:s a had one. lie named the woman
'his immortal lovÂ«.." but he: never on
i-artta ro.ssfÂ»Â«<sed her. Unless his dream
of i'.iniortality come true his love was
:.:id will bÂ« only a dream. One day a
friend of Beethoven came unexpectedly
to his lodging and surprised him bind
ing ov*-r the portrait of a woman and
weeping. After his death the portrait
was found in an old chest, and with
'a a letter addressed to his "immortal
l-cloved." It "was long a secret who this
woman might be. and his biographers
have- made the erroneous guess that it
was the Countess Giulietta to whom be
B dedicated the famous "Moonlight
Sonata." It has been discovered that
the great musician was secretly en
gaged for four years to his â¢'immortal
bolovod." and she was the Countess
Therese yon Brunswick. He renounceu
her because he saw unhappiness for
both if he married her. Beethoven was
aware that he was uncouth, stricken
with deafness and had his bad half
hours. Therese's mother would have
thought his union with her daughter a
monstrous thing. This hopeless love is
supposed to have been the cause of the
L composer's melancholy. Therese. whose
portrait shows her to be a fine-looking
woman, loved the unfortunate Beeth
oven to the last, and she was burled
with her head lying upon a pillow made
of the immortelles which he was fond
of sending her â all of which she ro
mantically saved and sewed in a silken
pillow.
*"*llx Mendelssohn had a happy love
with his wife. Cecile. So happy were they
that the lover's eister, Fanny, used to
call Felix and his wife "their felicities."
Chopin was both unfortunate and for
tunate in that he loved the Countess Del
phine Potocka. who was the wife of an
other, and a pure woman. She allowed
him to ensoy her friendship, however, and
when he was dying she hurried from far
away to be at the bedside to bid fare
well: and there she sang to him some of
her sweetest music as he passed away.
Tho great composer was too weak to do
more than whisper when he opened his
t-\;es and beheld her .mere. His words
were: â¢â¢Therefore, then, has God so long
delayed to call me to Him. He wanted
to vouchsafe me the joy of seeing you."
\u25a0â¢ â¢> â¢â¢ Those at the bedside had sunk
noiselessly on their knees. Over the
mournful accompaniment of sobs floated
the voice of Delphine like a melody from
I heaven.
Schumann's life with his wife. Clara,
who also was a fine musician, was one
long >ove affair. "After their marriage
his inspiration blossomed under her very
eyes. She was the companion of his in
nermost thoughts and purposes."
Ltszt's love for the Princess Carolyne
Sayn-Wittgenstein is not a pleasant thing
to contemplate, nor is the picture of Car
olyne's face. To look at her features is
y to find a conn-mation and an intensiflca
r tion of the dislike with which the text
of her love for Liszt repels you. This
dislike is not due to Kobbe's manner of
telling her story, it is due to the ugly
truth that r.o biographical lenience can
quite gloss over. Kobbe seems to have a
good deal of Continental tolerance for lax
ity of morÂ«*2e. provided only the parties
to it were prominent enough to brazen it
out and cause people to toadily visit and
fraternize with them just because they
were famous. No doubt there are cases
of lawless romance which we can almost
pardon because the beauty of the rebel
lion contrasts so favorably with the ugli
ness of the convention from which' 1 it
broke away; and we are willing, at least
for a time, to let the loving parties to it
appeal their case to the higher law and '
await its immortal judgmentâ meanwhile
whispering to ourselves, "Judge not."
But when we read the text of this defi
ance of church and of society, and then
look u}>on the mouth of Princess Caro
lyne, which she contributed to coarsen
liy smoking big Havana cigars, we say
nay, nay, Carolyne, your plea won't go;
end it is blasphemy to the holy name of
love to put your illegitimate affair down
in a blue and white bound book called
"The Loves of the Great Composers."
I*ook at this little episode in the life of
the lawless lovers. If you want a fine
example of sentiment degenerated into
sentimentality, hers is It: "When Liszt
sat down at one of the two pianos, Caro
i lyfie drew an arm chair close op to it
X.. and seated herself expectantly, also with
one of the long Havanas in her mouth
and pulling delectably at it. â¢ â¢ After
the clorious *Gretchen' division of the
eymphony. the Princess sprang up from
â¢ the arm chair, caught hold of Liszt and
kissed him so fervently that we were all
deeply moved. (In the interim her long
Havana had gone out.)"
Fancy that for a sublime passion
scene between the musically lax mor
e'.ed Liszt and his para
mour! Actually dropped her dear, big.^
delectnble Havana cigar out of her
mouth in order to seml-publicly give
him that fervent tobacco-flavored kiss.
A mouth that was quite big enough to
have kissed " both her forsaken hus
band and her lawless lover, as the lit
tle girls say, simultaneously at the
same time. My. but she must have
been enormously enamored. And as
for him. oh, you blue heavens, the loves
of the great composers!
To more fully appreciate that sceDe.
which so*"deeply moved" too musicians
present, it is to be remembered that
Liszt had had another immoral "love"
affair with another married woman,
who had borne him three illegitimate
children. In the sweet hereafter Caro
lyne can at least put in a plea that
she did not Delilah-like be the first
currupter of her beloved Liszt â he was
cuite well-seasonedly spoiled before
. she got him.
Now listen to this. Kobbe says: "The
relations between Liszt and the -Prin
cess were frankly acknowledged, and
by the world as frankly accepted, as
If they were two exceptional beings
i in whom - one could pardon things
,\^ which In the case of ordinary mortals
v.-ould mean social ostracism." That
may be true of Continental customs,
and true of musician ism gone mad in
degenerate worship of srenius; but, oh.
,j._ . -
Gustav Kobbe, in the fair name of Pal
las Athene, do not let us pardon it in
literature. At least not in a case like
that of Liszt and Carolyne.
An amusing story about the other
mistress of Liszt, the one that bore
him the three illegitimate children, is
that when Liszt urged her to get a di
vorce from her husband in order that
she might marry the composer the
lady drew herself' up proudly, for her
abandoned husband was a Count, while
her beloved Liszt was untitled. She
assured him that being a Countess she
could never sink so low as to become
merely Madame Liszt. Kobbe . hits a
slam at French morals by commenting
thus: "Certainly none but a ' French
woman would have been capable of
-such a reply under the same circum
stances." '
Yet another rich one In this con
nection is the story about' the noble
Count, who was the acquiescent hus
band to this noble Countess' conduct;
"Equally French was her husband's re
mark when, the Countess' j . support
having been assumed by Liszt, he ex
pressed the opinion that throughout
the whole affair the pianist had - be
haved like a man of honor."
A person of a satiric turn of mind
and a taste for the material on which
to feed it could surely find immense
amusement- In studying typical irreli
gious love affairs. Some social phil
osopher has said something to the ef
fect that a fine gift of humor and a
keen sense for realizing, the ridiculous
would have saved many a woman from
folly where all the restraints of social
obligation, generations of family pride,
and the most solemnly strict Sunday
school or convent bringing up have ut
terly failed. No doubt if the keen critic
would search sleuthly for it there
surely must be enough of the con
temptibly ridiculous in nine-tenths of
all the irreligious passion arrange
ments that blaspheme by. calling them
selves love affairs to turn a humor
alive woman from the naughtiness of
it because of sheer dread of being
laughed at; although fear of law, hu
man or divine/ was never felt until, the
lash of mocking laughter sent her fly
ing for shelter to the high, white altar.
It was a queer lax crowd that the Prin
cess Carolyne mixed herself with to grat
ify her love of Liszt. Let us see how the
great composer, Richard Wagner, mixed
himself and his greatness with the same
musicianly great and morally little set
of law-defying emotionals. Wagner
comes next in the book's list of "the
loves of the great composers." Of his
three principal loves, the one for Cosima
is here given the place of honor. Cosima
was the illegitimate daughter of Liszt.
Remember her mother was the she who
would rather be a man's mistress and
keep her title of Countess than to become
a wife and be called merely Madame. So
you can hardly wonder that Cosima was
i willing to abandon her husband and be
come Wagner's mistress. Nor can you
wonder that Liszt gave. the girl to Wag
ner. Wagner himself says that Cosima's
husband was a fine young fellow ; and a
fit mate for Cosima. The couple were
guests at Wagner's house In their early
| married life, ' and again when he urged
them to return. The tale, in spite of all
the glamour of romance that is sought to
be thrown around it, seems like a double
blasphemy; first, of the sacred name of
friendship â friendship consecrated by hos
pitality given and accepted, and second,
i of the name of love when Cosima. left her
husband and went to live with Wagner,

summation it Is more satisfying to our
sense of the true romance of love to turn
back to the renunciation of stolen love
as exemplified by Chopin and the Coun
tess Delphine Potocka: "She was one of
those rare and radiant souls who could
bestow upon this delicate child of genius
her tenderest friendship, perhaps even her
love, yet keep herself unsullied and an
object of adoration as much for her
purity as for her beauty. "Because she
was Chopin's friend, because she came to
him in his dying hours, because along
paths unseen by those about them . her
voice threaded its way to his. very soul,
no life of his is complete without mention
of her, and in the mind of the , musical
public her name is irrevocably associated
with his."

TRUE SPIRITUALITY
IS ADLER'S THEME
The disposition of the religious man
to regard a man who is banking on the
favorable opinion of his fellow men,
and even basing/the hopes of his im
mortal welfare, on. the. good quality of
his ethics, as one over trustful of "mere
morality" must have often touched, . like
a stab of steel the sensibilities of Felix
Adler, the president of the Ethical Cul
ture Society.H>/If so there is a sentence
in his new book, "The Essentials of
Spirituality," which- might be taken as
a reply, to the users of the phrase" "mere
morality," and ; which shows a view of
ethics as something so high .that, it
completely merges; in religion. Adler
in summing up the leading thoughts of
his book: says:. "Spirituality is morality
carried out to â¢\u25a0 the finish."- Defining
morality" thus, the ;. most notable ex
ponent of, ethical culture in America
makes of morality something, more
than the mere humble handmaid of re- I
ligion or ; second cousin to spirituality.
It is a big. subjectâ that of the essen
tials of a savingsplrituality. Certainly
the church could- hot wholly indorse
Felix Adler's teachings. "Neither could
it indorse those of Matthew Arnold, and
his definition of ; the- difference between
religion and ethics was that "religion
Is morality touched by, emotion."
Whatever may be the ultimate re
sults of -a man divorcing his v ethics
from a union with what the church re^
gards as the essential dogmas, this
book of Adler's 'on; spirituality," in which
he "draws: the: thins -as he sees It for
the God of things as they are," may do
much good \u25a0by 'virtue .: of its beingrr of
wider, appeal to ; men ; than- would \u25a0> any
dogmatic teaching of the essentials of
spirituality; for under 'its comprehen
sive interpretation; -every .aspiring ,
soul might . take heart "of : hope, 4 be they
Christian, - Buddhist," agnostic or Jew.
If it be denied that this will "carry out
to the finish" of a quality .; of spiritual
ity that Is equal jto true soul salvation,
no one will r dispute that it -will , lift the
minds: of 'those , who read toward the
great goal.: ' V \.- :\u25a0\u25a0';: s . ,'.:\u25a0/. "_ :--.'s .-..-; ;i

LONDON TELLS OF
HIS ADVENTURES
Jack London's new. book of short sto
ries, "Tales of the Fish Patrol," consists
of narratives" of his adventures when' he
was a boy about 16 years of age, serving
as deputy. fish'patrol to police the waters
of San "Francisco Bay." He :had. a Uttle
sloop called the: Reindeer,' and as he 'was
skillful in handling it, and knew , thorf
oughly. all . the .coves., and hiding places
about the bay; the Fish Commission em
ployed, him to aid? in; the capture of; the
violators |of the fish S laws. v His pay was
in \u25a0 a percentage of the fines imposed ion
the convicted violators of the. law; and he
also had the "chance of capturing the re
wards that- were occasionally offered,- by
private parties. ;Tor a, boy i so adventur-r
ous as was Jack . London, however, the
best of the pay must have been in the
opportunities the occupation gave of per
ilous and excitlng : action! | ..The work re
quired, skill in boatcraft, strategy, gener
alship, and was spiced ..with danger. â¢
;It Is a book that will be very entertain
ing to' boys, and the fact that ; the
of the stories are on and "around our own
bay " gives the stories a local flavor that,
is sure to enhance'; the Interest in r ; them
here. .That; added to its being written by"
a \ favorite - local author, i will / cause ? the
collection to receive a- wide reading. Bach
of : tho stories has ' an illustration drawn
by George Varian. . .
As the, fisher craft that broke the laws
were virtually ;\u25a0â¢ pirates, the :â¢ very name
must have added much to the excitement
of the boys in thus daringly, hunting them
down. , â¢; One of ', the. stories \u25a0 is about the
Chinese shrimp fishers, who make j a spe
cialty of that â¢ industry round San- Fran
cisco Bay. As'the : Chinese boats operate
in' fleets it required a great deaj of nerve
in the â¢ boys to 'arrestrand bring in tha
offenders when they fished unlawfully. , ; ;
: - The other class" of fishermen \u25a0 aresprin
cipally Greeks',. and* London is; careful to
state ! that : they ; must not Â£be considered
as altogether a bad lot. They fare rough
merf,*? he says,> gathered \u25a0 together , in * iso
lated s communities - : and fighting with i thÂ©
elements ; for a' livelihood. v "They v lived
far away from , the law and its workings,
did . not understand " it, i and thought It
tyranny." So they ; regarded the men of
the â¢ fish patrol as their natural enemies.
One , of : , the 'â¢ exciting t stories is about v a
Greek I fisherman Uof this - type, > . named
Demetrlos Contos. V, He had an unusually
fleet boat and - was â¢a * fine sailor, 'i He de
fled the fish ' patrol;: more i by : way,i of^a
challenge ;to race than of ; j any - evil \u25a0. or

HOW THOUGHT
GROWS INTO ACTION
"Remember this: Thought tends to
take form in action, and mental pictures
tend to materialize." That is a sentence
emphasized by heavy type. in the chapter
on "How psychic pictures are made real
ities." in the little book called "Auto ?
Suggestion,".* by' Dr. Herbert A. Parkyn.
That physician and writer believes the
sentence is only another way of saying,
"As a man thinketh in his heart so he Is."
He believes more than that, to wit: "that
our thoughts or mental pictures, besides
-.- . . .; * ,'. - i*r \u25a0
Influencing ourselves mentally and physi
cally, . actually affect the people around
us, â¢ â¢ â¢ so subtly does the mind work
in its endeavor to, make our thoughts
realities." '
It seems scarcely necessary to . define
"auto-suggestion.". but as; our author di
vides tho wonderful thing into three va
rieties,>let;us get'at the meaning of the
divisions. Auto-suggestion means an im
pression made on one's self, or an Impres
sion arising within one's own mind. The
divisions "are: Voluntary. Involuntary,
and ther seemingly Involved one of "volun
tary involuntary auto-suggestion." Per
haps the ; easiest *to understand example
of ; auto-suggestion \u25a0 is the common expe
rience of a man impressing his mind with
the thought that he must rise at an early
morning hour. '- Many people can accom-,
plish* this auto-suggestion so perfectly
that the ; Impression .} will awake them
from a deep sleep ', as infallibly as an
alarm clock \u25a0 set Jto some unusual hour.
Salnt-Beuye -remarks \u25a0 that an example Is
always the r . best ; definition.; So now we
know "- what \u25a0it \ Is. This ! case Is one of
"voluntary^ ; auto-suggestion.
</A" case Of involuntary auto-sugges
tion is: that N of. a child's seemingly in
tuitive dislike of some .person of whom
he ; knows no Hl.-Its explanation prob
,abiy"ls ; .that" the, child; once noticed "a
man with fa r similar \u25a0face; do some un
kind thing or.' speak , a' harsh word. The
child i may, have , forgotten ; the \u25a0 incident,
but the resemblance. calls back the im
pression of disapproval; and so a kindly
man ' may, sometimes suffer-'dislike'be
cause'of the meanness of his double in
some distant city. It is a curious specu
lation to '-. wonder if this same explana
tion {would; not furnish a clew to that
familiar ," adult -experience' of:,- "I' do , not
like you,' Dr.: Grey; the reason why, , I
cannot "say; but I don't like you. Dr.
Grey." A ;-: :.: ;'::\u25a0 â¢ . .' " ' ...

at -the ? hour set," 'saying . himself, "I
am using this medicine. to calm rriy ner

night." " t This : often acts as so impera
tive .a command; to- the 'body that' it
j "obediently sleeps. ;
; This physician^ "grants c that well

organ "of â¢: . the\bod y- ; .
So much 1 for, a comprehension of what
the thing Is and bow it operates. Now
to get the practical good of our knowl
edge let us listen to the assurance of
a physician who claims to speak witu
the authority of many convincing ex
periences: "Learn to Influence the in
voluntary mind and yon can influence
yourself mentally and physically as
you desire, but the involuntary mind
must be reached through the voluntary
mind. Seek then to control the volun
tary thoughts."

LITERARY MOTES.
The death of Frederick Laurence
Knowles is a' distinct loss to American
letters. Not only was Mr. Knowles a
poet of decided gifts,, but he was a
critic who knew how to get the best
out of others. Only 35 years ot age. he
had still hi 3 life work before him. but
nevertheless he has left enough good
verse to keep his memory green. I
quote "Love's Awakening" as a worthy
example of his quality:
When Memory was a desert
And Life a dungeon wall.
When Hope became a harlft
That lured diÂ« to my fall,
When June had Jost its old perfume
And Poetry its glow â
There dashed a sensa at wlogs and bloomâ*
Ot joys that stir and grow!
The thorns became a chaplet
Upon my bleeding brow â
Night fled; the world was *unrisÂ«Câ
U dearest, it was thou".
â¢ â¢ â¢
And though 'tis still a marvÂ«lâ
The rapture and the wings â
My heart has learned the wonder.
Of love that serves and stnxs;
Xow 1 can welcome June a sain.
And watch her roses blow.
Once more i find the world or men
A conflict, not a show. i-p â¢\u25a0
From worse than death awakened.
Whence came the Â«*ll and bow?
Guild angel must have touched me â
Nay. darling, It was thou:

The lines of verse which serve as
chapter- headings in "The Trident and
the Net," by the anonymous author or
"The Martyrdom of an Empress." while
not intended in any way as a feature
of the novel, have attracted consider
able comment because of their unusual
and rather weird merit. It may be of
interest to know that these selections
were made by the author from her own
unpublished poems. The signature M.
M. refers to a pet nameâ Princess
Muzzi, Marie Muzzi â given her by her
friends.

There has been question among critics
and readers whether "The Long Day" 13
not the fruit of some experiment rather
than the unvarnished record of actual
facts. To a recent query on these polnt3
the author of the bookâ now a profes
sional woman in New Yorkâ answered em
phatically : vSS^^SwpÃ
"Every word in The Long Day* Is
true. Every character I have had occa
sion to draw, or even to mention casually
In the unfolding of my story, is some par
ticular woman, or girl, or man with
whom circumstances threw me Into more
or Jeas Intimacy during my long, hard
apprenticeship as a working girl in the
city of New York. The incidents are like
wise true even to the most trivial detail.
And my experience Is not a rare one."

LAN MACLAREN
TO WRITE AGAIN
Well Known Author Plans a
New Novel and Will Also
Produce Short Stgries
SOME GBEWSOME WORK
Evidence at Hand to Show
liiat Shakespeare Was Ac
quamted With
Special Dispatch to The Call.
| LONDON, Nov. 11.â Dr. John Watson,
or "lan Maclaren." has lost no time
after giving- up his church In Liverpool
last week, in seeking much needed rest
and recreation. The author of ''Beside
the Bonnie Brier Bush", and "Kate Car
negie," is now In Paris on his way to
Egypt, where he is planning to remain
for. live 'months or more." \u25a0 ;
"lan Maclaren" intends to return to
novel' writing shortly," and judging
from a private letter received from him
the other day, theflrst of his new ro
mances will differ considerably from
his previously nublisned u-Oiiv.e.
"Religion will play no part in my
new -s>iury," 01*. ..^ L si/Â»Â» ....!_.., vi.i:/
will there be any dialect worm xnon
tionirig. My idea Is \u25a0_ a historical ro
mance in which the central figure will
be Graham of Claverhouse, who was
used by Scott as a public *controver
tionalist, but who,never has been por
trayed in his romantic private charac
ter."
"Lan Maclaren" is also planning a
series of short stories, but they will
not be written for some time to come.
The announcement, that the. author, of
"The \u25a0 Bonnie Brier ' Bush" : is reiurning
to literary work has aroused uncommon
Interest among publishers here, and
some tempting propositions were made
to Dr. Watson just prior to his de
parture. '\u25a0 /\u25a0
STRONG RUSSIAN NOVEL
So far as can be. learned, no arrange
ments have yet been made for publish
ing in America an exceptionally grew
some Russian novel which is to appear
on this side of the water in a few days.
"The Red Laugh" is its rather striking
title, and the author, Leonidas And
reiefs, is one of the most promising ot
the younger; .Russian . writers. In
France where several of Aiidreiofs' ro
mances have been published, -"The Red
Laugh" is regarded' as not far behind
Tolstoy at .his best.
It is a study of the physchology of
war and is made. up of fragments from
the : diary of a young officer who }s sent
home from. the front. with his leg shot
off, and his mind affected- by the hor-.
rors he has witnessed.* He", descries,, it
is said, with remarkable' realism the
sufferings'and the ghastly^sights of the
campaign. One of, the -most horrible
instances is wjien lie sp'e&ks to a com-;
rade and asks him whether lie is afrajd;
the other smilesYwith an' effort, and at
that moment is struck in the face by a
shell and the smile "is seen through a
red mist; hence the title of the story.
The unfortunate writer of the diary
dies, and the journal is .continued by
his brother, who is also driven to mad
ness, partly by his brother's fate, part
ly by the news that reaches ; him from
the front. Often incoherent, -like the
words of a disordered brain, the book
is said to be one of the most; moving
things in recent. Russian fiction.
FOOTBALL. IN' OLDEN DAYS.
Apropos of the agitation; now going
on in America' for* making football
painless, an antiquarian gives the;rath
er surprising information that so long
ago as. the reign .of 'Edward' lll a stat
ute was enacted forbidding the game
on account of its brutality. Henry VIII
and* Elizabeth both legislated against
it, the latter punishing indulgence in it
by imprisonment. But the game flour
ished despite the fact that It. was under
the ban. of the law. That Shakespeare
was familiar with" It is shown by a
passage in "King Lear" In which Kent
says to Oswald, "nor â¢ tripped neither,
you base football player." Even
stronger is .the evidence furnished by
a passage in "The Comedyof Errors,"
where the Ephesian Dromiosays: .
''Am T so round' with you "aÂ» you with me
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
You tttiurn me hence, and he will sDurii me
hither. . i : :
If I laÂ«t in this service, you must ' case me
In leather." . Â» ' ;\u25a0\u25a0-- .â¢ ~\
-It was owing to the spread of.Puri
tan influence, more potent than legis
lation that-^the game began to decline
about the middle of the v' seventeenth
cenury. The revival of football and its
modern development in England as a
game fit for civilized \u25a0 . persons, came
through the public schools .which kept
it alive until the athletic frenzy of the,
nineteenth century took possession of
the country. ! '
GEORGE MEREDITH ' INJURED.
George Meredith's readers have spe
cial reason to feel regret over his re
cent severe fall, as during the last few
weeks the author of Richard Feveral"
has been engaged! in * fresh, literary
work, which he has /now had to lay
aside entirely. " Decidedly; the luck
seems: "to be against \u25a0 Mr;:. Meredith.

DISAPPOINTED
IN HER YACHT
Mrs. Turner Farley Fails to
Win as Many Eac'es as
Hoped For During Season
NOT IN BEST OF LUCK
Plucky English Woman Is
Discouraged, However,
and Will Try Again
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Nov. 1 1â Mrs. Turner Far
ley, , the -plucky English yachtswoman^
who got HSTrestioff to build her a rac
ing craft for .the fifty-two-foot ; race -In
these waters, is much disappointed
cause she has failed to realize: her ex
pectations of being able to hoist Tmore
winnings flags at the; close, of the sea-;
son than any of her competitors. /The
class furnished the keenest racing of
the season, and, although Mrs. "Farley's
boat, the Sonya, was beaten in most of
the contests, the margin "between her
and the winning boat was always a;
small one- and she .always had the
worst of the luck. v Mrs. Farley's conf
lldence in the Yankee designer is not
a. bit : shaken and she will race the
Sohya next year, she hopes, with bet
ter results. As a yacht is seldom tuned
up to her best; form the first season, it
is not improbable that she may come
out on top of her class next year.:
In â¢ years, past jHerreshoff has built
several yachts for English yachts
women J and they invariably showed a
clean pair' of. heels to . their competi-'
tors of British design.' But in build
ing/ for the fifty-two-foot class the
Yankee wizard was tackling; a harder,
task than has. ever been intrusted 'to.
him; by an English clientâ feminine or
masculine. He was hampered by rules
with which he was unfamiliar and
which had been expressly, devised. "to
bar racing machines pure and simple,
in the devSign of which Herreahoff has
always shown himself supreme. With
such shackles imposed on his genius
it; is ; not to be wondered at that he
failed to repeat his earlier triumphs.
But it won't be Mrs. Turner Farley's
fault? if he does not do the trick next
year and 'with the same boat.

ALAMEDA. Nov. 11.â Lost in tha fog:
in an open/boat on the bay, nearly
wrecked on Goat Island and almost run,
down by ferry steamers was the thrill
ing: experience last night of a party of
. young people; from this city who at
tended a ball at the Yerba Buena naval /
training 1 station. :
They succeeded in making: a landinff
at 1 the Oakland : mole ; early this raorn

In tow of a launch, had blindly voy
aged around' Goat Island and down the
bay south o,f the Alameda mole. When
the badly frightened passengers were
taken ashore they were benurooed,
; f rora exposure and two of the women
â¢were ill to-day as a result of the try
ing ordeal.-
Among/those who went through tho
perils of the trip were Mrs. Fred "Wag

and started for the Oakland mole,
I where, the. party, planned to catch a lato
; train for this city.
, - Dense fog. obscured the lights on the
slip.; but the .launch captain believed,
; that he could .make the landing safely.
! When the launch had been running for |
" half, an hqur it, dawned upon those In>
charge of the - craft that the course
had been lost. The next thing the voy
agers learned was that they were dan
gerously close to the west shore of
Goat Island, so ' close that -f the steep
banks could- be discerned In the thick

by,. and" lt 3 was only by! a few fee:. that
they missed colliding with the launcli
and its tow. ."
Through the hours of the night the
launch navigator floundered about In
the fog, unable to get his bearings and
fearing serious mishap at any moment.
The :\u25a0: party : . In A the cutter was scantily
protected from the damp and the chill
and" the misgivings they felt added
keenly:. to '.their discomfiture.

CONVICT MYRTLE APPLIES
FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
Judffe Lavrlor Asked to Issue Beach
Warrant for Burglar Who Escaped
From Courtroom.
Chief of Police Dlnan was notified
yesterday by the Los Angeles authori
ties that Chris Myrtle, who had been
sentenced to life Imprisonment from
that county about three years ago in
Folepm penitentiary, had applied to the
District Court of Appeal In Sacra
mento for a writ of habeas corpus for
bis release. As the application might
be successful, Dlnan was asked to get
Judge Lawlor to issue a bench war
rant for Myrtle's arrest on a charge of
burglary committed here.
Myrtle was convicted of burglary by
a Jury in Judge Lawlor's court on June
20, 1899, for breaking into the store of
F. A. Dunbar, 1346 Market street
While in the dock awaiting sentence
Myrtle slipped out unobserved and
made his escape. No trace of him could
be found till he was arrested In Los
Angeles for robbery and the burglary
case here -was placed on Judge Lawlor's
reserve calendar.
Judge Lawlor was notified yesterday
of the request of the Los Angreles au
thorities and said he -would take the

NIGHT PASSES WITHOUT STRIFE.
Military Patrols Guard Asalnst Out
break in the Czar's Capital.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 12, 3:20 a. m.-
The groundless nature of the alarmist re
ports that a St. Bartholomew massacre
would . take place last night was demon
strated when the - hours passed without
the slightest development of mob spirit
The only sign of anything out of the or
dinary was that the Jewish stores were
shuttered up earlier than usual in several
streets and localities which rumor as
signed as the scenes for looting and Jew
baiting. Students in uniform avoided
these quarters, and the frequent military
patrols Indicated that the authorities
realized the necessity of preventing any
outbreak in the capital.
An unconfirmed report was in circula
tion late last night in. the newspaper of
fices that Cossacks had tired on a crowd
of roughs in a suburb beyond the Moscow
gate, but this was later authoritatively
denied.
Prince Layoff, the Moscow Zemstvoist,
and one of the leaders of the constitu
tional Democrats, has issued a reassur
ing announcement declaring, that the ru
mors of organized "Black Hundreds"
were entirely myths.
. In an effort to pacify, the country and
end the fratricidal strife Count de.Witte
has enlisted the aid of the church, and
the Holy Synod, which Is now under the
direction of 'Prince Alexis Obolensky, has
Issued an encyclical which will be read
In' all of the churches of the empire In
place of the usual Sunday sermon. It
reminds Russians that wrath and hatred
often change the nature of men and make
them like wild beasts, 'forget the laws
of humanity and commit- crimes causing^
eternal remorse. i

of socialistic literature by "the Ameri

Charles W. Folk and Julia Ward Howe

' "James Branch Jr., a midshlmpan. sec
ond class, at : the United States
Academy, at- Annapolis, died about 10 a.
m., November 7.;.' V:~ . - ;'- ;\
"A board of inquest having : been duly
convened by order of Rear Admiral James
H. Sands, U.S. N.. superintendent- of the
>. aval Academy r and , senior officer pres
ent. In accordance with; the provisions of
articles 1775 and 1776 of the United States
Navy j Regulations, reported, under \ date
of November 8, as follows:- ; : / ;
" * Tl ? e board, f rom \ a view of the body
and from the evidence before It, is* of the
opinion that Midshipman James vH.
Branch Jr. died from the effects of inju
ries, received in a fist fight with Midship
man Minor Merriwether- Jr. This was
not occasioned -by any '. act 'of duty - in
which he was engaged.' \u25a0'. .-.
. "This report was approved by the con
vening officers. Prior to the death of Mid
shipman Branch a.\ board of investigation,
appointed under the provisions of article
1774 ( of I the United^ States Navy Regula
tions, ! had investigated and : reported the
circumatances preceding and attending the
conflict referred. to th the finding of thÂ«
board . of Inquest. : Briefly; stated, ,; these
circumstances were reported to the board
of investigation to be as follows: . .; â¢ -
"Some personal hostility.. had existed -for
some -time past ..between J Midshipmen
Branch and Merriwether." . .\u25a0 \u25a0 v
"Midshipman Branch in the T discharge
of his duty inspected the quarters of Mid
shipman ' Merriwether and is alleged ., to
have discovered - there a suit of civilian
clothes. .Possession ; of â¢ clothing:'. of this
character by midshipmen is a serious of
fense under the regulations gi the United
States Naval Academy.' No report- of -thijs
alleged , discovery, however, appears Â£p
have been made by Midshipman. BrancS.
Midshipman *\u25a0 Merriwethcr -subsequently
visited the quarters â¢ of Midshipman
Branch and became engaged in an angry
altercation.- with, the: latter .'on; the: subject
of his Inspection jof - Midshipman \ Merri

dispute- Midshipman â¢ Merriwether Is -al
leged to havo . : Insulted Midshipman

'sneak* . and \u25a0;, After consultation
with other : -midshipmen, -"Midshipman
Branch challenged Midshipman \u25a0 Merri
wether to a fist fight, and .the latter ac
cepted the challenge. -" \u25a0' . , ' \u25a0\u25a0'.
"The fight. took place on the evening of ,
Sunday, ] November. 5. It lasted r between
an hour and : an hour" and a quarter and
was.' finally declared a- draw by the ref
eree, having . been Interrupted by reason
of . the reported | approach '\u25a0 of one of ; the
officers. At the conclusion %of the j (en
counter Midshipman Merriwether. appear
ed to be the most seriously Injured' of the
two combatants and- , went, to ; the hospital,:
while Midshipman Branch,' whose injuries
seemed ; at first- superficial.' -went to ! his
quarters. A report made to the.superin
tendent of the United States Naval Acad
emy by the senior medical officer and also
the evidence taken by 'the- board of in
quest indicated that : Midshipman" Branch
received severe Injuries ,to his brain : as
the result ; either of 'blows on the head,
inflicted during the conflict, or of falls, of
which several are' said -to have occurred
while it was in progress.

THE NEW GOVERNOR
OF OHIO
!K Distinguished Legislator
and Life Insurance
Leader.
The selection on Tuesday of John M.
Pattison, a Democrat, for Governor of
Ohio, the stronghold of Republicanism,
is a remarkable incident In politics and
a wonderful mark of respect to the
man.
Ohio is notoriously a Republican
Btate, and from it have sprung many of
the nation's greatest leaders and more
Presidents than have been produced
from any other State of the Union..
Notwithstanding- its history and the
overwhelming- domination of the. Re
publican party in national affairs, at
the present time, Ohio has Just made
nc-w history for herself. She has elect
ed a Democrat to the greatest office in
her gift.
This tribute of confidence and faith
in Governor. Patti?on is accentuated by
the fact that he is one of the most con
epicnous insurance men of the country,
being no less an one than the president
of the Union Central Life Insurance
Company of Cincinnati. In view of the
sensational exposures of life insurance
methods as practiced by the largest,
and until recently considered the most
representative, companies of America,
the honor conferred upon Governor
Pattison is an added testimonial to his
worth and the esteem in which he is
universally held by the people of his
State and a corresponding evidence of
approval of his methods by the policy
holders of this well-known company.
Under his control the Union Central
Insurance Company has risen from
twenty-fourth to eighth position in
point of insurance in force among the
great American insurance companies.
Conservative in management, but
ag-gressive in field work, it has offered
Indemnity of a character excelled by
none. Appreciation of its qualities has
been marked by Californians particu
larly during the past two years, while
localLy directed by its manager, Mr.
Robert Lee Stf phenson. for many years
previously the widely known find pop
nlar passenger agent of the Santa Fe
Railroad. Mr. Stephenson has made an
enviable record for his company and is
tremendously pleased at the indorse
ment the people of Ohio have given the
president of his company and the high
standard of insurance methods he rep
resents. ,V * . \

TWAIN FAVORS
A THIRD PARTY
Dean of Humorists Talks
â¢ Seriously of the Ameri
can Political Situation
SUGGESTS A REMEDY
Balance of Power Should
Be Held and Used by a
Body of Independent Voters
Special IMspatch to Tilt Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 11. â "Mark Twain"
has suggested a remedy for bosslsm, a
way to overthrow the Murphys, the
McCarrene " and the Coes and make
them stay overthrown. He believes
his treatment will not entail the aban
donment of that habit, so dear to most
citizens of this great republic, of vot
ing for their party candidates. .
Under the new order of things the
man who cast his first ballot for a
Democratic nominee and has done so
every election since because his father
and his grandfather were Democrats
may continue to vote the Democratic
ticket and advise his son to vote the
same way, with the comforting assur
ance that be will be honestly following
the dictates of his conscience and that
the election of his nominee will mean
political purity, no bosses and thj
best administration possible.
Mr. Clemens believes it is simple to
bring about this state of political per
fection. All that is required is the or
ganization of a permanent third party
called "Mugwump," if you choose,
which shall continually hold the bal
ance of power In municipal, State and
national elections. It must be a party
with no candidates and no political or
personal Interests to further, and its
members may not even suggest the ap
pointment of any of their friends to
office.
Mr. Clemens, as he lay propped up
In bed in his city home. Fifth avenue,
explained his theory, to-day to The Call
correspondent. He was not 111 â only
resting In preparation ror a trip to
Washington to-morrow.
"It is a peculiar condition, but none
the less true." said Mr. Clemens, "that
the political liberty of which we are so
proud is mainly responsible for the ex
istence of the political boss. At any
election the people, if they choose,
may turn out the whole crowd. This;
is shown by the re-election of Mrf
Jerome by citizens who believe In his
honesty of purpose and that his quali
fications fit him for the office of Dis
trict Attorney.
"But this very power which reÃts
with the people is accountable for the
laxity which permits Murphys and Mc-
Curdys and McCalls and Hegemans to
flourish.
"There is a way to escape from the
thralldom of bossism. and that is by
the organization of a third party â an
independent party made up of those
who are generally called 'Mugwumps.'
I'm a "Mugwump.* I have never tied
myself to any party, but have voted
for the nominee who appealed to me
as beins? the best man."
Mr. Clemens lighted his favorite and
blew a great cloud of \u25a0 smoke. Into
which he gazed thoughtfully.
"What is a party anyway? That la
beled 'Democrat' or 'Republican' means
nothing to the average mind when
analyzed.' The Democratic party shouts
for free trade, while the Republican
party shrieks for high tariff. Which is
right? Why, there is no possible way
of deciding. If in the great party
politic a half ( believe high' tariff is
right and the other half cries free
trade as the proper thing, who is there
to settle the Question?
"If you ask me what I suggest an a
remedy for the present conditions I'll
tell you that some one, a man of great
executive- ability â John Wanamaker,
for instance â will have to enlist all his
energies in the formation of a "perma
nent third party. . It must be com
posed of men who are willing to give
up all affiliations with either of the
great parties. Xo man in it can have
any political aspirations. He must not
have any friends whom he wishes to
urge for political honors. The sole
reason for the existence of this new
third party must be. to elect the candi
date of either the Democratic or th-3
Republican party who is believed to De
best fitted for the office for which he is
nominated."

in thl3 city of John â¢L. Tisdale, i the
wealthy mining man who v mysteriously
disappeared last \u25a0 Monday . In I New York,
express the belief that he has been as
sassinated on account of the part he took
in ; the cattlemen's war which was waged
In 1 Wyoming; fifteen years ago. y V
Tisdale, then a prosperous stockman of
this city, was one of the party of cattle
men who chartered a special train In this
city and, accompanied: by a gang; of fifty
hired Texas gun-lighters, made . a :rald
into Johnson County, the stronghold of
the small cattlemen, : who were j then .In
control of the .county. 1 government./; The
wealthy cattlemen said these small : stock
raisers were, "rustlers." The .latter said
the big fellows were endeavoring jto con
trol the range and f were willing to â¢ coun
tenance much in order toget the land, j
During this , raid, two prominent r mem
bers of the small stock raisers," Ray and
Champion,. were ; shot down by the invad
ers. Later friends oorf r them . swore venge
ance on the bie men and informed Tisdale
that they proposed ;to make him answer
with his life for the death of the men.

FORM EXCHANGE
Meet in Santa Rosa and Ar-
range for Organization for
the Purpose' of Protection
WILL SATE COMMISSION
Raisers Expect to Add to
Their Profits by Doing
Away With the Middlemen
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAJTTA ROSA. Nov. 11.â The hop
growers of this county to the number
of nearly seventy-five gathered here to
day and took the preliminary steps to
organize the Sonoma County Hop-
Growers' Exchange. The general sen
timent was favorable to the organiza
tion of the exchange for the purpose of
handling the output each year indepen
dent of the middlemen and thus save
the commission to the grower as well as
to arrange for the handling of supplies
for the growers at reduced rates. The
matter of mutual insurance and the con*
trolling of prices were discussed.
It was brought out at the meeting
that the growers of this county pay
more than $SO,OOO a year as commissions
to the local dealers and fully $40,000
more as Insurance on the crops and
buildings. The difference In prices here
and in New York at the present time is
from 10 to 11 cents, and on 20,000 bales
of hops, the quantity raised in this
county, cuts a big figure in the profits
of the grower.
The meeting adjourned until next
Saturday, when It is expected that the
committee on organization will have a
report to submit for consideration- At
that time the Mendoclno growers , are
also expected to be here for consultation
and possible organization, either with
the Sonoma growers or as an indepen
dent organization.

MAKES DELIBERATE
PLANS FOR SUICIDE
Artist Fuchs. Before KiHing
Himself, Disposes of His
Etchings.
NEW YORK. Nov. 11.-Gustave Fuchs,
delineator of the march of triumph at the
World's Fair at Chicago and various oth
er notable structures, who committed sui
cide at his East Eighteenth street apart
ments JaFt night, planned his suicide most
deliberately. When found he was sitting
upright in his chair dead, while all
around, on the mantel, the tables, the
chairs and other pieces of furniture, were
the fruits of his life's work, all carefully
arranged and most of them bearing the
address of some friend to whom he
wished the etchings to be given.
Among the pictures ready for shipment
was the artist's masterpiece, entitled
"The Moses Column." It Is a beautiful
creation, dedicated to the sufferers of the
Russian massacres, and was willed to
Jacob H. Schiff. president of the Society
for the Relief of the Russian Sufferer*.
On a mosaic table there was a band
some bust of President Roosevelt, the
handiwork of Fuchs and showing his skill
In bronze.
Fuchs' latest work and the one which
Is still to iie seen all over the city, "The
Portsmouflfc Drama," was also found. The
top of this picture represents the Czar,
President Roosevelt and the Emperor of
Japan, while to the lower left hand are
likenesses of the Russian peace envoys,
De "VTltte and Rosen, and directly oppo
site those of the Japanese envoys, Ko
mura and Takahlra. The center Is a pic
ture of the marine building in the Ports
mouth navy yard.
Although Fuchs has been in 111 health,
it is believed that money and family
troubles caused him to end his life.

How to Test "Hair Dyes" Containing Sugar of
Lead (Poison) and Sulphur
IFEEL It is my solemn duty^ as an analytical chemist familiar with the facts, to sound a
note of warning: to users of hair dyes. The market is flooded with dyes that are not only
Injurious to the hair, but endangrer the health of every person' who uses them.
These preparations, variously advertised as. "hair dyes," "hair renewers," "hair "re-
storers," etc.. are In the majority of cases solutions containing nothing: more nor less than
And. Reader. Sugar of Lead Is â POISON!
In Justice to the public, every bottle. of hair dye containing these substances should bear â¢
the poison label and the poison emblemâ the skull find .cross bones!
Thousands of people who have no Idea that they are plnylns; with flre, are using: .these
preparations, and not knowing- of anything: better, arc slaves to them!
Now I am polneT to tell you how yon can detect the presence of Lead and Sulphur with-:
out polnK to the expense of a chemical analysis. .
The manufacturer of every Sulphur and Lead- preparation Rives emphasis to the i direc-
tions â "SHAKE THE BOTTLE BEFORE USING!"
Why? Simply because the Sulphur and the Lead settle to the bottom of the bottle, form- .
Ing a thick sediment, and you must shake the bottle and stir up this sediment, for It's the
sediment that does the rrork! 'Here is the test: Dont shake the bottle!
Just try to dj-e the hair with the clear liquid at the top and the stuff will fall absolutely
Co color the hair.
So the vendors of these dyes are always shouting; â "Shake the Bottle!"
Lead and sulphur make the hair sticky and etreasy, and the stuff rubs off on everything:
!t touches. ' iJ-1i J - 1 ; : '.
There's another "old-timer" â the "two-bottle" dye. that's so popular with many hair
nhops. No one but an expert can use this properly, and the customer must, as a rule, pay
dearly to have It applied ffrom $5 to $15). Then, in a very short time, the gray hairs at the
roots must be retouched (by the expert) and another fee paid.
RlgM here Is where the real trouble begins, for the hair then takes on two and some-
times more colors, and the effect Is startling, to say the least. After the first application the
hair has v "dyed" appearance that does not fool anyone but the user. But when a variety of
colors appear, even the victim of the "expert" awakens to the shame of the situation. â¢
Many people had a pood head of hair when beginning the use of the "two-bottle" prepa-
ration or the "Bhake-bef ore-using" mixture, but aft*r two or three years, thin, short hair
was their reward. In some cases the eyes and head are affected by the Sugar of Lead, and â¢
the victim presents a truly pitiful appearance. The method by which these harmful nostrums
are commended to the confldenco of the public consists In the liberal use of so-called "testi-
monials." If you only stop to think, your own common sense will tell you that no disinterest-
ed person would permit the use of his or her name in an advertisement, particularly for hair
dye. The very fact that one uses a hair dye Is evidence of a desire to conceal the pres-
ence of gray hair. But even If any could be found honestly, do you suppose they would
be willing to answer a hundred letters a day Just for the fan of It? Would you. Reader, do
It for nothing?
Intelligent people will not be led astray by cunningly worded "testimonials"â tha
real meaning Is too transparent. k
* Thousands of men and women have learned by sadexperience the truths above stated.

CRAFT SYSTEM
IS DISCUSSED
Commissioner Garfield Talks

I ri Banquet in Washington
MUST AIM AT THE BOOT
Says It Is Impossible at
the Present Time to Ef
fect Any Permanent Cure
Special Dispatch &> ThÂ» CalL
WASHINGTON. Nov. 11.â Commissioner
of "Corporations James R.Garfle!d, la an
address at a banquet of the Hardware
Manufacturers' Association here last
i night. ; discussed the question of graft
in the government and commercial In
dustrial evils.
"You have heard that graft la tha
government Is rampant." ho said,
"and this must not be taken
lightly.' la 13 true that there
are things in the Federal- Government
that are wrong 1 , but when you compare
them with "the things that are rood -you
will find them Incomparable. There axe
things wrong In private business affairs
as well as In the public affair*, vv â¢
should not attempt to apply a remedy
before we know what the disease is. The
Inquiry conducted by this bureau Into
the workings of the corporations means
that the Federal Government, as the sov
ereign of all the people, has a right to pro
tect one man against the alliance of
others." . ,
The speaker stated that the problem*
now are as mighty and Important 'as ever
our forefathers had to contend with. On
every hand we are confronted with com
mercial and Industrial evils.
"To attempt to remedy them : Is use
less, unless the blow be aimed at their
root." he said. "At present It Is Impos
sible to effect any permanent cure; only
penalties can be imposed where tha
wrongs are discovered. If you. my
friends, are to have the advantages of
corporate formation, you must submit
your affafrs to the sovereign of creation.
Let the people know who you are and
with whom they are dealing. The Gov
ernment can be vested with the power
to deal with Incorporations engaged to
Interstate commerce, such as It has re
garding the national banks, to keep it
self Informed as to what they are doing,
how they are doing it and what their In
tentions are. MMflMjS^jlsiUjÃ
"The* question 13 whether the corpora^
tlons shall rule tbe people or be ruled
by the sovereign by which they are cre
ated." . . - /J -

PAXTOX EEFUSES TO
MAINTAIN CHILDREN
Attorney Asks Court 'to Issue
Execution Against
Him.
Blitz W. Paxton, the Sonoma capitalist,
has ignored the order of Superior Judge
Graham directing him to pay his blind
con, John A., and his Invalid daughter,
Roma,, $50 a month each for their main
tenance pending the final adjudication, of
! their action for permanent support.' As
a result Attorney Charles F. Hanlon, rep
resenting the afflicted and helpless chil
dren, has prepared an execution to be
against the large holdings of the
. defendant, which are located in his home
county.
Attorney Hanlon appeared before Judge
Graham yesterday and announced that
his clients were In dire need and that
Paxton had refused to obey the order of
court directing him to temporarily pro
vide for their maintenance. He requested
the court to sign an execution against
Paxton's interests in the splendid coun
try residence and farm in Sonoma Coun
ty that the condition of the children
might be immediately relieved.
Judge Graham stated that he preferred
to give Paxton a few more days in which
to obey the order, it being the wish of the
court not to tangle the properties of the
defendant in litigation more than could
be helped. However, the court announced
that if the order is not obeyed by next
\u25a0week he will sign the execution.
Paxton asserted during the trial of the
action that he was practically bankrupt

FIRM ACCUSES LYDEN
' OF FRAUDULENT ACTS
Spoliii-Patrick Company Asks
; Judgment for. Damages â¢
Against Hiiri.
With ; counter charges "of fraud and a'
demand for $10,000 damages, the Spohn-
Patrick Company has answered the suit
of Frederick F. Lyden, a former member
of the firm, for an accounting of profits
and for' the recovery of $4200 salary he'
alleges is due him' and for $1450 he asserta
he paid out in the interest of the firm at
its special instance and request.
Lyden, says "the defendant firm, acting
with fraudulent intent to destroy that
branch Vof the firm's business of which
he had charge, failed, as he agreed to
do. to spend all of his time in the man
agement thereof, but was only present at
his ; place of j business about three hours
a day. idling away the rest of his time o?
utilizing it to ; further his outside inter
ests.* ' Fuithermoje, say s â¢ the ; defendant,
when this state of affairs was- discovered
and it 'became' known that^ Lyden ; had
operated .' his : department- at; -a ' loss^oi
$1391 88,, as shown by j the books, it \fras
agreed, Lyden'assentingv that his branch
should be terminated. It was further
agreed, says the defendant., that no, ac
counting would be demanded of either
party, and. with this understanding the
business of 'Lyden's branch was ter
minated. ;As a matter of fact, say 3 the
defendant, the loss the firm suffered
through Lyden's management . of his de
partment was greater than the books
showed, but the firm decided to close' it
out and let matters stand with as little
friction : as possible.
In conclusion the defendant firm asserts
that the suit instituted by Lyden was for
the - sole purpose of harassing, annoying
and defrauding the firm, and it demands
judgment against him for $10,000 damages
for his alleged fraudulent acts. The de
fendant firm is represented by Attorney
E. D. Knight.

Penrliyn Staiilaws, Who Won

HE ACHIEVES SUCCESS
Little Play Accepted l)y Sir
Henry Irvingv hut Actor
Did Not Live' to' Stage; lt
F;Â»cScl DlspaUtt to TS>*" Call.
; LONDOT, Nov. ll.r-^Td a " Veer Vain
young American dramatist. "~ who '. is
known to fame, however.' for work of
quite another kind. Sir Henry IrVihg's
recent death must have meant a rather
severe disappointment. This is , Pen
rhyn Stanlaws. inventor of the famous
Girl, who wxs second only to the Gib:
son damsel in popular favor in America
a few years ago. Like most peoplo
who have made a big success of one
thing, this young: artist's most cher
ished ambition is concerned with some
thing: quite different, and in his case it
Is play-wrltlnÃ. .
A year or two ago Mr. Stanlaws. who
spends a large part of his time in Lon
don, wrote htÂ» first stage piece of any
Importance â a little tragedy in one act,
and thinking he might as well aim high
at the outset, sent It to Sir Henry Irv-
Jng. Not long afterward he was delight
'sl beyond measure b yrecelving a letter
from the late .actor accepting the play
and undertaking to produce it as soon
as the opportunity came. But with
actors great as well as small, that is
an elastic team.
Irving proved no exception to the
rule/ No doubt ho fully expected to
appear in the StanJaws piece at some
time or otherâ perhaps during his pro
jected farewell tour In America, but
the fact remains that he died Without
producing it, fmd so Mr, stanlaws loses
the Inestimable advantage that such a
production would have been to him In
his effort to gain recognition as a play
wright. At last accounts the Inventor
of the Stanlaws Girl was . working on
a tour-act play of which he had grea.t
hopes, but which he did not intend to
offer to any manager until after Sir
Henry Irving had produced his curtain
raiser. . - â¢
NEW. PLAY BY JONES.
Henry Arthur Jones, -though he
fioesn't always succeed in pleasing the
public with his plays Is almost invaria
bly happy In his titles. His new piece,
which- James Welch is going to produce
at Terry's soon after Christmas Is
called "The Heroic Stubbs," and. It is
said, will be Quite, different from the
author's usual ' work. Jones has not
had a real eighteen-carat success since
"Mrs. Dane's Defence," though both
"Whitewashing Julia" and "Joseph En
tangled" enjoyed some favor on both
sides of the water. "The Cheveleer,"
written for Bourchier, was a complete,
frost, but so, too, was "The Lackey's
Carnival." the Jones play that cairie
just before "Mrs. Dane." .
11. B. IRVING HONORED.
There was a particular kind of roar
with which Sir Henry Irving's first
night, audiences used always to greet
him, the" ordinary hand-clapping prov
ing quite Inadequate to the occasion.
That roar was not accorded to another
actor till Tbrusday night, when H. B.
Irving made his first bow to the audi
ence in Beyerlein's "Lights Ouf-r-call
fed "Taps" in the United Statesâ which
was just ready for production In Lon
don when Sir Henry's sudden death
made postponement necessary; .- .-
The younger Irving was producing
the play himself, and owing to the more
than ordinarily strong affection that
existed between himself and Mb father
he would have wished to delay the pro
duction much longer if his own feelings
had been the only ones to consider. The
splendid reception given to him doubt
less was partly In recognition of this
fact, and partly also a tribute to the
memory of Sir Henry. But the great
applause at the" end of the play was for
the actor himself, and for a- remark*
ably well-chosen and well-managed
company, and for a play that was
strong and simple and dramatic, going
straight to its grim conclusion "without
"letting go" for a" moment.
Part of Its point, the Impassable so
cial gulf fixed between commissioned
and non-commissioned officers, is lost
here, as was probably the case in
America, but the story of the aristo
cratic lieutenant's love for the ser
geant's daughter and its tragic out
come Is so direct and convincing and
so fertile In effective situations that
arise naturally from the story. Instead
of being dragged in anyhow, that the
play is sure to be a success at tha; Wal
dorf. This theater is now under the
management, of the Shubertsj "Lights
Out" being their first production.
OSBOURNE AS DRAMATIST.
Lloyd Osbourne's stories are greatly
liked oh this side of the water, -but he
and his collaborator, Austin. Strong,
have yet to win success here with a
stage work. The, Napoleon play, called
"The Exile," which they wrote for Mar
tin Harvey, had some decided , merit*,
but It did not .please". and was soon
added to that actor's long list of fail
ures. Londoners, however, are looking
forward to seeing "The Little -Father
of the Wilderness," played In America
by Francis Wilson, which Charles
Frohman will present at the Comedy
Theater when he starts business 'there
with his new star, Huntly Wright ..
Wright, who Mr. Frohman begrulled
away from George Edwardes. has made
his reputation purely as a comedian,
and consequently there Is much curi
osity to ace him In Osbourne and
Strong's, pathetic little piece. "The
Little Father of the Wilderness" will
be used as a curtain-raiser to "The
Mountain Climbers." "the German adap
tation by Cosmo Hamilton. In jjj
Huntly Wrigtit makes hiÂ» first' reap

Napoleon Byrne Sleeps After
Half Century Spent in
Developing His Community
BKRKELEV. Nov. 11.â Napoleon B.
liyriie. a former Postmaster of Berkeley,
died this afternoon at his home on Oxford
street, in North Berkeley. He had lived
for eighty-eight years and was regarded
as the oldest resident of this county, to
which he came in liwS.
Former President Cleveland made Mr.
Byrne Postmaster of Berkeley in the
early 'tÂ»o's. Before that appointment Mr.
Byrne had served as a Town Trustee.
B;nce his retirement from the postmas
tership he had Uiken only a casual inter
est in public matters because of his ad
vanced age.
From Missouri to the West Mr. Byrne
came in ISIS. His start was made in the
traditional jirairie schooner, and in this
sort of vehicle the pioneer and his family
traveled across the plains. When he caxno
to Berkeley there was but one house in
the vicinity, and only a few in Oakland.
The stakes for the family tent were driv
en in Berkeley soil and the pioneer began
to farm what is now known as North
Berkeley. He h2s never removed his
home from the town since that day, near
ly a half-century ago.
Six children survive the father of the
Byrne family, these being Miss Kate, Miss
aiyra and Miss Maude Byrne, Mrs. F. \V.
Carlton, Luke J. Byrne and Sister Mary
Ealamo of the Catholic church in San
Francisco. Arrangements for the funeral
have not yet been made.

she has since learned to hate. She was
granted the divorce on the ground of cru

children and JlOO a month alimony.
While the ground of the divorce was
cruelty, it was not of the physical kind,
but described to the court as incompati

which so preyed upon the mind of the
plaintiff that she was unable to live such
a life longer and went back to the
parental home.
Rossier is an insurance man and capi

The couple were married in IS3G. The
â¢wedding Was one of thf ..vcxits of the sea

RAILWAYS RACE
FOR CROSSING
Electric Line Takes Initia
tive^ and Begins Work on
Its Alameda Service
ROAD TO BE WIDENED
Maintenance' Question Cause
of the Construction Grew
Starting Worl on System
OAKLAND. No V..IL- Fifty sturdy work
men of the Oakland Traction Consolidated
were put to work this morning on the con
struction of the broad gauge electric road
to Alameda just south of the estuary. It
is a race to a finish with these hardy sons
of toil, for they are trying to head off the
Southern Pacific Company from building
across their right of way before the rails
are in irace. *
The {southern Pacific desires to build a
cut-off so that its Alameda trains, that
are now operated on First street, may
connect with the tracks from Oakland to
the Alameda mole. In order'to do this the
Southern Pacific must cross the right of
way of the electric line on Webster street.
That in itself is not objectionable, but ac
cording to the law the company crossing
another's tracks must maintain the cross
ing. It is to/ avoid being compelled to
maintain this new crossing that the Oak- v
land Consolidated has begun the race
with the Southern Pacific, which has yet
made no move" that might show its hand.
"It's a. case of race, all right,"' said
Foreman Morgan of the construction
corps today. "Where the Southern Pa
cific Intends to cross is not' known, but it
must be somewhere along here. We have
built 300 feet* of track and we. plan to build
200 feet more toward Alameda before we
stop."
The present crossing, just south of the
Webster street bridge, is now maintained
by the traction company.
An official of the Southern Pacific who
viewed the work of construction to-day
said that such railroad warfare in the
East was a thing of ibf. past.
"It is only in the West where such
fights are made," he said. "In^the East
the companies have decided "that the
cheapest policy. is to. repair the crossings
alternately and thereby save trouble and
share the expense.". '
The workmen are laying broad gauge
double tracks on the east side of Web
ster street, allowing sufficient room on
the west side of the street for' an excel
lent roadway. The tracks are .placed
nearly a foot above the present grade of
the street. \
The management of the Oakland Trac
tion Consolidated has been promising an
improved service in the Encinal City for
months, and one of these improvements
was to be a broad gauge system through
that municipality.

or from luncheon to card affair will suf
fice to shove the City of Oaks into promi
nence as a wide-awake town, then is . the
vinegarlst old pessimist deprived of. his
daily "sour-ball." We are certainly not
asleep these days, for one has , scarcely*
time even for an occasional "beauty -nap."
Even the students must scoop up.knowl
edge as the fast trains do waterâ on the
fly. The past week has been almost un
paralleled for the great number of smart
events, both small and important, and the
calendar for the coming wfcek already
presents an appalling array of social
dates.
To-morrow two functions of consider
able importance to the musical world will
take place in Berkeley. Charles Duttbn,
the pianist, has planned what promise 3
to be a 'delightful studio .entertainment,
to be followed by a dinner. Mr. Dutton
and Mrs. George W. Haight, a charming
dramatic reader, will give the programme
and a number of prominent people from
both sides of the bay have been invited.
Mrs. Mabel Gray Lachmund, also a
well-known pianist, will be hostess at
another affair, at .which Dr. ,J. Fred
Wolle and his wife will be guests of hon
or. Dr. and Mrs. Wolle furnished the
motive for one of the most pleasant re
ceptions of the week, last night, at the
Starr King rooms. A musical programme
was siven during t..e evening by. 'Mrs.
OlivÂ« Reed Cushman, Mrs. Robert
Hughes, William Leimert. John W. Met

SUSPECTS ARE AKKESTED
Police Officer Has Battle
With Suspicious Charac
ters, liut Lands His Man
OAKLAND, Nov. 11.â A thief who con
cealed himself in the basement of the
Anheuser-Busch saloon at 477 Ninth street
before closing" time last night robbed tKe
proprietors, Snoderleiter &' Bandel, of
nearly $300 and escaped without leaving
a clew. The money was in a tin" box in
the basement.
The robber escaped from the saloon
by way of the iron cellar door in the
sidewalk.
Patrolman Mulgrew' this ' morning ar
rested Edward Sandusky, who has been
loafing around the saloon . for several
days, on suspicion that he knew some
about the robbery.
The saloon of John Heinhold, at Web
ster, and Water streets, was also entered
by burglars at an early ,hour this morn
ing:, but the thieves secured nothing but
a ,few bottles of . whisky.
At 2:40 o'clock this morning Patrolman
Sherry accosted five . men at the
corner of Broadway and First
street. They started to ', run. Sherry
cornered two of them, but they gave bat
tle to the officer and one escaped. The
other. Jack Lynch, a well-known charac
ter of West Oakland, was booked on the
detinue book at the city prison. The
police believe that the five men seen by
Sherry may have been concerned in' the
burglary of Helnhold's saloon.
Early this morning Officer Powers ar
rested William Malloy and John. Ryan
as suspicious characters. On one of the
men was found a bottle of whisky, which
the police think ; may , have been one of
those stolen from Helnhold's.
William McCulloch and Frank Miller
were arrested by Officer Tom Brown early
this morning on suspicion of having
robbed the room , of Theodore Zubac, at
1054 Broadway. Zubac, was awakened
this morning by hearing some one in his
room. The j intruder escaped and Zubac
notified Brown, who . investigated and
found, that, the room of Charles Pomas
sler, a cook employed in the Saddle Rock
restaurant, had also been entered. He
then arrested Miller and McCulloch, who
â¢have a room together in. the same house.
R. C. Clark, 1120 Adeline street, re
ported to the police that burglars had
entered his house last night by means of
a set of painter's falls, hanging from the
roof, and had stolen a small amount of
jewelry and silverware. V 1V 1

the town and postoffice, and the moun
tain Black Butte from which the name
comes .is.; a mountain :.of f mercury. .-'lt
is'- claimed '.'.by the owners, that -.this
mountain. has the largest exposed body
of quicksilver, ore "; in/ the world. .A
vein 400 feet wide has" been- opened for
more - than 'a^ mile : along .the mountain
and j to a depth of ,1000 feet below the
crest. More" than \u25a0': three mile 3 ; of tun

everywhere the rich cinnabar ores from
which | Qulcksll ver is | taken appear in
great quantities. :' \ . " <
â¢-In the Oregon mining section at the
Lewis "and Clark Exposition the visitor
could; see In operation a miniature
quicksilver distilling plant modeled af
ter the one . at Black Butte. The little
engine ran all day^and i attracted much
attention.: Near by was the condenser
and "under the spout an iron bucket of
quicksilver, showing just how the mov
\u25a0ing: metal .runs j but of â¢ the condenser
after" being liberated from 'the ore
through a scientific' process. >
..'-The process ordinarily is called dis
tillation. First the ore Is; crushed and
then it is dumped into j f urnacesV where
it is roasted at the fierce heat ' of 1200
degrees Fahrenheit. When the ore
reaches a temperature, of 680 degrees
the quicksilver begins to pass off in the
form : of, vapor. The mercury vapor is
passed into, large â¢ chambers built 1 jof
wood or brick, called condensers. These
afecoated by. water, jackets 'and; other,
and in them the vapor soon
changes into metallic ' form, the quick
silver being precipitated in fine glo
bules~on the walls and : floors. The
globules collect and run out in troughs,
ready to be marketed.? Quicksilver, is
put up for. shipping in' flasks* of
wrought: ironi. : weighing 'fourteen
pounds each and holding seventy-six
and - a r half pounds jof the metal. The
present market' value of ; quicksilver/ is
about fifty-three cents per" pound
wholesale. . :
'.Quicksilver Is found in veins of rock,
like gold,; silver; and "other metals.
Sometimes the <tiny globules .of the j
mercury appear "in,' the ; interstices* of |
the rock, but usually. IMs found in the
form of ; cinnabar, a chemical 1 compound
containing ; 13.8' per; cent: sulphur^and
s\i.2 per cent mercury. .When pure and
reducedto a powder it'ls; a bright-red
color. . . '

lowers | possessed the courage of i their
convictions and perished rather than
abandon their experiment.
Englehardt was no ordinary man.' He
was a native of Bavaria, a. university
graduate and an author of considerable
merit. He might, have made something
of a mark in the world if he had not
sickened of civilization . and Its ways.'
It Is said that the failure of a woman
to reciprocate his affection was ! the
cause of it, but this is mere conjepture
and due to the fact that J the fair jj sex
was excluded - from his schemeV for
restoring. mankind to an. earthly, para-"
disc. He believed that where woman
came- the devil was sure to follow and
he didn't intend to run any risk of get
ting into the same sort of trouble that
Adam did.: ' \u25a0\u25a0.'\u25a0- â¢ " \u25a0
"It was " his opinion ' that the human
race originated in the "sun-blessed
tropics," and only, there could it obtain
a fresh start on .the right track. In
1901 he came to New Britain in search
of a suitable place : for the establish
ment of a community which he fondly
hoped .would form' the. first link in a
chain of. similar settlements that .would
eventually^ gird the. earth. - ,'He pur
chased the little . island of Kabakon,
situated in the Duke of .York group and
about fifteen milus from Herbertshoe,
the seat of ' the German administration
in New Guinea. It'is 165 acres in ex
tent and cocoanut trees 'flourish there
in abundance. He believed . that liv
ing in the primitive .fashion required
of those who joined the order It would
suffice .to maintain 250 men. .
"I have . proclaimed Kabakon an open
fruit garden and sim grove." he said in
a letter setting forth his ideas, "for the
purpose of reclaiming degenerate man
kind to .t heir true state. of existence. I
will settle it with fruit-eating sun-wor
sbipers to re^ar." great, pure, true. \ sane
men by giving its \u25a0 members natural
conditions of lif e. \u25a0\u25a0 I * will send out as
missionaries members of the Sun Order
who have been -tried .and -found to be
true, natural-living men.' .In this "way
I shall 'establish similar colonies round
the whole , equator. ,\ The more people
who Join me and the greater the means
placed' at my disposal "the quicker will;
these colonies be 'formed."
' Expecting *Â£,*, rush"' of applicants he
laid, down .very, stringent rules as to
the conditions on which candidates for
earthly, perfection _ J and human "regene
ration should.be taken ''.lnto his island
paradise.' Among "them were ihe fol
lowlngr ; :
"1. Only men. of^ noble and excellent
character will be admitted. .
.. "2."Each. applicant* must be recom
mended by two respectable credible
persons, approved. by the leader of the
Sun Order.". ~ : * ..'"^:^
, J"3. A payment of $250 for such as can
afford that amount; for less wealthy
persons a^sum corresponding to their
means, and for the poor. sun- worshipers
nothing at all."-.
Naked. man "comes into" the world and
naked he goes out of it,. and naked he
should abide In it,' according to ,the
highest priest of the i sun-worshipers.
He insisted that his". followers should
never under- any circumstances wear a
vestige of ' clothes. He â¢". held that
clothes poisoned ' the system .and that
by intercepting- the rays of the sun
"the source of all life,' of all mind and
all strength," they prevented .the at
tainment of : a ; perfect humanity. '
. . Marriage -he \u25a0 also regarded .. as an
abomination and strict celibacy was
enjoined. Fruit which' ripened in t the
sun was alone . to .be .eaten. Houses
were - forbidden. â¢He \u25a0 would tolerate
nothing that interfered with' living close
to nature all the time. .

Near and the John A. McXear Company,
who own thÂ« several thousand acres of
land east of this city comprising Point
San â¢ Pedro, by a deed executed on Sep- ,
tember 22, 1905, and filed for record onr"
November 9, conveyed to J. H. Sandford
of San Francisco a 100-foot right of way
nine miles in length for a standard gaugs
railroad, twenty-six acres of land, over
fifteen acres of tide land, siding sites and
the use of a .large rfiill for roadbed ma
terial purposes. - The consideration la SID,
and there is a proviso in the deed that
the work must commence within two.
years and ' that ona of the lines, to bo
known as the Puerto Suello line, should
be completed within' four years, other
wise tho property reverts to thÂ« grantor.
| The northerly point of the right of way
commences at a point on the Las Galllnaa
Creek and runs for nearly a milÂ©, then It
separates Into two courses, one being
.known. as the '''tunnel line* and the oth
er "tbo Puerto Suello line." both running
to the bay.
- From the terminus of the latter a> half
mile pier will be bunt, reaching to a point
near Maria Islands and having low water
depth of .Line feet or more. Then* is to
be a branch line known as the "San Ra
fael Line" leaving the Puerto Suello line.
The distance from the site of the pro
posed,- ferry slip to San Francisco will bÂ«
twelve, miles, 'and. lt can be easily madÂ©
by a steamer similar to the TamaJpals,
Frlsble, San Francisco and the San Pablo
In -forty minutes. The line from there to
this city will be about three miles, and
, will | easily ..land passengers here within
fifty minutes, and they should be able to
make Petal uma within an hour and twen
ty minutes from San Francisco.
Sandford Is supposed to be the agent of
the Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad^
Company, which has men on the road
surveying, quietly securing rights of way.
host : of regenerating recruits. A lot of
folk In Germany had signified their In
tention of Joining him when he got
; his paradise started., but when it came
to the scratch all but two backed out.
The ftwo men who Joined him on
these terms were Max Lutzow, a musi
cian who conducted an orchestra in
Berlin that bore his name, and Heln
rlch Eukens, a native of. Heligoland
who had settled in the same city. They
consigned their clothing to the sea on
landing on Kabakon and settled down to
a course of sun-worship and fruit diet.
But the sudden change to an equato
rial climate, exposed to the fierce heat
or the sun all day and sleeping on the
sand at night . with no \u25a0 bodily nourish
ment but â¢ cocoanuts, soon reduced - Eu
kens to a condition of extreme physical
weakness. In that state he was smit
ten with malaria.. In accordance with
the rules of the order he took no- reme
dies, but lay In the direct rays of the
sun and fasted for three days. On the
fourth day he . succumbed to the "hun
ger cure." But his fate did not weaken
the faith of the two other men.
Skeptics might sneer, but they felt
certain that they -were on the rfght
track and that through them the hu
man race would ultimately be regene
rated. ' Stark naked and with their â¢
skins tanned to the color of leather
they wandered about the .Island and
seemed quite happy and contented with
their primitive life and frugal fare.
The natives regarded them with super
stitious reverence and settlers who vts
lted them . occasionally looked - uponT^
them as harmless lunatics. .
At the beginning of this year. Lutzow
was carried out to sea in the Methodist
mission cutter, which had drifted away
owing to adverse currents and when
the boat was recovered some consider
able time afterward It contained the
corpse, of the deluded musician. His
loss was a sad blow- to Englehardt. but
he still refused to leave his beloved
sun-grove and still . continued to con
form strictly to the rules which he had
drawn up for the sect. He subsisted
entirely on cocoanuts.
At last he was striken with a severe
illness. Learning of his condition, the
German authorities sent their medical
launch to the island and despite his
protests insisted, on conveying him to
the hospital. At Englehardt's request
he was placed in such a position, on the
little craft that he could gaze upon the
Island as it. receded" in. the distance. He
spoke no word to any one, and by signs
rejected the nourishment that â¢was of
fered him. - "When at length the island
vanished, from his sight, he closed his
eyes in death. â¢ \ '\u25a0RAMSES BRINGS VARIED

WANTS A NEW

As. the. result of a visit-;. of. inspec
tion yesterday- by- Public {Works 'Com
missioner-Alereltiriger 'and;: Chief-Dep
uty | Donovan of the . Bureau of Streets,
the first- named official will :at once
recommend to his | colleagues a
new bridge be * built |to - replace : the
structure at \u25a0 the foot of Sixth street.
crossing* Channel. ... ; . .
The present bridge is In a bad con
dition and Is regarded as dangerousyin
view of the heavy ' teaming -*%; traffic
Aigeltinger .believes that /the cost .of
repairing the- old bridge would . be
more advantageously used -in^: building
an entirely new bridge, whloh ' he ; esti
mates: will cost $50,000. He will en
deavor to have the Incoming Board of
Supervisors set aside the amount In the
municipal budget, which will be adopt
ed next June. \u25a0 '. \u0084 v' V â¢--' "'.'\u25a0"\u25a0\u25a0.' 'â¢ '
.Algeltinger also proposes to recom
mend that the width of the sidewalks
on. Sixth street * from: Townsend â¢ to
Kentucky be reduced from nineteen to
fourteen feet, which will ..widen the
roadway of the street by ten feet.) This
will be : a great accommodation to
teaming traffic. He will make a sim
ilar recommendation that the width of
sidewalks on \u25a0â¢ -eventh street' from
Townsend southerly be reduced for the
same reason. > _ ' -, '\u25a0'-],.'.
'^The Board of "Works has granted per-r
mission, to the Southern 'Pacific .Com
pany to grade for credits the roadway
of Mississippi street from Twenty-flfth
to Army streets and also from Twenty
fifth street northerly along the line of
its. bay shore i cut-off.
The fact' that there is a scarcity of
basalt blocks, in the local market \ has
resulted in ' inquiries f rorri ' quarrymeh
as far away as Portland as to the pos
sibility of placing orders for the blocks
with contractors in this city." It is cal
culated that the blocks can be landed
here ; by water for. practically the same
price as by quarries in and adjacent
to San Francisco./ In that event the de
lay in proposed street work will be; rn
a measure ; obviated; \u25a0;.; The 'proposed
paving of Minna and Stevenson streets
will* require several hundred thousand"
basalt blocks.
JUDGE LAWLOR GEANTS

' An order heretofore Issued by Judge

Shortly after Mrs.'- Hutton-s r death" Mrs.
Raine filed a- will of 'the': deceased, iv
which "Hutton was practically disinher
ited, and; her)petltion for special letters
of administration thereunder j was * grant
ed. To this- Hutton Instituted a contest,
but "later presented , for probate a letter
written to him by his wife : and bearing
date subsequent : to -that of -the will, in
which letter Mrs. -Hutton stated that it
was her desire for. her; hUÃband to have
all of her property. This 'letter, con
tended Hutton, constituted a valid testa
ment, and he offered it â¢\u25a0 as the last wilr
of the deceased. ;;\u25a0
An opposition to the probate of this let
ter, was filed! by Mrs.- Raine and other
heirs of - the deceased \ and [ this , contest- is
now awaiting trlali :; After, filing the "let
ter will" Hutton | petitioned Judge Lawlor
to revoke his order appointing Mrs. Raine
special " administratrix. . rfipre
sentlng Mfs. Raine . objected to her re
moval and' applied to. the .District Court
of Appeal for. a writ of prohibition to pre
vent her removal, the ground .being that
Judge Lawlor had no 'right to remove 'the
administratrix a" showing of im
proper conduct ; on . her; part." : The appel
late court held j otherwise, S however, de
ciding that the "court had the right to re
move an administrator at will. ' '
Judge Lawlor then yielded to the impor

After speeding - all ' r the way from hla
place of business to the Key Route ferry
station, his gait- being, urged .-by fear, that
he might miss the 5:55 boat and thus dis
appoint pome persons whom: he .had prom
ised- to meet at a designated time In; his
Berkeley home, Edward I^auderback was
within half a;dozen paces . of the sliding
doors when. they collided. with a crash and
barred his farther- progress.' -"c..- ' ;;'
Other shut-out commuters': were, . per
haps, :as deeply chagrined as Mr. Laude:
back, \u25a0 but he was the only ,oneV of \u25a0 the
group who permitted hJs rage to overcome
hlsdiscretlon. r He'ralsed;hls voice injut
teranees j that . would not bear literal tran
scription, | and while they.: were probably
indorsed by his \ companions In disap
pointment there .was '.no 'oral, evidence^ of
such approval.' Indeed, the feminine cctxi
tlngent' of i the audience removed itself "be
yond earshot of his -inelegantly expressed
sentiments. \u25a0 \u25a0 .; ' ' : ; :\u25a0\u25a0.+ '-\u25a0- -. . :
Among the; hopes fervently exploded by
Mr. I^auderbaek' was one, to the effect
that the boat Just; departing I ' would sink,
andwhen chided by John D. Whiteman"; a:
station attache, for, saying' such a- shock-'
ing thing he, turned-the vials. of his wrath,
upon that' gentleman and kept them inj
active service ;, until Patrolman George,
Tracy arrested him for peace disturbance.
"You really did not mean 1 to , wish \ that;

Attorney W.; D. Grady* declared, his ar
rest for drunkenness was an outrage and
demanded a '/'full, investigation of the,
charge, which r had been filed against him
by Patrolman "Charlie" Goff.'
"It- isn't the first- tinie he has arrested
me,"' thundered the excited . lawyer,, "and
I'm getting tired of his persecutidn." !';,:

\u25a0 William. , Langdon was - hlrsutely,: if \u25a0'. not
otherwise," qualified to declare himself an
artist, for both his cranium and the lower
section of his face ; were covered.- with
flowing hair. He was arrested for va
grancy in "Portuguese John's" saloon, on
the BarbaryCoast, and Patrolman Nelson
pronounced him a thoroughbred vaga
bond. -. ' '." â¢'\u25a0"' â¢\u0084*â¢,-.:,: ' , " : '\u25a0\u25a0 .â¢; "â¢ \u25a0

haughtily retorted; .-"l'm an artist, and
when arrested I was painting. an oil por
trait of my friend, .Portuguese John,' as
he can 1 testify." r " â¢.
"When do you expect to finish the job?"
inquired Judge Cabaniss. / ;
"At 4:30 o'clock this afternoon the job,
as you_ call it, shall be completed,"':. v/as
the reply, delivered with a great show ot
dignity., . , : --/ " , ;\u25a0! -;
"If you- are. caught? in. San Francisco

"Humph!"- ejaculated Mr. Langdon. and

Judge Mogan dismissed the murder
charge against Emily, Sattler Simon, who
was alleged to 1 have performedta' crim
.inal operation on Mrs. ; Angela; Venezia of
1412 Powell street; and; thereby caused her
death. The prosecuting, testimony' 'was
utterly inadequate ; to' sustain 'the charge.

ADHERENTS OF .VICTORS' DO "THE SERPENTINE"
At the dedication of Stanford's ath
letic grounds yesterday afternoon, dur
ing more than two halcyon hours,' brave
men struggled for supremacy in the
game of football â and by the time the
benign November sky was growing dull
with the tones of the gloaming a score
of 12 to 5 told that the cardinals had
won the fifteenth intercollegiate game.
Then red megaphones were loud with
barking, red banners were waved like
oriflammes, and "Rah-rah-Stanford!"
'swelled into a Niagara of exultation
over the dying walls of "Oskl-wow
wow!"
Instantly the triumphant cardinals
bounded over the railings like red
devils in the fastnesses of Virgin
America, formed in long columns, fol
lowed their triumphant musicians and
danced the serpentine over the field of
victory until the sun had sunk into the
crimson sky and until the yellow moon
had risen high over their harmless
orgies. . \ - : :Â«
The foe was vanquished, but not in
dishonor, and none could 6ay. that the
blue and gold had failed to make a gal
lant flghtand leave a record of deeds
nobly done, for the . struggles of the
quivering masses | that faced each other
on the sTidiron yesterday were as bold
and fierce as those in any game of cour
age and, skill ever played' by Greek
cladiators. Neither Agamemnon nor
Diomedes , ever battled where swift
ness, endurance and foresight counted
for more, or \u25a0 where - cunning and skill
were more essential to success. - - ' \u25a0.
LEIGH H. IRVINE.
Long before the warriors bold came
forth there was much pleasant badinage
in the singing of songs foretelling vic
tory. Yell leaders and. their "great chor
uses vied with each other, songs of de
fiance echoed and re-echoed across the
chosen field of conflict, and fair
women In white waved banners of blue
and gold or megaphones of brilliant
red. The .thundering yells of Berkeley
were first to be heard, but when the
cardinals came- they sent up. red bal
loons. , set . free pigeons with ; brilliant
streamers "flashing â¢ the ' colors dear to
Stanfordâ and when * their team ap
peared red confetti filled the: air and
floated to the sky like the glow of
Greek fire. ' ' * â¢ â¢
SILEXCE PRECEDES BATTLE.
..When the teams at last came forth
and after the cheers or , welcome had
died away there was the ominous si
lence that ' precedes : a battle. , " The pig

Football Battle at
Palo Alto.
By Park Window.
Captain Force of California and Captain
Chalmers of Stanford met John Poe in
the center of tne field and the Berkeley
team capiain won the toss. He selected
the cast goal to defend and Stanford won
the kick-off.
Crawford sent the ball spinning through
the air to California's fifteen-yard line,
Snedigar neatly catching the yunt and
zigzagged the ball back ten yards be
fore he was nailed. On the line-up Stan
ford was penalized five yards for off
side play anJ the ball was brought to
Berkeley's thirty-yard line. The Cali
fornia backs began digging through the

Stanford Would Give

BY NEILSON POE,
REFEREE.
It was a good, clean same from start
to finish and | the best team came out
victorious. Stanford outplayed Call- ]
fornia- in every! point? of the same, i!
have seldom seen such. a brilliant game,
even among the great Eastern univer
sities. -It , was" ; an' r ; evenly contested
trial of brawn against ; brawn. 1 don't
think Stanford could -;. score against
Harvard, Yale or; Princeton,' but these
teams would know they" Bad been play
ing after they had defeated the car
dinals.
* The work of-, the Stanford backfleld
â¢was superb. -The way" the backs han
dled the punts on the defense was bril
liant. Captain Chalmers, especially, ex
celled In this phase of the game and I
think more than half of the credit is
due him for the victory.
g Again I wish to emphasize the clean
ness of the game and the sportsman
like : conduct of Captain Force of the'
blue and. gold team when the cardinal
captain was forced out of the game.
Taking everything; into , consideration,
I. believe Stanford could repeat to-day's

Captain Chalmers handled his men
like a genera). His previous experience
in the game was a great aid, no doubt.
In accomplishing what he did, I waa
sorry to see such a nervy player retire
on account of Injuries. There were ten
other men on the Stanford team that
are to be admired. Each of them played
the game- of his life.

The vast throng enjoyed every moment
of the game, and the mass of colors, tha
beautiful tints of the autumn sky, with
the white garments of thousands of wom

linger in the memories o( . those who en-
Joyed the inspiring sight of a mad multi

CAJWOT ENLARGE WOODEX
BUILDINGS VS FIRE LIMITS
City Attorney Say* Ordinance Prevents
Board of Works ; From Granting
Permit* for Snch Alterations.
City Attorney Long yesterday filed
an opinion with the Fire Marshal that
the Board of Works Is prevented by an
ordinance from '; permitting? a wooden
building: within the firs limits to be en
larged or built upon, even though such
enlargement be of brick or stone. The
opinion says:
"The evident put pose of said ordi
nance Is not only to prohibit" the fur
ther erection of wood frame buildings
within the fire limits, but to bring
about the gradual substitution thqrefor
of buildings constructed of brick, stono
and other non-inflammable materials.
Under this .view -the reason for declar
ing that 'no wood frame building;
within the fire limits shall be enlarged
or built upon' 13 apparent. The in
creasing "demands of a growing popu
lation call for the erection of larger
â¢and more modern buildings. As tha
property owners are prevented .by said
ordinance from enlarging .or building
upon the old wood frame buildings,
such buildings must necessarily- be
torn down and fireproof and semi
fireproof buildings erected in. their
place. Thus the purpose of the ordi
nance Is accomplished." ;,
, The opinion will prevent the proposed
raising, of a two-story frame building
at the southeast corner of Dupont 'and
California streets.

7 raws, Automobiles
and Carriages Put
Stanford Rntertains
Royally 12,000
Visitors.
BY E UGENE FA VRE.
BY E. B. FAVRE.
Yesterday was a gala day at Stanford.
Never before in -the history of the univer
sity had such a crowd gathered within
the wide confines of her campus. The peo
ple came from everywhere. Speeding
trains brought them from Berkeley and
San Francisco, automobiles carried them
from surrounding towns and an army of
dogcarts, traps, runabouts and tally-hos
drove into the grounds with the smart set
from Menlo Park and San Mateo. Yet
through it all Stanford proved herselr
to be a most admirable hostess.
Ample provision was made to take care
of every one. There were carriages In
which to ride, seats upon which to sit
and, best of all, dozens of places where
refreshments were served to the hungry
multitude. There was not a hitch during
the entire day. The trains were on time,
the automobiles caused no runaways,
there was no crush at the gates and in
side the bleachers gave plenty of room
for the people to sit down. Comfort, a
rarity at a football game, was within the
reach of every one, and every one took a
happy advantage of the conditions to
make the best of the day.
The crowds began to arrive early in the
morning. Trainloads came from Berkeley,
fully 5000 people in all, San Francisco
eont her contingent of 3000. From Palo
Alto, San Jose and the neighboring towns
mere thousands poured into the grounds,
until at 2:3-3 o'clock in the afternoon,
when the referee blew a sharp note from
his whistle as the signal fr the play to
begin, there were oevr 12,000 bleacher
hearts anxious about the fate of the day.
NARROW ESCAPE ON THE BAY.
The rooters frcm Berkeley were the first
to arrive. Their journey was seriously
Impeded at the start. They left their
home campus before <5 o'clock in the
morning a:id went in special trains to the
Oakland mole. Here disappointment
awaited them. On account of the heavy
fog the ferry-boats were seriously de
layed, and these men stood for nearly an
hour before they were able to make the
etart. la the meantime local trains were
pouring In their human freight and the
mole was jammed to its fullest capacity.
On board the steamer Oakiand the trou
bles were not yet over. In the fog the
boat just escaped a terrible catastrophe.
It passed within a few feet of the battle
ship Chicago, which was lying at anchor. :
So narrov/ was the escape that the yell
ing crowd of rooters stood aghast and
were hushed fcr many minutes. On at
tempting to enter at the San Francisco
slip the Oakland failed twice before the
landing was successful. Then the 2000
blue-hatted, lusty-lunged rooters from the
University of California made their way
across the city to the Third and Town
send streets depot, their slogans ringing
through the streets as they marched.
The Southern Pacific Company had
provided ample means of transportation
for the crowd, Eight special trains of
fifteen coaches each were waiting on the
tracks and they carried the people away
at twenty-minute intervals. As fast as
the coaches were emptied they were run
back to San Francisco to be made up
again Into a train. The first start was
made at 6 o'clock In the morning, and at^ 1
o'clock In the afternoon the last ad
herent of the great college game was ,
on his way to witness the struggle of
the year. Two specials ran out from
Oakland and one was filled at San Jose.
ENJOY BKAUTV OF CAMPUS.
At Palo Alto buses met the crowds
and took them Into the university
grounds. Thousands preferred to walk
down the long palm avenues that lead to
the quadrangle and to saunter around
through the arboretum. For hours they
\u25a0walked about enjoying the beauties of
the Stanford campus. Many had never
been at the university before, and they
took full advantage of the opportunity to
go through the magnificent stone build
ings.
The great memorial church built by
Mrs. Stanford in memory of her hus
band was opened to "the crowds by spe
cial courtesy of the university authori
ties. The bis organ played the entire
morning for the edification of the vis
itors. Thousands entered the great stone
doors, gazed enraptured at the wonder
ful carvings and mosaics that decorate
the Interior of this, the most wonderful
college church in the world, and then
eat down to rest and enjoy the music of
trie organ. ,
The museum \u25a0 was also oj>ened to the
public and thousands more wandered
through its long halls and domed rooms.
For the first time In many years au
tomobiles were allowed to enter the
grounds. There were hundreds of them
there, driven from San Francisco and
Ban Jose. They, entered the eastern gate
of the campus and were rounded up on
the faculty athletic field olose to the
main grounds. They were not given the
privilege of the rest of the campus.
There was no confusion among them at
er.y time. .
Menlrt Park and San Mateo sent a
large contingent of smart folk, who came
down to Palo Alto In carriages. Tally
hos were generally decorated and nobby
traps shone resplendent in trimmings of
blue and gold or the cardinal. There
were other vehicles there, too, and of
every description. Ranchers from over
mountains, men who had never seen a
football pame, but who had sons at one
university or the other, drove over ;In
buckboards and wagons. The automo
bile and horse vied for superiority in
numbers.
AMPLE LUXCHEOX PROVISION.
The best feature of the day was the
ample provision which the men and'wom
en of Stanford made to satisfy the appe
tites of the thousands of hungry visitors.
Pah> Alto had restaurants and lunch
counters in abundance, but tlte best serv
ice was at the university. Each of the
fraternity and sorority houses ran a buf
fr-t luncheon for their friends. Thou
sands were fed in this way. The Stan
ford Inn was enlarged for the occasion
and served its guests on its shaded ver
anda. Other boarding houses took care
of a cart of the crowd.
Under the shade of the trees Just east
of the quadrangle an outdoor luncheon
of wonderful tastiness was served. This
was done by some* of the young ladies
of Roble Hall. Dainty tablecloths cov
ered heavily laden tables. Visitors
purchased a luncheon and then sat ;on
th*' grass and enjoyed It. Hundreds
took their own baskets from home and
picnics were held in every corner of the
arboratum. Xo one of that great mass
WHITMAN, THE QUARTERBACK OF THE CALIFORWA j
of hungry football humanity went into
the grounds w'lth an empty stomach.
On every hand were policemen from
the Morse Patrol of 'San Francisco.
They guarded the buildings from pos
sible defacement by the small hoodlum
element which always follows a great
crowd and they kept order among the
busmen and automobile drivers. They
watched carefully for pickpockets and
possible gamblers. But everything was
orderly and quiet. There was little, if
any, infringement of the law, and no
property was destroyed. It was a well
behaved crowd at all times.
ROOTERS OX THE ALERT. '
The California rooters ate their lun
cheon and straggled into the â¢ football
field. Their section. was quickly filled
and they were organized first. Stan
ford made a pilgrimage from the great
arch at the entrance of the quadrangle
down to her place on. the field. ' The
rooters had valuable possessions to
guard, surprises which they later sprung
during the game, and they took no
chances of a possible raid by the sup
porters of the blue and gold. They
marched .in .a compact, body . and.ltpok
their seats very x quickly. Then the
noise from the rival sections began. It
did not stop until long after the game
was over.
After the rooters came the general
crowd. There is* something -about a
football game that draws even those
people who do not know the first prin
ciples of the game, but who cannot
miss the fun of a day with the college
boys. The opening of the racing at
Oakland pulled at the hearts of many
San Franciscans, yet thousands finally
decided that the football game was the
better and theji took the first train for
Palo Alto. Mothers and fathers of
sons and daughters- who attend the uni
versities came to see what Stanford
really looke<f like and incidentally to
watch- the struggle. But the mass of
the crowd, outside of the rooters, was
made up. of football fans who love the
game for the game's sake, who' under
stand every move that is made upon
the gridiron* below and would not miss
the annual intercollegiate football game
were it hundreds of miles away.
OLD-TIME HEROES THERE.'
Heroes of former football battles. were
gathered there by the dozens. They
had come from every corner of .the
United States. For California . "Jim
mle" Hopper, one-time college hero and
last year's cdach, squatted on the side
line. "Pete" Kaarsburg, greatest ' of
blue and gold' fullbacks; "Heine" Heit
muller.. who saved his- team from de
feat three years ago by breaking
through the Stanford line and. blocking
a kick and who was a tower of strength
in last year's struggle; Middleton.
early tackleâ all of these men .watched
every move of -their team from the
bleachers. Most prominent of all Cali
fornians was the mighty "Ovie" Overall,
veteran of four varsity,, games. : He
stood up straight when Force dropped
back. for the first time and signaled for
a field goal. Down in his heart he re
membered and every bleacherite remem
bered the game of 1902, when he had
brought victory to his team by kicking
two goals and making one touchdown.
Eagerly fcÂ« waited for Force to make
the kick, and when the ball was finally
sent toward the goal, but ' far
wide, disappointment was written on" his
every feature. Air of these stars of
former days were given a rousing
greeting.
For Stanford Chester Murphy, the
greatest of all the long: list of cardinal
great quarterbacks, helped to watch: the
lines that measured the., distances. The
Stanford rooters cheered ,him time and
again. "Guiby" Dole, a member of the
famous Dole family and formerly tackle,'
watched his brother fight as halfback for
his team. "Sunny Jim" Weller, last year's
towering fullback, came down- from the
mountains' to help cheer for his former
teammates. There were many, others, too,
and each of these heroes of" former days
was given a rousing. welcome by the car
dinal, rooters. \u25a0 ,
THE JOURNEY HOME.
As soon as the game was over' the
crowd made a "break for the excursion
trains. The first cars were started at
5:30. o'clock, and at 6:30 every one who
wished to so had : been \u25a0 cared ' for. The
automobiles whizzed down - the -county
road and the carriages slowly â followed.'
In an. hour the greater, part of the -crowd
was on its road home.;,- . '. ' > :;\u25a0
Several \u25a0 thousand people stayed over to
visit with friends and to watch â¢ the cele
bration of: the Stanford 'men during the
evening. The fraternity ', houses and- the
dormitories took care of \u25a0. the \ visitors \ for
the night: Some left on late tmins.
The. football -trains arrived In San Fran
cisco after about an hour and r a \u25a0 hairs
run. There was little actualdelay through
stops, but } the " heavy grades -near/the
cemeteries, told; on the speed. '. Four long
trains five : minutes apart '\u25a0 ';\u25a0\u25a0 brought ' the

GLORIES OVER
OLD HARVARD
Game Will Go Down
hi History for Fierce
Struggle*
Gladiators' Helped
Over Line by Luck
and Steady Wonk. .
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 11.âPennsylva
nia defeated Harvard to-day In one of the
fiercest cridiron battles ever witnessed
on i Franklin field. \u25a0 The final score was
li'to 6. Both elevens scored a touch
down and kicked the goals in the first
half and the Quaker eleven added a sec
ond touchdown In the second half. That
there was ill-feeling between the play
ers of - the two elevens was made appar
ent early in the first half, when Parker,
the crimson center, was disqualified for
slugging and again in the second half,
when Sheble was sent to the clubhouse
for a like offense.
, Both touchdowns in the first half were
due, to luck. Before the game had been
in progress two minutes and with the
ball ten yards off Harvard's goal, Foster
was sent against Pennsylvania's left
tackleâ As he struck the line Foster
dropped the ball, and when Referee Mc-
Clung; was able to get the mass of hu
manity separated, Robinson was lying
on the ball within eight yards of Har
vard's goal. In three plays Lamson was
pushed over for a touchdown.
HARVARD WORKS TANDEM PLAY.
, Burr kicked to Sheble, who had a splen
did opportunity to carry the ball out
of danger, but just as he got well start
ed he dropped the pigskin. A Quaker
player fell on It within four yards of
Pennsylvania's goal. Sheble kicked on
the first line-up, the ball going to Hur
ley of Harvard on the Pennsylvania's
forty-yard line. Here the crimson eleven
began to work their famous tandem, and.
aided by two off-side plays, which net
ted them ten yards, they quickly pushed
the ball over for a -touchdown.
The third touchdown was made on
hard, clean football. Pennsylvania got
the ball on Harvard's forty-flve-yard Una
on an exchange of kicks and pushed it
over for the final touchdown by straight
line plunging. Tory kicked the goal.
In the first half Harvard completely
outplayed Pennsylvania and gained
ground almost at will, while in the sec
ond half the crimson players made only
one first down. Both their offenses and
defense weakened perceptibly as the
game progressed, while Pennsylvania's,
attack and defense Improved 50 per cent.
LEVOB PLAYS STAR GAME.
The particular star on Franklin field to
day was little Levine, Pennsylvania's left
end. It is no exaggeration to state ho
played the most remarkable game of foot
ball'ever witnessed in this city. He fol
lowed the ball perfectly, and time and
time again broke up Harvard's interfer
ence before the play had gone six feet.
Six times, during the game be recovered
the ball after some member of his team
had fumbled. Three times during the,
game he was laid out because of his
fierce tackling, but he always resumed
play after receiving the sponge bath.

TEIJX'S ROD THIRD
AT A LONG PRICE
High Chancellor, a Close
# Second in the Stake, Would
Have Been Returned First
in a Few More Strides
By Fred E. Mulholland.
The crowd at the California Jockey
Club track at Oakland yesterday was no
different from any other big gathering at
a Tacerourp*. It waded patiently through
three ordinary but excellent contests, with
Proper and the Opening Handicap,
though, ever in view. '\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0â¢ V : .
The race figured out 52450 to the fir3t
horse, and that sum will put a lot of flour
In the barrel. Good Cheer, Judge, Reser
vation ar.<s Briarthorpe declined the is
rue, but Beau Ormonde and Corn Blossom
were added. This left the hoodcp thirteen
to ilght it out. Hew could Proper lose
after beating all the good ones around
New York? That's what everybody want
ed to know. The Idea, too, of the handi
cepper only asking the big horse to cairy
126 pounds! It stemed too absurd to be
true. Walter Jennings received ccngratu
latlsns for standing so well with Handi
cepper Egbert. The bookmakers also be
came Imbued with the idea that Proper
dopefi a certainty and quickly rubbed the
price about the Jennings entry from 4 to
5 to 3 to Z. This saved many of the larger
bettors frcm complete annihilation.
SAX NICHOLAS SEVER HEADED.
Packcy Rj-aa's black horse San Nicholas,
carrying 10& pounds and piloted by" Willie
Davis, went out la front as Jake Holtman
released the barrier, and without being
headed stood a hard drive; beating High
Chancellor a head in 1:40. Tern's Rod,, a
40 to 1 shot, s<Jfcured show honors. Proper,
with "Big Bill" Knapp in the saddle, ran
sixth, with excuses. He caught the bar
rier at the start and then met with con
siderable interference on the clubhouse
turn, which seemed to knock .him off his
stride. Bragg and Rightful, although both
were among the "also rans." gave prom
ise of dcing better.
There was a world .of coin in the
ring, and the downfall of Proper
etarted the layers off on velvet. Two
other choices were dethroned and the
books quit with the honors.
Anybody cculd have had a . bet on
Miller's Daughter for the asking. "Ken
tucky John" Givens, trainer of the filly,
didn't think she had a chance, and at
odds of 23 and SO to 1 the daughter, of
Belvedere beat Dod Anderson a ' scant
neck for the introductory seven-furlong
selling run. Laura F. M. enjoyed flrst
call, arid after playing along in second
position- to the stretch she sought re
tirement. Dod Anderson made all the
pace, only weakening the last few yards.
Potrero Grande was third. . â¢
WATERCUHE SCORES CLEVERLY.
Touted far and wide as one of the
real mellqw ones of the day, Watercure,
a 6 to 5 chance, made good without ef
fort in the mile selling number. Jimmy
Long's Kcrmit filled the leading role for
six furlongs, then wired his regretg.
Willie Smith here picked up- the run
ning with the favorite, subduing; â¢' Del
Coronado and The- L&dy nolle*;!*.
Rostof. a barked outsider, . failed to
cause a flutter of excitement by any
thing he did.
Dick Williams sent one to the post In
the five and a half furlong scramble for
thre*-year-olds that certainly gave the
talent a rocking. If all the stories ex
tant could be believed, betting on Loyal
Front was stealing something. The
colt closed an 8 to 5 favorite and ran*
unplaced. . The winner snowed np In the
diminutive I'm Joe, a 9 to 1 (shot.
whicti . McÃride dropped In first, more
than a length 'before Sir ' Edward and
Retropaw. . ;
"Lucky" Baldwin's Cruzadps, with
"Citcket;-'- -Kelly on his . back, formed a
combination .difficult to beat in the fifth,
&â¢ slx-furlong purse affair. Desyite the
fact that Bearcatcher was a starter, his
ctndltlcn has not pleased the "clickers,"
and C'juzados went to the barrier an odds
on choice.
BEAHCATCHER SLOW TO BREAK.
Both Bearcatcher and tty favorite gstve
Jake Holtman some trouble before be
caught them both straight, and then Gar
net Ferguson's brown horse seenaed slow-
In gitting away. The Baldwin flyer
quickly assumed the le-ad, iomping home
ahead of Tocola'w. c 20 to 1 shot, in 1:13^.
Radtke on J3oercatcher lost the place by
almost a-length. ' -
Those who strung. with- Dick "Williams
got even on Reservation, winner of the
final mils and -a sixteenth selling race.
The Cayuga hcrse ruled a stunSy favorite,
and thraush some delicate maneuvering
E. Walsh landed^ the money. The 20 to 1
shot Lady Goodrich, ridden by littln Rob
lnscn, proved troublesome in the stretch,
cr.ly losing the verdict by a head. Played
down from 5 to 3. Hugh McGowan fin
ished a close third. â¢ ;-

Ideal Weatker Draws Thousands, to
:/\: /\ Enjoy Opening at Oakland. -
By William H. ..Jordan.,-
"They're, off!"
It was . opening .day at thÂ© New ' Cal
ifornia Jockey Club's track yesterday at
Oakland. Those .who have. watched these
opening, days come and go said it was
a record 4>reaker. \u25a0 . . .
- The scene at the beautiful race course
did not belle their ' words. , Under condi
tions (climatic and otherwise) that could
not have been improved the fall and.win

attendance which easily, rounded out SOOO
persons. ... \u25a0 -. .â..,\u25a0\u25a0
: . Nearly the middle of November and the
skies an opalescent blue, the air balmy
and exhilarating ason a day In spring,
lovers ot the racing f game turned out
by thousands, whetted for sport by the
long, months of waiting. '...-..
Calif ornia was there ., to gtve the
strangers .from beyond the . Rockiesâ and
there were many iof j themâ a , glorious re^
ceptidn. Though it may be trite to write
about ideal .weather, yet this was the
day that - met every definition of the
term.' . V _ .
Half the joy of horse-racing is In the
weather. Clear skies, f rosh ; air, fast
trackâ these make for speed, for tha Inch
by-Inch, fighting over the course that trn-:
pels the heart to thump, : the * pulse to
quicken and the eye to glisten as the
swift contenders ; press ' their way under
whip and spur toward the finish., :
- And such a day was this at the Oakland
track* ' when \u25a0 Starter "Jake" t Holtman
mounted the stand for the . Initial race.
If the sightseer had â¢ stood at \ the point
of vantajre" he would have noted a great
grand stand ; literally | packed \ from r.oof
to the asphalt parade below,' Jammed with
enthusiasts, men and women; waiting In
eager excitement for the j beginning of
the \u25a0 game. The crowd 'at a race \u25a0 course
is ; a spectacle by Uself. : ." . :. '

Tnc* was it yesterday at Oakland. To
the veterans- at the Kamc.it. mtÂ»ht have
seemed . stale, perhaps. To . the tyro, - tnÂ«

human interest, for on every side was thÂ«
very css:nce of human nature depicted.
GROUNDS IS FIXE TRIM..'
The New California Jockey Club man
asement believes In cultivating: an es
thetic side. The grounds at Oakland were
spick and span. At the clubhouse for thÂ«
guests everything: was bright and clean,
fresh under* much new paint. ; Grass
swards, fresh and Invitingly cool. . vtees
and plants, palms and foliage,, called
hither for relief from the bright sun
light. Along the boardwalk from the main
entrance, covered for shelter against the
rains, b-autiful creeping vines. had over
grown the sides, forming a delightful ar
bor, half a mile long. ..
The stables, neatly kept, the appoint
ments fcrr patrons new and bright, .tha
attendants quick and politeâ all this add
ed to the attraction of the day. But
President , W!l!larn3 overlooked one Item.
He should replace that dingy black and
gold banner that was fiung froni a pole
in the inner fteid. The colors are weather
worn and not in keeping with the general
appearance of the grounds.
I>jns before the bugle call sounded for
the first race the bettirg ring- was swarm
ing with crowds of eager investors. Thero
were twenty bookmakers in the main
ring. : three field books and a combination
stand to handle the public's money. Tha
evidence was that there was plenty of it
to handle. Some of the men en thÂ» block
needed Â£3 many hands as a centipede has
legs to accommodate the prcs3 of patron
ag*. iJ r V
The betting men said it wa3 a day of
days^for an opening, as oftentimes the
public shies a bit at Inaugural races.
Form is not always so readily figured,
especially when a host of new horses and
new Jockeys appear on the cards. But
that Is for the technical side of the game.
Around the ring the old-timers greeted
Barney Schreibtr. who had been away
for a season. "KM". "Weller's face was a
new one after his absence of three or four
years; Among the jockeys who were given
a cordial reception from the grand stand
were Willie Davis and Knap p. ' \ '/\u25a0%"\u2666
Noticeable In, the Jbettfng ring was a
large 'number" of Eastern horsemen who
have come to California- for the season.
The' game has beetr* heavily advertised'
throughout the East. The tracks- In tha
Middle West have closed for the 'winter.
The yellow fever scare at New Orleans
has sent many followers of the sport
westward, the large stables have given
Impetus to public Interest, and. all com
bined, these reasons account to some ex
tent for the successful, opening 1 of the
racing year. . . '\u25a0'\u25a0'.
Fine weather, prolonged as It has been
this year, gave the club* management
every opportunity to pat things shipshape,
and conditions at Oakland prove . that
none pf the opportunities were _; over
locked. . â¢. '-V*:2
It was suggested yesterday at thB track,
that the football game at Stanford might
have been a counter attraction ' to win
many an enthusiastic devotee of racing 1 .
.If any were absent the thronged grand
standing, betting rms and paddock parada
d.fd not. give evidence thereof. The- inter
est of women In this exhilarating sport ts*
hardly second to that of the men folk.
While the men pressed about the betting
stands and wisely or not wisely mad a
their selections, .they barely diminished
the occupied space. ln the pavilion above.
Hundreds of daintily .gowned -warden.
graced the grand stand, and In tha height
of battle In. the race their voices, shrill
with excitement, joined in the chorus of
the "course. . ,' ' V .*â
It was kaleidoscopic Finery .ta thÂ»

brand new suits of brilliant hues, * tha

EARTH SHAKES
FORTY SECONDS
Residents of Elko in Xe
vada Given a Scare by an
Early Morning Temblor
RENO, Nov. 11.â The town of Elko was
the scene of a panic on the part of its
inhabitants to-day. It was caused by
a severe earthquake which shook the city
for a period of forty seconds. Buildings
were badly shaken, the windows' in sev
eral houses being broken by the shock.
The shock occurred -near the breakfast
hour and dishes on the tables were over
turned. The inhabitants, fearing the de
struction of the city was at hand, fled In
terror from the neighborhood, returning
several hour? later, when their fears had
Foriiewhat subpided. The recent volcano
discovered in the vicinity of Lovelock is
thought to be responsible for the severe
shock.

Collector Stranahan has a dog on his
hands which he is desirous of getting rid
of. The animal arrived here on the Penn
sylvania on September 6, and immediately
became a charge on the hospitality of the
United States, as its owner failed to put
In an appearance and claim the canine.
For more than, a month the dog has
been boarding at Hevemer's Hoboken
Riding Academy at a daily expense to
Uncle Sara of 75 cents. Three square
meals a day of a character to tempt the
appetite of the most exacting canine are
served, with nothing for doggie to do in
return but to nap and speculate who his
new master wil be.
Considerable red tape had to be un
wound before the collector was in a posl
(ion to announce that the animal will be
Â«old at a special sale to be held next
ruesday in the seizure room at the ap
praiser's warehouse in this city.
Acting Deputy Collector Storey will
represent tar. Stranahan and see that the
flog is given a good master and home.
The official custom-house papers describe
the animal as "unclaimed perishable mer
rhandlse." He will be sold to the highest
bidder.â New York Commercial.

They're telling of a Jackson County
farmer who found an auto horn in the
road one day and took it home and
taught his chickens to recognize its
honk as their feed call. Instead of
calling them in the old-fashioned way
the farmer or his wife would blow the
auto horn. One day an automobillst
passed the farm going about fifteen
miles an hour and tooting his horn.
The chickens near the house took out
after the auto and fourteen hens and
three roosters ran themselves to death
behind the machine.â Kansas City

Special Dispatch to Tha CalL
SAN JOSE. Nov. 11.â The three chil
dren of Hugh Herd, who were spirited
away some days ago from San Fran
cisco by his sister-in-law, Mrs. Sadie
Herel, were located here to-day by W.
D. Scott of the Boys' and Girls' Aid So
ciety. Herel, who is a car builder,
is lying at the point of death in a San
Francisco Hospital and the efforts
made to recover the little ones were
made at his request, as he wished to
see them before he died. -
In 1901 Herel was divorced from his
wife, Nina Herel, and was awarded the
custody of the three children. His cir
cumstances would not allow him to
keep them and two of them, Alice and
Sadie, now aged 13 and 11 years, were
placed with Mrs. Sadie Herel, his sis
ter-in-law. The boy, aged 8 years, was
boarded with a woman in San Fran
cisco. Some three months .ago Mrs.
Sadie Herel'.callcd at the house where
the boy, Henry, was boarded and asked
permission to take him for a walk." She
never brought the boy back.
Herel. who cannot live much longer,
a few days ago agreed to let his former
wife have the custody of the children and
the court made such an order. A search
was at once made for them.' Mrs. Sadie
Herel had taken the children to Oak
land and four days, ago they were
brought here. To-day Detective Scott
and the children's mother located the
children at. the residence of T. Buck
man, 180 East San Carlos -street, and
with the aid of the police secured pos
session of them. They were taken : to
San Francisco this afternoon.
Nothing seems to please a girl - more
than her ability to win the man of an
other girl's choice. â¢ -.

Taconia at Los Angeles.
The: baseball game at ; Recreation Park
yesterday fully demonstrated the value
of base hits. .The Seals gleaned four from
the offerings of Shields': left ; mitt -and
turned them Into five runs. The Siwashes
did Just as well -with the ones r Williams !
twisted over the oyster, > but ttyey g never
had ; a. look at that^pan s and they never
seemed to- have a chance. Some "clever
work on' the basest coupied; with', some
errors and dummy:, throws by -.the -north
ern tossers, helped a great* deal. / %
. ;! The Seals . began to L gather some iiv the
third/when' Shea lboked-at:four<bad"bnes.
Waldron ; sent' | him - .along -with ; a | safe
drive. Shields thought he saw a- chance
to nail Shea ? at second, Â«but"his' peg was
wide, and as the center fielder gave chase
to the ball both men moved up. Hllde
brand ripped, one at Blankenship, who
did a couple of fiipflops and a double
shuffle with the ball and then let it fall
into a gopher hole. While this stunt was
taking place both runners were wander
ing leisurely homeward. ! .
Nothing else 'happened till the sixth.
Then.. the Seals put three more over. Wal
dron again bihgled and Mohler bunted
one at Shields." His throw to. second-was
too late and both men pulled up safe.
Hilde dumped a. sacrifice, at the plate and
Wheeler sent Waldron through with a
hit. A double steal was quickly pulled off
and an error that happened opportunely
let Wheeler come in with the last one.
-Williams pitched another pretty game;
of ball. He had control all the time and
made the Siwashes cakewalk away from
that, old cross-fire of his, which was
breaking at all iides of the plate. A thick
smoke covered the field and it was nearly
impossible to. see the' balls that were hit
into the outfield. The score: ..

Little SouthpnW Lands In -Spite of
Dummy Bane Running;.
OAKLAND, Nov. li:â Despite the
poor base running of the Commuters,
which was perhaps the worst of the
season, they took a "game from Port
land this afternoon by a score of 3
to 1. The feature of the game outside
the base running was the remarkable
pitching of Young Smith, who also won
last .Tuesday's gajne , for Oakland.
Smith allowed only three hits, two of
which were bunched. in the first In
nning before his arm had really got in
working order, gj In the seventh he al
lowed another hit; when McCreedie
beat a slow one out to; first. '.- - â¢
Oakland had several good chances
earlyin the game, but it was not till
the seventh that - . the "Commuters
warmed up. Francks walked to .first,
went to third on Devereaux's. hit: and
scored on Byrnes' hit. ; Then Devereaux,
who had gone to ' third .on j Byrnes', hit,
took second ron 1 Smith's sacrifice . and
scored ori Van Haltren's ' long fly. out.
Dunleavy.' started the 'eighth' rwith a
hit and stole second." .Kelly, hit and
Dunleavy went to third; v where , he.
stopped for. no apparent . reason..'. That
left Kelly between first and second,' and
while he was ; a majority
of the Portland men Dunleavy man r
aged to reach home, making the score
2to 1. The score: \u25a0 / ;' â¢\u25a0 :

Early in the day the market gave : evi

BODIES OF DEAD
GO TO VULTURES
Strange Custom Prevailing
Among the Parsees, Who
Live in India and Persia
Special Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
BOMBAY, Nov. 11. â Among the Par
sees, the recent agitation to induce
them to dispose of their dead by cre
mation instead of exposing them to be
devoured by vultures on their "towers
of silence" has awakened only indigna
tion. They are not prepared to aban
don a custom which Is hallowed to
them by hoary-antiquity and associ
ated with their most hallowed religious
rites. ...
- Though Yin European minds the
thought of . allowing feathered scaven
gers to feast on. the bodies of their be
loved dead would excite the - deepest
feelings of repugnance and disgust, as
practiced by the Parsees this method of
getting rid of the fleshly tenement is
far from being so horrible as Is gen
erally imagined.' Indeed, to the Parsees
themselvesâ and they are the most cul
tivated and intelligent of all the sects
found in Indiaâ it seems far preferable
to burying the dead ,as practiced by
Christians.
'.'Your people," said a. 'Parsee, "put
your S dead j underground, where they pro
vide a banquet , for worms. - We put
ours above ground, where their flesh is
eaten by vultures. , The ultimate re
sult is the same. The bones alone are
left ..Â«. _ .\u25a0. \u25a0 ' : \u25a0.-,
"But, there is a great difference in
what takes place before ,the skeleton
stage is reached, and that difference Is
all In favor' of our method. Before con
signing the bodies of your dead to the
earth, you; inclose them In coffins. You
dare not allow . your imaginations to
picture 'the horrible changes that there
take * place before nature recovers
what she \u25a0" gave. -We do not ; seek to
retard the. process. The vultures . do
their work expeditlously. There ' is \u25a0no
putrefaction. Christian burial grounds.
co I have read, are often sources of dis
ease; ..Parsee . - dokhmas, or 'towers of
silence, .as you practically call them,
are never such." From a sanitary point
of view, they- are' incomparably, superior
to your cemeteries and with us they
are equally sacred." .
""But,", was suggested, "fire would do
the "work; even better .than vultures."
IMPOSING' CEREMPXY.
"Or worms." said the Parsee.- ."When
you Christians take to cremation, we
Parsees may possibly. f ollow \u25a0 your ex
cellent'example.:. There are far weight
ier reasons why cremation' should take
the place of > burial than . can be urged
In',; favor;, of Its substitution for our
towers of silence." '\u25a0>
.'â¢The. towers of silence crown. the sum
mit-of Malabar Hill,' near Bombay, ; and
are .situated \u25a0in .the midst of a .beauti
ful; garden /whose tropical trees. swarm
with vultures. ; They are . built -of stone
and areabout twenty-five feet high. A
small door is provided for' the. entrance
of the body.' When a Parsee dies, after
the performance of solemn and impo3 7
ing f tin eral : rites; . the t body v - is â¢ borne
uponyan'.-iron',bier to^the towers, fol
lowed by a procession of relatives and
friends of the dead, headed by a num
ber Cot r. priests. . -Upon Â« arrival -at the
gardens,*- the jbier -is ;laid; and
prayers are said at the "sagfi" or house
of \u25a0" prayer .'- hear^ the" entrance to = ; the
garden. 'The attendants then carry the
body, to, the 'v towers 'of i silence, .- lay ' It
on ; its â¢ stony, bed^ and .retire. V Then . the
vultures 'gather ; about' it and " do; their
gFewsorae workVunseen.^.The bones are
soon denuded of flesh and fall through

MAKES OFFER
OF FAIRMONT
Mrs. Oelrichs Forwards a
Proposal to St. Francis
Hotel Company to Lease
. There is a prospect that the Fair
mont Hotel will be leased to the St.
Francis Hotel Company and be run la
conjunction with the St. Francis. *A
committee of the St. Francis Company,
composed of M. X Gerstle. A. B. C.
Dohrmann, James Woods, manager "ot
the hotel, and Thomas Magee. visited
the Fairmont last Friday. They in
spected the beautiful building from top
to bottom.
It Is understood that Mrs. Oelricha
has made a very reasonable offer to
the \u25a0 St. Francis people to lease the
bnilding to them for a long term of
years. The' committee that visited the
Fairmont. It Is reported, think most
favorably of the offer and the matter
will soon be placed before the board oC
directors of the St. Francis Company.
The Fairmont is practically complet
ed so far as the building is concerned.
Its cost is about $3,000,000. If the St.
Francis people decide to take It they-,
will . furnish it lavishly. These fur
nishings, and fittings will cost about
$500,000. It- will be complete in every
detail and second to no hotel in tha
world.
No Use to Repeat.
They were two buyers from the "West,
and .were exchanging experiences the
other evening in a well-known Broadway
hoteL
"I used to be a drummer for a big Cin
cinnati wholesale shoe firm," said one.
"and imy district Included a large pert
of rural Ohio. I recall' once that I got
into a crowded train, . and the only seat
I could find '.was one ; near .\u25a0 the oar door.
I became interested in a conversation be~
twee n two biakeznen. -One was a green
negro and the other was instructing him
what to do. < .
" 'Now. you have got to learn the name*
of the stations, and call them oat at eacb
stop. So when the train stops, you open
this -door* and -listen to 'what. I call out
at the other end. and then repeat it/ saM
the instructor. .
" 'All right/ was the reply.
"Everything went fairly well \u25a0 for a,
while, but . finally the. old- timer stuck his
head in the door. and called out: rWapa
koneta! "Wapakoneta!* . The greenhorn
listened attentively, with a . puzzled , ex
pression. At length aij faca . brightened
up. and he exclaimed:

the priest a list of contributions to va

scribed as a memorial offering. This
concludes the ceremony of ."rising 1 front
mourning" or the "resurrection of , the
dead." ... 881
t On each recurring anniversary, of thÂ«
death .of .'a , Parsee, memorial / funeral
ceremonies are performed. 'An iron

Have you seen the beautiful Burlingame

both electric cars and the railway station?
Burlingame lands are not a "wildcat"
speculation; the property has merit, and the
prices are so low that they must advance.
Think of this beautiful land, with as good a
climate as you can find in the world, selling
for $10 a front foot and only 33 minutes
from the wind and fog of San Francisco.
When the bay shore cutoff Is completed It
will be only 23 minutes. Will not thousands
take advantage of this climate and natural
beauty when it Is in such easy reach? Will
not prices advance? Come to our office at
Burlingame Station, see the land and Judge
for yourself. Remember, every lot has
sewer and water pipes laid in front of it.
This pleasant trip will prove profitable.

Some of the Eemarkable
Things That Exist in
; This Old World of Ours
PUZZLING SCIENTISTS
Breathing Wells of Hawaii
and the Cave of Winds
in Korea Also .-Mystifying
No plausible explanation haa yet been
offered â regarding ' the origin of thtj
famous stone of Oberammergau. which
has a human face of sorrow marked by
the hand of nature on its surface.
The stone was discovered by an Ameri
can lady on Mount -. Kopiel. , overlooking
the village of Oberammergau, famous
for. the "Passion Play." Geological ex
perts declare* that It Is natural and that
no tool has carved it. If this be true. Â£
says the inquisitive scientist, then how"
was the stone naturally marked?
This Is a question that la likely to puz
zle mankind for so long a time as tho
stone exists. Dr. Game tt, who haa exam
ined It, cannot say more thao that "it is
a' great natural curiosity, more curious
than anything of the same nature with
which I am acquainted, and the history
of its discovery Is more curious stilL"
In the Church of St. John. Pisa, there
Is a stona that " puzzles scientists even
more than does the stone of Oberam
mergau.
It is curiously marked with red, blue
and yellow, and the lines represent an
old man with a beard and with a bell in
his I hand seated beside a small stream.
This stone fragment Is supposed to con- \u25a0
tain & picture of the Redeemer.
A water well bored upon a plantation
at Kealia. Hawaii, presented a new prob
lem to the world's scientists, and they
began, to ask one another the question.
"Does the earth breathe?"
Tho artesian well at Kealia had a tube
thirteen feet high surmounting the bore.
and in this at S o'clock in the mornlns
the water stood at a height of eight feet.
Six hours later they -ter bubbled over
the top of the tube In a steady stream.
At 8 o'clock next morning the water
had fallen live feet In the tube. This
rising: and falling continued like clock
work for so long as the tube was left In
the bore. â¢ It certainly wasn't caused by
the tide, for.no tide in the world id regu
lar. Scientists know this, and they want
to fathom the mystery of the regular ris
ing and falling of underground streams. J
/Why do mountains travel? is a little .'
puzzle that has stumped many great
minds for many years. Several engineers
went* to Bengal some years ago to find
out why the Alaithana Mountain, near
Gohna, had taken it into It 3 head to move.
This gigantic mass of earth started on
its travels In 1593, and In September of
that year had completely damned the
River Ganga.
Although the engineers made every pos
sible effort to discover the reason of Its
shifting and to stop its advances, they
failed, and a deep lake was formed
which rose till the new dam, unable to
bear the vast pressure of water, broke
suddenly.
-The flood turned a rich valley fifty miles
long, into a water-sodden waste, and do-
Ing damage 'to the extent of many thou
sands of pounds.
â¢Trayers Mountain." in Switzerland, has
also stumped men. of science.. At ./.the
present moment 'it is \u25a0 crossing. thÂ« valley
in which it is situated at the rate of a
few inches a day. and no one can discover
the reason of its stealthy crawling.
" Somo time ago an immense wall of
great thickness was erected around the
mountain to keep it in its place, but It Is
believed that by and by the huge mass
will push the wall dow- as easily as If it
were built of paper.
Three "scientists. -two from America
and .the other from Britain, are re
ported to have spent several months in.
Korea trying- 'to elucidate the wonders
of that strange land.
The wonders in question consist of a
hot mineral spring, which is supposed
to heal anything- from a cut to a cancer;
two springs so arranged that when one
is full the other- is empty; a cavern in
the mountains in which a cold, piercing""
wind rages perpetually; a large grrovo
of pine trees which will . sprout again
directly ..they are_ cut. down; a stone
which floats In space; and last, but
not least, a rock which gives forth
gre.at heat however cold the weather
might be. . "
The- scientists studied the springs
first of all. and. failing to understand
them,- turned their attention to the
wonderful cavern. The moment they
entered, the Interior* they were almost
blown off their feet, and although they
adopted aii manner of dodges to find
I the origin of the wind, they had to re
turn to the open sadder -but not wiser
: .They next walked into the grove of
I pine trees, known as the Ineradicable
Forest," and there again they were â¢
stumped. They destroyed : several *of
I the "trees by. fire during the night and
\u25a0next morning they -were regrowing
i strongly out of the I very, ashes! â¢-. \u25a0-
The fifth wonder. of Korea, the float
ing stone, in honor of which .a temple
has' been built, tried the ; scientists' pa
tience to a maddening. degree. .
This stone, to air appearances, "rests
on '- the ground, yet, when two -of the
men stood upon it, one on each side,
the third was able to draw a thick
I string underneath without encountering
any obstacle. ;why., they were never
able .to discover.
,The warm rock, the last wonder, also. â¢
puzzled * their , brains. This . rock I3_^
really an immense stone, on the 'top of .1
which -a * small Inn has been erected.
The building requires no fires for heat
ing purposes,- either in winter or summer*
for the rock, always keeps iririn m

Late ma.ll reports from New York cay:
"The most prominent feature In the coast
eituaticn at the end of last week was the up
ward tendency of f. o. b. prices on Prunes.
Thle Is attributed partly to the renewal of
export demand, which has resulted In a con
siderable buelness for prompt shipment to
I3urcpe on the basis of 3%c f. o. b. on the
nine point, which Is equivalent to 2*sc for
domestic count. Some holders of Santa Clara
Prunes turned down orders from this market
on Saturday on a C%c f. o. b. basis, making
c >unter offers of 3%c i. o. b.. with a premium
of a quarter cent on 40s and 90s. Others,
however, were *UII prtpartd to confirm on
the f. o. b. baeis of 3^c, with a premium of
a quarter cent en 90s, while others quoted
S*Â£c f. o. b. basis on 40s alone. Offerings
from the coast, on any basis are light and sell
Â«rs do not seem to be anxious for business.
Apricots and Peaches are In a strong position,
but n-Â»t much business la being put through.
apparently owing to the email offerings and
the difference between the t-itwe 1 of buyers
and sellers. According to some reports re
ceived rrom the coast on Saturday, a change
for the betur is impending in the Raisin situ
ation. Inquiries for loose Muscatels were be
ginning to come from all quarters, and It wae
said that outside seeders were getting ready to
buy fre*ly- It was also Intimated that an
early movement in association seeded Raisins
is probable owing to the pressure of consum
ing demand upon Jobber*, who have bought far
less than their average November- December
requirements, eastern eeedcrs art reported to
have far oversold and are being urged to make
deliveries. The outside seeders on the coast,
sJthough., according to reports current, sold
up closely to the full extent of their capacity,
"are still taking orders for November shipment
on the basis of 7&c f. o. b. for fancy seeded.
Currants are etrong and higher on the epot,
little, if anything, being now obtainable htre
below 5%c for uncieaned In barrels. The de
mand far Smyrna Figs Is active and the mar

Wnll Street Last Week.
D. F. Hutton sends the following weekly
stock mariut reriew from New York:
Elnce our review of the stock market situa
tion last Saturday, when we advised conserva
tism for the immediate future In making com
mitments, we have experienced a sharp de
cline In the eecurity list, with some heavy
/ liquidation by pools who were instrumental in
"* fo.-clng the price of their specialties up against,
' tbÂ« related warnings of bankers here. These
operators and their friends have been the chief
sufferers from the present decline and toad the
public participated to" any extent in' this &
further considerable decline would have' b*en
eeen. But the week closei with the market
In a much Ftronger position technically than
has been eesn in a long period. We are aware
that the majority of active securities are not
on the bargain counter at the present level,
for If they were thtre would be reasons which
would deter the public from buying anything,
as witnessed In 1903 and 1904. when stocks
were 20 to ICO points cheaper, but tt cannot :
be eaid that securities are too high. We are i
in a great bull period and the growth of |
wealth and expansion in all Industrials cannot
be misled. We are in aa era of centralization
of capital and power which is producing earn
ings on a tremendous scale and evt-rythlnf
points to a continuance of theee market condi
tions until -we experience a year of bad crops. |
It ts this great commercial activity through
out the country which has been accelerated by
the harvesting of immense crops in every dis
trict that has caused the Western banks to
withdraw their balances from this center re
cently. T.Me factor, with the floating of the
Japanese loan and other financial â¢ operations
of magnitude, has caused the meney flurry of
the past wetk.
It narrow* itself down to this k-aris: That
there is plenty of money for legitimate busi
ness, but not for speculation by. the . public
This la evidenced by the fact that Secretary
Shaw sees nothlrg Â»v monetary situation
where the Government should intervene.
We 'ook for the outflow of funds to *lack*D
during the coming week and money should be*.
Fin to return this way In considerable volume
three weeks hence. .
There has been strong support to the market
by financial institutions In tbÂ« good railway
stocks on the recent decline, and. while there
will undoubtedly be come sharp drives at the
market the coming week, we look for a con
tinuance of this good buying and support en
any declines that are made. ,
Any of the cheap "railway stocks ehould.be
I bought on recessions. We consider. the market
> Â«\u25a0 rreat purchase on any weakness In the early

Christ mas Six Weeks.
Thirty-five buying days.
. Just cnbugh time tOi do -all* the-
shopping comfortably. ) Any num-
ber have started already. Numbers
more will start : to-morrow.
For years and years we have
seen early shopping growing more
and more general. For years we
have been able to have the Hale
store ready when you want it
ready.
This year marks the. climax. San
Francisco's Christmas , store is
ready as never before to help you
begin your Christmas shopping
now.
Ready with Christmas stocks we
had planned to show you in the
new store with " nearly twice as
much room. ' j
The larger varieties are here and
the new store is rapidly nearing
completion.
The second floor of the annex
is already occupied by the largest,
most complete underwear store in
San Francisco. (Visit it to-mor-
row.)
The Pyrography store has moved
to the second floor, where muslin
underwear was.
And millinery has. annexed the
former pyrography space, third
floor. (Sale $3.95 hats to-morrow,
third floor.) Certain departments
are inconvenienced somewhat.
Workers are busy installing the
new sprinkling systemâ an addi-
tional protection the new store will
have against fire.
Saf eness is a large part of a
store's goodness, and we are aim-
ing to have the greater Hale store
best. \u25a0 :
Many have told us they like to
watch the building' "to see how a
store grows." It is interesting.
Come to-morrow.
We are straining every effort to
keep service up to the usual high
standard.
And Holiday interest is hieh.
Look at the linens â the dishesâ
the silver 'for Thanksgiving.
And the toys â and other Christ-
mas things. .
Glove Orders,
Are safest Christmas crifts. Hale
glove orders are bestâ -offer largest
varieties to' choose crifts from.
Redeemable at any of Hale's Cali-
fornia stores.
