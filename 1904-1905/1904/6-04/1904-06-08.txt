terday, this gold mining district passed
a comparatively peaceful day. Through
out, the day deputies and soldiers
marched and searched the hills for
union miners and the sum total of the
day's arrests was nineteen. This
swelled the number of men confined in
the "bull i pen" to considerably more
than â¢ 200 and to-night twenty-four of
them were i placed aboard a special
train and deported from the district. A
guard of deputies Â¦ rode out of the dis
trict with them.
The men were residents of the fol-;
lowing towns of the district: Cripple
Creek, three; Victor, three; Irrdepend
ence, tweTve; Goldflelds. three: Ana
conda, two, and Altaian, one. They
were all active unionists and served as
lenders In the strike row pending.
ENFORCED RESIGNATIONS.
Three additional city officials were
forced to resign their offices to-day,
namely: Chief of Police William
Graham, Night Marshal Fred Hardy
and Justice of the Peace Charles Har
rington. Their reputed sympathy for
unionism led to this action. In each
case a committee of the Citizens' Al
liance waited upon them and compelled
them to act immediately under pain of
violence.
Sixteen deputies armed with sawed
off shotguns visited the union store
and made a thorough search for
weapons. They were rewarded by find
ing a rifle and shotgun concealed be
hind a large Ice* ox. Subsequently they
went to union headquarters and over
turned everything in an effort to find
the union records. Their efforts were
unavailing. -

Ludwfg Busse, proprietor of Teu

prived of his liquor^llcense by the PoÂ»
lice Commissioners last night. Busse,
when charges of permitting minors on
his premises where liquor was served
were brought against him, made as>
sertiohs that Commissioner Reagan
had trumped up the charge because
he refused to insure his property with ;
the Commissioner. When the case
was called last week Reagan produced
positive testimony to prove that^
Busse's assertions were false, that he
did not even solicit the insurance and
when it came to an issue the saloon
man failed to produce any testimony
â¢ n support of his contention.
The ! Civil Service Commissioners
addressed the Police Board to the ef
fect that medical examinations for po
lice officers who desire promotion will
not be held hereafter, as the aspirants,
if physically capable to remain in the
department in' the lower rank, must
certainly be for the higher, the duties,
so far as police matters are concerned,

f George Spingula, a six-year-old boy
residing at 1226 Kearny street, ate some
bills that he found -and died in great
agony a few minutes later.- He was
playing with little Joe Faricello in the
rear of a house at 1222 Kearnv street,
and found a bottle containing some red
pills. He thought he 'had found some
candy and ate several, then proffered
some to his friend. The other bov re
fused to eat them. Within a few min

JLast evening there, was a reception
in the social hall of the opera-house to
the supreme officers and delegates,
which was followed by a ball given by
the local lodges and under the direc
tion of the supreme officers, who act
ed as the committee of arrangements.
There was a well prepared programme
of dances, and the many that attend
ed had a very enjoyable evening.
The entire morning session was tak
en up in hearing the report of the su
preme president, which shows that
during the last twelve months there
has been a building up of the lodges.
A very creditable increase was made
in that line, as well as in finance. The
report shows that the order is in bet
ter condition than it has been at any
time since its institution. The order
has been fortunate during the last
year in having but two deaths.
At the afternoon session there were
a few changes in the laws, one to the
effect that the supreme chaplain shall
be elected before the supreme secre
tary and treasurer instead of after these
officers. Another was that no dele
gate who has not become a past pres
ident of a subordinate lodge shall be
eligible to the office of supreme pres
ident. The others were minor changes.
It was decided that the election for
officers shall be held this morning im
mediately after the reading of the
minutes.
The Supreme Lodge of the. Friends
of the Forest met in eighth annual
session yesterday in Mission Opera
Hall. The session was called to order
by Supreme President Mrs. Lillie A.
Dygert. Alf the .supreme officers,
past officers and delegates from the
several lodges of the order were pres
ent.

VICTOR, Colo;; June 7.â Two more
names were added to-day to the list of
those killed by the Independence dy
namiting. They '"are* George' S.' Hender
son and Fred Buckley. It is believed
that the bodies of several others were
blown to atoms and the remains are, in
the mass of flesh and bones at the bot
tom of the holp- made by the. tremen

Apart from a. few-small fights Jn con-
nection with the -rounding up' arid ar
resting of union- miners -no. -outbreak
has occurred in this district ;to-day.
Two local militia companies and a
small' army of f'armecT "deputies" under
Sheriff Edward Bell are In full control
of the camp. Though there has been
no turbulence to-day, there Is an un
dercurrent of feeling which bodes ill.
Secretary Clarence C. Hamlin of the
Mine Owners'- Association to-day de
clared that 200 prisoners now .'. held .in
the armory in Victor will be run over
the hills and warned never to '. return: 5
There is a minority element that want
to hang N.-W. O'Connell, fornier. Mar
shal of Victor, suspended and under
arrest; Alfred Miller, charged with
having started the riot which resulted
in the killing of Roxie McGee at the
mass meeting In Victor yesterday aft
ernoon, and several other leaders. No
hanging will take place, however, In all
probability unless resistance , is offered
by word or action of the prisoners. It
would require but little to result in a
wholesale hanging. '.
Virgil King, a union leader, and
fifteen others arrested in Cripple
Creek to-day, were taken to ' Victor
and deported. . â¢ ' : . ; . : 'i' :
The Victor Record, was- censored -by

Several boys, playing in the neigh

a portion of a cheaply made British
bulldog revolver. The weapon con
tained one empty shell.
The bloodhounds charge of Hugo
Pf aimer of Trinidad to-day traced the
assassin who killed the Findlay min
ers to a mile beyond Clyde station, a
distance of twelve miles. There the
scent was completely lost. It is be
lieved by the detectives working on
the case that the assassin took a bug
gy at that place and proceeded along
the old stage road to Colorado Springs.
The Coroner's Jury visited the scene
of the explosion to-day, after which
an adjournment was taken until 2
o'clock to-morrow afternoon, when
the taking of evidence will begin.
NIGHT OP KEEN ANXIETY.
Excited Throngs of People Crowd
Streets of Victor. ,
VICTOR, Cola, June 7.â Excitement
ran at a high pitch last night, 'although
no sensational- incidents occurred after
the riot of " the 'afternoon. " From dark
until jj dawn the principal : Streets were
almost as crowded as they were during
the day by thousands of men and wo
men, who had assembled from all part3
of the camp in-the' belief- that darkness
would invite further bloodshed. Their
expectations, however, Â¦ proved to be
groundless. : ;
Aside from the occasional arrest of a
union "agitator by the military author
ities or the Sheriffs deputies and the
occasional shriek of a' Krag-Jorgensen
from some dark, secluded spot in the
foothills. the night, passed quietly.
All night, however, the streets of the
city and the footpaths leading to and
from the mines were watched closely
by the; troops and the -deputies and
every "few minutes a hard-faced miner
was brought in and placed in the
armory, which is under heavy military
guard.
Mayor French said yesterday that in
his opinion no more troops are needed
here.
Â¦ "Company L, now on duty, consists
of sixty men," he said, "and the num
ber'can be increased to 100 if neces
sary. Besides these soldiers we have
a force ol armed deputies. The civil
authorities have perfect mastery of the
situation. Should the military turn
over their prisoners to the civil author
ities there will be no lynching."
"The Western Federation of Miners
will be banished from the district,"
declare the mine owners.
"It has not been proved that the
dynamiting was done by the federa
tion," retort union' men; "we have a
right to remain here.'.'
Both sides express a determination
to fight to the bitter end. Business is
practically suspended in Victor and
conditions in Cripple Creek are lit
tle, if any, better. All saloons are
closed by order of the authorities.
Many merchants closed their
stores and all who can are doubling
or trebling their insurance. . ! ..
By order of Mayor French the -Fire
Department has stretched a line of
hose from ' a fire* 'plug at the corner
of Victor avenue, under Third street,"
to the armory for the purpose of dis
persing the crowd without resorting
to. the use of arms.
There are now 200 union miners in
the ! bullpen and N others are being
rounded up. ( . ,

;There are various reports regarding
the comj>ensation they have been
promised. One is that they are to re
ceive 50 cent*-*n hour, with board and
lodging and transportation each way
from the place from which they came.
Another is that they are getting $2 50 a
day flat, with board and a bonus of
ZZ cents for each day they work. The
railroad officials refuse to state what
inducements have been offered* to the
new men.
The check clerks, of whom there are
about fifty, are the most pampered
Apparently"" the" railroad company
w&s doing fairly well yesterday in the
matter v? moving freight.. The con
gf Ftion that marked the first day of the
Birike was visibly lessened.. Only shed
G t whence freight for the city it dis
tributed, seemed .unduly . piled up.
Nearly every train that came into the
depot brought from three to thirty-five
recruits to the men who are handling
freight in lieu of the strikers. At 5
o'clock yesterday afternoon J. C. Wil
der, superintendent of the freight
yards, stated that he had about 250
men at work, which was about three
fourths of his regular crew. He thought
that- to-day there would be a sufficient
number of men at work to handle the
freight, even in the most crowded pe
riods.
The new men are fed and bedded in
the freight sheds and have no neces
sity to venture out among the strikers.
They have been recruited from various
places, as far couth as Bakersfield and
as far north as Portland." Most of them
look as thotigh they were farmers.
COMPAVY SECURING MEN.
At the freight yards of the Southern
Pacific. Fourth and Townsend streets,
yesterday and last night the only in
dications that a strike was on were
the groups of men loitering in the vi
cinity discussing the situation. Eight
patrolmen and two mounted policemen,
under command of Sergeant Mahoney,
patrolled the vicinity of the freight
eheds, but their services were not
called into requisition. About 2 o'clock
in the afternoon Captain of Police
Spillane went to the freight depot and
reviewed the situation. As he was
leaving he stated that he had no fear
that there would be any disorder.
The striking freight handlers have
established headquarters on Fourth
street, midway between Brannan and
Townsend. Here a large number of
them were congregated all day
and President Winsky of the union
spent the day there. In explaining the
grievances of the freight handlers, he
said:
There are tw6 " questions" Involved In â¢ tnis
strike. One U the Â«Â«rÂ« and the other the
hours of Iab6r. ~,Tb$ latter U *ubsidiary, tp
the Jormer. We are paid by' the hour for our
labor and the company reserve* the right to
r.ame what hours we cha.ll work.* If freight is
light we can only work two or three hours a
day, but when a rush cotnee we often; are
otligeA to put In eevrtiteen and eighteen hours
and a faiure to respond to an emergency
summons means dismissal.
Practically we are doing the same work as:
etevedoreti tcr Lesc than one-half . of the wage
received by them. Often' a man is obliged to
work twenty hoars a day at the, m6st ex
fc*.Ufct:r,s kind* . of l#bcr and then - is . called ,
Â«pcr. the following morning to resume work
fpr an hour or two. &t fer which hfs services
are dispensed with for a <3ay-or tÂ«n>.' The sys-;
i*m is so arramred that it scarcely ever: bap
{>cnÂ£ that one man â¢ <ao tnake f60 a mcr.th.
The very bfert workmen and the mo&t desira
ble to the amjary seldom make more than
I.'.r, a month.
What we are contending for Is a flat day
rate and pay for overtime. As long as we
mu&t respond to any summons of the company
we cannot 'undertake any. oth^er line of work
without disappointing ' our employers. But.
wben ;r<-:~bt is slack *e Â¦ must : loaX without
I>e.y. In other words, when the company
wants us for an hour or two it pays us; when
it doesn't want us it keeps us idle without ray
anfl without a chance to work at anything
else. Stevedores work this way, but they
receive more than double the compensation we
do. An hour schedule can be arranged that
wit! be satisf actory to both sides, I think,
but we must either have a satiKfactory flat
rate â¢ day or increased wages for this inter
mittent wcrk. . , Â¦
Reports were received from the pick
ets etatirg that freight was piled to the
rooofs of all the sheds and that the ut
most confusion prevailed. It was
stated that three trains of cars with
local freight were lying unloaded in the
yards and that in the West Oakland
yards many more trains were blocking
the tracks because there was not room
to track them in the yards in this city.
Fifty new men arrived last night, but
it is said by the union that nearly one
half of them were induced by the pick
etM not to go to work.
All of the speakers at the meeting
Ftrongly advised the men against the
least act of violence and the advice met
vith hearty responses from the men.
The union holds that there are only
about 150 working in the sheds and
that with such a force of inexperienced
freight handlers it will be utterly im
possible to manage the traffic.
XO DISORDER OCCURS.
An open meeting of the Interior
Freight Handlers' and Warehouse
men's Union was held at their regular
headquarters in the Alcazar building
la*t night and the question of the
etrike now in progress between the
union and the Southern Pacific Com
pany was discussed.
After the open meeting an executive
Fessioa was held and various members
of the organization and some of the
cfficials from the Labor Council ad
dressed the meeting, explaining to the
men some of the minor issues upon
Â¦which some of the members were not
t'ntirely clear.
The chock clerks had been invited to
attend the meeting, but only four of
them were present. They are not or
ganized, but the entire body held a
meeting at noon yesterday and by a
vote of 31 to 18 decided not to Join in
the strike. Another meeting of the
clerks will be held to-day, at which thc
question will again be considered. It is
stated that since the strike the wages
of the check clerks have been advanced
from J5 to 510 a month, with a promise
that the increase will be permanent.

STRIKERS REMAIN FIRM
VICTOR, Colo.. June 7.â Two hemp
ropes knotted with a noose for hanging
were lying on a table In the room
where the Cripple Creek district Mine
Owners' Association held a heated dis
cussion to-day behind closed doors. The
members were greatly Incensed by the
discovery of what they regarded as
the existence of a plot in the Victor
Miners' Union for the wholesale assas
sination of mine owners and miners.
This evidence was a bundle of forty
marked photographs found by Lieu
tenant Keegan in the Union Hall. On
the back of some of the 'photographs
was the name of James. Cochrane, sec
retary of the union. Among the photo
graphs were group pictures of men
employed in the mines. The most im
portant was a group of the night shift
of the Vindicator.
The photograph contains about twen
ty portraits, flve of which were num
bered from one to five. On the back
were written the names of the persons
numbered. Of the flve names, those of
Charles JlcCormlck and Melville Beck
had been crossed out. These two were
killed In the Vindicator explosion last
November.
On other photographs similarly ar-
ranged, It is asserted, there are crossed
out the names of some of the men who
have mysteriously disappeared.
James Cochrane was arrested and
taken to the mine owners' headquar
ters for a hearing.
"I do not know anything about these
pictures," he said, "pxcept that they
were taken to show the 'scabs.* The
marks by the names of the men who
have been killed are, mysterious to me.
I was not present when the pictures
were taken and cannot tell you any
more about them."
News leaked out to-day that had
Thomas Christianson been captured
la*t night three men, would have 1ieen
lynched. The plot was arranged and
a special train was standing, on the
Florence and Cripple Creek tracks to
carry a body of men who were ready
in Cripple Creek, awaiting a signal.
Alfred Miller, former Marshal Michael
O'Connell and Thomas Christianson
were regarded as ringleaders In the
rioting of yesterday and they were
marked for lynching on that account.
The failure to capture Christianson was
the only reason the plan was not car
ried out. The other two are still in
custody and awaiting the decision of
the citizens' vigilance committee as to
their fate.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., June
7. â A special train consisting of an
engine and two coaches, bearing fifty
union miners, deported from Cripple
Creek by the. citizens, passed through
this city this evening. It was going
at the rate of thirty miles an hour and
did not stop here. The first car was
empty and the second car had all the
blinds drawn and armed guards werp
on the platform.
The police and Sheriff's office here
were determined not to let the de
ported men stop here~ and arrange
ments were made with the Rio Grande
Railroad to carry them past this city.
It is presumed they are headed for

VICTORIA, B. C June 1.- â Bonds
to the amount of $100,000 have been
deposited by the agent of the Boston
Towboat Company on behalf of a
probable claim to be made by the
owners of the German steamer Nico
media, which towed the Â¦ steamer Ple
iades'ofthe American line mentioned,
a distance of 800 miles, and brought
her here. The Pleiades will be towe'd
to Tacoma, there to "discharge ~ her
passengers and freight and undergo
repairs.
The presentations will be made by
Vice President Pearce at 10 o'clock
this morning on board the steamship
Queen, at Broadway wharf. In addi
tion to a gold medal, Captain Cousins
will receive a gold, diamond studded
locket, suitably inscribed. There will
be sold medals for First Officer
In spite of the awful odds, of the
218 on board only fourteen lost their
lives. One of these, a woman, died as
the result of exposure; another woman
and two other passengers were
drowned through the unavoidable
capsizing of a boat; three members of
the crew were , burned to death and
seven were drowned.
When the alarm of fire was sounded
Captain Cousins, clad only In pajamas,
took charge of affairs and the victory
over the angry elements was largely
due to his good Judgment and cool,
unselfish bravery."
ONLY" FOURTEEN LOST.
The people of the Queen were
weighed In the balance. They were
not found wanting, and as soon as
the tangle caused by the disaster had
been straightened out Vice President
Pearce. set himself the task of finding
some appropriate way for the com
pany to say thank you.
The insurance companies interested
will probably do something of like na
ture, but the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company, not willing to let the mat
ter drag longer, decided to do its share
to-day and allow the underwriters to
take such action as they decide upon
Independently.
Fire was discovered in the after
cabin of the Queen at 4:30 a. m., Feb
ruary 27, when the vessel, bound
north with 218 souls aboard, was
about thirty miles west of -Tlllamook.
A gale was blowing at the time. It
will be remembered how Captain
Cousins first put the women and chil
dren and all other passengers not able
bodied and able to assist in fighting
the fire Into a lifeboats, which were
launched In charge of experienced
men. These boats remained with their
precious burdens under the lee of the
blazing steamship until those on board
had conquered the flames. On board
the coaster the engineers* crew, with
flames raging above and behind them,
kept up steam' and enabled those on
deck to pump, water on the hell of fire.
The Pacific C-ast Steamship Com
pany will to-day celebrate the return
into active service . of the steamer
Queen by decorating with gold and
silver medals Captain N. E. Cousins
and the other brave men that risked
their lives three months ago to save
vessel and passengers from destruc
tion. The story of that gallant fight
out on the cold, dark, storm-tossed
Pacific on the mornine of February
27, when flames and waves conspired
to overwhelm the gallant ship and
more than two hundred souls, fills, in
the marine history of the Pacific
Coast, one of its noblest chapters.
From captain to jcook, from the
most seasoned traveler to the frailest
woman and tiniest baby aboard, that
awful test revealed no sign of craven
heart. Each did his duty as it came
to hand. The neht was won. The
world: when it learned, said well done.
The company is now going to show
that even corporations have souls, and
this morning will give material recog
nition to the bravery of the men that
saved the Queen.
In the annals of the sea are the rec
ords of many brave deeds done by
sailormen in the line of their duty
and in some lands the government
makes official recognition of such
valor. The American merchant ser
vice is second to none in the quality
and number of its heroes, but in
stances of public recognition are con
spicuous by their rarity. It Is seldom
that a crisis brings out such general
Intrepidity as was exhibited on the
Queen and still less frequently do the
rank and file participate in the dis
tribution of the laurels. .
FOUND NOT WANTING. J
The Queen, thoroughly restored and
in some respects improved in the pro
cess, wllV sail to-morrow for the north
on her first voyage since that eventful
February morning.
"For singing 'Bedella- " is the in
scription engraved on the token await
ing Miss Peckenbaugh as soon as 'she
can be located.
"What's the matter wltn you people.
We're not going to die. The fire is
getting smaller. We will all be back
in our bunks in an hour. If you must
sing, sing 'Bedelia.' " Â¦
With that Miss Peckenbaugh's voice
was lifted in song and to the amaze
ment'of themselves and the wonder of
those aboard the steamer, everybody In
the boats was singing "Bedelia." From
"Bedelia" It was an easy step to other
lively airs and long before the boats
were recalled their occupants were al
most enjoying the novelty of the stern
situation.
Conspicuous service in fighting fire
and saving lives was rendered by some
of the passengers and these, too, have
been remembered by the company.
Captain I. N. Hibbard of the Northern
Commercial Company, who is now in
Alaska, worked like a trojan and in
appreciation for what he did a hand
some loving cup and a gold medal will
to-day be sent to his residence in this
city.
Captain McKay, a pilot In the com
pany's service in Alaska waters, will
also be remembered.
There is also a handsome token
awaiting Miss Peckenbaugh, a passen
ger whom Mr. Pearce has been for
weeks trying to locate. Singing "Be
della" as an accomplishment has out
grown its popularity, but it is by doing
this very thing that Miss Peckenbaugh
has placed the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company in her debt.\
When the life boats were launched
that dark, stormy morning the women
and children who had been aroused
from warm beds to face the bitter cold
and wet were subdued and fearful in
the face of the threatening tragedy.
In . < .e boat a voice was raised in
prayer and the sound of weeping was
heard above the roar of waters. A
voice was raised In song. "Nearer, My
God, ta Thee," was the refrain and with
trembling lips the fear dazed company
joined. The prayer ana the hymn
combined to deepen the morbid gloom
and as the last note of the sacred song
died in a chorus of sobs, a cheery voice
made all sit up and take notice.
SINGING "BEDELIA."
George E. Zeh, Chief Engineer W. J.
McCreedy and First Assistant Engin
eer W. E. Anderson. The medals for
the crew- will-be of silver. Altogether
sixty-seven medals will be given. .In
addition to these medals there will be
further recognition In a number of
instances for conspicuous service.
C. D. Dunann, general passenger
agent, who Is on his way to Alaska,
left behind a personal token to be
placed on the sideboard of Captain
Cousins' stateroom. This token is a
lofty stein of rare design, to be used
by the captain for ornament only.
Captain Cousins' tendency toward
embonpoint precluding the Indulgence

company's, regulations forbidding any

LOUISVILLE, Ky.. June 7.â The
Kentucky Democrats will hold their
State convention to-morrow for the
purpose of naming delegates at large
to the national convention at St. Louis
and to elect State Central and State
Executive committeemen. Though the
delegates are rather apathetic as re
gards the Presidential race and are
practically certain to vote for an un
instructed delegation to the national
convention, the contest for the con
trol of the party machinery, promises
to develop into one of the hardest
fights seen in recent years. On one
side are arrayed Governor Beckham
and the administration forces, sup
porting Lewis McQuown of Bowling
Green for chairman of the State Cen

*Pvcjl\ Dispatch to The OaU.
PHILADELPHIA, June 7.â Prior to
going to the State capital this after
noon to confer with Governor Penny
packer on the vacancy created by the
death of Senator Quay, United States
Senator Penrose and State Insurance
Commissioner Israel W. Durham held
numerous meetings with local and
State leaders on the situation. Before
leaving the city Penrose and Durham
reiterated their statements of yester
day that no one had been agreed upon
for' the place and that no announce
ment could be looked for for several
days.
Senator Penrose has been looked
upon as a State leader since the death
of Senator Quay, and the naming of
the new Senator is practically in his
hands. Western Pennsylvania will be
given the place, and there la a warm
contest between Allegheny County, in.
which Pithtsburg is situated, and In
diana County. Ex-Attorney General
John P. Elkin of Indiana County, who
was defeated for the gubernatorial
nomination two years ago and who
was recently nominated by the State
convention for Justice of the Supreme
Court for a term of twenty-one years
at a salary of $20,000 per annum,
is a candidate against the field. Al
legheny County has put forth four can
didates, two of whom are being seri
ously considered. They are George L.
Oliver and William A. Flynn.
Elderidge recently disposed of his in
terest in the Cane Belt Railroad to the
Santa Fe and was to become associa?
ted with John W. Gates, the Wall
street operator, in a railroad building
enterprise in Texas.
Elderidge came face to face with
Donovant on a railway train and be
fore the latter could draw his pistol
Elderidge fired and kflled him. He was
acquitted upon trial. Since that time
Elderidge's life has been threatened
time after time. Several months ago
an unknown person fired upon him at
close range, but the bullet missed its
mark. Elderidge had been urged by
his friends to leave here for 'a time,
but he declared he would not do so.
Calhoun. who Is alleged to have shot
Elderidge, is a brother-in-law of Don
ovant. His presence here was not gen
era\jy known until after the shooting. Â¦
EAGLE LAKE, Texas, June ".âEx
citement Is running very high here over
the attempted assassination of W. M.
Elderidge, the vice president and gen
eral manager of the Cane Belt Rail
road, which occurred here last evening.
The wound which Elderidge received
in the right lung is giving him much
trouble and there is small chance for
his recovery. He is displaying splen
did nerve and determination and his
physicians say they may pull him
through. The Winchester rifle bullet
passed entirely through his body.
As soon as the news of the tragedy
became known friends of the wounded
man began to come into tiwn.
W. E. Calhoun of Gainesville. TexaaÂ»
who was arrested and charged with the
crime shortly after the shooting, still
refuses to make a statement. It is
known, however, that the attempt to
kill Elderidge was due to the feud
which was started two years ago by
the killing of Captain William Dono
vant by Elderidge. Captain Donovant
was one of the wealthiest sugar plant
ers In the South. He was associated
with Elderidge in a number of busi
ness enterprises. Troubles arose be
tween them and Donovant is alleged
to have threatened to kill Elderidge on
sight. v:*"-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The fight between the Gray and the
anti-Gray factions became so bitter
that the former paid no attention to
Judge Gray's letter in which he asked
that the delegates be not Instructed.
They fought to defeat Kenny and
would not listen to anything that his
supporters offered. Judge Gray's letter
expressed his great anxiety for har
mony in the Democratic party this
year, and held that the Democratic
National Convention should be left free
to select as the candidate for Btoesident
the strongest and most available man.
He therefore requested that the dele
gates selected to represent Delaware
Democrats at St. Louis be not bound
by instructions.
DOVER, Del.. June 7.â Contrary to
the expressed wish of Judge George
Gray, the Delaware Democratic State
Convention by a unanimous vote to
day instructed its delegates to the St.
Louis Convention to present the name
of Judge Gray to the convention as the
choice of the Delaware Democracy for
the Presidency and to work for his
nomination. This action was taken
after one of the most stormy conven
tions ever held in the State. The leader
of the opposition to the Gray nomina
tion was former United States Senator
Kenny, who was opposed to the word
"instruct." He offered a resolution that
the delegates be "requested" to place
Judge Gray's name before the National
Convention.

DEAD WOOD, S. D., June 7.â Grief,
caused by the death of her daughter,
has resulted in Mrs. P. Carr, wife of a
prominent citizen and business man of
this city, becoming demented and de
veloping into an exceedingly dangerous
; "flre bug."
For some time property owners have
been greatly alarmed by the frequency
of fires, nearly a score of which were
clearly of incendiary origin. Mystery
surrounded the identity of the person
who set the fires. This has now been
solved. Mrs. Carr was detected while
in the act of attempting to set fire to
a business house. When arrested she
was in her night clothing.
The case Is an unusually sad one.
Since the death of her daughter some
months ago the unfortunate woman
has been demented and not responsible
for her acts, although she had been
considered harmless. J.

who read a paper on the curative
properties of music before the Pro

"It has been discovered that the
hearing apparatus of this little
nuisance," said' Mrs.' Holbrook, "Is
attuned to catch sounds and these can
be made to vibrate to the pitch of cer
tain musical notes. When these are
sounderl the entire nervous system of
the insect is affected and when raised
to a great number of vibrations per
second, yet in harmony with a lower
note, the mosquito becomes paralyzed.
When the note is sounded the mos
quito will plunge toward the music
and if windows are opened from the
outside Insects will flll the room and
will precipitate themselves against the
apparatus."

. The Japanese Consul in this city is in
receipt of instructions from the For

say to the traveling public that these
apprehensions are unfounded so far
as Japan proper is concerned. Perfect
tranquillity prevails throughout the Is
land Empire and tourists and business
men are assured that they may come
and go as safely and comfortably as
though no war existed.
These assurances are repeated by the
Kihiuki, which is a national associa
tion of great influence, especially
formed to welcc-me travelers to Japan
and to assist them in every way in
the prosecution of their plans, whether
of business or pleasure.
This information will undoubtedly be
received with satisfaction by the many
tourists and â¢'others who have deferred
contemplated trips to Japan from fear
of the annoyances which frequently ac
company a condition of war.
The attention of the Japanese author
ities has been directed to the fact that,
since the breaking out of hostilities
with Rus^W, a great falling off has
taken place "in the number of tourists
and business travelers who annually
visit Japan. ' This decrease is naturally
attributed to timidity on the part of
i*avelers, who fear danger and annoy
ance as the result of the war.

At the close of the arguments Jus
tice Clarke announced that he would
Five his decision later. The crowd was
then hustled out of the court room and
Mrs. Patterson taken through the Jus
tires' chambers to the street and in a
carriage to- the Tombs.
Assistant District Attorney Sand
ford said It would be a great pleasure
to the Coroner if he could discharge
th? woman, but he could not under the
pure question of law. The information
hud been laid before him that a crime
had been committed. The Assistant
District Attorney went on to describe
the wound and said that the woman
was the only one who was near the
dead man.
â¢"The pistol was held so close to the
coat that it could not have been held
by anybody but the defendant or the
dead man, and from the nature of the
wound the dead man could not have
returned the pistol to his coat pocket."
said Sandford, as he asked the court
to 'dismiss the writ.
Mrs. Patterson never took her eyes
from her counsel's face as he was mak
ing the argument, but she gave not the
slightest indication of nervousness or
?.nxiety over the outcome. From all
her demeanor shov.ed. she might have
been one of the half dozen women
fcpfctatprs in tn\ court room.
"Nan" Patterson was to-dajÂ» taken
before Justice Clarke of the Supreme
Court on a jrrit of habeas corpus.
When the proceedings were begun Cor
oner Brown produced a copy of the
affidavit on which the woman is held
by the Coroner. Attorney Unger, for
Mrs. Patterson, referring to the affi
davit, said that they were confronted
by a paper which purported to be a re
turn, but was in such shape that he
doubted that the District Attorney'3
Â«S3ce was . responsible for it. He then
demurred formally to the return.
'"This looEe paper is for a dilatory
purpose," declared Unger. He then
went into the law as to Coroners' in
quests and said that a Coroner had no
pov.er to imprison a person accused of
crime before the inquest unless the
person were not In custody.
"In order to enable the Coroner to
act there must be information laid be
fore him that a murder had been com
mitted." said Unger.
"Or suicide," Interposed Justice
Clarke.
"Young Corbett" has promised to ad
\ ance - the funds required for the de
fense of "Nan" Patterson. He is much
Interested in the young woman ana
says he does not believe her capable
of the crime. They were friends in
San Francisco and at one time it was
reported that they were to be mar
ried. \Through his manager, John
Pollock, the pueiliFt made arrange
ments to furnish ball for the actress,
and if it is decided to-morrow that she
is entitled to bail "Young Corbett" will
be on hand with a bond.
"Nan" Patterson in prison Is reason
ably cheerful. She is making a collec
tion of her newFpaper portraits. Her
mother is seriouslv ill in Washington.
The attorneys for the defense will
fail to prove that "Caesar" Young was
despondent over money matter**. He
Irft a fortune of half a million to his
widow.
KEW YORK, June ".âIt was not
with his own revolver that "Caesar"
Young was shot to death. The weapon
vu Â»old by G. R. Schneider in Novem
ber, 1SSS, In the establishment of Shov
erllcg. Daly & Gates, 302 Broadway.
At that time Young was In San Fran
cisco. So close to the ownership of the
revolver are the detectives getting that
they arÂ« confident of sensational de
velopments in the near future.
At a late hour to-night Detective Ser
geant Armstrong went to the apart
ments of J. Morgan Smith, who is mar
ried to a elster of "Nan" Patterson,
but was unable to obtain from him
information of great Import. It is un
derstood Smith was in New York dur

Questions relating to the ownership
of the revolver with which "Caesar"
Young was shot a subpena was served

Special Dispatch to Tbe Call
Three bold robberies have been re
ported to the police within the last two
days from the vicinity of Grant avenue
and Post street. Monday afternoon
Miss Fuller, who conducts a lodging
house at 213 Grant avenue, surprised a
burglar at work and frightened him
away. Early the same morning $600
in coin and $100 in jewelry were stolen
from Mrs. Weaver at HI Grant avenue
by two clever thieves. A few hours
after the last mentioned crime, bur
glars entered a barber shop at 106
Union Square avenue by means of a
ladder and rifled the telephone box.
According to the report made by Miss
Fuller at the Central Police Station the
burglar that entered her lodging house
was a short, stout man and well dress
ed. He had opened and searched three
apartments by means of a skeleton
key before he was discovered. Miss
Fuller, who was attracted by a noise,
followed the man into the third apart
ment. When she entered he was in
the act of searching a bureau drawer.
The landlady stood on the threshold
and demanded an explanation, but the
thief, with an oath, sprang at her and
throwing her from his path dashed
down the stairway and into the street.
The three apartments had been thor
oughly Ransacked, but little of value
taken. â¢
A stranger robbed the apartments
of Mrs. Weaver early Monday morn
ing. His accomplice stood in the hall
way and when the principal in the theft
secured the loot his pal made away
with it. On the pretext that he was
acquainted with .Mrs. Weaver the
stranger stated that he had called to
give her some information. While she
was In another room he entered the
one she had vacated and secured $5S0
in gold coin, $20 in silver and $100 In
jewelry. Just as the woman returned
he slipped a satchel containing the loot
to an accomplice and both made their
escapo.
During the early hours yesterday
morning the barber shop at 106 Union
Square avenue was robbed. The bur
glars entered a lodging house occupied
by colored people at 20J Post \street.
and, patios to tne rear of the house,
secured a ladder and let themselves
down to the roof of the Union Square
avenue building. Then they pried off
a sky light. and made a search of the
shop. With the exception of the coin
that wan in the telephone box they took
nothing. This crime was also reported
to the police.
"YOUNG CORBETT"
APPEAES IX CASE
Japanese warships are making Dalny
their headquarters and are coming and
going continuously. They take tarns
guarding the entrance to Port Arthur.
The Jimks further report that Chi
nese are no longer allowed to leave
Port Arthur and that the Japanese are
punishing the bandits who raided Dal
ny and Talienwan. Three bandits have
been executed and sixty have been ar
rested.
The Junks saw nothing of the Japan
ese fleet off Port Arthur.
It Is believed here that a naval battle
took place last night in the Gulf of
Pechili. Passengers on steamships
passing the Liaotshan Promontory at
the time did not hear any firing, while
reports come from Tengchow of heavy
firing being heard there from 11 o'clock
last night until 2 o'clock this morning.
Vessels from the Miaotao Islands con
firm this report and so do the residents
of hills In the vicinity of this city, who
heard the firing and saw the flashes
out at sea during the night.
The fact that the Russians were en
deavoring on June 4 to clear the road
steads off Port Arthur of mines indi
cates an intention upon their part to
give battle outside the harbor upon the
first favorable opportunity.
A Japanese correspondent returning
from Talienwan says there is a persis
tent rumor there that the Japanese
battleship Yashima^ struck a mine off
that port recently and was sunk.
CHEFU, June 8.â A fleet of Junks
which has arrived from Dalny for the
purpose of buying stores for the Japan
ese report having heard continuous fir
ing between Dalny and Port Arthur for
several days.
Finally the* Japanese fire on the
crest bf the hills located them and the
assailants swarmed up almost inacces
sible cliffs.
The Japanese at first kept in the
shelter of* the rocks, but the Russian
fire searched them out and they flitted
shadowlike across the rocks as the
Cossacks continued to- advance, while
the dragoons cleared the valleys lead
ing from the amphitheater. The Jap
anese cavalry retreated, unwilling to
risk a collision at close quarters.
The Russian line encircled one great
hill on which was the principal Jap
anese position and like a living ribbon
crept toward the summit. Colonel
Sereda led the advance until he fell
wounded half way up the cliff. The
command devolved upon Lieutenant
Colonel Chlcsville, who continued the
forward movement, clearing the Jap
anese from the heights.
In the meantime a Russian battery
placed an accurate shrapnel fire among
the hilltops, hastening the Japanese
retreat. Two Japanese sharpshooters
on a hill seriously annoyed the Rus
sians at a critical period of the Ad
vance. An officer of Terileskl's com
pany scaled the rocks in the /ace of
almost certain death and killed both of
the. Japanese, returning unharmed.
Soon after the Russians had occu
pied the hilltop and an intrenched vil
lage they received an order to retire.
Just then the artillery reserve was
brought into action and s-howered the
retiring Russians with Fhrapnel. but
failed to get the exact range.
Besides Colonel Sereda, seventeen
Russians were wounded in the day's
encounter. The Japanese losses, owing
to the accuracy of the Russian artil
lery fire, seemed heavy.
TOUMSTS ARE SAFE
THROUGHOUT JAPAN
LIAOYANG, June 7.â The Japanese
have drawn in their advance guards
from Vafangow. They blew, up part of
the railway and the telegraph station
on the night of June 3. The damage
will be soon repaired.
SamsonofTs Cossacks are harassing
the Japanese toward Port Arthur.
Cossacks searching the hills occasion
ally catch detached partjes unawares.
Samsonoff's fight with the Japanese
on June 3 in the valley of Putsiantun
took place in an immense amphithea
ter in theÂ«fitlls. Samsonoff threw for
ward skirmishers to feel out the Jap
anese positions. The Cossacks and
dragoons crept forward, examining the
steep hillsides, deep ravines and dry
water courses likely to protect Jap
anese ambuscades.
"The soldiers, who were dressed like
pirates, said they mistook us for a
pirate boat they were seeking. They
afterward donned uniforms.
"I walked to Tienchwang to summon
assistance. One of the Chinese crew
was badly wounded and it is not likely
that he will recover." u>
DENVER. June 7. â Anna B. Etzel,
a stenographer living in this city wiÂ£h
her mother and sister, received a ca
blegram to-dav announcing the death
of her brother, Lewis Etzel. a news
paper correspondent, who was killed
by Chinese soldiers. Lewis Etzel was
the eon of Gabriel Etzel, who died
several years ago in this city. The
dead correspondent was 36 years of
ape. He left home about ten years
ago.
Etzel had traveled extensively and
had accompanied some of the most
famous Eastern exploration expedi
tions. He had often penetrated some
of the wildest parts of the East Indies,
and with Russell Harrison, a son of
ex-President Harrison, made a won
derful trip through the jungles of
Borneo in 1901.
LONDON. June 7.â Ernest Brlndle,
the Dally Mail's correspondent In Man
churia, in a description of the death
of Lewis Etzel, the Daily Telegraph's
correspondent, who "was shot by Chin
ese soldiers while in a junk between
Shwantaitze and Erdiko, says:
"Our intention was to cruise along
the Ltaotung coast. About 6 o'clock In
the morning the Junk was surrounded
by four sailing boatB manned by Chin
ese soldiers, who, without explanation,
opened fire, their shots falling all over
our boat. We were below reading and
waiting and Etzel, looking cut, re
peived a fearful wound in the back of
the head and expired in a. few mo
ments.
NEWCHWANG, June 7.â A pri
vate telegram received from Shanhai
kwan says that Lewis Etzel, corre
spondent of the London Daily Tele
graph, and Ernest Brlndle of the Lon
don Daily Mail were fired upon by
Chinese soldiers while In a Junk be
tween Shwantaitze and Erdicko. Et
zel was killed, but Brindle is believed
to be safe. They left here on June 3
to investigate the movements of some
bandits.

SACRAMENTO, June 7.â The Grand
Jury to-day, through Colonel H. Wein
stock, the foreman, Instructed District
Attorney Seymour to bring suit against
the Board of Supervisors, County Au
ditor and County Treasurer to recover
the sum of $4822 21, which if is al
leged they allowed without legal war
rant during, the year 1903.
It is declared in the report that much
of this money was appropriated and
many offices created In spite of the
opinion of the District Attorney that
it could not legally be done. Among
the items is $700 for the reception to
President Roosevelt and the donation
to the Fourth of July celebration fund.
In interviews to-night the Supervisors
declare they made the appropriations in
the public interest and tltat among the
citizens who came before them and
urged the appropriations wen some of
tha very men who, as members of the
present Grand Jury, signed the report
condemning their action.

BROOKS SAYS FAREWELL
There was more singing and then
Professor Brooks rose to present the
class. He prefaced this pleasant duty
with a few remarks of personal ac
knowledgment of the many kind words
said of him on the occasion of his re
tirement. Then he announced that the
members of '04 were ready and quali
fied to receive their diplomas. Super
intendent of Schools William H. Lang
don, after a brief address to the class,'
requested Professor Brooks himself to
presest the diplomas. This he did with
words of affectionate farewell to his
last class. The graduates were as fol
lows: J N
The American parents are the best In the
world. (Applause.) They have learned i the
leseon of obedience, if their children have not.
(Laughter.) They are slaves to their chil
dren. American mothers, as I have often had
occasion to observe, retire from the enjoy
ments of life Juet as their daughters are pre
paring to enter upon .them. The eelf -sacrifice
of such parents Is a characteristic of Ameri
can life. If such sacrifice has been made for
you. be you worthy of it. â¢ rr
1 cannot leave the stage without aome
reference to the oarticular event that marks
this occasion. We all wish Professor Brooks
delightful rest at his Sablne farm. The teach
er's life is one of heroic sacrifice. We have
all seen ' men who - might have amassed for
tunes in business or the lucrative professions
turn deliberately aside. . abandon their chance
of prosperity and * even ' sometimes â¢ of a com
petency, and relinquish the. possibility of
starting their children prosperously In life,
all In order that they might' advance the
prospects and promote the welfare of the
young. Foreign teachers are better paid than
American in proportion to other incomes. Our
schools are better here In every other respect
than this.
' In conclusion, and with special reference
to Professor Brooka, I wish to recall with you
Kipling's stirring lines, "Let us' now praise
famous men." The famous men he mentions
are the teachers who taught him to render
obedience without excuses. Â¦
AMERICAN' PARENTS OBEY.
To-night I can think of nothing more Impor
tant to Impress upon you than the old saying
that the three things most worth while are
reverence, obedience and the purer life. Of
the last little need be said, because purity is
a distinction of American life. But does not
our American freedom and equality produce
a lack of reverence? No doubt there are good
reasons why this should be. The American
boy or girl has little reverence for the paat
because he sees few relics of it. In England,
and still more it Italy, the past is all about
the young. student, and he grows up In rever
ence for the things that have endured. But
In America how far back can any boy go* In
Chicago, to the fire. (Laughter.) Even in Cal
ifornia, with our Interesting ruins of the mis
sions, we hare little else â¢Â» excite reverenco
for history. But we nee4 to cultivate tlio
spirit, for although our -American institutions
are superior to those of the Old World, we
can understand them only by studying their
origin in the history ot other nations. It waa
the work of these that made possible our mod
ern civilization and its blessings.
But more important still is obedience. I
think the principal! difference between the
English and the American student Is that the
former does what you tell him to do. The
American student, particularly a girl, asks
"Why?" (Laughter.) Now, curiosity Is ad
xnlrabla 60mctimes, but there are times when
even life depends upon swift obedience. One
reason why I believe In college athletics Is
that the American boy learns on the football
field what we seem unable to teach him in
the classroom â namely, to do what he is told.
It iÂ» the people who aek "Why?" that 'are
making excuses for failure to do their duty.
Excuses -are . only known in. American schools.
I had about made up my mind to make my
remarks this evening an expansion of Charles
Kingsley's beautiful lines beginning: .
"Be good.' sweet girl, and let who win be
clever." v
But happily I bethought myself to consult one
of ?he brightest girls in my classes at the uni
versity. She is a sophontore, and. therefore,
of course, knows everything. (Laughter. > This
wise woman said, . "LK>n't talk to these girls
as girls. Just talk to them as you do to your
boys." And I shall try to follow her cage
advice, remembering my responsibility In view
of the fact that many of you are likely to come
over to the university and become members of
my classes.
Then the class sang another chorus,
"The Shoogy Shoo," sang it, too, in a
fashion that made every one in the
room glad he was there. Professor
Henry Morse Stephens of the Univer
sity of California was introduced for
the leading address of the evening â an
address full of wit as well as of com
mon sense and fatherly counsel t to the
young debutantes in life. He laid in
STEPHENS' WITTY ADDRESS.
The United MaiÂ«Â» was the first nation to
realize that schools are destined to supersede
earrlson? as factors In the world's civilization.
Our public schools are our greatest glory, for
they are developing the hij.iR-.--i types of men
and women. Lart year more than 453,000
teachers were employed In the public echool?,
with nearly 17.000,000 pupils under them. Al
moit $100,000,000 annually Is the cost of these
schools, and when we capitalize this sum and
add the permanent capital Invested in bulld
lnps and apparatus It Is seen that the Ameri
can people have given more than sentiment to
the education of the children of the rich and
the poor.
One of the most significant facts in Ameri
can education iÂ« the vast number of young
women in our schools and colleges. We have
demonstrated that there is nothing unhealthy
or abnormal in this. Women are as worthy of
education and endure Its demands upon the
physical and mental outfit as well as men.
Their education has an Important bearing upon
the general question of An/rican education,
for the great majority of them are destined
to preside over homes and to become the teach
ers of their own/ children. Thus the. work of
educated mothe/s will promote thÂ« highest
morality and the noblesN citizenship and
greatly advanca theV^emocracy of learning,
which is the ideal of Alnerlcan life.
The great hall of the Girl's High
1 School presented a scone last evening
that did San Francisco proud. Every
; seat in the auditorium was taken by
parents and friends of the members
of the class of '04. On the broad stage,
against a beautiful background of flags,
palms and lilies, were seated the two
ecore members of the class, arrayed in
simple white and more attractive than
the beautiful flowers of California, huge
bunches of which they bore in their
hands. It was their graduation night
and the event was made doubly mem
| orable for them by the fact that it was
also the graduation of their 1 beloved
i principal. Ellsha Brooks, after twelve
| years of noteworthy service as head of
! the school. Besides speeding the part
ing guest, the class had the pleasure of
welcoming the coming principal of the
school in the person of Professor
Brooks' successor, Dr. Scott of Oak
land.
Alfred Roncovierl. president of the
School Board, presided. The pro
gramme opened with two choruses ad
mirably sung by the entire classÂ»under
the leadership of their competent sing
ing teacher, Miss Estelle Carpenter.
: The songs were Handel's "Largo" and
, Schubert's "Hark, Hark, the Lark."
i^Then President Roncovieri read a brief
address, saving among other things:
State Commissioner Filcher is going
to California to have it out with the
butter men, who, he says, have "thrown
down" the commission In the matter
of supplying that substanc.e. .He Inti
mates that failure to get Jobs at the
fair under the commission caused the
"throw down." There Is a chance here
for another lively scrap.
, A space In theÂ» refrigerator section,
â¢where the world's butter display is to
be made, has been secured by the com
mission, but only enough ; butter has
been sent to model the figure repre
senting California. Consequently Call-
Kings County also shows a good
quality of cotton, and many Southern
ers inspect it, with interest. , . . ., >
FILCHER NEEDS BUTTER.
The Kings County display has been
enriched by the receipt of a large in
voice ot- cereals In the stalk, part of
this year's crop. There is wheat six
and a quarter feet high, barley four
feet ten inches high and oats five feet
high, all beating fine, large heads, just
ripening. Alfalfa, four and a half feet
high, is among- the lot. These pro
ducts, stood in large sheaves in front
of the booth and artistically arranged
on its sides, are attracting the atten
tion of many Eastern farmers, who
are thus given a good demonstration
of what California grain fields will
produce. The. wily Kings County peo
ple . know that . if an Eastern home
seeker, is lured there by the display of
wheat and barley he will soon go to
raising more profitable crops of. fruit
and grapes. Cereals always look good
to an Eastern farmer. They mean
wealth in his region.
The Kings County people have also
sent* on an exhibit of silk worms and
cocoons. These are not on mulberry,
but on oak branches and, are attract
ing great attention. If the- oak leaf
proves a sufficient food for the worma
the industry in California will receive
a great impetus.
As already stated by. The Call, the
central feature will be a relief map of
the university grounds and buildings
as they will appear when the enlarge
ment plans are carried out. The map
is 7x15 feet and the buildings will be
shown by accurate models.
KINGS COUNTY CEREALS.
Electric lights placed at the backs of
the cabinets and cases will make
transparencies ci" them. These lights
will be- kept burning constantly during
exhibit hours. Five" hundred will be
used in the Installation.
On two sides of the pavilion cabinets
thirteen feet in height will be con
structed against the wall. These will
contain photographic views and other
interesting material. On another side
will be the Lick exhibit, thirteen feet
high and eighteen feet long, also con
tained in a cabinet. The rest of the wall
space will be filled In with bookcases
and cabinets. All around the pavilion
will be a blue frieze five feet wide, with
golden lettering, showing the activities
of the university in all the various de
partments. - On the floor, extending
along all four sides, will be showcases
containing a display from the univer
sity library. Over the entrances will
be placed redwood panels on carved
brackets, the panels bearing the words
"University of California" in golden
letters.
WITHIX THE PAVILION".
CALL BUREAU, v WORLD'S FAIR,
ST. LOUIS, June 7.â The wbrk of in
stalling the University of California
display at the Louisiana Purchase Ex
position is well under way. It is being
conducted under the supervision of
Henry H. Hedger. assistant to Pro
fessor Galen Howard, architect of the
greater university, and' J. Marshall
Steel, who will be 'custodian of the ex
hibit. The design was prepared by Mr.
Hedger.
It is apparent from the material sent
on and the installation design that the
university will make a display that will
be an object lesson to the world of the
progress of the furthest Pacific State
and the proud position she holds to-day
in the field of letters and science.
Every department of the university,
on both sides of the bay, will be repre
sented. Perhaps the most notable ex
hibit will be that of the Lick Observ
atory. This is a complete exposition of
the advanced astronomical work of this
celebrated Institution, and doubtless
will be a magnet to scientists from all
over the world and the many others
Â¦who wish to gaze into thg opened book
of the heavens. Mr. Hedger thinks no
finer astronomical display has ever
been made than that prepared by the
Lick Observatory.
Redwood is used in the framework of
the university exhibit. The skeleton
was constructed in Oakland and un
loaded, ready-made, in the space al
lotted, which will save a great deal of
time.

The SrQuola Cluh-the nw organisa
tion of salonic tendenciesâ held its first
function latt night at the tit. FVancls.
Tho affair had Itr-cn dipl-'niatically an
ntWinced as informal â therefore was
â¢ there a fascinating lot of nien to talk
to. And that's a Â£ood beginning for
any club. Men and money are two
necessary Hements of success and both
vore tangibly near last night.
More than K>0 men and women gath
ered In the red and gold drawing-room,
the most of whom were exponents of th<>
arts or the professions. But the truth
to tell, the smart set, many of whom
were present at the initiatory gather
ing early in Slay, was appallingly scarce
â but, of course, it was the early pil
grimage to the pines or seashore rather
than disinclination to mingle with mere
artists and mksters and the rest of
the ilk who earn money that produced
the Stygian void.
The members and guests were re
ceived in charming fashion by Presi
dent Aiken, Mrs. Albert Gerberding,
John McXaught. Consul Courtenay
Bennett and William Greer Harrisonâ
ths guiding star Miss Ednah Robinson,
however, was conspicuously absent
from the receiving line.
Altbouph without crystallization of
energy much cheery chatter was heard
through the rooms, and many were the
types of guests that sauntered about.
Likewise was the merry Jingle of coin
heard to tinkle to the chatter. It being
yood form in the Sequoia for the mem
bers to become- persona grata with the
treasurer â the initiation fee of two dol
lar* for charter members and dues of
60 cents per month rolling up quite a
propitiatory 6um. The initiation fee, by
the way, will be raised to $10 atjer the
l&lh â so haste thee, salon-sigheris^est

Filcher claims that the Creamery As
sociation promised to supply all" the
material necessary. It sent 500 pounds
for the statue, but 500 pounds more is
needed.
"When we first asked the association
for, butter," said Filcher. "it sent a
committee to us and the members
swelled up and wanted all sorts of
positions for men' to attend to the dis
play here. We told them all we wanted
was the butter. They sent 500 pounds
and then when we needed the other
BOO they wrote on that they wouldn't
supply any more.' That was because
somebody -wanted a job. Secretary
Sailor wrote that we needed somebody
to look after the, details of the butter
exhibit. â¢ I wrote back and said 'Yes:
we ought. to hire you; all you've don#
is â¢ to send on modeling' butter that
won't do for modeling.'
: "I have been promised 100 pounds of
butter already by WoodlaÂ»d creamery
and think I can set the rest."
Commissioner Filcher will also,- see

'A'AWA'*'AWA'*4Â°*A 4'4"*'**4* WÂ«fc*raÂ«*WÂ« ******* '*A*M'4**'*'* ******* *****As the postal regulations prohibit
the soliciting of, business for a post
office with ; the object of having the
postmaster's pay Increased, Leydecker
found himself in a serious predicament
and is still there. Nissen also accuses
Leydecker of occasionally buying the
stamps himself in order to keep up the
receipts of his office and then peddling
the stamps out.
It has reached Alameda from au-
8OLICITIXG FROlimiTKD.
Nissen In his charges accused Ley
decker of soliciting the sale of stamps
outside of Alameda in order tv In
crease the receipts of his . office and
thereby Increase his salary, as the lat
ter is rated upon the basis of the cash
business transacted at me postofflce.
Nissen furnished the postal authorities
with letters in which Leydecker had
asked persons to purchase stamps in
Alameda, and "also receipts for . some
t-f the sales. It is held by the postal
authorities that in accordance with
the normal sale of stamps the post
master of Alameda is entitled to a sal
ary of about $2500 a year, but that
Leydecker had, through soliciting the
sale of stamps on the outside, increased
his salary to 52900 a year.
ALAMEDA, June 7.â Postmaster T.
W. Leydecker's position is said to be,
in Jeopardy as a result or charges filed
against him with the Postmaster Gen
eral by G. A. Nissen, who was retired
from the local , postofflce staff on
charges preferred against him by Ley
decker. T. G. Daniell?, editor of the
Alameda Argus, it is afiirmed by those
high in political councils, is to bs
named as postmaster in the event "of
Leydecker'a removal, which is regarded
as very probable.
"I have not received official informa
tion as to the result of the Investiga
tion of the charges against me and am
not worrying over the matter. I un
derstand that there are a number of
people in Alameda seeking my office. I
do not consider it as being significant
that the postal authorities have not
disposed of the charges against me as
quickly as they did of the charges I
preferred against Nissen."
It was found In the Investigation by
Fourlh Assistant Postmaster General
Rristow that because of the manner In
which the receipts of the Alameda
postofflce had been Increased by out
pide soliciting of the sale of stamps
the Alameda Postmaster, had re
ceived about $000 more than he was en
titled to. " This money, it is said, has
been returned to the Postofflce Depart
ment by Loydecker. When seen con
cerning the charges against him, Ley
decker said:
thoritative sources that Fourth As
sistant Postmaster General Bristow,
who conducted the investigation of the
charges made by Nissen against Ley
decker, fuund . that most of them were
true and decided that under the law
the Postmaster should be removed.
Leydeeker's friends then came to
his aid and went to Congressman Vic
tor H. Metcalf on behalf of the accused
Postmaster. The Congressman asked
tho Postofllee Department for a full
copy of the charges and findings, to be
examined by him. These are now in
Mr. Metoalf's possession ana he has in
formed the friends of Leydecker that
he will fully and fairly investigate the
charges against the Postmaster and
make known the result later.

another patch of two hundred acres
near Paso de Robles ehows signs of
being affected.

with the disease in the same way that
it is dealt with in the East. This con

The trouble all grew out of a con
tract that Professor Leuechner. and
Coionel Fisk entered into two years
ago for the rental of the professor's
house. The professor, so the story
goes, agreed to let the colonel have
his house for six months, but before
the colonel occupied the house he
changed hi* mind, having found an
other that suited him better. This
didn't suit the professor and he forth
with began suit for $280 rent.\
Justice Edgar decided the suit in fa
vor of Colonel Fisk after it had been
dragged along in his court for nearly
two years. But -tile professor thinks
still that the law is on his side and
so he has appealed to the Superior
Court for redrees, the appeal having
been filed to-day.
Professor A. O.Leuschne # r, director of
the students' observatory, at the Uni
versity of California, is bound to col
lect the rent he considers Colonel R. A.
FiFk of Berkeley owes him if it takes
all the courts In the land to help him.
The learned professor is nof averse to
dividing his. time between the law and
the stars and he finds that he can at
tend to the satellites of the courtroom
in the daytime as well as he can to
the planets of the heavens in the night
time.

A. E. Skinner, formerly a Southern
Pacific Company locomotive engineer,
went on a rampage at his residence,
469S Telegraph avenue, last night, and,
according to charges, brutally beat and
kicked his wife and knocked his motB
er-in-law, Mrs. J. G. Larned. senseless
from blows on the head with a club,
when she went to her daughter's res
cue. Dr. Charles E. Dukes and Dr.
Hi N. Rowell, who attended the in
jured women, say that Mrs. Larned's
condition is serious. At 2 o'clock this
morning Skinner was arrested.
The wife, Mrs. Mary Skinner, swore
to a complaint in the police court
charging her husband with battery.
Pending the result- of Mrs. Larned's
injuries, the police will hold Skinner
in ' custody. The older woman is 60
years of age.
Mrs. Skinner was marked by several
bruises and a bad scalp wound when
she appeared at court this^ morning.
The injured wife said her spouse's ac
tion was caused by a ilt oft drunken
anger. There had been some callers at
the house and they were departing.
Skinner angrily demanded to know why
his wife had not accompanied them to
the door. Mrs. Skinner's reply did not
please the husband, who, it is claimed,
struck his wife a heavy blow, knock
ing her down. Then he kicked the
prostrate* woman.
Mrs. Larned rushed to the scene and.
declares Mrs. Skinner, was struck sev
eral times on the head with a club that
the infuriated man had grabbed.
> Screams for help aroused the neigh*
borhood and thÂ«\ police took a hand in
the trouble, arresting Skinner. He de
nied that he had struck his mother
in-law. -.â¢â¢/, !Â¦-Â¦;

In this connection the commission
will on next Monday evening set | a
date and adopt a scope for the next
examination for promotions as police
sergeants and lieutenants. Examina
tions will also be held for police patrol
drivers and ambulance drivers In the
Department of Health.
The Civil Service Commission de
cided yesterday to abolish the medical
examinations for promotions in the
Police Department. The commission
assigns as a reason that the re-exam
ination of employes of the department
is superfluous because if they are re
jected by the medical board they are
still retained in the department in the
positions they occupied when apply
ing for promotions. It is said that the
board rejected fourteen applicants of
patrolmen for ttie last civil service ex
amination for corporals as medically
unfit, but they are still performing the
duties of patrolmen.

Continue Dairy Inspection.
Health Officer Ragan yesterday de
tailed District Health Officers Tillman
and Dillon to continue the inspection
of dairies which was temporarily sus
pended owing to the suspension of
Dairy Inspectors Smith ;tnd O'Connor.
Drs. Dillon and Adler will see to it
that the sanitary requirements are
riRidly adhered to in all dairies and
will report directly to Health Officer
Rapan.
Supervisors Bent and Sanderson of
the committee raised thtÂ» point that
ihe rules could not b<? enforced unless
they were incorporated in an ordi
nance formally passed by the Board of
Supervisors. Health Officer Ragan
contended that the Health Board had
jiower under the general ordinance
riving it supervision overjthe sanitary
conditions of the city to make such
regulations as it saw fit. The com
mittee thought that some of the rules
Â»ere too severe and after some dis
cussion referred the matter to the
Health and Hospital Committee to
consider a proposed ordinance on the
FUbject-
This action is not satisfactory to the
health officials, as they fear that the
dairymen will successfully oppose the
adoption of laws aÂ« covered by the
rules with the rlajm that they are too
drastic and would work a hardship on
thoir business. However, the health
officials are prepared to vigorously
urge the passage of the proposed ordi
nance, as the Board of Health fully
intends to continue its crusade for per
fect sanitary conditions in the hand
ling of milk and to force owners to
3\Â«Â»< > p their dairies clean.
The committee reported in favor of
printing the "Health Hints for the
Household," as prepared by the Health
Board for the guidance of the com
munity at large in preserving good
health condition*.
The rules were adopted by the
Health Board and it was desired to
have them printed in pamphlet form
in ordor lo acquaint ihp proprietors
of dairies with the sanitary require
ments to insure their privilege to con
tinue business.
The Supervisors' Priming Commlt
tre yesterday expressed itself as not
in favor of thr re^uost of the Board
of Health that provision be made for
the printing of the rules and regula
tions for the conduct of dairies in or
der that they bo kept in a perfectly
tanitary condition.
No hint Is being given by any offi
cial with authoritv to speak as to the
name of Elbert's probable successor
as warden of the hospital. Strong
pressure is being brought to bear to
bring about the appointment of James
McQuaide, at present assistant warden
of the Institution, to the wardenship.
Owing to a protest by the Civil Service
Commission, McQuaide is not receiving
any salary, and would be delighted to
secure the promotion.
Dr. William M. Lawlor, formerly
Health' Officer and at present receiv
ing clerk at the hospital. Is also an
aspirant for the position, but.it is not
belleved'that either McQuaide- or Law
lor will be selected. A third candidate,
whose name Is not revealed^ will like
ly secure the wardenship. which car
ries with it a salarv of $200 per month.
As the Health Board Is disinclined
to burden the existing administration
of the Health Department with any
further scandal, it has been keeping
the proposed removal of Warden El
bert a secret. The investigation has
been quietly conducted and the mat
ter has had all the ear marks of star
chamber proceedings. Elbert himself
knows that he will be compelled to give
up ofllce, and is said to have remarked
recently to one of his intimates that
he would be in the Institution but a
few days more as Its administrative
head.
With the knowledge that he will hot
be In charge of the hospital very much
longer, it is said, Elbert has vented his
spite on several subordinates bv sus
pending them for a temporary period.
These suspended employes have car
ried their tales of woe regarding El
berfs course to the Health Board com
mittee, and his case has not been help
ed in any way thereby.
This Is the second time that Elbert
has held the office of warden of the
City and County Hospital. He was ap
pointed superintendent, as the office
was then called, for a period of one
year by the Phelan Board of Health.
It was then thought that a layman
would conduct the institution more
successfully than a medical man. The
experiment did not prove a success,
and Elbert was removed, to be suc
ceeded by Dr. R. S. McElroy. At that
time Elbert charged that he had been
removed because, as he put it, "I
would not do the dirty work of the
Phelan Board of Health." Elbert made
several sensational charges, at the time,
but they came to naught.
SGCCESSOR XOT CHOSEN.
REMOVAL A SECRET.
These complaints have come not only
from minor employes, but also from
the nurses, apothecaries and internes,
and even from orderlies. The com
plainants have accused Elbert of being
of a domineering disposition ?and of
possessing a manner that is dictatorial
In the extreme. In fact It is charged
that it has been found Impossible by
those under his immediate jurisdiction
to get_along with him.
After a complete investigation of the
accusations made against Elbert the
committee of the Health Board on
City and County Hospital, composed of
Drs. Poheim, Stlnson and Harvey, has
reported that the accusations are well
founded. The committee further rec
ommends that, to prevent what may
result in the absolute demoraliza
tion of the conduct of the hos
pital, it is imperative that the services
of Elbert be forthwith dispensed with
and that he be relegated to some other
sphere. ,1 i '.--â¢â¢ i
For the last three months com
plaints regarding Elbert's administra
tion of the City and County Hospital
affairs have been filed by the em
ployes of the institution that happen
ed to come under his displeasure.
Elbert's dismissal is to be brought
about in the interest of harmonoy, and
has been under consideration almost
from the time he assumed the office
on January 9 last. Elbert has not been
on the best of terms with his subord
inates, and the clashes have been fre
quent and more or less of a violent
character.
John N. Elbert, warden of the City
and County Hospital, has been slated
for removal by the Board of Health
and his dismissal from the position
will be formally acted upon in a day
or two. In all likelihood Elbert will
be given an opportunity to resign, as
one or two members of the board are
disposed to favor him to that extent.
And the Board of Works insists that if the
budget shall be adopted as now proposed, with
the item of "street cleaning" unchanged, the
retponsibllity for unsatisfactory and lnsufji
clent work will at all times be placed where it
will then property belong â on the shoulder* of
those members of the Board of Supervisors
who countenance and by their votes indorse
th!* inconsistent and absurd appropriation for
that purpose, and that the Board of Public
Works will not assume and will at all times
disclaim any responsibility for the unsatisfac
tory results which must inevitably accompany
and fellow *o ill-considered a policy on the part
of tech Snj>erviÂ»ors.
If. however, your honorable board cannot
grant euch modifications, let the verdict be
proclaimed In advance of any trial that the
experiment of street sweeping by municipal em
plcyes must and necessarily will be a failure.
If it ia the sincere deelre of your honorable
board that Â«treet sweeping by city employes
ehould prove a success, let your budget item
be rr.o'ilttM ae to the amount cf the appropria
tion and let the conditions and restrictions as
to the employment of labor be so changed that
experienced laborers, who have In the past
proved themselves faithful workmen, may be
employed if deÂ«ire<l. Under such conditions
this board would willingly co-operate in Â«ecur
lng a better Â«.nd mure a.-ceptable street seep
ing rervlce under municipal regulations and
control.
It may be claimed that If the men upon the
elvll service llct are unable to perform the
work that there is a remedy provided by which
such men might bÂ« dispensed with, but the
remedy is too slow, the working fortes become
disorganized, the dirt keeps accumulating and
it will take a considerable part of the appro
priation to decide by experiment their avail
ability. To select laborers after trial beforÂ©
the Civil Service CommlSBloners of each indi
vidual laborer in euch a case would bÂ« unbusl
ness like and costly to the. city.
If. as proposed, the cleaning and eprinkling |
of street* should bÂ» performed by the employes {
of the Board of Public Works, the specifica- |
tions and schedules under which public bids i
(ren recently received by this board ehould I
te Mrictly adhered to and the quantity an.l j
quality of the service thej-ein provided shouM |
be furnished. Under public contract this work j
would cost the city $^54,000. which is $39,000
more than is allowed in the proposed budget. .
The Items of this expense havr already J>een |
furnished in a communication filed with V o "r j
honorable board. As against thiR estimate
your board seeks to allow us $97,000. with a I
further handicap cf between $30,000 lo $40,000 i
caused by the arbitrary quality of help sought j
to be imposed upon uÂ»- for the work. j
Your budget item limits the. employment of I
men aÂ« street sweepers to the list of laborers !
as registered upon the rolls of the Civil Per- I
vice Commission, regardless of any quallnca- (
tions for the performance of the work, and ex- j
eludes from employment any of the competent I
men who may have been employed heretofore j
by contractors on this work. You must re- |
member that this Hat is made> up without ex
amination, merely acccordlnir to priority of ap- [
plication, and includes some men feeble in '
body, seme without experience of any kind of
labor. somÂ« crippled, some enervated through i
drink and otherwise, and none enrolled for
this particular and difficult work.
CIVIL SERVICE CLAUSE.
Such an appropriation would force upon this
board an unfair burden. It makes an Ined
fsjuate appropriation; it ostracises experienced
labor; it compels us to .1o work without ade
quate tools or appliances. The Board of
Public Works, under Uiese conditions, cannot
assume the responsibility of clvlng the public
a satisfactory Â»*Tvice in the cleaning of
streets. It cannot do a 51 Job satisfactorily
for less than SO cents, especially when it can
not exerclso any discretion as to who should
be its employes to do the work.
COST UNDER CONTRACT.
BOARD IS HANDICAPPED.
If it it the deslra of your board, as *x
prebsrd by the KlnaTire Committee, that the
unLatisfactory results of sweeping this year
b.- Improved upon why handicap this board
not only with a known deficit of *40O> at
the inauguration of the work, lÂ»ut also adding
an increased deficit of the cost of a new
Plant, so that not even thÂ« work now done
en be accomplished, and that, too, without
irxking any allowance for the wages of sweep
en- which would undoubtedly be the sanu?.
namely. $2 &<â¢ per day. as is now paid to all
th.. laborers in the employ of this department,
and of every other municipal department. In
place of the $2 25 per da.y now paid such
Icbcrerw by the contractors. This would make
ug face a further deficit of $18,000 for the
year Â«>iill further reducing your appropriation
o* S215.0UO to $107,000.
Moreover during the ensuing year, if the
city is to do the work, the area of street
sweeping must be enlarged. Even a small
increase of 5 per cent over the work of this
year which Is a low- estimate for an ex.
l>or<iing city like this, with residents, tax
payers and improvement clubs on all sides
calling for more v/ork, would cauÂ»e an in
creased expeunse of at least $10,000, leaving
only $37,000.
And we would also call your attention to
the fact that If the men to be employed are
to be taken from thÂ« civil service list without
experience, men whose sole qualification" are
tfcat they %<A. their names on first. witWout
it-card t.o character of their former employ
ment, age. physical condition, energy or eklll,
you may reasonably allow a deficiency of at
ieaj-t 20 per cent in efficiency as compared
with the present workmen, who are undoubted
ly selected by the contractors for their ability
to do the greatest amount of work In the
least time. This would make a difference
agpJnst us of perhaps t:iO.CK*> or $40,000 more,
assuming, of course, that the civil service list
of laborers must be adhered to.
President Herbert Schmitr. of the
Board of Public Works yesterday
transmitted the formal protest of the
board against the appropriation of
$21.").oO<) made by the Board of Super
visors in the next municipal budget
fur the cleaning <-f streets.. Schmltz
declares that the amount appropriated
is insufficient to sweep the streets, in
view of the fact that the city is to do
the work, and plainly states that the
responsibility for the improper per
formance of the work will be placed
on the Board of Supervisors. The board
requests that $i'jO/Â»00 be allowed if the
work is let out bv contract and $300,000
if it is to be done by the city, so that
the necessary apparatus may be pur
chased. The protest says:
There are two principal objections to .the
alxive appropriation; flm. the insuiftelem-y uf
the sum appropriated, and Ferond. the re
strictions as to who shajl hr employed to per
form the work. During the present rtscul year
the tti-eet Is being performed und<r
an appropriation of $J15.<Â»00. vrhicb is the
vxaot amount which your honorable board pro
j>uses to allow for next year, and we nre
already facing a deficit of $4000 for the cur
rent year, and that, too, without the necessity
of our being compelled to buy a slnsie ap
pliance for the performance of the work
â¢ which is now being done by contract), while
under your new ideas we should be obliged to
purchase an entire plant and all of Hk ap
purtenances, at an expensu of about $r><),000.
leaving for the actual work of street cleaninK
only J125.00O. an amount so absurdly inad
*-*4iiate aa to bÂ« properly designated "ridicu
lous." \'

Jenny Und, who pleaded that she
had deserted her father's yacht at
C. A. Rush of 4 B.erry street had his
wife Kittle arrested for stealing from
him one bicycle and pawninjrit for $1,
but when the case came up before
Judge Cabaniss he declared he was
willing to withdraw the charge If the
wheel were' returned to him. The
pawnbroker, however, insisted on be
ing paid $2 ere he would release the
machine, and after much bickering the
money was paid and the case dis
missed. ;
"Pe tickets wuz In my pocket all
right," said Mr. Jackson to the Judge,
"but what fetches me Is how dat yah

For selling lottery tickets at 927
Market street Charles Hanen was fined
$100 by Judge Mogan, and for having
lottery tickets In his possession R.
Jackson (colored) will be sentenced to
day.
Dr. George Herbeln was fined $100
by Judge Mogan for practicing medi
cine without a license. He was arrest
ed and convicted in December, 1902, but
appealed to the Supreme Court, and
that tribunal has Just decided that
the statute under which he was
prosecuted is perfectly constitutional.
Margaret Galvln, "the aristocratic
soak," confessed to Judge Mogan that
she is a dipsomaniac. That was half
an hour after she had been sentenced
by Judge Fritz to thirty days' impris
onment, and his Honor Mogan con
siderately dismissed the charge upon
which 3he had been brought before
him.
It developed that the woman Is the
mother of two young children, who are
in their father's custody, and that she
has a comfortable income from prop
erty owned by her. Arrested many
times for drunkenness, she was al
lowed to forfeit her ball money until
the magistrates decided to attempt
her reformation by consigning her to
prison. She has a handsome home in
this city and employed a maid to care
for it during her sprees.
Bertie Alexander, a well-dressed
young man from Chicago, was loiter
ing on Dupont street at 1:30 o'clock
yesterday morning and spoke rudely
to the policeman who asked for ex
planation of his being there. His de
meanor in Judge Mosan's court was
tame, however, a night's confinement
among the chronic vagrants having ap
parently enhanced his respect for the
law's majesty. He said he was a civil
engineer by profession and a tourist
for recreation, and that he was mere
ly ".seeing the sights" when the offi
cer overhauled him. Then the Judge
Catherine Wall, accused of drunken
ness in a public place, told Judge
Fritz that she resided at the home of
her brother on Bryant street and was
eager to return there, but when his
Honor assigned to a policeman the task
of finding out, whether she spoke the
truth she confessed that she had no
brother and no settled home. Sentence
to-day.
George Beyer was fined $20 by Judge
Cabaniss for operating at the ocean
beach last Sunday a nlckel-in-the-slot
machine and offering .money instead
of merchandise for prizes. Two police
men in citizens' clothing clinched the
charge against the enterprising Mr.
Then came the pronounciation of the
name by Judge Megan, the officiating
magistrate, and that, too, used up
quite a lot of minutes that might have
been saved if the name had been more
reasonable as to length and euphony.
His Honor had studiously studied his
impressive part, but somehow his
tongue could not be attuned to rolling
off with ease the name of Carmelo de
Cenarruzabeitia. The best he could
do was to utter it In sections, and even
then several syllables were dropped.
But they weren't missed. As the for
mula necessitated introduction of the
groom's name twenty-eight times, it
was not wondered at that his Honor
was both wild-eyed and haggard long
ere the last strands of the knot were
tied. He omitted his custom of salut
ing the bride.
Senor de-C. and his better half are
receiving congratulations at 1325 Du
pont street.
Promptly at high noon began the
wedding of Senor Carmelo de Cenar
ruzabeitia and Senorita Eloisa Ar
menta, but unavoidable clerical and
oral difficulties with the name of the
groom-elect delayed completion of the
ceremony until after 1 o'clock and all
concerned were much fatigued.
In the first place, the blank space on
the marriage license was not long
enough to hold all the letters contained
In the full cognomen of the male con
tracting party, unless they were writ
ten so small as to be undecipherable by
the naked eye. and the clerk who filled
the document left several of them out.
This defect had to be remedied to make
the permit legally operative and con
siderable time and chirographic skill
were invested in the revision.
Each lady was represented by able
ctmnsel, but it couldn't get in half a
dozen consecutive words to save its
life.
"She flghd to me. bud I don'd flghd
to she." Eaid Mrs. Skala, with accusa
tory tinger aimed at Mrs. Caesar. "I
flghd to odder lady, und she den flghd
oop to me."
"Nein! neln!" shouted Mrs. Caesar,
with tone and gesture that would en
hance Edna Aug's scrubwoman act 50
per cent; "mid she eet is flghd und
flghd und flghd all der dime. Mid me
eet ecs der quiedness."
Mrs. Anne Skala. with a two-year
c!d toddler clutching her sKlrt for sup
port, affirmed that she had not dis
turbed the peace of Mrs. Annie Caesar,
as alleged in that lady's formal com
plaint, but had exchanged some acer
bitous language with another female
neighbor, name not disclosed, at the
time and place designated in the afore
mentioned document.
Mrs. Caesar, on the other hand, de
clared that she and she alone was the
person to whom Mrs. Skala addressed
certain uncomplimentary remarks on
the occasion in question, and that she
(Mrs. C.) would never feel secure from
oral, maybe physical, abuse until Mrs.
Skala feels the law's restraining hand.
Police Judge Mogan listened patient
ly to both pleadings and then continued
the case two *veeks for the avowed
purpose of giving the ladles time and
opportunity to settle their trouble out
of court. They dwell next door to each
other on the 700 block of Vermont
street, and their struggles with the
English language indicated that they
arrived fri/m the Fatherland simul
taneously and not very long ago.
For assaulting Patrolman M. Barry,
on the water front, John McCormick
was sent up for twenty days by Judge
Cabaniss.
Frank G. Stone, with flowing and
unkempt whiskers, could not tell ex
actly whore he was arrested for drunk
enness, but had a hazy idea that he
was picked up in the Hall of Justice.
"I lost track of everything two days
ago, when I began drinking," he ex
plained to Judge Mogan, "and when I
awoke in that cell this morning I didn't
know how'I got there."
Patrolman Hutchins, who made the
arrest, was -not present to cast light on
the mystery' and the case was contin
ued till to-day.
In the court of Judge Cabaniss a
jury acquitted D. W. Andrew, charged
with selling liquor without a license at
Greenwich and I,yon streets. The ar
rest was made by Policeman Field, in
plain cloths, who purchased a glass of
beer from the defendant.
In his argument with the officer Mr.
Hirschfleld received a blow on the
head from his opponent's club and his
aged mother swore that she was struck
on the arm with the same implement
while she was endeavoring to restrain
him from battering her son.,
The case went over till to-morrow.

"He's got it afflnst me," said Mr.
Hirschfleld, addressing Judge Mogan
and alluding to Officer Harvey, "an 1
he's de only policeman wot ain't me
fren'."
Harry Hirschfleld, arrested for as
saulting Special Officer Harvey, at Ellis
and Buchanan streets, averred that
there would have been nothing doing
on that occasion if the policeman had
not started it. Like a nemesis, he
averred, Harvey has pursued him for
years, although he had never done
anything to merit such tenacious at
tention. It was true that he had been
drinking, in fact, was drunk, on the
afternoon of Monday, but he had
slumbered in a saloon chair and was
sober in the evening, when the arrest
occurred.
Tlburon, waa sentenced to three
months in the County Jail by Judge
Mogan.
"For since your appearance here yes
terday. Miss Lind," said Judge Mogan,
"I have ascertained that your father's
yacht is as much of a myth as the
shadowy ship in which the chimerical
Vanderdecken is vainly trying to

A school for dogs is the latest devel
opment of the educational movement.
It has been -established in Paris, with
the object of teaching, not letters, hut
politeness. The schoolroom^ is fur
nished with chairs, tables and rugs, to
give the necessary "local color" to the
surroundings. The dog pupils are
trained to welcome visitors by Jump-
Ing up, wagging the tail and giving a
low bark. When the visitor leaves the
dog accompanies him to the door and
bows his farewell by bending his head
to the floor. He is trained likewise to
pick up a handkerchief, glove or fan
that has been dropped and return It to
the owner. He is. taught further to
walk with "proud and prancing steps"
when out with his mistress.

Our Ancient Epic.
A Londoner gave up his seat in an
omnibus to a woman arid stood. Where
upon a policeman arrested him, and in
due course he was fined for "over
crowding" the vehicle.
â¢ Cossack tactics are modeled after
those of the regular Russian cavalry.
The eotnia is formed in two ranks,
sixty-four files to the front. It is di
vided into four sections. The sotnla
is maneuvered by sections and on the
roafi travels by Ihrees or sixes. Th,e
Cossacks still retain, from the days of
their tribal wars, a formation called
the "lava." In forming the lava,
whether the force Is a regiment or
only a eotnia, one-half is deployed in
a single line. Behind the center is a
small group of experienced men and
sergeants, and 300 yards behind this
group follows the remainder of the
force. Should a small body of the
enemy be met the first line closes boot
to boot and charges to brush away the
enemy by the impetuosity of the at
tack. Should their opponents prove
only a line of skirmishers or troops in
retreat the line opens out to three or
fj>ur yards' interval and charges. If
the attack is unsuccessful the first line
rallies on the supporting group and
the third line charges in Its solid two
rank formation while the first is re
forming. The first then follows the
attacking line and supports it In any
way needful.
The Cossacks are not intended for
chock action against heavy cavalry.

SUPPORT â Oakland ' School Boy.
Oakland. Cal. This correspondent
wants to know if a Boy unould neglect
his opportunity to educaze himself In
order to support hl3 widowed mother.
The answer to this is. that It is the
duty of a boy who can earn something
for the purpose of supporting his wid
owed mother to do so. There are
night schools where ' he can obtain
education. A great many Illustrious
Americans have done in their childhood
far greater and harder work than is
expected in childhood days at present
in order to- help the family along, and
at the same time have obtained for
themselves a mentaLand moral train-
Ing which fitted them in after life fof
the highest positions in the nation.
THE culmination of lawlessness in Colorado, in the
fiendish murder of non-union miners, has its lesson
for, other communities. This abhorrent crime is
committed in a region where for years the officers of the
law have winked at all kinds of minor transgressions
against the rights of persons and property. It is the
region where President Roosevelt was mobbed in 1900
while the public authorities looked on and some of them
joined in .the riot. Given immunity in assaulting indi
viduals, murdering men by stealth, deporting them from
their homes and families, and in taking forcible posses
sion of mines whose owners and superintendents they
had assassinated, these violators of the law naturally con
cluded that they were .1 law unto themselves and have
planned and executed wholesale murder under circum
stances the most brutal and savage.
The officers of thef law in San Francisco may take a
lesson from those distant events. It is a daily occurrence
in this city that men in the peaceful pursuit of their vo
cation arc down by cowardly thugs. The energy
of the police is too often exerted against the victims or
intended victims of these hideous offenses. Mobs are
permitted to collect in front of the business places of
citizens who are afforded no legal protection whatever.
Is"it not plain that we are going through the same
processes here that in Colorado have led to mighty
crimes which are thÂ« odium of the whole country? It is
surely an impressive thing when organized bodies pro
test against the presence of the police in districts where
lawlessness and disorder may occur. The man who in
tends to obey the law has no objection to the presence of
the police. They cannot. hurt or hinder him. The very

A Whistler Anecdote.
In his biography of "Whistler as I
Knew Him," Just published by the
Macmlllan Company, Mortimer Menpes
tells a curious story of the famous
artist. At the little breakfasts which
he used to give in Paris and in Lon
don he was sometimes forced to be
very economical. "He often said to
me: 'Look here, Menpes, I wish you
would go and buy a bottle of 18-penny
white wine from the Victorian Wine
Company. We will decant it carefully,
and, what with my brilliant conversa
tion and the reflnedjatmbsphere of the
studio, these men will never know
whether It is good or bad. Somehow
men understand red wine. If you give
them a cheap vintage they recognize
vinegar, but with the qualities of white
wine they are not so familiar.' So it
always proved to be. This 18-penny
white wine was produced at the fam
ous-Whistler breakfasts, where it was
pronounced to be perfect. 'A very
sound wine, very sound indeed,' I have
heard men say as they held It up to
the light, handling it carefully as
though it were priceless â in exactly,
the same way I have seen them caress
a blue and white plate. ,1 have heard
intelligent men dilate for hours upon
the beauty and rarity of certain por
celain which I myself have seen
Whistler buy at a- cheap shop round
the corner, or which ljas been pre
sented at our doors in company with
a pound of Oriental tea."
CHINESEâ J- R., City. A Chines*
or native of China has not the same
right to vote In the United States that
is guaranteed to a native born citizen
for the reason that the law prohibits
Chinese from becoming citizens of thÂ«
United States, but the sons of Chi
nese parents. If born In the United
States, when they attain majority
have the same right to vote as any
other native born.
Official- inquiry has developed the unfortunate fact
that in several of the minor and practically private
foundling asylums in this city/the waifs there in custody
are shamefully and cruelly neglected. Surely no better
opportunity could be asked than this for the active sym
pathies of public spirited citizens that give their energies
to the reform of flagrant abuses. The private foundling
asylum at best is a dangerous institution in any com
munity.

Unselfishness.
Ah, dearest. I am like a violin,
Which^-'taken by some master, sounded
false,
And was laid back for want of melody.

And my poor tones would only spoil your
song, t
So put me down, find some more perfect
. viol.
Some instrument of sweeter, deeper
tone. - .
Though all the years I. lie here silently.
And though my heart strings cover thick
with rust
I'll still be glad, for just this onee I've
known
The soft, compelling â¢ touch of master

Munificent Pit Lun.
There Is no doubt in the minds of
the attaches of the Washington Hotel
in St. Louis that Prince Pu, Lun is a
real prince and knows how tcr uphold
the dignity of the office. And Mr.
Wong, the vice commissioner, is a
prince, too. if you ask the waiters, chefs
or bellboys at. the Washington about
It. Whatever doubts the attaches might
have had about the matter were glo
riously dissipated yesterday morning
when the Prince and his retinue were
on the eve of taking their departure
for Chicago. The Prince, or Mr. Wong
for him. did not forget the people who
had looked after his wants so care
fully for three weeks. There was
"something doing" for every one of
them, and it wasn't silver, either, but
bank notes. The money was turned
over to Manager Knapp by Mr. Wong
for distribution. Richard Vofk, the
waiter who served the Prince through
out his visit, drew the capital prize. It
v.-as a $100 bill. The chef and his as-
Flstants got as much more, and a still
larger amount was split up among the
bellboys, so that each one got 510. Then
came the head waiter and some of his
functionaries for a neat sum; then the
porters, the chambermaids, and all the
rest who had even so much as looked
into the royal apartments. Last, but
not least, were the "hello" girls, who
received $20 each.

with the similarity of answer, correct
of course, that each gave, so he con
cluded to transpose the questions, with
the following. result from the next ap
plicant: "Who can vouch for you in
this city?" The categorical answer
came out, "Roosevelt." Then he was
asked: "Who interprets the Constitu
tion?" The alien, supposing it was the
second regular question, answered
"Schmitz" and the Judge then asked
"Who 1 is President of the United
States?" The alien gave the regula
tion answer, "John Toppiano."
Judge Kerrigan smiled and after a
few more efforts, in which the alien
floundered, summoned an Interpreter,
who managed to make the applicant
understand what the Judge wanted to
know and, it appearing that he had a
fair knowledge of the country he had
been living in for five years, and of
its officers, he was granted his second
papers.
An Aged Pest.
Matignon is the oldest park peat to
Paris and Is proud of the title "doyen
des vagabonds," or, according to tha
.slang word, "doyen des pilons." Ha
has Just been arrested in the VlUette
district for the 110th time, according to
the London Telegraph. He started
life as a pest at the age of 16 and he is
now over 70. Matlgnon is also known
among the broken down people of soma
education who are hi3 associates . la
destitution as old Daddy Diogenes.
When captured lately the vagabond
made a short address to the police bu
perintendent. He said: "I am sorry to
trouble yqu so often, M. le Commls
saire, but then, you know, the policu
force is so very efficient. I remember
the time when you were only a simple
secretary In the police office at Saint
Ouen. Since then I have often been In
prison. It gives me great pleasure to
see you again, M. le Commissalre. Oo
revient toujours a ses premiers am
ours." After this little speech the sen
ior vagabond of Paris was sent again
to prison- He states that he has thor
oughly enjoyed hi3 irresponsible exist
ence. He has hardly ever slept in a
proper bed and his best spells of noc
turnal repose have been obtained oa
prison planks. In the summer weather

THE report received by the Department of Com
merce and Labor from United States Consul War
ner at Leipsic, Germany, in relation to the German
merchant marine, furnishes an example of what a coun
try can do in developing her sea trade, although badly
handicapped by natural conditions. Pie says:
"Germany, of all world powers, with the exception of
Russia and Austria, is the one with the poorest natural
means of communicating by sea with the outside world.
However, in spite of. this fact she holds to-day an envi
able position in the world's carrying trade. She is ad
vancing in the science of traffic upon the high seas, under
difficulties of no small proportions, faster and more
effectively than any other power. The Germans con
sider that the paramount factor in developing a country's
foreign trade is, perhaps, the merchant marine, and that
it is just as necessary to foster foreign trade as to en-
The report further shows the up-hill fight Germany
has had. to make to maintain her position in the ocean
carrying trade, yet, how in the face of it all she has
steadily forged ahead. Â¦ Until recent years she has even
had to pay toll to Denmark to enable her vessels to reach
their sea front on the Baltic. One of the curious reasons
given in the report for her success is because of the
"great development of the United States." Thus the
anomaly is presented of Germany's merchant marine
growing because of the evolution of our industries, while,
with that evolution, our own merchant marine has de-
teriorated.
Probably the greatest factor in Germany's success is
the economical and political confederations at present
existing between Tier states, which has made concentra
tion in trade matters possible. Under that arrangement
great energy in trade has been shown and foreign com
merce has been encouraged by the granting of export
premiumsÂ»and subventions to steamship* lines. It is only
within the last twenty years that she has fostered her
shipping on really scientific lines. She now pays over
a million dollars annually in subsidies and has agree
ments providing service to China, Japan, Australia and
theÂ»more important ports with the North German Lloyd
and the Hamburg-American lines. Among her contracts
is one with the German East Africa line for a steamer
sailing around the African continent. Another is with
the Jaluit Company to visit certain of the islands of the
Pacific for a consideration of $28,560 annually; and an
other with the Woerman line between Cape Town and
Swakopmund. The ships in the'service of Germany must
be built in her shipyards, of steel, with a stated minimum
speed, and are to carry troops and supplies under certain
conditions.
In the report stated Germany teaches the United States
a lesson. If other countries can foster ocean lines by
subsidy we can. At a time when railroads were needed
to develop the natural resources of this country the
Government was prodigal with its favors of money and
land. Railroad building through that impetus, now un
aided, keeps pace with our needs on land, while our water
trade is at a standstill. We have an immense sweep of
sea coast, with harbors adapted to the boat- building
industry, and, generally speaking, all necessary timber
within easy reach, with a production of over one-third
of the world's output of pig iron and steel, to build boats.
In spite of these facts our shipbuilding is dormant and
other countries arc building boats in which to carry away
our enormously increasing exports.
, A great factor in the question is the advantSge in time
of war a country has which possesses a merchant marine.
We keep a navy sufficient for our needs for fighting ma
chines, but not for transport. It'is in the nature of
things unnecessary to keep in constant commission ship9
sufficient for carrying troops in event of war. With a

could readily turn to them in case of need.
With ships built in foreign yards at a lower cost for
labor and material, manned by cheaper labor and sub

less something is done by Congress there can be no

If a formed body cf cavalry presents

The Cossack never fires from horse

his own army. When delaying an en

he cannot get away, or when needed

IT is very' satisfactory to Californians that the weather
service is to' supply to the press of this State a full re
port of the weather, covering all leading Eastern
points. This will give our own people an.opportunity to
compare temperatures and some other conditions in all
parts of the country with our own.
One element, however, j> lacking in these reports. With
out knowledge of the degree of humidity it is not possi
ble to estimate correctly the effects of temperHure. For
instance, on last Monday the maximum temperature in
Boston was 88, New York 88, Washington 90, New Or
leans 90. In Fresno on the same day it was 100, \>ut that
heat was less felt in the San Joaquin Valley than the
lower temperatures East, because in the valley there is
low humidity, and heat and cold are less felt in a dry air.
The minimum at Fresno was 66, which means a cool
night and restful sleep, while the sanle temperature East
means a swelter all night, because the air is full of mois
ture. That moisture is the means of retaining and diffus
ing heat. We all know how the heat declines in this
Slate away from the moisture of the coast as the sun
goes down and Californians are familiar with the coolness
of the shade. When the air is full of moisture the heat
is retained at night and even in the shade there is felt
the effect of hot steam.
Eastern people are always astonished in San Francisco
by seeing ladies, in midsummer, promenading on the
shady side of the street in fur garments, but they soon
learn that the shade is cool. It is not well here, on the
toast at least, to have shade around houses, while in the
East it is sought for the slight protection from the heat
which it furnishes. All of this nieans that mere reports
of temperature from different California points do not
tell the whole story of our climate. That climate differs
with the different degrees of humidity and on the coast
is quite different from the dry interior, where men work
without inconvenience in a temperature exceeding 100 be
cause it is dry. That dryness has an important relation to
health. Where the sun and dry air rapidly oxidize and
consume waste matter there is less chance for germ cul
ture and less liability to disease. The cool nights give
rest and recuperation from the, fatigues of the day, and
there is none of that exhaustion which h the forerunner
of sunstroke, an ailment unknown in California.
While the publication of a full weather report for the
whole country here will be gratifying to Californians,
after all they are much more interested in the official
publication, by the weather service, of a full California
report in the Eastern press. Californians in the East are
inexpressibly annoyed by the omission of this State from
those daily reports. As a rule the daily report stops at
Salt Lake City, and the weather service seems unaware
that there is any country, climate or temperatifre^ny
farther west.
Since General Chipman made it so plain that our cli
mate is a material asset of the greatest value our people
are still more anxious that it be recognized officially by
Eastern publication of reports from this State. People
who visit us carry back individual reports of our sooth
ing and equable weather, and those who hear the tale
naturally turn to the daily weather reports to confirm it
and find them blank as far as we are concerned. Salt
Lake, Denver, and perhaps some Arizona and New Mex
ican points are reported, but California is apparently off
the weather map, entirely. This should be amended. The
weather service is an important branch of the public
service, and all parts of the country are entitled to the
information it collects and distributes.
As far as Eastern reports are concerned they are the
daily record of daily distress and discomfort, of grilling
heat or dangerous cold, according to the season, ot cy
clones that rage like a pestilence and of untimely floods
that sweep away crops and the soil in which they grow.
The California report is a story of daily felicity, of equa
ble climate, of days full of glory and nights restful and
elysian; of conditions that foster the constant fruitful
ness of our and the beauty and perfume of our
flowers. The contrast is sharp and impressive, and for
what they pay in taxes to sustain the weather service our
people are entitled to the benefit of it by having Califor
nia put at large in the official reports published in the
Eastern press. i
The vast number of Eastern people who are to visit
us this year will back us in the request for this publica
tion. When they return home to endure its climatic dis
comforts they will turn to the California weather reports
as Dives turned to the cool quarters of Lazarus longing
for even a drop of that water to wet his whistle.
Making Citizens.
The evening before the recent closing
of registration for the primary election
a number of aliens who desired to be
come citizens, so as to enable them to
exercise the right of suffrage, appeared
before Superior Judge Kerrigan to se
cure final papers.
An individual named John Toppiano,
who had been a close observer of the
manner in which Judge Kerrigan ex
amined applicants for naturalization
paperC had got ttfe bunch of aliens
together in some place and had told
them that the Judge Aould ask them
a certain number of questions, and as
he always asked them in the same or
der they would have no difficulty in
giving the answers, so he drilled them
In response to the question, "Who Is
the President of the United States?"
to say "Roosevelt"; to "Who is the
Mayor of San Francisco?" to say
"Schmltz," and "Do you know any one
who can vouch for you?" to say "Yes;
John Toppiano," and so on.
One after the other the aliens ap
peared before the Judge, and after ex

A FULL WEATHER REPORT.
fact of such protest being made is sufficient proof of the
intention of those who make it to disobey the law and
commit crime if they can be relieved of the presence of
the officers.
It is among the strangely illogical acts of such men
that they profess a purpose to be law abiding, while com
plaining of the restraining presence of the police, whose
only duty is to make them do what they say they intend
to do. This city is disgraced if only one man is assaulted
and injured on the public street while peacefully going
about his work. When he is struck down by a thug who
goes unpunished and defiant every man in the city is
struck down, every citizen suffers from the same blow
and the same denial of protection in the enjoyment of
his lawful rights. The time to secure order is in the be
ginning of disorder by sternly punishing it.

The Republican State Central Com
mittee will meet in San Francisco on
June IS to fix the time and name the
place for holding the StatÂ«" convention
to nominate Presidential Electors. It
is practically settled that the conven
tion will consist of 734 delegates, the
apportionment being the same as that
which applied to the recent convention
which assembled in Sacramento and
elected delegates to the Chicago con
vention.
' It is very nearly settled that the next
California convention of the party will
meet in Santa Cruz, Thursday, August
25. At the same time several of the
Congressional, and quite a number of
the Senatorial, district conventions will
assemble in that city. It is said that
the Republicans will include in the list
of nominations to be made the office
of one Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court.
In all probability the State and dis
trict conventions ut the Democratic
party will be held in the latter part of
August. It is the purpose of the poli
ticians of all parties to give the
Knights Templar a right of way in
September. The primary election this
year falls on August 9, that being the
second Tuesday of the month.
The contest for Congress in the
Fourth District may present some en
livening features. It would not be sur
prising If the Republicans nominated
J. E.* McDougald, the present Treasurer
of San Francisco. The definite an
nouncement was made yesterday that
Thomas D. Riordan would not enter
the race for Congressional honors.
If he were in perfect health and fit
to undergo the strain of an active po
litical campaign he might entertain the
thought of making the fight, but his
closest friends and political advisers
warn him to keep out of the struggle.
In the Republican camp of the Fifth
District there is some talk of nominat
ing R. H. Countryman for Congress,
but all the party leaders recognize the
fact that Santa Clara County must be
consulted In the naming of the Repub
lican nominee for Congress in this dis

academy in September, 1894, and is
not quite 29 years of age. His service
record to date is six years five months
sea service, three years two months
shore service and two months unem
ployed. He was with his father on the
Iowa at the Santiago fight July 3, 1898,
and be has been serving as aid on the
staff of his father on the Kentucky
during the two years' service in Phil
ippine waters. He has had an excellent
tutor, and the indifferent record he
made at the naval academy may have
compelled the- necessity for extra care
in developing the qualities of a good
naval officer. His standing at the an
nual examinations were as follows:
In the fourth class of GO members he
was number 30; in the third class of
55, number 38; in second class of 40,
number 28; first class of 28. number 25.
and in graduating class of 37 he'stood
number 31." It frequently happens that
mediocre students develop into good
all around naval officers, and such may
be the case of Franck T. Evans. He
succeeds Lieutenant C. F. Preston, who
has commanded the Sylph since 'April,
1902, and who stands 209 numbers
higher on the register than Lieutenant
Evans. ;
REWARDS FOR DESERTERS.
There is another mooted point of law,
the legality of which is questioned,
namely, the right of the Navy Depart
ment to withhold from enlisted men the
rewards and other expenses incurred
for the apprehension of deserters. Up
to 1897 there was no such charge on
the* books against the men; in 1898 the
amount was $1666; but fpr the year
1902-03 It had increased to' $27,629, and
the total for six years foots up to $51.
002. As to pay forfeited through court
martial sentences, the amount has
risen from $18,446 in 1894, to nearly
'$90,000 in 1903; pay forfeited through
unauthorized absence has increased
from $7414 in 1894. to $27,994 in 1903. and
deserters have forfeited $23,457 and $51,
000 during the years of 1894 and 1903,
respectively. The total pay forfeited
by sentence of courtmartial amounts
to $356,000 in round numbers during the
period of ten years; desertion pay for
feited makes a total of $443,000; loss of
pay by unauthorized leave $176,671, all
which detailed accounts with that of
apprehension of deserters makes a
grand total of $1,056,494 lost to the en
listed men. No data are available as
to the pay lost to officers through sus
pension for various periods or dismiss
als from the service by sentence of
courtmartial, but it is fair to assume
that the courts dealt out justice in the
same manner to officers as was meted
out to the enlisted force of sailors and
marines.
Taking in consideration the fact that
the total enlisted force has increased
from 11.100 in 1S94 to 35,554 in 1903. the
comparative Ehowlng of increase in
forfeited pay does not indicate that the
morale of the navy is deteriorating. In
1894 the pay lost by the men was $49,
317. equal to $4.44 per head; in 1903
the total was $197,036, or $5.54 to each
man of the force allowed by law, and
approximately up to the number. This
would show an apparent increase of
$1.10 per capita, but this is due to the
fact that the pay o* the enlisted men
has been increased since 1S94. There
Is undoubtedly room for improvement
in the enlisted force, to be effected
either through individual effort or
through less stringent application of
the rules of discipline, but,... on the
whole, there is a v^st Improvement on
the enlisted personnel of twenty years
ago.
The keel of the battleship Vermont
was laid May 20 at the Fore River
shipyard. Qulncy, Mass., whi^h firm is
also building the battleships New Jer
sey and Rhode Island. The Vermont

tracts signed June 20, 1903, the ships to
be completed by December 20. 1906, or
in forty-two months. The Minnesota is
being built at Newport News and Is
nearly one-quarter completed, while
the Vermont has not yet reached 10
per cent toward completion. There
has been no increased activity in
pushing work on Government con
tracts during the past six months and
with the present labor troubles at the
Fore River yards the concern will be
left far behind in the race by the

A GRAVEYARD QUESTION".
Captain W. H. Brownson, superin
tendent of the Naval Academy, has
recommended the transfer of the cem
etery at that Institution to some other
less conspicuous locality. It is only a
question of time, he says, when the
cemetery must be moved to accommo
date the growing needs of the academy,
and that right now the ground could
be utilized for the proposed naval hos
pital. This recommendation has raised
a storm of protest from other officers
in the nevy. The feeling is strong
against the transfer and the secretary
is inclined to side with the sentiment
against It. The cemetery is not a
gruesome sight In close proximity to
the living quarters and other build
ings of the acadeniy. There are quite
a number of historical monuments on
the grounds and in the cemetery â no
tably that erected in 1S06 in honor of
those who fell at Tripoli in 1804 â and
the presence of these records of valor
ous deeds by the navy should have an
inspiring rather than depressing effect
upon the staff and pupils of the acad
emy. The latest interments were those
of the two young midshipmen. Neu

rangements in many ofjthe lately built
j ships in that navy aX compared with
I foreign vessels. The battleship Lon

j admiral. Xone of the ships are pro
i vided with heating apparatus, and it
j is only quite recently that bread is
being baked on board, although such
' has been In practice on American ships
for more than fifteen years. Quarters
[ for officers and crew are cramped and
I armament and machinery space takes
! the precedence of all other consldera
1 tions. And yet British ships have less
gun power than. American ships, which
Hatter in addition to heavier armament
are far more comfortable than those
of any other navy.
The torpedo-boat Welland. built at
Y arrow, attained a mean speed of
26.1'4 knots during her three hours'

The French naval authorities are
greatly alarmed over the fact that
plans of forts had been stolen and
hawked abput by an Italian named
Fragola, as recently stated in news
dispatches. He had offered the plans
and documents to several newspapers
in France and' England, but
his figures were too high ne
gotiations 1 fell through. He finally
communica'ed with the French
Ministers of War and Marine with
the result that the Government re
covered its property. M. Lockroy,
fÂ»rrmer Minister of Marine, was at first
disposed to belittle the importance of
the incident, but has come to realize
the seriousness of the theft and pub
licity of the documents. There were
no less that forty-two plans of the
batteries of Brest, Toulon' and Cher
bourg, with the armament of each
battery, height of guns above the sea,
and, what is still worse, there were
detailed drawings of the position of
submarine mines and sunken torpedoes
off the principal naval ports. A vigor
ous investigation is being made into
the affair, and the Government * will
be put to great expense in effecting
such changes In the systems of defense
as will make the stolen information
valueless to foreign powers.
The French Minister of Marine is
considering the proposition' of changing
the forms of ships' turrets, making
them in the form of a half globe. The
weight, as compared with the present
shape, is claimed to be fifty per cent
less, while the curvature of the plates
would offer greater resistance to pro
jectiles than Is now obtained with ver
tical sides.
NEW WATER-TUBE BOILER '
Rear Admiral MIyabara, engineer-in
chief of Japan's navy, has invented a
water-tube boiler for which the claim
is made that It Is cheaper and simpler
in cc-nBtruction than either the Belle
ville. Niclausse or Babcock and Wll
cox boiler, and that given the same
space and weight the Japanese boiler
will give slightly larger power than
the Belleville. Its durability has been
tested in a tugboat, running constantly
for 1,\vo years withoui cleaning the
tubes, and when some tnne ago an ex
amination was made of two tubes
located in the worst region, they were
found to be as clean inside as when
new, nor were there any indication of
corrosion. This conclusively proved
that the circulation of water was all
that could be desired. ;:[;*:'Â¦Â¦'

which makes retirement compulsory,
was retired from active service on
May 21 last. Mr- Hanacom was the
last officer in the constructor's corps
appointed from civil life, and now all
its members are graduates from the
naval academy. Prior to 1S79 all the
naval constructors and assistants were
selected from civilians assumed to
have the requisite qualifications, and
while In a few instances unworthy
persons entered the service as such
through political influences, the mem
bers of the corps were, in the main,
practical men and skilled in their pro
fession. In 1879 Secretary Thompson
selected three cadet midshipmen â
Schock, Bowles and Gatewood â as fu
ture naval constructors, and they were
sent to Greenwich College, England,
for a course cf study in naval archi
tecture. They were appointed assist
ant constructors in 1881 while still at
college. Schook and Gatewood died
and Bowles resigned, but the line of
succession still keeps on and the pro
motions have been rapid, as the older
constructors passed away and the in
creased building of ships required ad
ditional constructors.
A QUESTION OF SKILJa
Bureau of Navigation. *^
Lieutenant Evans entered the naval
â¢ It was asserted that the appoint
ment or naval constructors from gTad
uates pf the naval Â»;ademy would pro
cure a higher skilled class of men
than could be had from civil life, but
twenty-four years* workings of the
system has not yet demonstrated this
assertion of superiority to be correct.
Practically all the ships of the new
navy afloat and building at the present
time were designed by T. D. Wilson
and Philip Hickborn, and the work
oi superintendence of construction up
to say eight years ago was mainly
done by constructors of long years'
experience. It yet remains to be prov
ed that the designs of battleship*, ar
mored cruisers and other war vessels
since 1901 will turn out- as improve
ments on prior designs, for while It
must be admitted that the new corps
of constructors excel their predeces
sors In mathematics and allied studies,
they have all had to learn the practi
cal part of shipbuilding and the man
agement of affairs and men after they
became officers In the navy, and these
latter essentials have in some Instances
not been satisfactory in practical ap
plication.
Franck Taylor Evans, a junior lieu
tenant in the United States navy, is
fortunate in having an influential
father in Rear Admiral Robley D.
Evans. Thev have Jtrst returned from
the Asiatic station after an absence of
two years and the rear admiral is
preparing for a term of shore service
that will terminate with his retirement
in August. 1908. Pending the selection
of the most desirable duty for himself
he has succeeded in getting his son
assimed as commanding officer of the
President's yacht, the Sylph, a' billet
that is, of course, sought for as lead
ing to fame and fortune. The yacht
is very rarely used except in a short
trip to Oyster Bay and return to
Washington during the summer, and
the duty is therefore not arduous. In
cidentally the captain of the* Sylph is
also in charge of the seamen's quar
ters at Washington. The friends of
young Evans have congratulated him
upon his. good fortune, while other of
ficers are ur.ble to account for his
selection except as an Instance of fa
voritism extended by his uncle, Rear
Admiral Taylor, who is chief of the

You ought to have

player at your
Summer home...
They cost no more than other piano
players and are so vastly superior that we hard-
iy feel justified in even making a comparison.
When You Come to Look at
The Angelus
NOTICE the natural sitting position, upright as
if seated at the piano at ordinary playing.
NOTICE how very -little pumping with the feet
is required and that half the time one's feet are
at a standstill.
NOTICE with what ease one makes the retard-
andos 2nd accelerandos. Just a pressure of
the finger gives the most delicate control.
NOTICE how it is possible to subdue the accom-
paniment and accentuate the melody.
NOTICE all these points, and then notice how
woefully lacking these points are in all other
makes of piano players.

It has been decided by the commit
tee in charge that delays at race meets
are dangerous and long waits will not
be possible under the system to be
adopted. A time schedule has been
arranged and will be furnished to the
captain of each team. Riders not
coming to their marks at the bell will
lose their chances of contesting. Three
handicaps are down for competition,
a five-mile tandem pursuit 'race has
been added and a mile point race for
individuals, with every quarter pole
as a finishing point' in .counting- the
winners, will complete an Interesting
afternoon of sport. \
The use of the track has been do
nated for the afternoon by \ the New
California Jockey'Club. As the riders
are going for glory and ribbons the
entire proceeds will go to the coffers
of the park amphitheater fund.' '
In the ten-mile relay the Bay Citys
California Cycling Club. New Cen
turys. Golden Gates. Central Citys, Pa
cifies and Stars will vie for honors
against teams from Stockton, San
Jose, Oakland and Sacramento. The
provisions of this, race call for five
men teams, each rider to go two miles,
and points for first, second. and third
places at the end of each mile to de
cide the ultimate winner. The man
finishing ahead in the first trip around
the. track will thus gain as much credit
for his team as the one to actually
win the race.

He saved Andy Gallagher till the
last and went two exceedingly fast
rounds with the lively heavy-weight.
It was then he showed the great im
provement. Gallagher would work
him into a corner, but the miner had
a habit of shooting out his left and
catching Andy one that could not be
classed with the easy punches.
The pair went two hurricane rounds
and Munroe showed wonderful foot
work. He would let Andy get to him
with a couple of stiff wallops every
now and 'then, but always happened
lo be right back with one which re
sounded throughout the gymnasium.
A number of the miner's friends from
Butte who were present went into
ecstacies over Jack's showing.
Aside from boxing Munroe did his
usual roadwork and also went through
his stunts In the gymnasium, in toss
ing the medicine ball he showed up
fasL He has a peculiar style when
Indulging in this exercise and instead
of catching the ball with his hands
lets it hit him on the stomach and
ehesL He kept this up for some time
yesterday, but the hot ones that Gal
lagher shot at him only made him
smile.
Il was a bad day for Jack Munroe'B
â¢sparring partners yesterday, for every
one of them felt the force of the
diner's stiff punches and one had to
quit or else be pounded into insensi
bility. It was the banner day for
hard work and heavy punching in the
amp and even the most conservative
t>f Jack's admirers w,ere overjoyed at
th<* great improvement he displayed.
Ho had nve big, strapping heavy
voighls to punch at and grew more
willing as he faced each. He went
first with Joe Long. George Sullivan
Â¦uid big llanasso, the double of Jim
Jeffries. Perhaps his sparring part
ner's resemblance to the champion in
cpired Munroe to go and get him, for
ffo he did. He caupht Manasso an
awful jolt in the stomach ere they
had been at it a minute and the lat
ter went down writhing. This was re
peated shortly after and then Manasso
fiuit for keeps.
Xor did any of the others fare well
Rt the hands of the miner. Whenever
he cut loose his punches had their
effect. Each man was praying for the
round to end, and, stall and feint as
they would, they could not keep the
big fellow at a distance. â¢

There will be evidences of great hi
larity up in the wilds of Lake County
when the story is told that Jeffries is
afraid of Munroe and that he wants to
put off the evil hour of meeting the big
miner from Butte as far as possible.
This was one of the stories which grew
quickly out of the. one regarding the
postponement. The fight will take
place on time, and from the confidence
of the men it should be the most sen
sational battle ever fought for the
heavy-weight title.
Manager Delaney and Secretary
Egan entered strong disclaimers that
any one had been authorized to speak
for them in the matter.
"We cannot understand how the
story started," said Egan yesterday.
"We will answer 'Ready' when the call,
to the ring is issued. Jeffries is trained
now and it is only a matter of keeping
him at that notch. Our only fear from
the Ftart has been that Munroe would
want additional time."
The department of publicity for the
Jeffries-Munroe championship fight
made a late but brilliant start on Mon
day by announcing that Jeffries desires
a postponement of the affair. The story
had its desired effect and the fight fans
were given something to discuss, a con
dition much to be desired by the man
who stands guard over the box office. .
Denials came thick and fast yester
day. Jeffries said he never felt better
in his life and that he was ready to
fight at an hour's notice. He said a
postponement was farthest from his
thought and that if he had to train for
three weeks more he would take to the
tall timbers.
It Is known Jeffries prefers Graney,
who is the official referee of the Yosem
ite Club. Pollock, backed up by Young
Corbett. who is coming west with him,
will make a big fight if Graney's name
is mentioned. Munroe has no objec
tion to the Californian for referee, but
he will undoubtedly leave this detail
to Pollock.
When Harry Pollock, the astute man
ager of Jack Munroe, challenger for the
world's championship, comes over the
Sierra Nevada Mountains and sees the
pictorial advrtisements for the Jeffries
llunroe light, he is likely to have heart
failure. ;
On all the advertisements the face
of Eddie Graney looks out on the world
in open-eyed wonder. The little horse
shoer has on his Tuxedo, not the one
a certain obliging manager loans to
impecunious boxers in which to be pho
tographed. Under the photograph is
the non-committal caption, "Edw. M.
Graney, the peer of referees."
This does not intimate that Graney
is to referee the big mill, but it is pos
sible many people will so construe it.
Pollock i3 not one of these. The New
Yorker will never forget March 25 of
this year when Graney gave Britt the
decision over Young Corbett, who is
also in Pollock's charge. He vowed
then that he would put Graney out of
tho refereeing business. â¢
He tried to prevent the California!!
from refereeing the Uodenbach-Berger
amateur fight, wiring out a psremptory
command to Rodenbach not to accept
Graney. The officials paid no heed to
his command, but carried out their
original programme.
Request for Postponement of
Fight Is Not Authorized
by Jeffries.
Question of Referee Will
Soon Be the Issue of
the Hour.

Oakland could not hit at all, and it
was easy for Yerkes to score a shut
out. He had grand command of the
ball and seemed to know the weakness
of every man *bn the Oakland team.
Massey will probably be released to
day, as Uncle has signed up Cy. Town
send, last year's guardian of the Sac
ramento initial bag. The score:
"Ilabbit" Miller soused it out past
second base and Reitz arrived. Hilde
brand walked arid Waldroij unloaded
a double out to center; scoring two.
Meany's single to the same place com
pleted the run-making for the inning.
Massey smashed it out over the left
field fence in the third. After he had
doubled in the fifth Hildebrand sent
the leather out on a line to Ganley.
The latter f^ll down and the ball
rolled to the fence for a homer. Â¦
Mr. Schmidt did not have a thing
that Uncle's warriors could not hit
yesterday at Oakland. They let the
flrst inning pass without doing the
run-getting act, but landed something
awful in the second, going through
the ceremony of driving In five runs.
Score, 8 to 0. .
Schmidt was at his worst, certainly,
for^he possessed neither commund,
speed nor curves. It was partly
through his wildness that San Fran
cisco gained such an ea/sy victory and
partly because he was so easy to hit
when men were oft the bases.
Reitz was the first man up in the
second and Schmidt drove the ball
into his ribs. Leahy fanned, but Mas
sey flopped a "Texas Jeaguer" to short
center. Yerkes made the second out
by missing three strikes, so it looked
pretty good for Oakland.

farming uhen the time comes.
Among the visitors here is Will Ken
nedy, a well known New York politi
cian and an enthusiastic admirer of
Jeffries. He will have a ringside seat
at the battle on the 17th inst.
If victorious over Jack Munroe. the
champion has received a splendid offer
to aopear at St. Louis immediately
after the scrap. Forty thousand for a
forty weeks' encasement is rumored,
but Jeff says it is hardly as much as
that.
First came the wrist machine and
pulley weights, which serve to warm
him up as a preliminary gallop does a
horse previous to the real test In the
race. Then followed the battle with
the g-reat Jumbo sand bag. With the
perspiration streaming from every pore
Jn his giant body, Jeff shoved and
liugged and wrestled with the ponder
ous weight for twenty minutes. Pre
vious to this he had thrown a bunch of
rights and lefts at the leather punch-
Ing bag. They were not love taps,
either, for each blow was dcllved with
force enough behind it to fell a bullock.
Picking up his rope, Jeff next skipped
J'2.2 times. He extracts many beneficial
r<fults from this form of exercise, for
the entire weight of his body is always
resting on the ball of one foot. Some
fifty-yard sprinting followed, then a
plunge and a rub down and Jeff was
ready for luncheon. The champion
paid he would work again in the gym
nasium before dinner time, but altered
Ji:j= plans and went for a six-mile Jog
on the road instead. In the evening he
l^articipated in a ball game and before
retiring for good tossed the medicine
ball for fifteen minutes with his spar
ring partners, Joe Kennedy and Jack
Jeffries.
"Why," said he, "when 16 I weighed
WZ, and I emoked ko incessantly that
my lunge felt as if they were all
a'olaze. Only for that I'd been an aw
ful strong man."
He can carry an upright piano" on
his head and lick six ordinary men,
und what a great help to his family
he would be if he possessed any addi
tional strength!
Almost any athlete can do better
vhcii performing before company, and
t> ith a fashionable attendance to wit
ness a demonstration of his prowess
Â«nd endurance at training quarters
this forfnoon the champion was right
on his mettle.
After working furiously for more
than an hour and a half, he gargled
his throat and sat down on the rowing
ir.achine for a brief breathing spell.
Jlis weight is Btill a matter of
conjecture, and while his girth meas
urement has been reduced several
inches and his limbs look clean cut
and (symmetrical, he must tip the scales
in the neighborhood of 225 pounds.
Once an inveterate cigarette fiend,
the champion says he has not rolled
n brown paper since the flrst day of
the year. In referring to the days
Â«i hen boiler-making was his vocation,
Jr ft asserts he then smoked 100
â¢ is-arettes a day, at a conservative es
timate.
HARBIN SPRIXGS, June 7.â In ad
dition to th* ueual coterie of guests
here at the springs. Champion Jim
Jeffries' petite wife, becomingly at
tired in white lawn and silks, and Mrs.
Dclaney, wife of the big fellow's man
ager. Billy Delaney. were among the
spectators at the "gym" this morning.
No bftxing was indulged in, but Jim
worked like a Trojan on the different
muscle and sinew developing appli
aisees. Â«

GRAVESEND, N. Y., June 7.â The
running of the Standard stakes to-day
proved three things to thousands of
racegoers who witnessed the stirring
struggle. One was that Major Dain
gerfield has rturned to the superb
form which induced W." B. Leeds to
buy him from "Diamond Jim" Brady
for $25,000. Another was that the
year has not added to the courage of
Hermis, and he may be put down as
the same faint-hearted horse, and the
third is that Africander is a good
horse at present and will be, a danger
ous factor "in the Suburban handicap.
Major Daingerfield, carrying 116
pounds, defeated Africander, carrying
125,. in easy fashion.
The Standard had its luster dimmed
by the withdrawal of Irish Lad anrl
The Picket, but even in its amended
form it provided an interesting strug
gle. Hermis and Africander opened
pretty close to even favorites, as if
the layers were in doubt and were
feeling their way. They had not long
to wait, for the preference of the ex
perts was for Africander. The smart
money on him drove his price down,
while Hermis receded in the betting.
Major Daingerfield seemed to be
neglected. The Major has acquired
a bad reputation. Some days he runs
in brillant fashion, other days he will
not run at all, so the racegoers have
tired wagering dollars on the guess
that he would or that he would not.

CHICAGO, June 7.â A favorite landed
the money to-day at Harlem, the first

of the best played choices of the meet
ing. Not since the first race on the
opening dav had a favorite won un
til Pat Dunne's Adare. backed from. 8
to 5 to 6 to 5, landed in the second race?,
and his margin was less than a length.
Superstitious members of the talent
who had not spent their bank roll in
backing first choices during the flrst
three days ofNthe meeting finally took
a "hunch" on the thirteenth and went
to Adare for the limit. He barely got
up in the closing stride, beating out
the 9 to 1 shot, Bert Osra, by a
length.
Aside from this the only feature of
the afternoon was the victory- of
Gregor K in the fourth race, a purse
affair at seven furlongs. A large num
ber of spectators thought Soufriere had
won by a nose, but the Judges, who
were in a better position to see, decided
otherwise. -

WASHINGTON, June 7. â Indirectly
the interest of the United States in
the adoption of the gold standard by
Panama is no less than 525,000,000.
This is based on the belief that with a
fluctuating and unstable currency in
Panama, closely interwoven as it cer
tainly will* be with the isthmian canal
strip population, the contractors who
must dig 'the canal will be obliged to
add at leasj 25 per cent, to their bids
in order to,, guard against changes in
the cost of labor and supplies.; ' .. ,
If the decision of the Panama
Legislature promises to be adverse to
gold the United States will seek to se
cure postponement of the final procla
mation of that decision.

WASHINGTON, Â¦ June 7.â "William
Nelson Crowell, representing the new
Panama Canal Company, rrom which
the United States acquired the canal
concession, and Choron," engineer in
charge of th'e construction of the canal
during French ownership, to-day con
ferred with Rear Admiral Walker,

The accounts must be audited. and the

Stewart, about this time, took a trip
back to Ohio. -He returned a few days
ago and- yesterday, while walking up
Minna street in San Francisco, he met
Kennedy.! Kennedy stopped him and
brought up the whole family trouble.
Kennedy asked Stewart to accompany
him to Newark so that he could face
his wife with. her perfidy. Stewart
agreed to do so.
The two men arrived at Newark
about 5 o'clock, but did not go to the
Briggs ranch until after midnight. Mrs.
Kennedy was 'then called out and they
talked over the matter. Kennedy ac
cused Stewart of being too friendly
with his wife:' Stewart said Kennedy
then began to curse him and drew a
knife. He also thinks Kennedy had a
gun. Stewart then drew his revolver
and. shot twice^ Kennedy cried out In
pain and started to run. Stewart then
went to Alviso and surrendered to
Deputy Sheriff Mayne.
. SAN JOSE, June 7.â A division of a
woman's affections led to a shooting
at the Briggs ranch, between Center
.ville and Newark, early this morning.
W/O. Stewart, who did the shooting,
surrendered himself to Deputy Sheriff
J. L. Wayne at Alviso this moraine
and is now in the county jail here. The
inan who was shot is W. S. Kennedy,
who is said to be seriously Injured.
That he is not dead is due to the fact
that a pocketbook in his coat pocket
stopped â¢ a bullet that was going
straight to his heart. Another bullet
struck him in the groin,- inflicting a bad
wound. .
j Stewart said the trouble originated
over Edith Kennedy, the wife of the
man- who was shot. Stewart first met
Kennedy and his wife in San Bernardi
no.. Stewart at that time worked in a
cigar store and Mrs. Kennedy was em
ployed in a restaurant next door. Ken
nedy was engaged a^ a car tapper.
Mrs. - Kennedy soon became enamored
of Stewart and Kennedy soon became
aware of ..her. misconduct.

Shortly after the Algoa was docked
Captain T. D. E. .Wilson was on the
wharf arranging for the speedy dis
< harg* of the vessel's cargo. This work
will be carried on day and night until
the vessel's holds are empty. She will
then be placed on the Hunters Point
drydock for inspection and repairs.
Po fur an could be ascertained yester
day the cargo is undamaged. The leak
was confined to the forward ballast
tanks and a stout bulkhead held the
water from the freight. .
The Aigoa's cargo was large, varied
find valuable and had the vessel been
wrecked beachcombers from San
Diego to Alaska would have had a
tummer supply of Oriental odds and
ends.
Second Officer Stevens, who was on
<^f<ii fat th*Â» time of the accident,' says
ther* was no possibility of the steamer
taking any other course than she did
when the schooner attempted to cross
her bows. *.'â¢
Yes. we *truck the rocks.* and in the time I
have been aboard the Alcoa this is the first
fccrldent that I have known. I was on deck
when we Â«aw the schooner cutting across our
bow*. Whether or not she would have struck
us it a question, but I think she would. The
moment we hit the reef and the ship began
to i>ound Is th* swell the Chinamen on deck
and below came Filing up to the lifeboats.
Th^y wanted to cut them away, but Second
Officer Stevens and I ordered them back to
xh-ir stations. â¢Â¦-...'Â»---:â¢
We have aboard at this time a cargo valued
at about $400,000.
\Vh*>n I Jound that it was a matter of steer
ing clear or having a collision, I steered dear.
Otherwise we would have been smashed or
the Compeer would havÂ» been eat down. 1
did not na.ve any Idea that we would strike
1t. As <jul<-kly a> we struck I ordered the
fttj storied and foil Â«eam astern. That
was, however, not sufficient to check the
headway and I at once called out to Tint
Officer Nichols to let to both anchors. We
had at that time such headway that, even
though the profiler was working astern, we
<-ould ret check the forward motion. We struck
â¢jv! pounded until the propeller secured action
In backing out and we became clear. By that
time Pilot Reed was aboard and took com
ir.and.
First Officer Nichols made the fol
lowing explanation of the accident:
1 knew ;here was only one U.:::c to do; that
v e* to kefp out of ber way. It may bÂ« pos
sible that I vu too close in shore at the
time, but I was taking advantage of the tide
renditions and used the north channel to enter
port.
When I eaw the schooner heading toward me
During the five minutes that the
Algoa was pounding in the swell. Pilot
Heed boarded the freighter and as
turned command. He found nothing
snore to do than see the orders prev
iously issued by Captain Lockett car
ried out. Full speed astern was the
instructions to the engine room and full
it was.
The Algoa was heavily loaded above
The water line and there was some
5>ar that she njight turn turtle. With
p. heavy swell - running, the officers
â¢fought she might turn broadside to
the shore and in that event there would
be no possibility of saving her.
Captain Lockett contends that he
pave all the right of way necessary
for the Compeer to pass her. but in
order to protect his ship he had to
head toward the ehore. After the
Â«.ool!e crew had been sent back to their
posts, heading m made down the bay.
As Pilot Reed directed tne course of
the ship. Custom-house and quaran
tine boats followed in her wake.
Captain Locketfs statement is as fol
io we:
Chief Officer Nichols, armed with a
lead pipe, and Second Officer Stevens,
swinging a rope's end, drove the Celes
tials to their posts. â¢-.
Captain Lockett was on the bridge,
but the pilot had not yet come aboard.
Bells were sounded, and as the for
ward headway of the ship was checked
the ebb tide swung the freighter's bow
Toward the rocks. Breakers were
throwing their foam witnm a few feet
of the Algoa. Both anchors were let
go. The starboard anchor held, but
the cable parted and the port anchor
failed to check the freighter's head
way. As her bow struck the rocks,
panic seized the Chinese crew and
i here was a wild rush for the lifeboats.
Knives were pulled from their scab
bards and before the officers could in
terfere the demoralized Mongolians
were cutting away the boat lashings
and making ready for a hasty launch
ing.
The Algoa left Yokohama seventeen
days ago and had good weather all the
vay across the Pacific. When she ar
rived at the entrance of the Golden
*Jate yesterday morning the weather
was clear. There was a strong ebb tide
!!owir.g and Captain Lockett, who has
been her commander for several years,
hugged the north shore to make the
bay. This plaxred the freighter in an
awkward position iu the event of meet
ing any outward bound vessels. As
the Algoa rounded the point the three
masted schooner Compeer, going to eea
in charge of a tugbo&t, came tearing
along. The Compeer was bearing to
the starboard and it meant a collision
if the steamer maintained her course.
That the Pacific Mail freight steamer
Algoa. Captain Lockett, is tied up at
Â«Jreen\vich street wharf is due to the
fact that she has stanch watertight
Â«ompan mems. for Fhe struck c-n the
rocks of Point Bonita yesterday morn
ing and came down the bay with thir
teen feet of water in her hold and
pomps playing as hard as steam would
drive them.

reading go to LIVINGSTONE, 428 Eddy st>
, .He asks you no questions, but tails you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROFESSOR
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.
Â¦ lie Is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for bis original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness. â¢
Would It not he a relief to know how you
will pucceed, to be relieved of thÂ« matters that
aiâ troubling you and of the schemes of your
enemies, that you may meet with better success?
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test

A two-masted lumber schooner with
a large deck load, which apparently
had shifted, we sighted off the Far
allones yesterday afternoon. In the
rigging were two men signaling for a
tug. The towboat Sea Rover was*dis
patched to the vessel's assistance. The
Rover started out "at 2 o'clock and
could hardly reach the schooner be
fore 0. If the vessel is at all water
logged and difficult to tow it will be
early this morning before she Is
brought into port. The schooner's
plight was reported by the weather
bureau man on the Farallones, who
could not make out her Identity.

NEW YORK, June 7.â The case of
the missing Cape May cup, won by his
Majesty's yacht, the Brittania, prom
ises to become famous, says a Herald
dispatch from London. It Is reported
that diligent search for the trophy has
been made at Windsor Castle, but no
trace of It can he *' found. A careful
record is kept of all the items of furn
iture, silver and gold ornaments at the
castle, but the only trophy there is his
Majesty's Ascot gold cup, which Per
simmon won in 1897. The Inspector at
the Castle believes such a trophy
would never have been sent to Wind
sor, but would have been kept at Sarl
dringham with his Majesty's other tro
phies, which are very numerous and
include many yachting and racing cups
and prizes won at agricultural shows.
A careful search is' to be made at San
dringham.,

PORTLAND, Or.. June 7.â That the
Republican party in this State scored
an overwhelming victory yesterday is
being made more apparent I as the
count proprosses. Returns from isolat
ed counties are coming in slowly, but
those already received show that, like
the more populated districts, the citi
zens voted strongly for the Republican
Congressional nominees. Congressman
Binger Hermann has been re-elected in
the First District with a majority of
about 7000, while J. N. Williamson, the
Republican nominee in the Second Dis
trict, rolled up a majority of 10,000 and
later returns may swell this estimate
somewhat.
Returns Show That Oregon Republi

An attack upon Pearl O'Connel, 7
years old, and daughter of V. A. O'Con
nell, a prosperous ranchman of Nor
walk, was committed this afternoon
while the child was with her brother
Varney, a boy of 9 years. The lad was
beaten with a club by the fiend and
forced to run for his life.
The scene was about a quarter of a
mile from the O'Connell ranch and a
mile and a half from Norwalk. The
children were walking home, when a
stranger accosted them and tried to
tear the little girl from her brother's
side. The boy resisted and was beaten,
after which his siter. was dragged
away. She ran screaming in the di
rection of her home and attracted the
attention of the father, who immedi
ately started a search. Meantime
George O'Connell, an uncle of the chil
dren, came upon the boy in the road
and hearing the story from his lips
started after the brute and succeeded
in getting a glimpse of him . as he
dodged through the willows.
Friends joined the father and

Attacks Two Children
TRUCKEE, June 7.â Never within
the recollection of the oldest inhabitant
has there been such a scarcity of trout
in this section of the Truckee River.
The unprecedented high water is, to a
great extent, responsible for this con
dition, but the lack of fish ways at the
dams in the lower reaches^keep the
fish from their natural spawning
grounds. It is proposed that the flsh
commissioners of California and of Ne
vada meet and take steps that will re
sult in the enforcement of the laws
relative to the construction of fish lad
ders. Starting up the river from Reno,
the big dam for the electric light com
pany has a sheer fall of twelve feet
without any passage for the flny tribe.
The immense dam at Floreston had a
flsh ladder, but the high water has dis
arranged it so that it has become of no
material use. These obstructions keep
the big fish of Pyramid Lake from get
ting up here and makes the catching of
a fair-sized flsh a ten days' effort.
The catches of this year have been
small and the old fishermen are wait
ing for the fall of the river. There
should be some good fly fishing shortly,
but at the present time the smaller
streams are bringing down ! so much
flsh food that the trout find all they
want to eat without an effort.
The High Water Has Washed Out the
. Fish Ladders and the Trout
Are Injured.

went to the ,Tenecyck, Hotel, where
McDonnell was stopping, and went to
McDonnell's room. As soon as Mc-
Donnell opened the door Pruesser shot
him dead.

New. York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. June 7. â The professional con
tingent in the stock market started to-day with
very discouraging views of the, hopes of any
activity in the market or any movement of
prices. But the market' turned out better In
tone and distribution of business than was the
case urdcr tbe stimulating Influence of yester
'day'n rise. In Ontario and Western. It would
be difficult -40 fix a specific cause for this de
velopment.'as the current news seemed to have
Mttle. Influence on the market. The weekly bul
letin of the Weather Bureau proved rather more
favorable than was expected on wheat for both
the winter and spring crops, and .the favorable
progress cf the cotton crop went to accentuate
the effect of tbe Government report of June 1.
The bulletin was less hopeful as to the corn ;
crop, but the maturity of that crop la still so
far distant as to detract from tbe importance
attached to its present condition. Favorable
progress for the crops Is better calculated than
any other development to settle the fluctuating
opinions over the prospects of the country.
Hope seems to be thus engendered that tho
lower plane of business and Industry may be
nevertheies* on a firm basis. The rather con
stant ratio of the decline In railroad earnings
troes to establish this feeling. A late recovery
in Ontario and Western to-day produced more
Â«ffect elsewhere. In. tbe market than did yester
day's more sensational advance, and the kin
drei coalers were, especially affected. - The
market was still far from being a toroad one,
and was almost wholly in professional hands,
so far as could be perceived^ The personality
cf the brokers employed In- the late buying
conveyed an Impression that some of the larger
Interests were taking stocks, and. the sensa
tional effect of the buying was then enhanced.
The money market was - almost stagnant and
rates were inclined to droop, though with llttlÂ«
money offering at thÂ« present unattractive
rates.
Prices eased off In the final dealings, but the
clone wai steady. Â¦'Â¦â¢ Â¦ Â¦ .
The bond market was Irregular, with weak
spots among the lower grade bonds. ' Total
sales par value, $1,745,000. . ..
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

There la nothing particularly new In current

arejlberal and the distributive demand, while
fair. Is not urgent. There Is continued buying
through broken*, which seems to be the cover-
Ing of- shorts by local packers, but It is not
on A larire scale. The offering?* In the pit are
srnaB. I The market acts bullish, but we do
not see^much In immediate conditions or pros

CHICAGO. June 7.â A large decrease In the
world's visible supply was perhaps the prin
cipal bull influence in the wheat market to
day. Crop damage from the Southwest, how
ever, was of almost equal importance. Final
quotations on July wheat showed a gain of
%@%c. Initial sales of July wheat were
down MUViC at 87%@87%c. On an active de
mand from shorts and good commission-house
buying sentiment soon changed. Much smaller
receipts in the Northwest . had an Important
bearing on the early situation. The tenor of
crop news from the Southwest -also was gen
erally . considered quite bullish. There was
some reaction on selling due to expectations
of a bearish Illinois crop report, but the de
clining tendency wag soon. checked and prices
again started upward. . The strength of corn
was a help to the late wheat market. The
high point In July was reached at t>S*t,fiSSU.c
and the close was at 88ffS.S%c.
Under active covering by shorts a rally of
about lc occurred in corn. The market
clcsed almost at the highest point of the
session. July opened a shade lower to WiSttc
higher at 4S%c; told up .to 4tf%@H9%c and
closed at 40Hc.
Oets wero quiet and dull, but stubbornly
firm. July opened unchanged at 39%c. ranged
between 39%@30Hc and 40c. and closed at
S9a;<ff30%c.
Trading in provisions wag more active and
â¢the market manifested greater strength than
for some time past. There was an urgent de
mand from shorts and a prominent packer
also was a heavy purchaser. Light receipts of
hogs with a firm market at the yards was
responsible for much of the strength. The
close was at the top. with September pork
up 37^c: lard closed with -a gam of 15c and
ribÂ« 17ViC advanced.

The Weather and Crops.
The weÂ«tcly report of A. G. McAdie. section
Â¦iirÂ»^tcr of trie cliTTiate and crop service of the
Weather Bureau. iÂ£ as follows
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The teirptraturc wa* nearly normal and the
v. father generally clear Curing the week.
Light rain fell in pome of the central and
Dortaera districts. Dry Â¦ northerly winds pre
\ai!*-d in nearly all parts of the State.
The damage to the frrain crop by the long
> :;:inuÂ«d dry winds cannot yet bt t-stlroated,
bat it is said to be quite periou.* In some
1 laces, and tho late wheat is undoubtedly bf-
Ing irjured verj' materially every day. Hops,
. orn l>eans and garden vegf tables have also
been ounsiderably damaged. JlarU-y harvest
ic proprtssJng in the Sacramento and fan Joa
qa:n va'.lere and the yiÂ«-1<3 and quality are re
ported fair. " Early wheat is maturing *ipidly
ami will eoon be ready for har\eÂ»t. Haying
:? comr4eted ih some sections and baling is in
ITOurc-ss; the yjÂ»ld and quality are very good
la mos-t sections except the south. Sugar
ntetf and beans are In fair condition. Pas
turtipe If' dry. but still plentiful in most
places. Stock U moving to the mountain
ranges from portions of the Sacramento Val
ley. .â¢-.-- :-.-: ;- . Â¦;
Â«;rapeÂ« have net been injured by the dr>'ir.g
Â«-lnds. so far as reported, and the outlook is
pood for an excellent crop- in all sections.
Chcrrlo and oth*r email fruits were damaged
by high winds during the week. Deciduous
fruits cf nearly ajl varieties will not yield
the larpe cror* exrÂ»ected earlier in the season,
but they are said to be of superior quality.
Apricots, cfcerrtet and berries of-allkincis are
in ir.srket and â¢ tshi;:nÂ»>nts are belnr 'made !o
the Eaet. CltruiÂ« fruit? are In. good condition
and makinp satisfactrry propn-w.

vesting and ha> inn have beÂ«n retarded.
Karicy hardest is in progr-^w in some eections.
and the crop is reported fair In yield and
quality. Hay Is generally of superior quality
tnd the yield iÂ£ very good. A continuance of
the dry winds will materially reduce the yield
of late wheat. Panurajre i* scarce and stock
is moving to the mountain ranges. I*ate cher
ries are being gathered. Cherrien and other
? mall fruits were injured by hlph wind*. Late
I'eacbe* in the vicinity of Newcastle are very
licht. but cherries, Bart;ett pears and early
fachef are abundant

lowed by much ttarmer weather and dry north
erly winds. Lipht rain fell in some *<ecticnÂ«.

in some flacee. while in other* tbe damage
ha* been very light. Portions of Kclano and
Sonoma counties eeem to have been most eerl
oui-ly affected by the wind, and San Benito
end San LuU ObLspo counties were scarcely
injured. Haying is nearly completed in some
sections and {.regressing ny' dJy *Â« others; the
yield and quality are fair. Grain U maturing
rapidly. Grapes are In excellent condition an-1
a large crop if probable. Deciduous fruits

will be gtaersl during the coming m-eek; the
*â¢ le!d is good and the quality medium. The
fruit crop if maturirjt raiildly, and apricots

Stockton is to enjoy the privilege
soon of seeing a through overland
Southern Pacific train pass in and out
of Its city * limits. Yesterday the
Southern Pacific Company announced
that beginning on Sunday train No. 6.
leaving here at 6 p. m., will go East
by way of Stockton Instead of Benicia
as at present, which will make a dif
ference of two hours in its arrival at
Reno, but will give the Slough City
and the. stations between it and this
city whatever benefits may be derived
from the eastbound traffic.
â¢ This will be the first time that the
regular overland trains - have run by
way of Stockton since the Benioia
route was established by the South
ern Pacific Company. On Sunday
there will also be a change in the run
ning time of the Portland train. In
stead of leaving here at 1 p. m. Its
departure time will be 8:05 and the
train which now leaves for Reno at
8:05 will leave at 7 o'clock. The lat
ter, by reason of the shorter route,
will reach Reno two hours In advance
of No. 6. The changes are the result
of the frequent appeals of the people
of Stockton for a through overland
service. . ;:,';,:Â¦ - : j :y^- \ :

. If the attorneys In the Epplnger case
are endeavoring to gain time they suc
ceeded splendidly yesterday. The en
tire morning session and part of the
afternoon was occupied by the court in
listening to the arguments of oppos
ing counsel on a point of law. When
the case was called Colonel F. E. Beck,
manager of the International Banking
Corporation, resumed the stand. He
was questioned regarding a transaction
.with the defendant on April .11, when
a loan of $17,000 was made to Eppinger.
As.Eppinger is being tried for obtain
ing JS900 on : April 14 the attorneys for
the defense objected to any reference
being made to other transactions.
Judge Lawlor excused the Jury that
the point might . be argued^- without
danger of prejudice.
The prosecution contended that the
loans made on April 11 and April 14
were all part of the same transaction
and were the result of a conversation
wherein Colonel Â¦ Beck agreed to ad
vance Eppinger & Co. $25,000, taking
warehouse receipts for wheat stored at
Crockett as security. The attorneys
for the defense on the otner hand.ar
gued that Jacob Eppinger was, being
tried on an Indictment charging him
with fraud committed on. ! April -14,
when he secured $8900 from the Inter
national Banking Corporation' on ware
house receipts. â¢ Other acts o*, his or

time they claimed should not be ad
mitted. . y 1 :
The stand taken by the defense was
sustained ..by Judge Lawlor, -who, in
his_opinlon, said: ;Â¦ Â¦â¢ . *
"The offense is, alleged to have , been
committed on April 14, when false rep
resentations were -made. There" have
been Introduced In evidence. three ware
house receipts and two' insurance' poli
cies. It Is now sought to connect cer
tain conversations . and . acts prior -to
April 14 with the transactions on that
date. The court, is of the/opinion that
the two were distinct transactions and
might be made the' basis of, separate
charges. The -objection Is sustained."

Uncle Sam's troops made a brilliant
showing: in the annual review before
General MacArthur on the golf links at
the .Presidio yesterday morning.
Everything was in favor of the in
spection. The day was cloudless, the
temperature mild - and there was" al
.most no wind at all. Shortly before 9
o'clock the troops were drawn up on
the south side of the golf links In the
following order: .Commencing near the
golf clubhouse was the Coast Artillery
on foot, under command of Colonel
Charles Morris. Next came the Tenth
Infantry, under command of Colonel
Charles E. Noble. Then the Twenty
eighth Infantry, in command of Colonel
William L. Pitcher. Then four battal
ions of artillery, under command of
Captain . John L. Hayden, Captain
Charles A. Bennett, Captain Ira A.
Haynes and Captain A. S. Conklln. On
the extreme western wing was the
third squadron of the Ninth Cavalry,
in command of Colonel Edwin A. God
win.
} Promptly at 9 o'clock General Mac-
Arthur, accompanied by his aides,-Ma
jor âParker "W. West and Captain
Frank" L.. Winn, with Colonel George
Andrews, came on the field. They were
received by a grand fanfare of trump
ets and the major general's salute of
thirteen guns was fired from a battery
of artillery situated on the brow of the
hill. General MacArthur and staff took
up their stand near the northern line
of the links, immediately after which
the regiments headed by Colonel Mor
ris passed before him In review. They
presented a brilliant appearance.
Flags waved in the air and bright
accouterments and drawn sabers flash
ed in the sunshine. So soon as the in
fantry and foot artillery had passed
the reviewing stand they took their
places on the brow of the hill, where
they remained at' rest until the review
was over. The artillery and cavalry
then swung into line and passed before
the reviewing officer' at a trot. On the
third round they made the turn under
full gallop, which was the event of the
day. " "
. ; The cavalry, vrlth sabers drawn, sent
up a great shout as they dashed by the
commanding officer, which was re
echoed by the applause from hundreds
of â¢ people who lined the links and
perched all over the bunkers. The en
joyment of the day was greatly height
ened by the martial music of the three
splendid bands which played alternate
ly during the exercises. The maneu
vers concluded at 10 o'clock, when the
several troops returned to their dlffer-
fare and arms by a falling plank.

The dain&ee done was confined al
most wholly to the piling under -the
street and to the timbers on which the
m^athouses at. the west end of the
avenue are built. James & Co.'s hides
v.ere not hurt. Bernard Horn's Sons'
stables and the H. Moffat Company's
stables were filled with horses, which \
tvith great difficulty were rescued from
danger and led. screaming pitifully and
struggling in their fright, to places of i
safety. Much of the plank road was
" destroyed in getting the fire under con- j
