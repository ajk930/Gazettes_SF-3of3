The day opened with a sharp break,
in prices, under .the influence of a gen

by short interests effected since- -yes

half cent per pound, but a denial of

and the abandonment of his campaign
and' when he was quoted to the effect
that he was about to take a* two
weeks' vacation the downward move
ment became a panic, sel!?ng orders
poured in upon brokers and the mar
ket went to pieces, quotations melting
away 5 and 10 points at a time. . In
fifteen minutes of this panic, .with
every broker a seller and none- '.a
buyer, prices fell vertically almost a.
cent a pound, and the May option In
less than one hour registered a. Je
cline of a cent and a quarter a. pound,
a variation greater than would have
been effected in a week under normal
condition?. Along with the liqiiidz

some selling- for short account..

The sensational decline continue J
apparently until it had spent itself.
After it had been going on for about
an hour nnd fortunes had been wiped
out a few buying order* appeared, an-5
served to allay the storm of liquida
tion and short selling. Then "shorts'!
began to cover and there was a quick!
rally of from TO to 75 points. But it
bad been a terrible hour.
Only once before in the history of
the Cotton Exchange have the total
transactions for on*Â» day exceeded
those of to-day, when the two million

The market was finally steady with
the three active months 20 to 52
points up from the bottom, but at a
net decline of 65 to 87 points on the
old &nd 5 to 27 points on the new crop
months.
The early decline was helped by re
ports of a private settlement, said to
have been made last night, in which
it was estimated something like 100,
000 balÂ«Â»s were concerned.
FLOOD OF SELLING ORDERS.
NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 2.â The re
peated warnings and prophecies of
conservative traders came true to-day
end the cotton market showed a series
at eharp breaks, the last and most se
vere of which lowered prices almost 100
points, or a cent under the closing price
of yesterday.
Unlike the - two other memorable
breaks of this season, the slump was
unattended by much excitement. A
moderate volume of trade had been
shown all day, with the largest amount
of business coming from room traders
and outside scalpers. Suddenly- the
entire ring was flooded with selling or
ders and prices commenced a mad
chase downward. They dropped five
and ten points at a time under the
pressure. What weak "longs" there
were in the market quickly let go and
added to the volume of selling orders.
Some few stop-Iocs orders were re
ported and , thrown upon the market
But almost as quickly as it was applied
the pressure was removed and prices
ehowed a quick recovery on bujing or
ders.

Dramatic Incident
of Parliament's
Opening.
LONDON, Feb. 2.â "My right hon
orable 'friend, the member from- West
Birmingham/' as Austen Chamberlain
described his father, was the central
figure in the drama that marked the
opening of Parliament to-day.
No playwright could have devised a
more curious situation. For the first
time in years Joseph Chamberlain took
his s.eat as a private citizen and was
stysarated Trom his former colleagues in
the Cabinet by the gangway. From_
this seat he saw his son act as leader
of the House of- Commons, a position
which* Joseph Chamberlain, with all his
years of . Parliamentary experience,
ne.yer attained. "
Premier Balfour was laid up with in
fluenza and therefore was unable to
be present. When Austen Chamberlain
arose to reply in behalf of the party of
which his own father is believed to be
the most powerful member, the House
was spellbound. Until that moment
Akers-Douglas, Secretary of State for
Home Affairs, was generally expected
â to take Premier Balfour's place, arid
interest in the proceedings were height
ened by. the fact that Sir Gampbell-
Bannerman, the Liberal leader, had
just concluded a merciless* satire on
Austen Chamberlain's father. .-The sit
uation _ was without parallel in the
recollection o # f the oldest politician, and
all eyes were fixed alternately upon
the father and the son.
CHEERS HIS SOX OX.
Joseph Chamberlain, who had sat un
moved under, the ridicule of the Liberal
leader, turned nervously toward his son,
who ; now â  takes precedence over him.
With his monocle 'in his eye, an orchid
in his buttonhole and his hands clasped
across his knees, the most prominent
figure in the British empire sat and
listened to his own â¢ defense from the
lips of his son. â 
Austen Chamberlain spoke haltingr
ly and under evident strain; yet, when
he referred to his father it was always
as "the member from West Birming
ham." There was a tinge of impas
sioned feeling In his words, which
brought constantly to his hearers a
realization of the'relations between the
two men. Now and again Jeers greet
ed the youngest member of the Cabi
net, whereupon, with unmistakable
anger, his father turned his glance in
the direction of the offender and oc
casionally. Joseph Chamberlain cheer-,
ed his son on with an emphatic "Hear!
hear!"
As Austen Chamberlain neared the
conclusion of his defense of the atti
tude of Premier Balfour and his father
toward the fiscal question the inter
ruptions grew more frequent, and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer clutched
Ihe brass-bound treasury box, . on
which Gladstone was so fond of lean
ing, and ; addressed his remarks al
most solely in the direction of his
father. Defiantly Austen Chamberlain
accused Sir Henry Campbell-Banner
man of attacking the Premier in his
absence, and with a touch of pride he
said: |
"The member from West Birming
ham is here; he can speak for and
look after hjmself."

DEMOCRAT
ARGUES FOR
THE CANAL
Clarke of Arkansas
Praises Course of
President.
Says Mr. Roosevelt Did His
Plain Duty in Recog
nizing Panama. â¢
Minority Party, He Asserts, Will Give
Treaty Sufficient Votes to In
sure Its Ratification.
WASHINGTON, Febi 2.â Clarke, the
new Democratic Senator "from Arkan
sas, made his first speech in the Senate
to-day. He spoke two hours, and an
nounced his Indorsement of every po
sition taken by the President in con
nection with the Panama revolt and
in the negotiation of the treaty with
the new state. He even said that, in
view of the provocation given by Co
lombia, the President might have been
expected to go further than he did in
advancing the cause of Panama. He
declared that there was more popular
support of the course of the President's
policy among Democrats than among
Republicans, and said that the Demo
cratic votes necessary to ratify the
treaty were assured.
Clarke said that the civil war now
going on in Colombia was but a re
action of the revolution which had been
in progress for the last three years, and
in support of this statement he re
viewed governmental conditions in Co
lombia, saying that its rulers were men
who found in warfare their most profit
able aj^d congenial oiiyny^. These men
were for the canal, he said,~ ; simply
because thev saw a prospect of get
ting $10,000,000 out of it, and not be
cause they cared anything about the
United States or even about the wel
fare of their own country.
Clarke also found in the treaty of
1846 justification for the attitude" of the
United States, and contended that Co
lombia did not have unlimited sover
eignty in the sense that England, Ger
many or France had. He insisted that
1 if Colombia itself could not build the
canal it was bound, because of the at
titude of the United States toward it,
to permit this country to build it. He
then declared that as the republic was
an accomplished fact it would be an
act of foolhardiness for the United
States to refuse to deal with it.
Our acts of "friendly supervision,"
he said, should have convinced Colom
bia of the determination of the United
States to do ristat under all circum
stances, and the Colombian people
Bhould have know., they were asking
too much when they accepted our pro
tection under the Monroe doctrine for
eighty years and then demanded the
right to be treated as an equal power
with "the United States. Instead of
maintaining a friendly attitude, Co
lombia, he said, had begun a course
of double dealing and bad faith even
before the Colombian Congress had be
gun consideration of the Hay-Herran
treaty, and 1 this, he asserted, had been
continued to the time of Panama's se
cession.
Clarke contended that the Colombian
authorities knew perfectly well that tha
revolution was imminent and there was
no foundation for the charge that the
Panama revolt had been incited since
the adjournment of the Colombian Con
gress. It was not to be denied that
the United States knew what was go
ing on in Panama, and if it were nec
essary to show that the President was
unaware of the state of affairs in order
to establish his Integrity that must be
done at the expense of his Intelligence
and even of his performance of offi
cial duty.
Clarke announced his disagreement
with the Senators who contended that
the President should have turned to the
Nicaragua route after failing to secure
Colombia's ratification of the canal
treaty. His principal reason for this
was announced to be his belief that
we should have only a sea level canal,
which, he said, was possible in the
Panama route, and hot possible on the
Nicaraguan route. He did not believe
that any but a sea level canal would
pay expenses.
He declared his gratification that the
House expression given in favor of the
carifel had ' come from Democratic
States, and added - : that Democratic
votes would make the ratification of
the treaty certain. The Republican
party could, make- no such claim and
the President; had received no assur
ances of support from the Republican
party at large.

WILLIAM C. WHITNEY
DIES FROM EFFECTS
OF AN OPERATION
Under tfie Influence
of Ether When
Death Comes.
NEW YORK, Feb. 2.â William Col
lins Whitney, 'former Secretary of the
Navy, died a few minutes after 4 o'clock
this afternoon at his home, 871 Fifth
avenue, in his sixty-fourth year. He
died while under the influence of ether,
administered' preparatory to a second
operation for appendicitis. At his bed
side were his son, Harry Payne Whit
ney; his daughter, Dorothy Whitney,
and Dr. William T. Bull, the chief sur-"
geon in attendance.,
Mr. Whitney was taken ill on Fri
day night at the performance of "Rigo
letto" in the Metropolitan Opera-house,
and had to leave before the opera end
ed. .Dr. Walter B. James, the Whitney
family physician, was summoned and
found that the condition of the patient
was such that, after consultation, an
operation was decided upon and was
performed by Dr. Bull. The patient
rallied so well that it was confidently
believed he would recover. .
Mr. Whitney's condition became very
grave, however, on Sunday and to-day,
and at a consultation neld this, after
noon the conclusion was reached that
the only hope lay in a second opera
tion.
PREPARE FOR OPERATION.
A bulletin issued in the morning
stated that there had been a slight
improvement In the patient's condition,
but shortly before 3 o'clock 'alarming
symptoms were noted and hurried
preparations -were- made, for a second
operation. Mr. Whitney was placed un
der the Influence of ether, but whether
the operation was proceeded with or
not is unknown. \
When the physicians perceived that
the patient was . in danger of death.
Harry Payne Whitney and Miss Dor
othy Whitney were immediately noti
fied. They hastened to the side of their
father, and in. a few minutes he had
breathed his last. Oxygen was used
and all the skill of the physicians and
surgeons brought into play to save the
life of the distinguished patient, but
to no Wail.
It was 5 o'clock . before . the simple
fact of his - death was. made public.
Later the following statement was is
sued:
"Mr. Whitney died at 4 o'clock of
peritonitis and blood poisoning, follow
ing an operation for, appendicitis."
PLANS FOR THE FUNERAL.

vices will be held in Grace Church,

COLOMBIA'S
FIRST BLOW
AT PANAMA
Attack Upon Indian
Allies, of New
Republic.
Special Cable to The Call and New York
Herald. Copyright, 19O1. by the New York
Herald Publishing Company.
PANAMA. Feb. 2. â Positive infor
mation was received from Colon to
day that an attack had been made by
Colombian troops on an Indian vil
lage on the San Bias coast, several
miles this side of Cape Tiburon. It Is
said that the soldiers arrived In
canoes and drove away the Indians.
After firing a few shots and killing
and wounding several Indians the Co
lombians took possession of the
houses. It is not possible to obtain
further facts.
Rear Admiral Coghlan, immediately
upon receipt of the news, sent the
gunboat Bancroft, which had been
coaling with the expectation of start
ing to-night for Chiriqui Lagoon, to
investigate.
Officers who have 'recently been
scouting along the coast fully credit
the report. ' It has long been said that
the Colombian plan of campaign
would be to take possession of so toe
point admittedly in Panama territory
and not on the line of transit on the
Isthmus, in the belief that while such
would be admittedly a hostile action
the United States would not' attack,
but would-leave the affair wholly to
Panama troops.
,. One theory, is that a few companies
of soldiers, with officers, left Titulati
without the sanction of .their su
periors af ten getting weary of the ill
ness and, poor rations in the Colom
bian camps.
; It is said that no provisions have
been -sent to Titulati from Cartagena
since a month ago, when twenty
days' rations per capita were . distrib
uted. The supplies consisted of lard,
rice and kerosene, ,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONG BEACH, Feb. 2.â Under tha
cover of darkness three attempts have
been made in as many days to wreck
trains of the Pacific Electric Railway
Company, the Huntington line running
between here, Los Angeles and Alaxni
tos Bay. The latest work of the would
be train wreckers was done last night
on the Alamitos line, which runs along
a high bluff above the beach. A train
was speeding along when the motor
man saw a dark object on the track
ahead, and stopped just In time to pre
vent striking a tie which had been se
curely lashed to the inside rail in such
position that had the car struck it, it
would have been hurled down a thirty
foot embankment. As it was the car
struck the tie and broke the fender.
The other attempts have been made
in much the same manner. On Sunday
night two ties" were placed crosswise
over one rail, the ends being buried in
holes dug for that purpose.
Baling wire had been used to tie them
so that they could not be knocked
from position when struck by a car.
apd near the place the bolts holding a
fishplate had been tampered with, the
object evidently being to cause the
track to spread as the train passed over
it. In the third instance several ties
had been piled on the track, but were
not fastened to it.
Electric trains which traverse this
line are rarely heavily loaded, and
whether the motive of the criminate
who have attempted to wreck them be
robbery or revenge is a matter of con
jecture. The work of double tracking
the lines In that part of the system is
now in progress and ties are scattered
all along the road. The track Is now
being carefully guarded.

3I1L CLEVEIJkXD'S TRIBUTE.
Former President Deeply Shocked by
the Death of His Friend.
PRINCETON. N. J., Feb. 2.â Grover
Cleveland was deeply moved when he
learned of Mr. Whitney's death. To a
press representative he said:
"The news of Mr. Whitney's death
has greatly shocked me. As I think of
him my mind, passing beyond recent
years, dwells upon the day of my asso
ciation with him In high official duty,
and recalls the tfme when I had' the
opportunity to enjoy his unreserved in
timacy and friendly companionship.
Our relations have never changed, but
the exigencies of life have forbidden
recent close intercourse, j ...
"Mr. Whitney had more calm, force
ful efficiency than any man I ever
knew. In work that interested him he
actually seemed to court difficulties and
to find pleasure and exhilaration in
overcoming them. His conquest over
the obstacles he encountered in under
taking to build up our navy afforded
him. greater delight than the contem
plation of the great results he achieved
in his "department of the Government.
His judgment was quick, clear and as
tonishingly accurate; and when it was
called into action his mental poise was
so complete that neither passion or ir
ritation could lead him astray. â 
"While I remember all this with ad
miration and affection, 1 recall with
more tender sentiment Mr. Whitney's
devotion to his friends, his extreme
consideration for all with whom he
came in contact, his thoughtfulness for
the ease and comfort of others and his
ready impulse to help those who need
ed help. I mourn the death of -a friend
of whom it can be truthfully said that

in his character were combined mental
traits of a high order and loving quali

friends with hooks of steeL"
WHITNEY'S NOTABLE CAREER.
After Founding the New Navy He De
clined All Political Honors.
William Collins Whitney, member of
President Cleveland's first Cabinet, and
the father of "the new navy," was born
July 5, 1841, in the quaint little town of
Conway, Mass. He was of good descent
on both sides of his house. Starting
from John Whitney, who came to New
England in 1635, he could number
among his ancestors many who were
famed for prowess in the earlier war
times and especially his revolutionary
grandfather. General Josiah Whitney,
born in 1713â <:ied 1806â who fought with
the British and Colonial troops at
Crown Point in 1774 and yet was one
of the first to take up arms for, the
colonies in 1776. He went into the war
In a modest capacity and came out. at
the end as a brigadier general â  (1783).
All along down Mr. Whitney's ancestors
in the male line were men of prom
inence in the community and* State in
which they lived. On his mother's side
his ancestry went back to William
Bradford, Governor of Plymouth Col
ony.
After a course in the schools of his
vicinity young Whitney wei.t through
Willeston Seminary. East Hampton.
Mass.. and then entered Yale College,
from which he was graduated in June.
1863. He then spent two years at and
graduated from the Dane Law School,
Harvard, in 1865. Soon after his grad
uation he began the prrr ~e of laf.- in
New York City, the Mecca and the
grave- of many a young aspirant for
honor3 in his chosen profession.
He soon made his mark at the bar
and attracted attention outside his pro
fession. In 1871 he was active in or
ganizing a Young Men's Democratic
Club in. New York, and after filling sev
eral other offices was appointed Cor
poration Counsel in 1875, and. by. re
forms within and without his office did
much for the current and future wel
fare of the city that had so honored
him: He took an active part in the
campaign that elected Samuel J. Tilden
Governor of New York in 1874. â¢
- In 1882 he resigned his office in order
to devote his attention to his private
business, which was large and remun
erativei ,
Already cognizant of his merit and
efficiency, in March, 1885, President
Cleveland offered to Mr. Whitney the
naval portfolio, which was accepted.
In his first report to Congrt ss he pre
sented a plan for the reorganization of
the Navy Department, for which, after
being put in action, it was claimed
that' "for the first time In the history
of the navy it has been. possible to pre
pare complete statements by classes,
of receipts and expenditures, of sup
plies throughout the entire service and
of the total valuation of supplies on
hand for issue at all shore stations."
Proceeding to the' construction of the
"new navy." with which his name
should always be identified, he aimed at
putting the United States again in the
posit.on which it once enjoyed as a
naval p.wer and above everything else
making it independent of the rest oi
the world for aupplies in case of ..var.
To him was due the good condition of
the United States -navy shown during
the Lpanish- American War. When he
went into office he found that neither
armor nor forglngs for high power
guns nor rapid-fire, guns could be pro
duce Z oh this side of the Atlantic. He
insisted on American product and when
he went out of office we were getting
from American workshops the best ar
mor and guns that were 'made in the

ready for work.
It Is worthy of note that on his re
tirement from office one of Mr. Whit
ney's politi-al opponents. Senator
Plumb of Kansas, said in a speech to
'the Senate: "I am glad to say in the
closing hours of Mr. Whitney's admin
istration that the affairs' of his depart
ment have 'been well administered.
They have been well administered not
only in the sense that everything has
been honestly and faithfully done, but
we have got the keen competition of
Ameri-an manufactories and the in
ventive genius of all our people, so that
we may not only expect the best re
sults, but great improvement each
year. And the result is such that I
am prepared to say that in ten years
we shall have the best navy in the
world."
After his retirement from office in
1890 Whitney took an- active part in
national politics, especially contribut
â  ing to the re-election of his former
thief, Mr. Cleveland, in 1892. but for
himself resolutely declined all political
preferment.
In later years he was out of public
life, except that he became interested
in such international sporting events
as yachting and horse racing. 'which
more or less kept his name before the
public.
Mr. Whitney belonged to all the
leading clubs in New York City and to
some in other parts of the country.
He was also a member of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren and a. trustee of the Peabody
Museum of Yale. He was besides, di
rector in many of the larger corpora
tions of New York City:
In 1869 Mr. Whitney was married to
Miss Flora Payne, daughter of Henry
B. Payne. United States Senator from
Ohio. Of this union were born Harry
Payne Whitney, who was married in
1896 to Gertrude, daughter of Cor
nelius Vanderbilt; Pauline, who was
married in 1895 to Almeric Hugh
Paget, descended from a long line of
English peers; Payne Whitney and
Dorothy Whitney.
In 1892 Whitney contracted a sec
ond matrimonial alliance with Miss
Elite S. Randolph of East Court, Wilt
shire, England, who soon after died
of injuries received from falling from
her horse in the hunting field.
Mr. Whitney's city residence was
871 Upper Fifth avenue, New York,
and his country home, October'Moun

ton !<->r that office is being actively
urged by his friends. Senator Ralston,
accompanied by his friend, ex-United
States Senator Felton, arrived here
some days ago from New Orleans and
are at the New TVillard. Felton, since
his arrival, has been laid up with a
Flight attack of grip, but work has
gor.p on in behalf of Ralston. It has
been intimated that Senators Perkins
and Bard might possibly, in view of the
circumstances, effect an agreement
upon the candidacy of Ralston, as it is
understood that their differences in this
rÂ«.-gard is the one thing that would
cause the President to hesitate at mak

place was left vacant by the resigna

has been the champion of W. M. Cut

has nominated Ralston. The question

Cutter in nomination before any man
had been named for the place since the
withdrawal of the name of Wood of

WARSHIPS.
Russian Army Is Moving Forward to the Yalu and
Japan Mobilizes Her Naval Reserves.
Special Cablegram to The Call and New York Herald. Copyright, 1904, by the New York Herald Publishing Co.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 2.â Russia's
reply to Japan will not be sent until
Friday next, or Thursday at the very
earliest. On no day has the situation
been generally accepted as so grave as
to-day. A highly placed official this
afternoon admitted that this was the
case, saying that the Japanese seemed
to have made up their minds that It
would be more advantageous for them
to fight now than later.
Publication of news of the calling out
of the reserves in the eastern provinces
and of reinforcements being hastily,
sent to Vladivostok and Port Arthur
caused hopes of peace to sink. If any
thing more were needed it came from
Port Arthur in the form of a telegram
published In the papers here, saying
that the transports' troops are moving
to Yalu. This is interpreted in official
circles as meaning war.
As a final touch came news of the
mobilization of the Japanese naval re
serves: The Bourse and business men
took the view that the situation was
bad.
"Russia cannot climb down," said a
general as a final word last evening.
"I don't see the remotest possibility of
war being avoided. At best it can only
be postponed for a short time."
It was sa'.d to-day by one who has
considerable knowledse of what is go
ing on behind the scenes that the mat
ter of the Russian ships leaving the
Black Sea had once more been vigor
ously taken up and that the Sultan
had been constrained to give his con
sent.
I also heard a mysterious statement
that it had been arranged that war
should be finally brought about by a
well and previously, arranged move
ment made by Admiral Alexieff, which
would forthwith give Russia the domi
nating strategic position.

able Japan would immediately -throw
30,000 troops into Korea to safeguard
her interests there. Some twenty com

been chartered by the Government,
those of the Toyo Kisen Kalsha having
been converted into fast cruisers, as
have also some of the Nippon Yusen
Kaisha boats, including the Nlkko. The
second reserves of the Kokura division
were called out. Various military ap

attache to the Seoul legation.
The provisioning of the fleet and pur
chase of supplies for the naval and mil
itary personnel were completed, some
American firms securing profitable or
ders. Tenders for the supply of an
enormous quantity of food and pro
visions were invited in the Manila pa
pers and it was inferred that Manila
might be made a supplementary base
of supplies In the eyent of hostilities,
as British ports, such as Hongkong,
etc., would- be too closely watched to
be available.
One notable feature of the lull had
been the Increased friendliness shown
toward the United States by the whole
Japanese people. <ThIs was manifested
by the attention showered on leading
representatives. United States Minister
Lloyd C. Griscom, who Has won great
credit among his colleagues for his
quiet, non-committal bearing through
out the crisis, of course, has not figured
in any demonstration personally, but
a military attache of the legation was
one of the special guests of honor at
a banquet given on the '14th ultimo at
Tokio by representatives of the bank
ing and commercial interests in honor
of the special correspondents of the
foreign press. The entertainment
proper comprised a modern masque and
some speeches. Sonoda Kokichi, presi
dent of the Nobles Bank, made an elo
quent speech, indicating Japan's re
solve and readiness to act and the in
spiration afforded by the moral support
of the United States. Lieutenant Trow

warmly applauded.
The Empress of China brought specie
valued at 4,000.000 yen and landed it at
Victoria. While nothing definite could
be found to account for such an Im

supplies in British Columbia.

been somewhat relieved and this tends

MAY SEND AN ULTIMATUM.
Japan to Make Final Move Before
Declaring: Hostilities.
TOKIO, Feb. 2.â The Russian note is
still undelivered and the Government
and people of Japan do not possess
any definite information concerning the
time of its arrival of its contents. Rus
sia's delay, coupled with the announce
ment of continued movement of rein
forcements into Manchuria, increases
the strain of the tension, while It di
minishes the already slim prospects for
peace. The Government has been urged
to dispatch a peremptory note to 'St.
Petersburg, threatening to declare war
if refused immediate satisfaction in the
way c-f a reply to its previous note; but
still the Government is patiently wait
ing, although it: is manifest if the de,
lay be much prolonged it will act en
ergetically.
Events will move rapidly when the
note is finally, received, if it is mate
rially unsatisfactory and the prospect
for additional negotiation is slight, al
though Japan may dispatch an ulti
matum before striking. The Japanese
show' a remarkable outward calm and
no scenes similar to those in America
and England before recent wars are
witnessed. There aer occasional dem
onstrations and oujcroppings of pop
ular feeling, but the casual visitor to
the larger cities can see but little out
of the ordinary in the disposition and
behavior of the people. There is, how
ever, an undercurrent of desperate de
termination runningthe nation's length
and breadth. The people have counted
the cost and made final preparations,
so- that if forced to fight they are ca
pable of waging and sustaining war in
a manner that will surprise the world.
PLACING ONUS UPON JAPAN.
French Press Busy Creating: Sympa
thy for Muscovite Ally.
PARIS, Feb. 2.â The Havas Agency
has circulated a dispatch to the effect
that Russia's reply to Japan, the sub
stance of which* has been communicat
ed to the foreign chancellories every
where, has created an impression that
war will be averted. The concessions
go beyond general expectation and il
lustrate the sentiments of equity and
loyalty actuating the Czar.
,*'If, in spite of the very large satis
faction Japan will receive," continues
the dispatch, "the issue of the crisis
should be war, Japan will incur the
whole responsibility and find herself
morally isolated." .
. The reply, the Havas Agency says,
only awaits its final drafting and will
be presented on February 5.
The French Foreign Office authorized
a denial of the report, printed in New
York and emanating from Paris, to the
effect that the French and British Gov
ernments had' agreed to" exert pressure
upon Japan for the acceptance of the
coming Russian reply.
.Motono, the Japanese Minister, in
the course of an' interview published in
the Temps to-day, is quoted as saying:
; "They know nothing in' Tokio con
cerning the contents of the Russian
answer, and Baron Koraura, the Ja
panese Foreign Minister, will know its
contents only â  wheji he has the reply

WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.â By unani

resident Commissioner to Congress
from Porto Rico was. given additional

to that of a delegate from a Territory,

A bill which provided for a "delegate

the action of the House at the last

Porto Rico will receive under the ac

the benefits extended in the measure.
A lively parliamentary debate pre
ceded the adoption of the resolution,
which was reported from the Commit

The minority members of the commit

in question, and to extend in the mean?

ROME, Feb. 2,â It seems more and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY' 3, 1904.
CHAMBERLAIN CHAMPIONED BY SON f.
AT THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT
Continued From Page I, Column 3.
Hef when the speech was over and
generally termed the proceeding as
one of the most extraordinary per
sonal situations that ever bad oc
curred and the speech as one of the
weakest defenses of the Government's
policy ever made.
. On behalf of Premier Balfour, Aus
ten Chamberlain declared the House
of Commons must first decide "whether
or not it desired any change at all In
the fiscal system, and until that point
was settled the opposition demand for
details of the Government's fiscal re
form plafi could not be'granted. 0
* -With th'e exception of the foregoing
unexpected incident and the spirited
defense of his .action in the Whitaker
Wright case by Sir Robert Finlay. the
Attorney -general, the opening of Par
liament was uneventful.
King Edward and Queen Alexandra
drove in full state to the House of
Lords, w^ere with much ceremony the
session was declared open. His Maj
esty's speech from thethrone is gener
ally regarded as having merely record
e3 the facts already known, while the
Government's â¢ legislative programme
has been announced already in these
dispatches. Lord Lansdowne, the For
eign Secretary," confirmed what has
"heretofore been generally conceded as
â  Great Britain's attitude in the Far
Eastern crisis, without throwing any
new light on the negotiations. Both in
the House of Lords and the House of
Commons the British Thibetan expedi
tion and the warr in Somaliland came in
for. criticism, but the opposition after
the fiscal question laid stress chiefly
upon fhe Importation of Chinese Into
the Transvaal and the report of the
War Commission.
BROKEN PARTY LIXES.
In the House Â©f Lords the absence of
the Duke of Devonshire (formerly
Lord President of the Council) and
Lord Balfour of Burleigh (former Sec
retary for Scotland)" from the Ministe
rial bench was noted, but in spite of
this the House of Peers ended theÂ°ses
siori with a passivity that quite belied
the party cleavage whidi has occurred
since last they met.
In the House of Commons this cleav
age was made apparent, for Charles T.
Ritchie (former Chancellor of the Ex
chequer) and Lord George Hamilton
(fortnerÂ«Secretary for India) both took
their sea|s below the gangway and di
rectly in front of o Joseph ChambeFlain
and, curiously enough, between Lord
Hugh Cecil, the bitter opponent of the
former Colonial Secretary, and Jesse
Collings, *iis most faithful adherent.
As one member said, "everything is at
sixes and sevens."
The government is not likely to be
turned out on â¢: John Morley's amend
ment to the address in reply to the
speech, from the throne, which is
aga'inst a return to protective duties,
but the general impression prevails
that the government will not be able
to keep its forces together to see the
session end.
POLICY OF IKISH PARTY.
The Irish party, which now almost
holds the balance of power, held a con
ference during the day and decided to
take no action until the government
has defined its intentions toward the
CatholicIJniverslty and the amendment
to the land purchase act. It is prob
able that Redmond's adherents wllli'ab
stain from voting for the present on
Any division which would endanger the
government. Redmond will enunciate
the policy of his party to-morrow.
Sir Robert Finl&y, .toward the close
of .the night session, said he intended
to amend the law dealing with com
pany cases, such as those of Whitaker
Wright. H.e declared that after cafe
ful consideration of the evidence at his
dfsposairin 1902, it seemed to him that
Wright's misstatemfents were really in
support of the~"corner" which would
have rehabilitated the London and
Globe Finance Corporation and were
made with the view of benefiting rath
er than injuring the shareholders. The
Attorney General announced that the
government would pay the costs of the
Wright prosecution.
Throughout this first sitting the op
position appeared much invigorated by
its successes in the bye-elections.
POMP AND CEREMONIAL.
Ancient Custom Is Observed in the
Opening of Parliament.
LONDON, Feb. 2.â "King Edward
opened Parliament to-day with all the
ceremonial that ha* been in vogue since
his ascension to the throne. None of
the familiar outdoor features were lack
ing. The weather conditions, however,
were too depressing to permit of much
enthusiasm. <
Early in the day occurred the time
honored search of the vaults of the
houses of Parliament for conspirators
and later came the crowds, under a
forest of umbrellas, always eager for
anything in the way of^ pageantry;
but their ranks were thinned by the
inclement weather. . In the passage of
the -royal pair along the troop-lined
route from Buckingham Palace to St.
Stephens no novelty was introduced
and the effect was sadly marred by the
drenched appearance of the cortege.
Half a dozen state carriages with the
suites preceded the ornate coach of
state, drawn by eight cream-colored
Hanoverians and bearing the King and
Queen. . The procession was surrounded
by the usual retinue of equerries, out
riders, yeomen of the guard, exercising
their ancient right to be in close at
tendance on the sovereigns, and an
escort of household cavalry.
The Prince and Princess of Wales
had a small procession of their own
from Marlborough House:
After entering^ the House of Lords
by the royal gate beneath the Victoria
tower, the King and Queen were robed,
and, preceded by the state regalia,
passed In procession to the chamber,
where the lords had assembled to hear
the King's speech. Many peeresses
were present and their feathers, jewels
and bright dress, with the. varl-colored
robes of the legislators of the upp.^r
house and the brilliant/diplomatic uni
forms, combined to make an effective
scene.
Embassador Choate was confined to
his room by a slight cold and 'was un
able to attend, so the United States
embassy was represented by Secretary
White and Second Secretary Carter.
On the arrival: of the members of the
House of Commons. King Edward read
the speech from the throne. Touching
upon the Alaska decision the King's
speech said that on some points the ver
dict was favorable to the British claims
and on others it had been adverse.
Much as this last circumstance was to
be deplored it must nevertheless be a
matter for congratulation that the mis
understandings in which the ancient
boundary treaties, made in ignorance
of geographical facts, are so fertile
have in this case been finally removed
from the field of controversy.
The crisis in the Far East is touched
upon briefly in the King's speech, as'
follows: ,. *
"I have watched with concern the t
course of the negotiations between the
governments of. Russia and Japan in
regard to their- respective Interests oin.
China and Korea, and a disturbance
of the peace in those regions could not
but have deplorable consequences. Any
assistance which my Government can
usefully render toward the promotion
of a pacific solution will be gladly af
forded."
Another point of interest to the Unit
ed States was a reference to cotton, as ,
follows:
"The insufficiency of t^ie - supply of
raw material upon which the greal cot
ton Industry of ' this country depends
has Inspired me with deep concern. I
trust the efforts being made in various
parts of my empire to increase the
area of cultivation may be attended
with a large measure of success."
The; speech makes the usual refer
ence to" the satisfactory character of
foreign relations, touching upon the
conclusion of the Anglo-French arbi
tration agreement as being "a happy.
Illustration, of 'the friendly feelings of
the two countries," and refers to the
Somaliland expedition and the Mace
donian reforms, expressing the hope
that th'e "practical measures for the
amelioration, so sorely needed, of these
unhappy regions" will be carried out
during the present respite in tfie dis
turbances. / â  ,
â¢After mentioning thÂ£ "political mis
sion which, with the concurrence of
the Chinese Government, has entered
the Thibetan territory in order to se
cure d\ie obserVance of conventions,"
saying that a Chinese official had been
dispatched from Peking to meet the
mission, and expressing trust that an
arrangement would be reached to
peacefully remove the constant source
of friction, the speech closes with the
warning that, although the estimates
have been framed with the utmost de
sire for economy, -the burden imposed
by the â¢ necessities of naval and mili
tary defense is "undoubtedly serious,."
and mentions some of the.proposed do
mestic legislation, as already forecasted
in these dispatches.
No suggestion o of legislation concern
ing Ireland was contained in the King's
speech. â¢ . o
At the conclusion of the ceremtfny
ih the House of Lords the King and
Queen returnedÂ»to the palace and the
members of the , House of Commons
repaired to their own house and ad
journed at 4 o'clock;
"When the House of Commons as
sembled later for business the Souse
was crowded and there was great/ani
mation, in striking contrast to the lintâ
lessness generally characterizing the
opening of a. session. .Joseph Cham
berlain was warmly cheered by the
majority of the Conservatives as he
entered and* took a seat below, the
gangway. The other- Parliamentary
leaders were "accorded hearty recep
tions by their followers.
The Secretary of State for Home
Affairs, Akers-Douglas, in the absence
of Premier Balfour, 'temporarily as
sumed the duties of leader of 'Â«ie
House.
The mover and seconder of the ;id
dress in reply to the speech from the
throne referred with satisfaction to
the settlement of the Alaska dispute
and paid tribute to the manner in
which the award was received in Can
ada? . i
Lawrence Hardy, Conservative, who
moved the address, alluded to "the
war that was threatening a vast area
of the Far East," and said he would
trust the British^Government to do
Its utmost to maintain ueace.
Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman,
the Liberal leader oftihe House, fol-â¬
lowed. After expressing regret at the
absence of the Premier, (Sir He,ifry
said rie desired to question the Gov
ernment regarding its attitude on the
fiscal question and asked if It were a
new government with a new policy.
The only way of dealing with the ex
isting confusion, he added, was to ap
peal to the sense of the electors of the
country. In conclusion, Sir Henry se
verely arraigned the Government's at
titude on the fiscal question and an
nounced that John Morley would in a
few days introduce a more compre
hensive amendment involving the
whole situation.
Austen Chamberlain, the Chancel
lor of the Exchequer, replied. He de
fended the Government, whose fiscal
policy, he said, had been . clearly to
stand by the Premier. All the Gov
ernment asked for was freedom to
negotiate, which would enable It ito
preserve the .open door and freedom
of trade.
The sitting was suspended at 7:30
o'clock.
The House of Lords commenced the
business ' of the session at 4 o'clock.
The galleries were well filled, among
those present being the Prince of
Wales, the Duke of Connaught, Lord
Roberts and the Duke, of Devonshire.
After the introduction of new peers,
Lord Fitzwilliam (Liberal-Unionist)
moved the f address in reply to the
speech from the throne, which was
seconded by Lord Hytton (Conserva
tive).
Earl Spencer, the Liberal leader in
the Houso, followed. He paid a trib
ute to the late Lord Salisbury,- the
Duke of Devonshire and Lord-Lans
downe, and, continuing, alluded to the
situation in the Far East.' The. Earl
said he hoped the Government's
friendly office had been offered to both
powers, especially to Japan, and asked
for information from the Government
regarding. Somaliland and Thibet, and
the situation in South Africa, to" which,
he pointed out,' no reference had been
made in the speech from the throne.
Earl Spencer added that he hoped
an early decision in regard to" the Gov
renment's policy on the fiscal question
would be reached and announced that
the opposition .would take every op
portunity of bringing the question be
fore the country.
Lord Lansdowne. responded. He con
gratulated: the House s on the conclu
sion of the Anglo-French and f Anglo-
Italian arbitration* treaties, deplored
â¦he situation in the near and Far East
and expressed the hope that a pacific
solution of the difficulties in both cases
would be reached.
. In regard to the United States, Lord
Lansdowne said the Goxernment haÂ«i
endeavored to translate into practice
what it affirmed rather as a matter of
principle in the French and Italian'
treaties. . â¢ .
Commenting on the subject of the
Alaskan decision, Lord Lansdowne
said that, although the tribunal which
disposed of the Alaskan difficulty was
not, strictly speaking:, arbitral, its ef
forts illustrated the possibility of set
tling, by other than diplomatic means
long standing, dangerous international
differences. The "condition of Alaska
rnight have brought Great Britain into
a serious and acute controversy with
,the United States. The finding of the
tribunal doubtless was note entirely
satisfactory to Great Britafn. but no
one expectedit to be an entirely favor
able verdict-
Lord Lansdowne was inclined to find
some consolation in the fact that his
military and naval adviser were confi
dent that the two islands in Portland
Channel which had gone to the United
States were not of ..any 1 strategical
I value whatever.
Concerning the Russo-Japanese dis
pute, Lord Lansdowne said It was an
axiom in diplomatic circles not to offer
good offices until they were asked for.
Neither of the disputants had asked for
them. In fact, it was an open secret
that one aÂ£ least of the disputants 4iad
said that mediation was not desirable
at the present time. But should the op
portunity offer, his Majesty's Govern-,
ment would gladly avail itself thereof.
The Thibet mission, said Lord Lans
downe, was political^and not military.
It was for the purpose of promoting a
more satisfactory arrangement for
friendly intercourse in trade.
Coming to the fiscal situation, Lord
Lansdowne said the policy recommend
ed by Chamberlain was not the policy
of the Government, and Balfour had
clearly defined the Government's pol- o
icy. He (the speaker) did not conceal*
his sympathy with Chamberlain's aspii
ration to draw the empire more closely
together and to put the affairs of the
nation on a more business-like footing.
If the reward of the success of such a
policy was great, the punishment, of
failure was irreparable and the Gov
ernment was only prudent in declining
to be rushed into, such proposals. â¢ In
conclusion, Lord, Lansdowne said the
position of the Government was per.
â fectly defensible and' logical.
. The text of the amendment to the
address in the reply to the speech from
the throne, referred to by Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman in the House of
Commons, and which will be moved by
'Morley in behalf of the opposition, is
as follows:
"It is our duty, however humbly, to
present to your Majesty that our ef
fective deliberation on financial ser
vices is impaired by conflicting declara
tions from your Majesty's Ministers.
"We respectfully submit the . judg
ment of this House that the removal
of protective duties has, for more than
half a, century, actively conduced to the
vast "extension <jf thÂ£ trade and com
merce of the realm^and the welfare of
the population, and this House believes
that whileÂ°the needs for social improve
ment are still manifold and urgent any
return to protective duties, and 3 more
particularly when imposed upon the
food of the people, would be ueeply
injurious to the national strength, con
tentment and wellbeing."

The meetir.s was called to order by
W. W. Allen, who stated that its object
M-as to recommend the opening of
either H. I or J streets. I. D. Blux
ome, the first speaker, favored the
opening of J street, contending that
It. would pierce both the Sunset and
Oceanside districts end ffive the rail
road an. opportunity at some future
time to parallel the H-street line.
Robert Fitzgerald, a member of
the Oceansi'le conting-ent. argued in
f;ivor cf. the opening of H street, say
ing that it would be easier to open H
street than either I or J. as less bur
den would- fall upon the property
hoKer*; owing To the fact that the city
must- tjike care of the third abutting
on the : park, the railroad company of
the center- .and only a pro rata por
tion .of' the remaining third would fall
upon the taxpayers.

LOTS OF PIANOS!
A Sale oi the Maavais Line
of Pianos Is N T ow Being
Conducted in the Ware=
rooms of the Wiley B.
Allen Co.
We boagbt the Mauvais Company's
etock cf fine, high-grade pianos at a
remarkably low figure. The Mauvais
Company determined to retire from
the piario business. They put before
tis p.n Inventory of their stock -with the'
proposition to sell. We made a spot
cash off tr and were surprised when
after a few moments' silence Mr.
Mauvais said: "Well. Mr. Allen, I shall
lose considerable money, but I ac-
cept your offer. The pianos are yours
Ctnd I am out of the business/'
â¢ - â¢ â¢
This tells, the whole istory. The
pianos, came to us at a price per-
haps unprecedented in the history of
the piano trade in this country; so low
that we figure 6:1 retailing them lower
than the cost of material and labor
required to build them at the factory
and still make a decent, small profit.
The. advertisement of having bought
out so large and fine a Btock of pianos
and the good will of a fair and friend-
ly competitor is of considerable Im-
portance and satisfaction to us, and
this, added to our pleasure in selling
them to our friends and patrons at a]
price hardly covering the cost of ma-
terial and labor in them, makes us
fully satisfied.

Just one word more In particular j
about the class and quality of thÂ« ;
Mauvais Company's stock of pianos
now offered for Eale'by us. The Mau-
raiii concern never bought nor kept in
stock any shoddy, low-grade instru-
ments â no "decoys."
The Wlasner Piano carried by the
Mamais Company has scarcely a su-
perior in the country'.
The Behr Bros., that has been car-
ried by this houpe, is an exceeding-

CHARMING FUNCTION
AT BOHEMIAN CLUB
The dinner given at the Bohemian
Club last night by Edward M. Green
way in honor of Miss Mabel ClufE and
her fiance, J. C. .Wilson, was a typical
Greer.way function, perfect as to details
and with a plenitude of jollity. The
guests, fifty in number, including the
members of the bridal party, dined in
the cheery Red room, the scene of so
many brilliant affairs this winter.
Miss Cluff, the fair fiancee, in a gown
of Nile green chiffon, with billows of
chiffon ruffles and dainty pink forget
me-nots on the low corsage and a cor
onet of the same blossoms in her hair,
made a radiant picture. Though feted
incessantly at luncheons, dinners and
teas since the announcement of her
betrothal, she holds her own admirably.
To-night, however, will bring to an
end the pre-nuptial festivities, when
Jack Wilson will himself be host at a
large dinner at the Bohemian Club.
Last night one of the most popular
functions of the season was held at
Pioneer Hall, when the Woman's Aux
iliary of the Society of California Pio
neers gave Us annual assembly.
The affair was planned to celebrate
the momentous day In Old Mexico,
when the treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo,
by the terms cf which California be
came American territory, signed
by the commissioners of the United
States and those of the vanquished
country. This date, from which Cali
fornia began her phenomenal growth
as an integral part of the United States,
has been commemorated for three years
past in the delightful fashion of last
night.
Flags, ferns and flowers made glad
the Hall of Memories â aa is indeed-the
Pioneer Hall, which was thronged
with the sturdy argonauts of old, to
whom the birth of California is an in
cident of easy memory. Likewise
were the women there â they who
braved the treachery of the plains to
reach the land of promise, arrayed In
gowns that did not obtain In the day
of their migration â brave women who
have made history. And charming
hostesses they were at this function
last night, graciously assisted by their
men folk and their children.

CALIFORNIA FRUITS IX . . â 
BIG DEMAND IN LONDON
Stand In No Danger c( Competition
From the Other Producing
Countries. - '. .
Michael J. Garcia, head of a London
firm which for years has been engaged
in importing California fruits into Eng
land, is 5taying at the Palace Hotel,
having just returned from Tasmania,
whither he was sent by the British
commercial bodies to investigate the
fruit raising industry there, with a view
to determining whether the products
of that section of the globe can be
handled in Great Britain. .. â'
"Thirty-four years ago," said Mr.
Garcia last evening, "about 150 boxes of
California pears were. shipped over to
London to us as an experiment and
the English people have Ptnce been
consuming your fruits to the exclusion
of those of almost every other country.
The importation of California pears,
plums, peaches and apples, and es
pecially the latter fruit, has grown tc
be an important item in trade and Is
steadily increasing. They are the most
popular fruits with the London people
and there is no fear of competition from
other sources, for they arrive and are
consumed before the fruits from other
countries reach the market. Th<? bulk
of your fruit reaches the British me
tropolis In August. September, October
and November and meets a ready de
mand. The American apple Is known
as the best apple in our market, for it
comes to us in excellent shape *ts a
result of proper methods" of packing.
Not a few California oranges also find
their way into London and are well
liked for their size and flavor, although
the Spanish orange, â . a. rather diminu
tive article, is sold in larger quantities.
"The Tasmania apple is destined to
find a good market in -London, a fact
my recent investigation has developed,
but it will not enter into competition
with your product, for the reason that
the whole shipment for the. three
months* season will not exceed 500.COO
bushels, which is not equal to two
weeks' shipments from this country.
And again, the seasons differ. In fact
I see nothing that will displace your
apples as a popular product in Great
Britain so long as the present quality
of the shipments is maintained."
Forbearance is one evidence of for
giveness.

CARRIE SWAIN
AND HER SUITS
They Keep Attorney Joseph
Redding Away From the Seve
ral Delights of Bohemian Club
BATTLING FOR MILLIONS
Once-Famous Actress Seeks Di
vision of Fortune Owned
bv Millionaire Frank Gardner
One reason, and probably the princi
pal one, for Attorney Joseph Redding's
protracted stay abroad was Incidental
ly disclosed yesterday through a pri
vate communication received from New
York by a San Francisco promoter of
amusement enterprises. It is his con
scientious devotion to the legal inter
ests of a lady client that deprives Mr.
Redding of Bohemian Club delights
and creates a vacuum in the social en
semble of that organization. He is
flittlngr*between London and Paris at-~
tending to Miss Carrie Swain's suits to
have the divorce of Frank Gardner
from Annie Graham Gardner set aside
and to secure a division of the Gard
ner fortune, which is said to amount
to. about $25,000,00*.
This bit of intelligence will awaken
the Interest of many Californlans out
side of the coterie that is Interested in
the comings and goings of Attorney
Redding. It will recall memories of
the Bella Union Theater thirty odd
years ago, when the singing 5 and danc
ing of Carrie Swain was an attractive
feature of the bill. It, will also recall
some of the events of Miss Swain's
subsequent meteoric career.
HER EARLY SUCCESSES.
- On the Bella Union stage Miss Swain
appeared in a "double turn" with Sam
Swain, and she claimed distinction as
the first woman to do "knockabout"
work. While she was doing "flipflaps"
and "splits" for the edification of large
and demonstrative .audiences, there
came to the city one Frank Gardner,
a handsome ' actor, and at the same
time there was appearing at the Cali
fprnia Thea^r, as fading lady â  of
John McCullough's company, one An
nie Graham, a beautiful woman and an
excellent actress." Mr. Gardner and
Miss Graham became such very good
, friends that the Rial to busy bodies be
gan probing for incumbrances that
might prevent their marriage, and sure
enough they succeeded In bringing to
light a Mrs. Frank Gardner, who had
been Miss Clementina Derringer of
Philadelphia until sherwedded the actor
in 1873. In 1875 he obtained a divorte,
and thpn, one version of the story goes,
he married Miss Graham In this city.
It is another version upon which Miss
Swain now bases her suit.
It wasjn 1879 that the Swains, Sam
a,nd Cirrie, joined the rush to Lead-
Ville, Colo., and they made friends and
money in that "greatest mlnlnsr camp
"in history:*' -And it was while'' there,
say the latterday gossips on the Rialto,
that Carrie decided to pursue her pro
fessional career unhampered by Sam.
She went to Chicago and *was next
heard *f as the star of "Cad the Tom
boy," managed by Frank Gardner.
Annie Graham's thereabouts at this
period is not recorded, but she was not.
a member of the conjpany. The play'
was put. on tour and met with good
success. In the year 188? the marriage
of Miss Swain and Mr. Gardner was
announced In the theatrical papers.
THEY FOUND FORTUNE. s '
When thp attractiveness of "Cad the
Tomboy" began telwane in this coun
try Mr. Gardner and Miss Swain took
it to Australia and in that country
they waxed wealthy. By fortunate in
vestments cin;; mining;. storks they #c->
cumulated millions, and Miss Swafn
now asserts it wasy always understood
between them that they were partners
in all those mcyiey-making enterprises.
When .they became multi-million
aires they shelved "Cad the Tomboy"
and went .to Europe', where they cut a
swath of splendor and extravagance
that made some of the native spend
thrifts green with envy.^In Paris th^y
purchased a beautiful home near tne
B,ols de Boulogne,, where they enter
tairied lavishly. In suburban London
they bought aribther estate and started
a racing stable, which for a time was
managed by Tod^ 1 Sloan. About ten
years ago came an estrangement be
tween the pair.' Gardner returned to
this country, and suit for divorce was
filed against him by ! Annie Graham
Gardner. | No defense was Interposed
and a decree was granted. It is this
divorce that Miss Swain* during a re
cent visit 'to this city, retained Mr.
Redding to have set aside.
â what she Claims.
Miss Swain asserts that in her suit
Annie Graham testified she had mar
ried Gardner in 1873, whereas Gardner
was not from Clementine
Derringer until two years later. Miss
Swain alleges also* that Gardner ex
pended a large sum of money in order
to facilitate the divorce suit of Annie
Graham and that Annie Graham sud
denly, exhibited great prosperity after
the decree was issued to her. By
proving these allegations Attorney
Redding hopes to establish the validity
of his client's claims. To enhance the
complications Gardner insists that he
is divorced from Miss Swain and re
port has it that he Is now married
to a French woman. Miss Swain's
suits for a division of the Gardner for
tune are. pending in Paris and London.
Another interesting feature of the
romance of three continents is the an
nouncement that Miss Swain intends
to return to America and the stage
and that a New York theatrical agency
is now "booking time"' for her. She
intends, it is claimed, to return from
Paris to New York some time v next
month and place herself at the head of
the most 'pretentious burlesque organi
zation that- ever started on tour in the
United States. Color is given to this
story by the fact that her brother, W.
J. Wisler of 1833 Oak. street," recently
received a letter from her, in which
she stated she would soon return to
California. :
It is' not pressure of poverty that
impels Miss Swain to seek a share of
Mr. Gardner's millions or to resume
acting. When in this' city several
months ago she proved possession of
much wealth. '

Erroneously Thinis . by Scouriasr Her
.; Scalp That She Cares Dandruff.
Cleanly woman has an erroneous idea
that by scouring the scalp, which re-
moves the dandruff scales, she is curing:
the .dandruff. She may wash her scalp
every day, and yet have dandruff her Ufa
long, accompanied by falling hair, too.
The only way in the world to cure dan-
druff is to kill the dandruff germ, and
there is no- hair preparation that will do
that but Newbro's Herpicide. Herplcide.
by -killing the dandruff germ, leaves the
hair free to grow as healthy Nature in-
tended. Destroy the cause, you remove,
the effect. Kill the dandruff germ with
Herplcide. Sold by leading druggists.

TAKES ITALIAN
FOR A RUSSIAN
Japanese Restaurant Keeper
Throws Frank Soares Out of
Wijidow Through a Mistake
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb." 2.
Complications of an international
character almost arose yesterday even
ing all because Frank Namamoto, Jap
anese proprietor of a restaurant on
Broadway, between Sixth and Seventh
streets, mistook John Soares, an unof
fending Italian, for a Hussian. A slight
difference of opinion between the two
was 'sufficient to cause the patriotic
Japanese to jeject. the supposed Rus
sian. The first blow delivered by the
little brown,,, man was the rigpal for
a dozen other subjects of the Mikado to
spring up by magic.
Vainly did the swarthy son of Italy
try to explain himself in the silvery
tongue of his native land. Everything
he said was interpreted as ending in
"sky" or "vitch" and this wai suffi
cient fi>r renewed assaults. Despite
uis efforts to maintain 'an equ.lfbrium
and his dignity as a Romar. descend
ant, Soares was â¢ unceremoniously
thrown through a window, taking sash
and all with him.
Th3 crashing of glass attracted V: j
attention of Patrolman Hammertcn,
who arrived on the scene in the role of
"Uncle Sam" and offered his good of
fices in preserving *the peace. Being
unable to speak Jpther Italian or Jap-,
aaese, Hammerton . was compelled to
give up his attempt at diplrmacy and
t rrest both t**.e proprietor of the place
and the supposed Russian.
This .morning in the Police Court
neither of the belligerents was able* to
make Judge Smith, sitting both as me
diator and Judge, understand them and
he set the case over until February 4,
at which time two interpreters will be
on hand to assist the court in settling
the dispute.

Rev. E. E. Baker and Other
Prominent Residents Are Vic
tims of the Cowardly Crimes

pet was the Rev. E. E. Baker of the
First Presbyterian Church. The dog
was found on the lawn in front of the
Coghill residence, on Jackson street; in
convulsions. The animal showed un
mistakable sfgns of strychnine poison
ing. The dog was shot.
The next family pet to eat of pois
oned food was a Cocker spaniel belong
ing to Miss Bessie Coghill. The ani
mal's life was saved by prompt action.
A valuable dog belonging to Mrs.
Thomas Mein was next poisoned and
died. Mrs. E. Duncan also lost a dog.
Yesterday a dachshund belonging to
Mrs. Mein was poisoned and died.
The law makes it a felony to poison
dogs. The residents of the Lakeside
district are uniting to discover the guilty
party if possible. . â

est pupils in his class.

education. When his course at that.in
stitution was completed Father Kirby
returned to his native town, where he
was ordained a* priest oh March ' 17,

BRUTAL MURDERER HELD
WITHOUT CHANCE OF BAIL
George Benes, Who Killed Wife Because She Re

Judge Hebbard Is Reversed by Divorced Man
George Benes, a German, who out-
Soeders Soeder from an appearance
standpoint, -was held without bail for
trial in the Superior Court by Judge
Conlan yesterday on the charge of
murder. - On Deceniber 22 he shot his
wife in the bSck with a revolver arid
then attempted to end his worthless
life with the same weapon. The
woman died in the Harbor Receiving
Hospital two hours after the shooting,
but the man survived.
Shifty, weazened and' cunning as a
coyote in face of a trap, the defendant
listened to the murdered woman's
sister as she told the story of the
crime. Benes' wife had deserted him
In Los Angelas because s"he could no
longer bear the .burden" of turning
over her slender, wages to him in order
that he might satisfy his "appetite for
drink. By fair pr foul means he gain

MINT DIRECTOR
NOT IN ERROR
Superintendent Leach Says' No
Ground Exists for Any
Criticism on Recent Report
TELEGRAPHER AT FAULT
Statements That Estimates of
Gold and Silver Production
Are Incorrect Are Refuted
The annual report of the Director of
the United States Mint as to the esti
mated production of gold and sliver of
the country for the calendar year 1903
has given rise to some comment in cer
tain quarters owing to an error that
appeared In the figures.
The error is due to the telegraphic
reports sent out and, in speaking of
the matter last evening, Superintendent
Frank A. Leach of the San Francisco
Mint' said:
A few days ago I noticed in The Call an ar
ticle-in reference to a criticism that had ap
peared in other publications, relating- to the ac
curacy of the preliminary estliAate of - the
Director of the Mint of the gold and silver
production of the United States for the calen
dar year 1803. The accuracy of Director Rob
erta' figure* was questioned by reason of the
apparent mistake In the production of gold
accredited to South Dakota, which was given
in the table of figures as being about one
third of what was anticipated and what it
feally was. Because of this error thÂ» accuracy
of all the other return! was questioned, and
as further evidence that the .figures were un
reliable, the critic called attention to the fact
that the units were given In precise amounts.
In justice to Director Roberts I wish* to call
attention to the original estimate, wherein
Bouth Dakota was credited with $6,869,302
value of gold, whereas the amount given in.
the table sent out by the Associated Press was
$1,000,000 less.. The Associated Press, I air
Informed, sent out a correction of ita error a
few days later, but I have no recollection of
seeing the correction mentioned in any publica
tion on the Pacific Coast. If the critic had
taken the trouble to foot up the column as
published the discrepancy of $4,000,000 would.,
have been apparent.
It has been the custom of the Director of
the Mint for several years to publish for the
benefit of the public a preliminary estimate
Rt thÂ«Â» cloÂ«e of the calendar year, of the pro
duction of gold and silver j in the United
States, and such figures have alwavs been
Kiven out as/a preliminary estimate. The re
port of the production of precious metals in
the United States Is not published or the cor
rect figures given to the public until some
months afterward, but experience has shown
that when the official statement is made pub
lic the figures very closely agree with those
obtained in making up the preliminary esti
mate.
Superintendent Leach also explained
the system used in the mints by which
data is furnished the director for use
in making up his annual report. 1^
said the entire asold product of the
country finds its .way into the mints
and assay offices .of the United States
and its source is carefully noted.
"The reports of the mints vary but
little Trom the pMsliminary estimate of
Director Roberts," said Superintendent
Leach, "and the fact that the final re
port agrees bo closely with the prelim
inary estimate makes it certain that
the reports of the Director of the Mint
are as accurate as it Is possible to
make thÂ«n."
ALASKA COMPANY MUST
PAY FOR A MAN'S LIFE
United States Court of De
crees That Baldwin's Heirs Shall
Receive $5000.
The United States Circuit Court of
Appeals decided yesterday that the es

from the Alaska Commercial Company
$5000 and costs for damages for the loss
of Baldwin's life. Baldwin v/as one of
five men who were drowned near Yu
kutat Bay, Alaska, when the schooner
Dora B was wrecked.
During tht- trial the fact was devel
oped that the defendant contracted to
tow the Dora B from St. Michael to
Lituaia Bay with the defendant's
steamer Bertha, and that when the
tow line parted the defendant aban
doned the schooner to her fate. The
hu*.l of the Dora was found on the
beach several days later, the five mem
bers of her crew that remained on
board having been drowned. ,
It Is expected that the heirs of the
four remaining members of the crew
will Institute suits for damages agaist
the company, they having been await
ing the outcome of this case.

STATE LIBRARIES MEET
WITH UNUSUAL SUCCESS
California Association Does Much to Promote In
terest of Plan for Free Education â Membership
Is Rapidly Increasing and Outlook Is Bright
The Library Association of California
is the only body in this State organized
for the special purpose of fostering
general interest in public libraries and
of promoting their welfare. Its mem
bership is composed of librarians,
library trustees and others who are en
gaged In allied educational work. This
association is now endeavoring to en
large its membership and its useful
ness.
From time to time It will publish bul
letins of professional value and also
some of the papers .read at the associa
tion meetings, and through its advisory
committee will furnish suggestions and
advice to new libraries and others
needing assistance. Joy Lichtenstein,
assistant librarian of the San Francis
co Public. Library, is the president of
the association and Margaret A.
Schmidt, librarian of the North Beach
Branch Library, is its secretary. Such
helpfulness in .the organization and
management of the small libraries of
the State Is greatly needed.
A score of similar organizations In
different States of the Union are doing
excellent work tn raising the Ideals of
the public library system. Mill Valley
has ..lust finished a neiv room In the
schoolhouse for a school library and
reading-room. The library wÂ«l be well
supplied with v reference works. The
question arises, "Why should not Mill
Valley organize and maintain a free
public library under the provisions of
the general library law of the State?
Mill Valley has an assessed valuation
of three-quarters of a million dollars,
is not burdened with oppressive debt
and is rapidly growing.
Nearly every public library In the
State has grown from humble begin
nings. In San Juan, San Benlto Coun
ty, a little HbraryQstarte^F in 1896 has
gradually acquired 2000 volumes. Its
history is like that of other libraries,
of progress made under discourage
ment and many difficulties. The so
ciety which supports the library and
reading room is hopeful of better days
for the institution.
The City(_Trustees of San Mateo have
recently decided to turn over the. large
hall belonging to the city to the board
of library trustees for library purposes,
the present library qjuarters being
cramped and generally undesirable. It
will, however, be necessary to raise
$2000 by popular subscription for the
library equipment for the hall.
San Luis Oblspo has -secured a site
for its new Carnegie library building,
the lot fronting 74 feet On Monterey
f^reet and 114 feet on Broad street, and
fcfie library board now invites competi
tive plans for the building. The design
calls for a one-story, building with
basement. The main floor Is to have a
general reading, room, librarian's room
to be used also by the trustees and a
stack room which will accommodate
12,000 volumes. In the basement are to
be a janitor's room, rooms for storage,
fuel and bicycles, besides a dumb
waiter to the main floor. The total
cost must not exceed 59000, the gift be
ing $10,000.
Andrew Carnegie has not been able
till of late to bestow any gifts for
library buildings upon the cities of
Oregon. The State of Oregon had
no general library law permitting suf
ficient taxation for public library pur
poses until a, few months ago, and
therefore not a city in the State could
meet Mr. Carnegie's requirements for
the annual maintenance of a library.
The new legislation permits every city,
unless hampered by charter restric
tions, to appropriate any amount for
library support which the city au
thorities desire. Eugene, the seat of
the State. University, Is one of the first
places in Oregon to receive an offer
from Mr. Carnegie of a gift of $10,000.
The proposition is now before the City
Council.
The second report of Portland, Or.,
free library was made January 20. . It
shows a marked growth in the useful
ness of the library. The total circula
tion of books for the year was 145,000.
Owing to the limitation in the new
charter of Portland allowing but one
flfth of a mill on the dollar tax on city
property for library uses it lias been
necessary for the library to avail Itself
of the new law allowing a county tax
for library support. "Under this pro-
vision a number of traveling libraries
have been sent to places in the county
outside of Portland city limits. Books
have been* loaned from the library
to various educational institutions
throughout the State. The reference
department of the library has been so
much crowded that additional space IS
required immediately. â¢ *-_
No department has been. more suc
cessful than the children's, where there
seems to be unbounded prospect of in
fluence among the 12,000 school children
of Portland. The story-telling .hoar
conducted by Miss Hassler, one, of the
children's librarians, proves to be one
of the greatest attractions of the week.
The chief librarian. Miss Mary F.
Isom, lays special stress upon the need
of a State organization to carry on hi
Oregon the. general work performed in,
many* States by library commissions,
such as establishing new libraries, en
couraging others already started and
furnishing information that is con
stantly needed by all but the largest
libraries. . . 0
Montana, that State of magnificent
distances, is having continued reason
to bo glad. of the freedom with whlcti
Mr. Carnegie disburses his mo.ney.
Bozeman, a flourishing town ea'st o$
Helena, has Just opened its new Car
negie library. A good public
had been maintained in Bozeman for a'
number of years, but the rooms were*
small and inconvenient and the rental,
paid cut into the income seriously.
Every addition to the number of such
library homes Is a standing impulse to
the cause of popular education. ; .
In earlier, days the average circulat
ing library possessed only a plain
room where books were stored, loaned
and returned. Nothing more was- done
for the public. The, library -equipment
of to-day is based upon the idea of at
tractiveness. Open access to the.
shelves, abundant * light, # tables arrd
chairs for readers, refere'nee rooms for'
study and research, children's rooms
where the little folks may have their
own magazines and books with special
attendants and large general reading'
rooms, decorated with engravings;
paintings and statuaryâ all these feat
ures speak of 'the higher ideals gained
in what is sometrmes termed the peo-.
pie's university. And now comes the"
endowed, library. "Wealth, supplemented
by taste and breadth of purpose, pro
vides means by which the physical, so
cial, musical and literary wants of a
community 0 may be ministered to
through one organization. An illustra-'
tion of this type may be seen in -.the
Carnegie free library at Braddock. Pa.
The city of Braddock has a; population
of 16,000," made up of workers in the,
great steel concerns of that region.
The library in that city Is the first one
ever built by Mr. Carnegie and has
been liberally endowed by him. This
endowment is sufficient to maintain a
library of 27,000 volumes, with all de
sirable appointments of reference and
Juvenile rooms, absolutely free to every
one, as not a dollar is received from
taxation.
Under the same roof and the same
management and supported in like
manner is the Carnegie Club, composed
of different classes of boys, men and
women. It is thought .best to require
from them the payment of a small fee,
varying from 50 cents to 52 per quarter
for the privileges of the club, though
but $1 per quarter is paid by the men
of the steel works.
These payments allow the unlimited
use, within reasonable limits, of a gym
nasium, swimming 1 pool and baths,
bowling alleys, billiards, clubroom sup
plied with games, magazines and
books, and also provide for tennis
courts and ball teams.
In the auditorium, with its 1200 opera
chairs and fine concert organ, courses
of lectures and concerts are given from
October to April, on which no expense
is spared. Season tickets to these en
tertainments cost but a dollar. A fine
band of fifty pieces gives frequent con
certs. Free organ recitals are given
twice a month by an accomplished or
ganist. A choral society is conducted
by the qrganlst without charge. It Is
intended to organize a children's chor
us. A dramatic club gives several plays
each season. Greater use and increas
ing satisfaction mark each year of the
life of the institution.

, GIVE YOUR STOMACH
V* ;,- A MCE VACATION*
Don't Da: It by Starving; It Either.
Â° Let a Substitute Do the Work.
â The old adage, "All work and no
play makes Jack a dull boy," applies
just as well to the stomach, one of the
most Important organs of the human
system, as it does to the man himself.
If your stomach Is worn out and
rebels against being further taxed be-
yond Its limit, the only sensible thing
you can' do is to give it a rest. Em-
ploy a substitute for a short time and
see if it will not more than repay you
in= results.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a
willing and most efficient substitute.
They themselves digest every bit of
; food in the stomach in just the same
! way that the stomach itself would
were it well. ' They contain all the es-
sential elements' that the gastric Juice
and' other digestive fluids of the
( stomach, contain and actually act Just
the same and do Just the same work as
the natural fluids would do, were the
stomach well and sound. They there-
fore relieve the stomach, Just as on*
workman relieves another, and permit
It to rest and recuperate and regain its
normal health and strength.
This "vacation" idea was suggested
by the letter et a prominent lawyer in
: Chicago." Read what he says: "I was
! engaged in the most momentous un-
dertaking of my life In bringing about
the coalition of certain great Interests
that meant much to me as well as my
clients. It was not the work of days,
but of months; I was working night
and day almost, ,when at a very critical
time my stomach went 1 clear back on
me. The undue mental strain brought
It about and' hurried up what would
have happened later on.
. "What I ate. I had to literally forca
down and that was a source of misery,
as -I' had a sour stomach much of the
time. My head ached, I was sluggish
and began to lose my ambition to
carry out my undertaking:, p It looked
! pretty gloomy for me and I confided
my plight to one of my clients. He.
had been cured by Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and at once went down to a
drug store and brought a box up to
j the office. â¢ ' * â >'
"I had. not taken* a quarter of that
box before I found that they would do
all- the- work m^ stomach ever did;
and' as a rest or. vacation was out of
the question for .me, I determined to
givfe my stomach* a vacation. I kept
right on taking the tabletT and braced
uiÂ» and wen't ahead with my work with
renewed vigor, 1 ate Just as much as I
ever, did and carried out that under-
taking to a successful issue. I feel
that I have Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
to .thank for saving me the handsomest
fee- 1 ever received, as well as my repu-
tation, and, last' but not least, my
stomach."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by all druggists at 50 cents a box.

know absolutely nothing about, ana in
the second place it sharpens his wits
wonderfully to be obliged to keep in
touch musically with two or perhaps
three persons at the same moment.
The term "ensemble"- means," as the
pupil probably knows, "together," and
literally duets come under this head,
but the generally accepted meaning <?f
"ensemble" playing refers ' to trios,
quartets and quintets, and this is the
kind of music to which I shall devote
our lesson to-day.
Some, of the most beautiful music
ever composed was? written in trio, and
much Orchestral music has been 'rear
ranged for the purpose of being played
in this way. so there is realTy no end
to the beautiful things one may find in
tVi^s' If inA nf rpsp.i'ph. - * â¢

Let the midem gather about him a
little circle of congenial musical friends,
and if possible let there be among
the number at least one who plays the
violin and one who plays the
violin-cello. If he can number among
his friends some one who plays the
double bass and some one who plays
tbÂ« organ, he is lucky indeed, and the
prospect of great musical enjoyment
opens wide before him.
In order to acquire the best results,
regularity is as necessary in this sort
of playing as in any other. Therefore,
let him organize a little club, of which
i he avowed Â¦ purpose is music reading
Â«nd study. - Let the members meet
once a week regularly, and if they are
moved to "study ui>" their parts by
themselves during the week, so much
the better for every one.

made up of a violin, second violin, viola
and viollncello. The first violin repre
sents the soprano, second violin the
a; to, viola the tenor and violincello the
bass voice. This is the true and per
fect form of ensemble music. It is
cftcn difficult though to set together
people who play, even a little, on these
instruments, Â¦ among one's personal
friends, and a trio, composed of piano,
viclin and organ will be found an ideal
combination.
An ordinary little reed organ (al
though its tone may not be particu^
lurly good, when heard alone) will,
if in tune, be found to harmonise., ex
cellently with a piano and violin and
the Jack of richness in the tone of the
orgran will not be noticed when the In
struments are all played in unison.
The organ is, in fact, a very great ad
dition, as it lends body and substance
to the whole and takes the place of
a cello, or "double bass." It is 'most
necessary, however, that piano and
organ be pitched on the same key,;
for quite often there is a variation of
a whole tone between the two instru
ments, and if two people attempt to
pl3y together under such circum
stances the result ls most disastrous.
The organ and piano should stand
as near each other as possible, in the
room where the musicales are to be
held, and as soon as they are in place
some one should strike "middle C"
on the piano, while at the same time
come â  one else tried "middle C" on
the organ. If they are not in perfect
accord a piano tuner must be sent
for at once and the organ tuned up,
or down, as the case may be, to suit
the demands of the piano. A little
reed organ is easily moved and one
can be hired without any trouble â
can even be rented for the whole win
ter at a very email cost.
â¢ In case there is no one in the com
pany competent to play the organ our
pupil can resign his place at the piano
(letting some one else take the piano)
and without any trouble play the sim
ple organ parts as they come in the
triop, if he Ls careful to study out the
marks that indicate the "stops" he is
to use. His training in legato playing
will stand him In good stead here, and
if he remembers not to "overlap" his
tones and yet at the same time to hold
one note down until the moment that
he strikes the next note, he will have
no trouble, I am sure. It will be nec
essary for him, h'owever, if he is not
familiar with the organ to notice the
marks of the "stops" (registration
marks, they are called), as they ap
pear on the part of the music intend
ed for the organ and to give some litâ
tie time in studying them all out by
himself, for when he is playing' in the
trio he must not hinder matters by
waiting to figure " out which "stop"
coraeg next.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Of course, the pupil understands
that I do not mean by what I have
said above that he would be qualified
to play the pipe organ or, in fact, any
organ, to any great extent, and cer
tainly not in solo form, without some
personal instruction in regard to reg
istration and/?o forth, but my meaning
is this: An 'Ordinarily intelligent per
son, adult or child, will, after having
studied the course I have given in
these lessons, be able to apply his
knowledge to the reed organ In such
a way that with very little work on
his own part,- or with some one to
spend a single half hour with him, to
explain a little about the most import
ant things connected with the mech
anism of the organ, he will be able
to play this instrument, very accepta
bly (both to himself and his hearers)
in conjunction with the other instru
ments comprising the trio. :
I have brought in the matter of the
organ rJght" here because it is such
a very great addition in the playing of
ensemble music. The student can
have no idea of the beauty in the
combination of the three instruments
â violin, piano and organ â until he

has heard them together, and the de
light of being a part of that, trio is'
gomething which, when one has ex
perienced it, is not likely to be for
gotten.
To return to the music cfub as a
whole. Let the members always choose
good music. Not difficult music, at first
â the easier the better, until -the per
formers become accustomed to playing
together; but let the music be always
something that is worth while, and let
It be chosen from the different masters,
so that the players may become famil
iar with all styles. Haydn is the great
est model for the string quartet (the
piano or organ can always play the
fourth part in the quartet, if preferred).
Mozart, Beethoven, Spohr, Mendels
si.-hn, Schumann and Schubert have
all written exauisite quartets, quintets
and trios, and there are other more
modern writers.^too numerous to-men
tion.
' Let the choosing of the music fail
to the member of the club who is,
musically, the most well read, and let
him* always seek to find the music that
is most elevating and inspiring, for the
broadening process must go on in this,
as in all other forms of musical educa
tion.
Each member of the trio (or quartet,
as the case may be) must be as con
scientious in his part of the perform
ance as if he were playing a solo. He
must try to grasp the idea of the com
poser, must heed all the marks of
phrasing, and must do his 'part toward
welding together a perfect whole from
the three separate parts. Unless each
member does this conscientiously and
refrains from trying to make a solo of
his own particular part, the trio will
be the expression of three separate and
antagonistic minds, instead of the rep
resentation of one mind, as it should be.
In "ensemble" playing every one must
count! Not aloud, of course, but each
to himself must keep strict time, and,
in trying a piece of music for the first
time it will^do no harm for one member
of the Irio to count aloud, until , all
three fairly get the swing of the music.

CALIFORNIA'S ATTITUDE.
THE political prophets, seers and revelators are
busy juggling with a vote not yet cast, in order to
figure out and figure in a national administration.
We have seen some of these prophecies that put Cali
fornia in .the doubtful column and some that set it
against President Roosevelt, 'It is even said thafsome
Republicans here have volunteered the .statement that
this State is against the President, and will be so mani
fested when it sends its national delegation.
For the satisfaction of outsiders, and for the informa
tion of some in the State, it is well to explain why Cal
ifornia is for President Roosevelt and will give him the
biggest majority in its history. Irf the first place, leav
ing out all questions of public policy, the President is
personally popular here. His vigorous sympathy with
all tilings human, and his keen appreciation of California
as a peculiar and exceptional region* where- beauty and
utility combine as nowhere else, have seated him in the
affection and good will of our people. Then there are
thousands here who like him for the enemies he has
made, to reapply General Bragg's famous epigram.
But above all merely personal reasons, California
supports the President because we need him'uf our busi
ness. After a long period of inattention, delay or in
difference.'such of our material needs as may be met by
the distant administration of Federal affairs are getting
retention, and we are prospering. No sensible man can
name a single particular in which California can be bene
fited by a change of Presidents, but any observant man
can see many ways in which such change now would
work our injury.
After a fight that has been so long that those who be
gan it are dead, we are brought near the realization of
California's dream of an isthmian canal. It is within pur
grasp. President Roosevelt has brought it there. His
prompt and vigorous action has cut through all the knots
tied in the proposition by the railroads and by the cu
pidity and villainy of Colombia. His determination to
have the canal is one cause of the virulent opposition to
him of the combinations of capital which have interests
in rival transportation. He has so far triumphed over
his personal and his political enemies, and has gone, with
purpose and energy both magnificent, straight toward
accomplishing his purpose. For this he is accused of be
ing a Hotspur, of having too great speed, of giving too
little consideration to obstacles. . :. V
Does any one believe that we will get a canal if he is
displaced and his accusers get into power? We have seen
in the hundred and fifty years that the world has been
discussing the canal how easily it is obstructed, and how
unforeseen the obstacles imposed by those who oppose it.
It must be built by a President who acts quickly in emer
gencies, and sets a face of flint against impediments. The
canal cannot be dug with a boiled carrot, nor the ob
stacles removed with a lace fan.
The situation for California is serious, and the State
appreciates it. The stake is so great as to justify every
thinking man here, jregardless of his politics, in/voting
for President Roosevelt, and our convictions on the sub
ject are so definite and strong that we believe he will get
the greatest majority ever cast in California. , :
Our people don't want to stand and mark time. They
want to go forward. They want every resource of the
State put in commission. They want every avenue to the
world's markets opened to their surplus. They see the
key in the President's hand and they want it there,
where there has been shown the courage and capacity to
use it.
Properly qualified authorities of Germany have decided
lifter due deliberation that while the red necktie is not
revolutionary or reactionary it certainly is undignified
as an adornment to any learned professor who may so
far forget himself as to wear it. The judges are to be
commended for their mildness and discretion. A red
necktie when worn by anybody except a pugilist is posi
tively an incentive to crime. â¢
BRITISH ARMY REORGANIZATION.
THE Royal Commission authorized by the Govern
ment of Great Britain to make investigations into
the conduct of the War Office and submit their ad
vice upon the question of a reorganization has exceeded
even the hooes of Chamberlain and reported back a
scheme for radical change. When their plans for army
reorganization are authorized by Parliament; and the
Conservative strength is fufficient to bring such action
about, the office of commander-in-chicf of the army will
be abolished and an army council, framed upon the Ad
miralty model, will take the high place of authority. A
new office of inspector-general will be created, whose
tenure shall be five years and whose duties will be
strictly those of reporting upon actual facts concerning
the efficiency of the military service. The Secretary of
State for War is to be elevated to the same degree of au
thority as that enjoyed by the First Lord of the Admir
alty and made responsible directly to Parliament.
The promulgation of such a radical change in British
army administration by the Conservative Government
has a remarkable significance.'' The constitution! of the
army council aims at nothing else than^dccentralization
and the separation of the administrative 'and the execu
tive heads in the conduct of the War Office. That it is
intended to be a complete break from the old order of
things is patent both from the nature of the changes
recommended and from the very significant- passage from
the report which says: "New measures i demand new
men; we therefore attach special importance to the ap
pointment of military members not too closely con
nected with existing methods,, and who,; therefore, are
not likely to be embarrassed by the traditions of a sys
tem which is to be, radically- changed."
When the South African War Commission had sub
mitted its unsavory report of scandals in .the army ad
ministration of that time, Chamberlain was credited with
the announcement "that .the Government would not dis
solve until the lessons of the South African War Com
mission's report had been applied and the War Office re
organized." The report of this Royal Commission is de
signed, then/as a vindication of the existing Government
from the palpable weaknesses- of -.war â¢ administration
which were brought out bythe investigations of theWar
Commission last fall.. Furthermore, War Office reform
is at present time, excellent material for electioneering
purposes. Our embalmed' beef "scandals had nothing of
the material, for political handling that the South Afri
can war scandals possess. *"'.'* ''Â« -": >â } / '' ' â¢â¢-â¢â¢â¢ â ;
The zeal of the Government, to revolutionize the War
Office may not be taken as wholly. ingenuous; It will.be
remembered ' that the investigations of the South> Afri
can War Commission-showed that there was" a woeful
lack of co-ordination between the ..diplomatic doings . of
rhe Government and the movements of the War Office.
Sir William Butler, who had been stationed at the head
of a division in South Africa just prior to the breaking
out of hostilities, testified that his unceasing warnings to
the home government to respect the strength-of the
Boers drew only a sharp reproof, and a hint that he was
to tend to his own knitting.' When Sir j Redvers Buller
was appointed to the command in South Africa before
the opening of the war the only way that he learned of
the acute stage reached in negotiations with Kruger was
through a chance remark by Lord Salisbury.
. From all the facts of the case it appears that the
change advised by the Royal Commission cannot be con
strued into an affront to Lord Roberts, the present com
mander-in-chief. He must simply'bend to the institution
of a new order of things, which has come to supplant the
old and manifestly incompetent administration.
An edict has gone forth that foreigners are not wanted
in Macedonia', the land of buncombe and brigandage, of
the misguided missionary and the artful bandit. It- is a
matter of regret that the Macedonians did not go a step

A HORROR SERMON.
THE Iroquois Theater fire, which, under the most
awful circumstances, destroyed nearly six hundred
people, a majority of them women and children, is
taken for a text by Rev. Dr% Parkhurst of New York. If
anything could add to. the gloomy horror of the calamity,
this sermon has done it. He said: "The fire that burned
those six hundred people was God's fire. Fire is one of
the ways by which he works. God is love, but that is
not all there is- of him. He is a loving father, but not a
doting old grandfather. 'He is enough of a God to' have
some'respect for himself. We hear so much about God's
love, so 1 much I mean that is said in a one-sided way,
that we come to consider, by and by, that God is noth
ing but a mush of concession; that his fondness for peo
ple has melted out of his character all respect for'him
self. With such a light thrown upon a certain side of
God's character as is shown by disasters like the one we
have been contemplating, I am sure we arc all of us tak
ing things too easily. The people who went to that the
ater were taking things too easily. The result shows
that." . ., ". â¢
Is there any wonder that people do not go to church
if that is held to be doctrine? The falling off in church
attendance and the spirit of indifference to the pulpit
message began when the reason of man traced the prin
ciples of justice as. they exist in the creation back to the
Creator, and took out of the idea of a supreme being the
savagery which it had inherited from idolatry. It dawned
upon men that cruelty and torture which no human
father would inflict upon his children for any possible
transgression couy not be visited upon man by a wise
Creator, leavingoiit the element of affection.
It :is -not . strange that we read with horror' of the.
slaughter of their subjects by African ruler3, who wan
tonly, and for their pleasure, and to enforce respect for
rtheir power, have men and women slain in their presence,
until their campoody is a shambles. But is the attribute
W the God of the. Christians given to him by Dr. Park
hurst deserving of any more respect than that of the
African, ruler?
Supposed to have power over the human heart, why
not instruct it against theater going, if that be wrong,
and not wait until hundreds are crowded together and
then burn them, to indicate the divine self-respect? If a
human father manifested his self-respect by burning .his
children,, he would be called a monster and hanged.
Does any preacher hope to arouse and sustain an inter
est in the church by representing God 'to be a monster,
surpassing any human criminal that was ever brought to
bar?
In the eruption of Mount Pelee, thousands of devout
people were destroyed while humbly worshiping in
church, for it was a holy day. To what would Dr. Park
hurst ascribe their destruction? Was that also a willful
reminder of the divine self-respect? Or was^it for the
purpose of showing that^the Creator is not "a mush of
concession"? If r he use fire in a theater to destroy those
who think he is "a doting old grandfather," could he
not restrain the elements which kill his devotees in a
church while at worship? If not, there appears another
divine attribute, in the form of entire indifference to
those who obey him, associated, with such intense hatred
of those, who disobey that it can be satisfied only by
burning them to death.
It is pitiful that the church should destroy its useful
ness and abdicate its high mission by such preaching.
When people go to church in crowds to hear the preach
er extol the virtues of a man who tortures his children
to, death by fire, they will go in crowds to be told of a
God who does the same thing.*
The House of Representatives was visibly agitated a
few days since by the assertion that American green
backs have become nests for innumerable 'deadly germs;
because of the. indiscriminate circulation of the currency
among the inhabitants of our insular possessions. If
Congress is looking for a remedy just circulate the paper
at home, and we will warrant that' it will travel fast
enough to kill everything in or on'the fiber. We will
make thiqgs fly wherever the greenbacks are.
The officers of the Board of Trade have rendered their
annual reports, which bristle with enthusiasm for. the
commercial success of San Francisco for the past year

greater triumphs for the year now passing. And the best

great community wealth not upon the failures of others
but by our own energies and well directed activities.
The Thibetans, offending no one, threatening no onÂ»

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
Such Is Greatness.
He had been on the force but a week
and In consequence had a proper sense
of the Importance of his position. Woe
betide the unlucky <-ltlzen who dis
obeyed his sharply and pompously ut
tered "Move cm." "A record I will make
in a week" was the one thought that
possessed the bluecoat. "My worth
shall be recognized."
Upon the corner of Market and Ma
son streets he spotted a little knot of
citizens, evidently from Slskiyou Coun
ty, engaged in admiring the beauties
of the Phelan statue. "Out of this;
keep a-movlng, you haymakers," he
cried, and the knot of art admirers
moved. "Out of this."" he again cried
a few minutes later to another crowd
that had gathered to admire a display
in a haberdasher's window; "don't
block the sidewalk."
"It's great to be a cop," he solilo
quized, gayly swinging his long club.
"There is no man better than a good
one." Then with chest expanded to Its
utmost limits he strode over to where
two men were standing In earnest con
versation. "Keep a-moving. there,
you,", said the new officer, prodding
both of the men sharply in the back
with his club.
Now he is out in the fog of the West
ern Addition, patrolling long quiet
streets, with nc-ne tu disturb, him or
interrupt his cogitations on the sub
ject of greatness. One of the men he
had prodded was Pplice Commissioner
Equine Wisdom.
A well-known physician In the Mis
sion who died recently had a passionate
love for clams. Every afternoon after
finishing his calls upon his patients he
would drive to a saloon on tha way
home and partake of a dish of the
bivalves and a glass of beer, believing
that the refreshment gave him an ap
petite for his dinner. There was. a
watering trough In front of ths saloon
and his horse would slake its thirst
while its master was within getting up
an appetite.
When a young physician succeeded to
the old doctor's practice after his death
It puzzled him greatly that the horse
every afternoon between 5 and 6 o'clock
would make for the same saloon and
whippings and checkings had no' effect
In deterring it from its purpose. It
would slake its thirst at the watering
trough, wait patiently for a few min
utes and then willingly start for home.
One afternoon the saloon-keeper came
out during this" performance. '"Say,
doc." said he, "why don't you come in
and have a glass of beer and some
clams, like the old man used to do?"
The mysterious conduct of the horse
was thus suddenly explained. Its nev/
owner took the earliest opportunity of
selling it and buying one that knew
nothing of the old doctor's love for
clams and beer.
A Stitcli in Time.
"Is this where one swears to a war
rant for the arrest of an Insane per
son?" he asked the clerk of the Lunacy
Commission.
"It is," replied the clerk, pulling out
of a cabinet an official looking blank.
"Want one?"
"Yes," was the response of the visitor.
He raised his right hand and swore to
a statement that to the best of his
knowledge and belief one George Wil
liams was not possessed of his senses.
He gave the address of Williams, the
names of his relatives and other data
required by the clerk.
"What's your name?" asked the clerk
when the warrant had been completed
and was ready for the signature of the
one making the accusation.
"George Williams," responded the
"Any relation?" asked the clerk.
* "I am the man," was. the surprising
answer given to - the clerk's query.
"About every three years I get 'looney'
and have to be 'sent up* for a few
months. Which cell will I take?"
An hour later he was a raving
maniac. V V' .?? â 'â¢',

As evidence that The Call's policy of

read the following from the Niles Her

"In the effort to belittle the east side

suing two editions, one- with a subur

"All efforts of Oaklanders to stop this

Life, the Harp.
Thou instrument of many strings
For men to play on, slaves and kings,
Let me- but keep thee. life, in tune.
That fall what may. by night or noon.
Still in the heart shall sing for' me
One clear and constant melody.
Too oft the clamor and- the strife
Of living quench the notes of life: â¢
Too oft they lose their customed way,
In alien sequences to stray.
Yet. ever stealing back they fall A-t-
Into the cadence sought through all.
Then grief and gladness, love and pain
Blend all their harmonies again:
The heavens. uplift a shining arch
Spacious above the soul's brave march:
If I but keep thee. night and noon.
Ever and truly, life, in tune â
Strange instrument of many strings
For slaves to play on. and for kings.

Economy.
William Archer, in the Fortnightly
Review," tells an amusing story of the
economy practiced and necessary in
the early days of the Norwegian
Theater at Bergen. It was in 1849,
when Ibsen and Bjornson were creat
ing the national drama. A lady had
been engaged for the part of "second
old woman" when it was discovered
that her elocutionary powers were im
paired by the fact that she^ had lost
one of her front teeth. Impoverished
as she was, the management came to
the rescue, and bore tho expUise of the
necessary dentistry. When she retired,
however, after two seasons she had to
leave the tooth behind her, the
example of the dentist's art being the
property of the theater.; The : man
agement was too poor to part with It!

â¢Among In* factors, in the present

which at any moment may develop
into full-fledged war; there is one thai
has until now escaped the attention of
the public, although familiar to. the
State Department at Washington and
to every foreign diplomat who has
ever been stationed at Tokio. - It is
the former Vice Consul General of the
United States at Yokohamaâ a shrev/d
and able lawyer named Den
nison â an expert in international liw,
and who, for a number of years past
(indeed, ever since he quitted the ser
vice of the American Government),
has been the legal, adviser to 'the
Gaimusho, or' Department of Public
Affairs at Tokio. His activity is. by no
means restricted to the mere legal af
fairs of the department. a His counsel
is sought by the Japan'ese Minister of
Foreign- Affairs and' his subordinates.
as. well as by the other members of
the Cabinet, about all sorts of mai

, Government. , It speaks volumes for
his honesty, Â° f or his 'tact and for, his
shrewdness that he should have sue
ceded in wholly, winning their con
fidence, that he should have been, able
to dispel altogether that innate "dis
trust which the Oriental, invariably en
tertains for the European or Amer

cised his delicate functions, with so
much care as to avoid .exciting the
Jealousy which so highly sensitive Â«i

THE FIRST FLAGâ A. T. S. Y. S..
City. It Is generally believed that the
first American flagâ the Stars and
Stripes â was made about the middle of
1776 by Betsy Ross, wife of John Ross
of the Continental army, at 239 Arch
street, Philadelphia, but there has been
a question raised in regard to the Iden
tity of the flag made Ly Mrs. Ross. The
first flag she made for General Wash
ington was. It ls asserted, made In June
or July. 1776, while the design of the
Stars and Stripes was not adopted by
Congress until June 14. ,1777. It is be
lieved that if Mrs. Ross made a flag
for General Washington In 1776 at his
suggestion It was the grand Union
flag adopted by the Continental army
In January "of that year. It was made
up of thirteen alternate red and white
stripes and a union of the crosses of
St. George and St. Andrew. While this
was an American flag^ it was not the
flag of the United States of America,
and a demand for such a flag was not
created until after the Declaration of
Independence. There is no record of
any United States flag before the de
sign adopted by Congres In June. 1777.
but it is possible that Mrs. Ross, who
was a flagrmaker, made the first one
from a design furnished her by a com
mittee of. Congress, of which General
Washington was one. From the Imper
fect history in regard to the flag It is
impossible to state exactly when the
first flag of the United States was
made. v

SHAM BATTLE AT PRESIDIO
THRILLS MANY SPECTATORS
Troops of Ninth Cavalry Attack Field Artillery on
Point Back of Post and Give Splendid Military Ex
hibition, Showing Effects of Discipline and Drilling
The sham battle at the Presidio yes
terday morning between the Ninth
Cavalry and a battalion .of field ar
tillery, assisted by. Troop K, from a
scientific standpoint was a complete
success, but the lowering clouds and
the gloom of the, early morning made
it far from a spectacular success. Ma
jor John Bigelow, with Troops I, L
and M, charged up the steep incline
to the point, where they encountered
the field artillery, under command of
Captain I. A. Haynes, who had the ad-
ditional support of Troop K, Captain
John T. Nance. The three oncoming
cavalry troops began the attack and
opened up the engagement by firing
twelve rounds at the entrenched artil
lery. The artillery replied in lively
fashion and it seemed as if a genuine 7
engagement was on. When the firing
had ceased the , cavalry advanced in
line at full gallop, and, with drawn
sabers, charged the artillery with a
tremendous yell.
Here they ran against the support
ing cavalry and a general shock and
melee was the result. The troops
crossed sabers. The attacking cavalry
then retreated, and, after getting into
line, made another charge, during
which the troopers fired their pistols
with tremendous vigor and for a time
the proceedings were almost hidden
from view by the cloud of smoke that
rested on the contesting parties. When
the smoke had partially cleared away
it was seen that the cavalry which had
been assisting the artillery had been
worsted, as it was under retreat, fol
lowed by the attacking party under
full gallop,' firing pistols as it dashed
across the field. Then, by a flank
movement, the attacking cavalry was
attacked by half of Troop K and was
by it compelled to withdraw.
ATTEMPT A RALLY.
The three companies then attempted
a rally, but without success, and in the
general melee which resulted they
were compelled to retire from \he
scene, followed by a tremendous vol
ley from the artilleryt which shook the
hills and rattled the windows in the
immediate vicinity. This wound up
the battle.
Following the fight came a long and
exhaustive drill of the four troops.
They were first drilled by troop and
then went into the general squadron
formation. They went through all
sorts and kinds of maneuvers.
Major Bigelow expressed himself as
highly pleased with the morning's
work and said his squadron was prac
tically ready to go into campaign
work at a moment's notice. Th^e of
ficers yesterday worÂ© service uniforms,
but the enlisted men were in dress
uniform. *
Considering the Inclemency of the
weather and the long distance from
the car line the crowd of onlookers In
attendance was large. The thrilled
visitors frequently applauded the dif
ferent maneuvers and the fine horse
manship of the troopers.
The Twenty-eighth Infantry is being
drilled every morning on the lower
parade ground between the hours of
7 and 12. The drilling is by battalion.
The men go through the regulation
battle exercises, extended orders, litter
drills and all the general minor de
tails, including a complete series of
athletic exercises. In fact, they are
being placed in a position as fast as

SEARLES SENDS
A NEAT CHECK
Acceptable Contribution of
Five Thousand Dollars to
San Francisco Art Association
MONEY COMES IN HANDY
Unexpected Gift Enables the
Directors to Do Something
More for the School of Design
A gift of J5000 has been maae by Ed
ward F. Sea rles to the San Francisco
Art Association. A check for that
amount, drawn on the Mechanics' Na
tional Bank of New York and made
payable to Horace G. Platt, was re
ceived by the latter yesterday and at
once indorsed as. payable to the San
Erancisco Art Association, Willis E.
Davis president.
The cash donation of Mr. Searles was
unsolicited and unexpected, but, nev
ertheless, highly acceptable, as money
was needed to keep up the School of
Design, Mark Hopkins Institute of Art,
to its present standard of efficiency.
For quite a length of time subsequent
to the transfer of the Mark Hopkins
edifice and grounds to the State Uni
versity Mr. Searles made an annual
cash contribution to meet expenses in
cident to the care of the mansion arid
its contents. Some time ago contribu
tions on the part of Mr. Searles were
suspended or ' withheld. Perhaps he
fancied that the Regents of the univer
sity and the directors of the Art Asso
ciation should provide the means re
quired for maintenance of the school
and the care of the house. The pupils
of the school, the members and direc
tors of the Art Association, the Re
gents of the university- and the people
of San Francisco generally will appre
ciate the generosity of Mr. Searles.
Under the administration of Willis E.
Davis, president of. the Art, Associa
tion, the School of Design has made
exceptional, progress. The Searles gift
will surely encourage the supporters of
the institution to renewed efforts In
behalf of the 1 school.

COME TO TERMS
Pacific Coast League Becomes
a Member of' National As
sociation in Special Class
WKANGLE OVER DILLON
Morley and Hanlon Each Claim
the Biff First Baseihan . and
; Both Want to Retain Itini
The Pacific C'-ast Baseball- League
has become a member of the National
Association of Professional" Baseball
Clubs and the long existing war be
tween the only outlaw league in the
country and the national association
has at last come to a' peaceful ending.
The looked for step was taken when
llessrs. Morley, Harris and Bert of.
the Coast League met Johnson, Han
lon and Hart of the national associa
tion yesterday morning.
The conference was & short" one and
the principals tackled business as soon
as the session begun. Within an hoÂ°ur
the existing differences, were settled
and the Pacific Coaust J>eague was ad
mitted to membership in the national
association under a jiew class â aÂ°class
above division A and.ncxt to the major
league division. . c
Ml the details of the conference
m-ere not made public v by the mag
nates, yet It is generally admitted that
the coast managers secured the best of
the deal and that many concessions
were made them. There will be no
salary limit in the Coast. League" and
the managers of the various teams will
be permitted to draft players frorn
either of the two major organizations
or from any of the minors.
President Ban Johnson of the Amer
ican League opened the meeting with
Â« plain talk, in which he stated c that
The war had been on long enough and
for the good of the. 'sport ' -a tjruce
should be declared. He agreed to al
low the magnates of the Coast League*
many concessions, and, after short
ppeeches by th*Â» others present.' the
terms of settlement were drawn up
and agreed upon by all representatives.
No Eastern league wall be allowed
to take any player now signed by the
Pacific Coast 'League, nor will the
managers of th? latter organization be
allowed to sign any players who are
under contract to the leagues In the
East. At the present time there are
several men who.are in dispute,- but
Hanlon promises to < forward . their
names here on the 2<>th inst. and settle
the matter definitely.
The principal clash of. the meeting
happened between Morley and Hanlon.
Both claim to have signed Dnion for
the corning season and neither is will
ing to Waive claim on the noted first
baseman. Hanlon brought forward a
contract which Dillon had signed on
September 15, but .Morley came back
with one that Dillon is alleged to have
signed on September' 1. -. :
Just who will secure the big fellow
remains to be settled. Hanlon is ready
to agree to almost anything, "but firmly
refuses to let Morley have Dillon. -In
all probability the Brooklyn magnate
will finally land the noted, tosser, for
the other magnates will not Tet a mat
ter of one player stand in the way of
the final peace negotiations.
Johnson and Hart departed for the
East when the meeting was over.
Hanlon will remain here for several
days and in the meantime will prob
ably arrange with Morley as to who
tv ill secure the services of Dillon.
Hanlon also claims Castro, who is
signed by Portiand, but the chances
are the latter club . will retain this
player.
It is expected that as soon asÂ«Han!on
secures a full list of -all the players
signed by the Eastern,* minor leagues
and forwards it to the coast magnates
the peace negotiations will be per
fected. There is Ftill a lot of contro
versy goinsr on over several" of these
men, but the chances .are matters will
be settled to the satisfaction of all con
cerned and then peace will be officially
declared. -*Â«.-'

cisco Flycasting Club was held last

Says Parker Family Was Aided.
"Editor The Call: Will you kindly
publish the following facts relative to
the case of George E. Parker and his
family, which was referred to in to
day's Call: Mr. Parker did not make
his needs known until a little over a
week ago, and then his family was at
once visited by- a Christian Scientist.
Through the help received he was en
abled to go to work, but after a few
days he became ill and has been unable
to work since. The Christian Scien
tists who have been helping the family
not only treated them free of charge,
but gave them money and .interested
soirie of the charitable societies in their
behalf and they were well supplied with
provisions and fuel. They had ample
clothing and were not suffering from
lack of food. The Parkers have little
knowledge of Christian Science, but
Mrs. Parker having been healed of a
cataract on the eye some years ago by
this means, they" turned to it for help
In their present extremity and their
needs were provided for. Sincerely
FRANK W. GALE."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY/ FEBRUARY, 3., 1904.
KENIL WORTH RUNS HIS RACE,
BUT IS DEFEATED BY ARABO
Four Choices Are
Dethroned at
Kenilworth had too much excess
baggage to handle in the Bix-furlong
handicap yesterday at Ingleslde. The
brown horse shouldered. 121 pounds
without a murmur and made an excel
lent attempt to deliver It at the right
place, but failed.
Arabo, from Walter Jennings' stable,
â¢was In with 103 and was prayed from
11 to 5 down to 8 to 5 favoritism. Jack
Martin rode the latter and, after In
dulging Kenilworth with the lead to
the eighth pole from home, started
after him.
The "brown bird" weakened grad
ually and Arabo disposed of him clev
erly by half a length in 1:13%.
Schwalbe, the runner-up for two
thirds of the trip, ran a fair third.
Ananias and O'Hagen were the only
other starters.
Cold, cloudy weather kept tha i at
tendance down, but the betting . was
brisk. The fields were not above me
diocrity and four favorites were
beaten. â¢
SOIjAXUS SCORES HANDILY.
The tip on Modred to win the open
ing event, a Futurity course sprint,
did not amount to much. Bob Smith's
colt was heavily backed at the start
of the betting, but at the close there
was plenty of 3^ to. 1. Solanus, from
the stable of W. B. Jennings, ruled
favorite, and, passing Red Bird and
Gene H&ndlan in the stretch, beat the
latter out easily by a length. Modred 0
ran fourth behind Red Bird, but should
have been closer up.
Hildebrand on Albemarle, a 5 X ,Â£ to 1
chance, beat the others away In the
seven furlong number following and
that Is all there was to it. Optimo
was always the contender and at the
wire only lost by a neck. Lady Wads
worth, another of the first choices,
finished third. Marelio drew the rail
position and was knocked out of the
race at the start.
Anything Hildebrand rides is as a
rule installed favorKe and Carilee was
held at odds of 13 to 6 to take the mile
and seventy yard selling affair. The
mare led for half a mile, when J. T.
Sheehan on G. W. Trahern assumed the
front position and ridden out at the
wire downed Mr. Dingle half a length.
Carilee was third.
Mike Daly came near putting Flo
Manola over again at Juicy odds in the
seven furlong selling run for three
year-olds. Wlth'iW. Daly and 96 pounds
up the filly made all the pace but could
not stay, and Ebony registered an easy
first.
EBONY'S PRICE RECEDES.
The winner showed signs of lameness,
which caused his price to recede from
2% to 1 to 14 to 5. Creole Jim, the
favorite, with Larsen up, finished in the
show.
Judging from remarks heard Larsen
did not enhance his popularity to any
extent by his handling of Ada, N, fa
vorite for the closing mile run. The
mare was sore, as she usually is, but
was always in close touch with the
leaders. Third turning into the stretch
all Larsen had to do to win was to
hand-ride his mount. Instead he drew
the whip, allowed the mare to swerve
all over the stretch and then only lost
to Mimo by a head. Chileno was third.
NOTES ~OF THE TRACK.
"Big Bill" Knapp, who is now in the
employ of Parker & Thwaites, had
the mount on Sisenvlne in the tliird
race. Knapp was a' great favorite with
the crowds at Ascot Park, Los Angeles.
He will ride Fossil in the Burns handi
cap on Saturday.
Bookmaker Caesar Young has en
gaged Arthur Redfern to ride Eonic in
the big stake on Saturday.
Hildebrand was there with two win
ners again yesterday.
Gawaine was played from 5 down to
13 to 5 in the betting on the conclud
ing race of the day, and got away so
poorly that he had no chance.
Quite a number of owners appear to
be Buffering with the delusion that if
they put Hildebrand up and the horse
wins regardless of all previous races
everything, is lovely and the goose
hangs high. For "example, take Albe
marleâraces 5803, 5788, 5680. "Why are
theesey thusus?"
When a rider finds that he is riding
out of form he should take a rest.
Only a fortnight ago Larsen was put
ting up some splendid rides and rap 7.
Idly became popular. Then all of, a
sudden he began to "scramble the
eggs." In Justice to himself after his
performance on Ada N, Larsen should
purchase a shotgun, 300 shells, half a
dozen decoys, a slab of bacon, two or
three dozen eggs, some matches, a saw,
hammer and nails to construct a blind
and so way *up In the country duck
shooting before the season closes.
Lapidus seems to have gone away
back, judging from the slowness of
his movements In the j afterpiece.
Timed separately, he trotted the mile
in 2:29%, which leaves him still
eligible to the 2:30 class trots at Kan
kakee. 111., and Bedford, Me.
Many of .the Burns handicap can
didates were let down "for keeps" at
Ingleside yesterday morning. Proper,
with Jack Martin up, covered one and
a quarter miles In 2:08; Faulconbridge
In 2:06 3-6; Arcade, 2:09%; Oarsman,
ridden by Wonderly, 2:10. Fossil also
worked the distance in impressive

BURIAL ALIVE
Supposed Dead AYoman Revives
While Undertaker *Is Prepar
ing- Her Body for Interment
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 2.â An inci
dent which came near causing a sen
sation at Pendleton a month ago was
made public to-day, following the death
of Mrs. Mary Stephens from consump
tion after an illness of several years.
Early In January she lost all appear
ance of animation and neither heart
beat or pulse could be felt. Her color
faded away and it was believed by
her family that she was dead. An
undertaker was summoned and the fu
neral arrangements discussed. Mrs.
Stephens was wrapped in a burial
shroud and as the undertaker was clos
ing her eyes her lips moved and she
gasped, *T am so cold."
The startled family hurriedly dis
missed the badly'frlghtened undertaker
and quickly put Mrs. Stephens into bed
again in a warm room. She revived
slowly and was abfedto take liquid
foods, but did not rally sufficiently to
get up. Monday night she passed away.
Tests were applied to make certain of
her death. She died uninformed of how
near she came' to being buried alive.

Lain were In th' *J box for the fresh

BORNEO ISLES
NOT DESIRED
General, Wood Gives British
Official Assurance of the At
titude of the United States
POSSESSIONS WORTHLESS
Flag Is Raised on a Few
Groups That Sultan of Jolo
Might !Nofr Dispose of Them
! LONDON, Feb. 2.â Ernest W. Birch,
Governor of British North Borneo, who
has arrived here, says General Leonard
Wood, while recently at # Sandakan,
.capital of North Borneo, informed him
that fhe question of the ownership of
the islands off the coast of Borneo,
over which a United States war vessel
had hoisted the American flag, would
Le amicably settled, as there was no
â¢eirong desire on the part of the Amer
icans to keep them.
â¢ WASHINGTON, Feb. 2. â Investiga
tion here r,how# that Genernl Wood wa3
fully authorized to make the statement
attributed to him relative to an ami
cable settlement of the ownership of
the Islands off the coast of Borneo. The
issue as to the /ownership of these is
lands was made by the dispatch to
those waters by Admiral Evans of the
gunboat Qulros, v.hich hoisted the
United States flag on some of the is
. land?. They are said to be practically
but, fearing that the Sultan
of Jolo might undertake to bestow
them on some other nation, the ques
tion was placed in the hands of General
1 Wood with the single understanding
that the islands are to be declared part
of either the British or the American
possessions. It is presumed that Gen
eral Wood will report to Washington
in accordance with his statement to the
Governor of Nqrth Borneo and that the
question will be finally settled by a
treaty or protocol between the United
States and Great Britain.

DELEGATE GETS
A HARD BLOW
Chicago Fh*m Discusses Mat
ters With Twelve Work
men, Averting General Strike
BUSINESS AGENT IGNORED
Employes "Who Represent the
Unions Have â¢ No Trouble
in Settling Their Disputes
CHI&AGO, Fefc. 2. â Elimination of
business agents and other union of
cers in deliberations between employer
and employe for the readjustment of
wages, it Is believed, has averted a
general strike and lockout of 1200
members of the Paintworkers* Union
of Chicago. Instead of dealing with
the labor leaders the proprietors of
the paint factories of the city, mem
bers of the National Paint Manufac
turers' Association, submitted their
case to juries o'f twelve actual work
ingmen from each shop.
A tentative agreement, practically
satisfactory to both sides, has been
submitted tcf the Manufacturers' As
sociation by the union, based upon re
ports made by the various shop com
mittees. The agreement, it is said, will
be accepted by the employers, to
whom is left the "open shop" and the
question of settling the wage scale.
THEATRICAL. COVENANT
HAS HIDDEN MEANING
Klaw & Erlanger and Stair & Havlln
Agree to Divide Territory and Shut
Ont Independent Stars.
CINCINNATI, Feb. 2.â Referring
to a New York dispatch that Klajv &
Erlanger and Stair & Havlin had
agree-d not to conflict with each other
in theatrical business, the Times-Star
says to-day it gives no adequate idea
of the meaning of the agreement. The
fact is, eays the Times-Star, that the
entire popular priced field of the Unit
ed States is turned over to Stair &.
Havlin. This firm in turn abandons
the higher class theatrical field, ex
cept the Majestic Theater in New
York and the Globe Theater in Bos
ton. The most complete fact is that
the arrangement shuts out the inde
pendent players entirely, as., neither
Stair & Havlin nor Klaw & Erlanger
will play the independent stars.

GENERAL SUM MART.
Clear weather prevailed in all eections dur

r.ighcr thsn during the preceding week, but
me nights were generally cold and heavy frosts
occurred in many riacet.
There has betn but H'tle change in crop con-

abceaoa of rain Is being more keenly Icll ail
;nrough th# wnithem uis'rkts and especially
in Soutlvrn California and the southern t-an
Joaqu.r Valley. Other sections are not yet
*tirrerinc m>m lack ot moisture, but the poll is
brcoming dry and rain will be needed soon. In
lhÂ« central "and northern eections the warm,
tÂ±cmx days of the past week caused a more.
iÂ«>;id growth ot grain and grass; early sown
grain if locktng well, but the late town is
ii'Hking flow growth. ProÂ«i>eits are very good
lur Â«-x;-ell<nt crop* In these sections. In South
ern California the early i*oÂ»n grain hau not yet
tome up. and thouch some farmers continue
dry *eÂ«r<JinR. trusting to future rain* to make
n crop, prosrÂ»ects are extremely discouraging
except in places where trnple iirigation water
can be obtained. Pasturage has faifed in most
j.isr*-* in tht- south and cattle are suffering;
â  n the northern sections ercer. feed is abun

fctipevlncs is being considerably Increased,
rrunir.g continues in orchards and vineyards.
The *oll is becoming somewhat dry and rain
\v|ll fee n?*ded soon.
COAST AND RAT SECTIONS
Ciear weather prevailed during the week,
with cool, nosty night* in most place*. The

\>ee|c, bu' heavy rain Is needed very soon to
inxurt- {air crops ; green feed is scarce and

yields of deciduous fruits. ;-" â  â -,
SAN JOAQU1N VAIJ^ET.
Generally clear, cool weather with frequent
frcstÂ« prevailed during the week. No damage
iuu be<n reported from the frosts. Grain and

Nfzv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 2. â The stock market
lapsed a further stage toward entire stagna
tion to-day. Except for the fact it continues
to show activity In a few stocks the dealings
were of a negligible quality so far as th-y
reflected views on any properties or of the
business, industrial or political world. There
was a flurry in Amalgamated Copper In the
opening dealings on the decision by the Mon
tana Supreme <>>urt giving legal sanction to
the holding by Amalgamated of stocks in other
corporations, but the price of that stock got
only a shade higher than the first price and
then sagged hcav.iy to Hi below last nfght.
The action of the stock was attributed to
profit-taking on the favorable news. The rise
in the United States Steel preferred, on the
ether hand, was considered due to covering.
Operators who followed the decline last week
were inclined to believe that the fall had
been due to the knowledge of the coming
resignation of John D. Rockefeller from the
board of directors. The shorts were therefore
disposed to cover, with the news of the resig
nation published. Some of the other iron and
steel stocks hardened in sympathy with United
States Steel, but the movement was" short
lived. 'News from the trade was meager, but
the decline In gross esrnings of the Penn
sylvania lines for December was counted as
an unfavorable indication owing to the large
share of that system in the iron and' steel
traffic. Pennsylvania's reduction in operating
expenses for the same month was .regarded
hopefully as a possible promise for conserva
tion of net earnings by retrenchment. The
Russo-Japanese situation was deemed rather
leas hopeful for peace and this influence was
shown in 'a firmer tone for grain and a re
lapse of cotton. The effect on the securities
market was largely confined to restriction
operations pending the reception of the Rus
sian reply to Japan. Amalgamated Copper
carried the whole market with It In the late
dealings to a level below last night and the
market closed heavy and lifeless.
Bond* were dull and Irregular. Total sa'es,
$2..Vtf.,0O0.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

j Chicago Board of Trade. |
CHICAGO, Feb. 2. â Trading on a mammoth
scale was witnessed to-day in corn and oats.
Manipulation by prominent operators caused a
marked advance in both cereals. May corn
showed a final advance ot l%c, while oats
were up %Q>%c Wheat prices were affected
largely by the strength In coarse grains. May
wheat closing %@lc higher. Provisions also
were .strong, the May products closing 17 %c to
45c higher.
A remarkably broad market In corn devel
oped almost at the very opening. The keynote
apparently wu sounded when the representa
tive of the Interest that is supposed to be-}ong
on May wheat began to buy May corn. Large
commission houses were also liberal buyers.
The advance resulting in prices for corn was
not lacking in celerity. It was estimated that
during the buying furor upward of 2,000,000
bushels of May corn were taken by one house
popularly credited with being the largest hold
ers of wheat for May delivery. May opened
i<ic to He higher at 50!&@51c. and after selling
at 5O9i<a*i0&,c the price steadily advanced.
The advance demand continued the entire
session and the close found May l%c higher at
61TJC
A new record mark was scored for the May
delivery of oats; the price to-day reached 45V4
@45?ic. Trading continued in a large scale
the entire session. The close was strong, with
May %@%c higher at 44%@45c.
Trading in wheat was moderate In volume.
A decidedly strong tone was manifested. Ear
ly factors in contributing to the advance were
strong English markets, reports of damage by
unfavorable weather in the Southwest and the
apparent congestion In the market for coarse
grain. May wheat opened unchanged to %c
higher at 90%c to 91%c. On an active demand
from shorts the price quickly rose to 91 %c.
The advancing tendency, however, was soon
checked on selling by commission houses, who
were supposed to be acting under Instructions
of the leading long. The market gradually re
ceded under this selling pressure until the end
of the first hour, when May was again quoted
at 91 lie. The market dragged for a time,
owing to the absence of many traders who had
found more alluring attractions In corn and
oats. A large decrease In the world's avail
able stocks brought about an active commis
sion house demand later in the day and prices
started upward, aided by the strength in other
grains. On this spurt May advanced to 92c.
but realizing sales caused a slight reaction.
The close was strong, however, and near the
best prices. May being %@lc hinher at 91%Â©)
91%c. July f=old between 82"i@83%c, closing
at the top with a gain of %$*%c
Provisions ruled strong and active on cover
ing by shorts, together with heavy buying for
investment account. The opening was strong,
influenced by higher prices for hogs at the
yards, and on the advance In the nrice of
coarse grains the provision list became still
stronger. The selling was chiefly by local
longs. May pork showed the greatest gain
and closed at an advance of 45c at $13 45, after
ranging between $13 15Â®13 50. May lard was
up 20c at $7 50. with ribs 17%@20c higher.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
An easy feeling continued to prevail In the
Potato market, due largely to the recent heavy
arrivals of Oregon Burbanks. Most buyers
were anticipating further declines and were
purchasing no more than absolutely necessary
for Immediate requirements. â¢ Telegrams from
the north say that the stcamerOregon. due to
morrow will bring nearly 10.000 sacks. Trade
In river Burbanks was quiet, but as supplies
were controlled by a few dealers prices were
unchanged. No fresh Sweets came In, but a
car wns reported close at hand and due at any
time ' Onions were firmer under continued light
receipts. Fine stock sold direct from the car
at the Inside rate, while the top quotation was
readily obtained for small lots at the stores.
As usual on Tuesday the receipts of Los
Angeles vegetables were light and prices for
cholco stock were well maintained. There was
no KÂ«fg Plant received and only one sack of
String Beans came In. New Potatoes from
Mameda County were selling at 3@4c per
pound. Mexican Tomatoes, ex-steamer, were
offcrirB at 75ct*$l per box, but found few buy

Poultry and Game.
' No ' more Western Poultry 'came In. but a
considerable portion of thu two ears that came
in on the preceding day was still on band. Re
ceipts of domestic stock ' were moderate and
trade was' quiet, as retailer* were well sup
plied with Western stock. Old Hens and
Roosters were dull, while* young stock, both
large and small, was steady under limited sup
plies. A few cases of dressed Turkeys came,
in, but they met with a sluggish demand and
prices were nominally unchanged.
Game arrived freely and moved oft slowly.
In fact, there was not enough business to war
rant any change in the quotations. Geese ana
Ducks were mostly poor and thin.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter continues steady and th* situation
shows no change whatever. Fancy creamery
continues in light supply and there is no large
stock of lower grades.
A number of dealers are now reporting rather
more demand for the lower grades of Cheese,
though even with this improved inquiry thÂ»
income is fully up to the outgo, so the market
shows little change. . Th* choice grades exhibit
no new features, being dull and plentiful.
Eggs continue unsettled, with a market al
most bare of stock. The range In prices con
tinues extremely narrow, yesterday's range be
ing 24g27e. which comprised everything. Re

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Trade, in Oranges was of a light Jobbing
character and confined chiefly to the large
sizes, principally 96s, and such offerings were
firmly held at a small premium. Retailers
were complaining that the consumptive demand
was very light owing to the continued cool
weather, and were taking Just about enough
for immediate requirements. Tangerines were
less plentiful and were quoted firmer. Lemons,
Limes and Grace Fruit were in free supply
and unchanged. Ripe Bananas were plentiful
and moved slowly at previous prlcts. Five
cars of Oranges are announced for to-day's

Dried Fruits,Nuts,RaisinsJIoney.
Aside from the establishment o( new Raisin
quotations by the Association, already men
tioned, the market has exhibited no new
features for a long time. The demand for
all descriptions of Fruits, Nuts and Honey is
reported quiet. The bee-ralaers still express
apprehension for the existence of their bees,
owing to the drought in the southern bee dis
tricts. It Is reported that Cuba is governing
the Honey market just now and. that Honey
from there is being laid down in the Eastern

CLAIMS RUDDER
WAS DEFECTIVE
Sailor Who Was on Ill-Fated
Steamer Clallam Makes Af
fidavit Bearing on Disaster
DEPOSITION IS REJECTED
Marine Inspectors Decline to
Accept It Insisting That
Witness Appear Before Them
SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 2.â In sup
port of his contention that the Clallam
had a defective rudder which prevented
Captain Roberts from heading the ves
sel into the wind, allowing the water to
pour in through the broken deadlight,
Chief Engineer do Launay, during the
Investigation which was resumed this
morning, submitted an affidavit from
R. W. Griffin, a sailor, which the ma
rine inspectors declined to allow' to be
introduced as evidence upon the
ground that affiant had been â¢ sum
moned to appear; that it was made In
Victoria, i>. foreign city; that the wit
ness had r.ot been questioned or cross
examined by men of marine knowl
edge. Hut v. ith the opening of the aft
ernoon cession the inspectors gave no
tice that they had caused a telegram
to be sent to Griffin, the board agreeing
also to personally pay his expenses, as
the Government makes no provision
for the importation of witnesses.
'iriffin sets forth in his affidavit that
the Clallam'p rudder was cracked from
one end to the other that -the ship
could not be steered without the re
lieving tackles; that Captain Roberts
ran about" the boat acting like an in
sane man, and that he was greatly ex
cited.
Various other witnesses, officers of
the steamer, had sworn during previous
sessions that the Clallam had a good
rudder and First Officer Doley testified
to-day that the relieving chains were
not brought Info use on the day of the
disaster.
After Engineer de Launay had been
on the witness stand several minutes
Inspector Turner asked:
"Is there anything more you want to
â¢talk about that you think has any
bearing on this case?"
"Well. 1 don't know as there is any
! thing that I could say that will help
; my case a bit," replied the engineer.
| "From the evidence that has been in
! troduced here there seems to be a dls
, position on the part of you gentlemen
1 to make me shoulder the blame iii Â£hls
! case."
Henry Jensen, a deckhand, recalled,
testified ,that in his opinion the Clal
lam's lifeboats were not properly man
aged.
spection. to cross the quarantine Jine
into other Stat-s and Territories. -
â¢ The O. >vernor to-dny received a' reply
from the Secretary of Agriculture say # -
inj? that the department may be able
to issue an order for the movement of
cattle, after inspection, from the quar
antined section to other parts of^the
State if Callforr.;a. but thÂ« It w*Â«'ald
be unable to permit such movement to
other States or Territories. The Secre
tary of Agriculture added that cattle
below, the .quarantine line, which,
roughJy. speaking, runs from San "Luis
Obispo County across the northern end
of Kern County, are considered infeet
?d and there is great danger of
spreading an infectious cattle disease
!f such cattle are allowed to go to other
States. The Secretary said that if a
plan can be devised by c which the cat
tlebwill be retained In California and
assurances given that they will not
he ntttved to other States, it is prob
able that an order extending the open
season can be issued.
A letter was also received by the
Governor to-day from Dr. C. H. Ble
iner. Sta^ Veterinarian, dated at San
Luis Obispo. In ft Dr. Blemer repre
sented the situation as serious, saying
thai cattlemen declare there are 800,000
head of cattle involved. Dr. Blemer will
go to-morrow to San Diego, Santa Bar
bara and Los Angeles. He is accompa
nied by Dr. A. B. Melvin, assistant
chief of the Bureau of Animal Indus
try at Washington. D. C, who has been
Inquiring into the situation aiil has
recommended to his department s,n
amended rule to permit cattle to be
moved over the quarantine line.
A. circumstance which is regarded as
of great iirsportance ,in the present cri
eis is the difficulty of find tig a locality
affording adequate feed for the cattle.
Northern California is said to be over
stocked at present, as also ar* Oregon
and Kevada. Arizona is considered the
best outlet, but it 'id laared the author
ities Jiiere *vM not permit the catVie
to enter the territory. In 1S98, when
4here was a drouth In the Bouth, the
Arisona authorities would not allow
the cattle to be moved across the bor
der, declaring that Arizona was free
irom Texas fever and it could not af
ford to run the risk of having the in
fection brought in.
Governor Pardee will at once com
municate with the Arizona authorities
with the view to securing their consent
to receive the cattle if the Department
of Agriculture will peyjnit them to
move. It Is thought that Arizona of
fers the only place for 3 thertl, as they
are growing too weak to to
States farther distant.

STEAMSHIP KOREA CARRIES
MANY TONS OF MERCHANDISE
Pacific Mail Company's Big Liner Departs for the Orient
Laden to Her Full Capacity With Freight and
Takins: Biff Crowd of Passengers in Her Cabins
The Pacific Mail Company's big liner
Korea sailed yesterday for the Orient
with more than 8000 tons of cargo and
a large number of passengers. The
v^harf was crowded with people, inter
ested in the liner's departure and in
the crush the pocket-picking fraternity
found at least one golden opportunity,
by which they acquired $200. The vic
tim was G. F. Foye, a passenger
bound for Hongkong. He claims to have
had ten double eagles taken from his
pocket.
"There's nothing in it," said Captain
Anderson when asked about the re
ported theft. .
"Not now," said Foye, who overheard
the captain's remark and was slowly
climbing the gangplank, making a last
sad search of his pockets.
The Korea will call at Manila and
among the passengers for that port
was Bishop Thomas F. Hendriclt, who
is going to assume charge of the dio
cese of Cebu. Accompanying Bishop
Hendrick was Joseph Dissett, his sec
retary. Bernard Faymonville of the
Fireman's Fund Insurance Company
was another passenger. He Is going to
look over the Insurance field in the
Philippines. Horace G. Burt, who re
cently resigned the presidency of the
Union. Pacific Railroad, sailed on the
Korea, accompanied by Mrs. Burt. He
is traveling for pleasure and looks for
ward to enjoying a rest earned by
many years In the harness of an ex
acting profession.
The Korea's cargo Included 2500 tons
of flour and 700 tons of beef, the latter
part of Russia's big order. The freight
for Manila included 10<f tons of m.ess
beef for the United States army and
250,000 feet of lumber.

"Winifred Mears. the daughter of an
army officer, who reached San Fran

the islands, accompanied by her canine
pet. Miss Mears was allowed to come
ashore, but under the regulations her
dog was shut out. Miss ' Mears ap
pealed to Collector of the Port Strat

relief; -the dog must either dJe or go
back to the Philippines. It was agreed
that the animal should be allowed to
remain safely in quarantine until Miss
Mears should exhaust her resources to
regain her pet. P^e appealed to Gov
ernor Pardee to intercede with the Sec
retary of the Department of Agricul
ture it Washington for a suspension of
the Ydles against the admission of ani
mals from the islands. Just to give her
back ber dog. Governor Pardee good
naturedly complied, arr* has received
an answer irom the uepartment at
Wasb'nprton saying that the action of
the Collector of the PoÂ»c in shutting
put Miss Mears' pt.1 uog must be sus
tained. There' is nothing for the dog to
do now except \o~ rÂ»turn to â¢ his old
haunts in the Philippines or permit an
end to be made of all his troubles by

*zâ¬.n and. Heard Discussing the
, Division of Stolen Money
â¢ Two .daring foctpads have revived
the. pastime of robbing saloons, ac
x-ording to the story told by James
jCorcoran, night" bartender in Thomas
saloon, at Efeventh and Mar
k*tstreets, to Policeman Slattery early
yesterday morning.
Corcoran informed the policeman
that about S o'clock a yeung man wear
ins a'biack mgst over 'his face came
Into the saloon". when* no customers
were present. . The man had a revolver
in hi-s right hand and, presenting it at
Corcoran, ordered him to throw up b.is
hands."
Corcoran quickly complied and the
ir.an said: "Now: go int.o the back room
and flon't make a noise on your life."
Corcoran, with Iris hands raised above
bis head, walked into the. back room
and the- robber opene'd the cash regis
ter and took' between $10 and $11.
: Â»w. I want you to. remain in that
room for fifteen minutes," he said to
Corcoran. "If you d^n't and raise an
outcry I will come back and kill you."
Corcoran said the' robber had an ac
complice, whQ st:ood CiUtside the saloon
on the lookout. , .. '
Strgc-ar.t Blank and Policeman Slat
tery searched the. neighborhood, but
could find no. trace of the robber and
his accomplice. -They received infor
mation from .P. J, Carr, 39 West Mis
sion street, however, that he had seen
two young men 'going down Eleventh
street toward .Mjssidn. about the time
mentioned by Corcoran- and when they
were passing close to him he heai'd
thorn talking about dividing 511.-
The description given by Carr an

two men who robbed- the saloon.
EUPKEJIE COURT GRANTS
WALKER A NEW TRIAL
Defendant Is Conimencing His Seventh
Year of Imprisonment in the . :
County Jail.
George Walker! who is charged with
having defrauded the American Tract
Society out of $4o 35; was granted a
rew trial b>' -the. Supreme Court yes
terday. For more than six years he
has been waiting at the Broadway
Jail io discover whether he belongs in
Folfom penitentiary, or In unrestrain
ed society. There are an indefinite
number of features and ramifications
of his case pending in. various courts.
All sorts of proceedings against him
and in his behalf "have been instituted.
The original 'caj;se of the defend
ant's difficulties .Is.: sa"id to have been
an erroneous supposition on kis part
*iat he could beat the bookmakers.
When his employers learned of his
delusion he is alleged to have been
about $4000 shorf-in'.his accounts. HÂ«
>yas convicted on one- charge of em
bezzlement, February^, 1898,'and sen
tenced to four years, at Folsom.
Various kinds of appeals on several
features of his were taken. He
was next sentenced to serve one year
at Folsom on August 26, 1901. Then
there was a fight over a .bill of excep
tions, another over' the Judge's in
structions and another over a com
plaint. Next came : a difference over
the posting of the' court's record. JThe
new trial is granted this particular
itime because certain evidence, incom
petent out detrimental to the defend
ant, was introduced.
Walker's lawyer 'is George Collins.
Convicted of -Manslaughter.
Victor le Corvee was convicted of
manslaughter by .-a Jury in Judge
Cook's court yesterday afternoon and
will be sentenced on Saturday. He
was 1 tried SCor killing Vincent le Meur,
a shipmate on the French bark Ver
cingetorjx, on the night of January
12. The question of jurisdiction was
raised in his case, as the killing oc
'curred on board the bark, but it was
not sustained.
P0STU2I CEREAL.
DIDN'T BELIEVE
,7Tiat Coffee Was the Krai Trouble.
Some people flounder arpund and
take everything that's recommended
to them, but finally find out that cof-
fee is the real cause of their troubles.
An : Oregon man says:
twenty-five years I was
troubled with my stomach. I -was a
steady coffee ' drinker, but didn't sus-
pect that as the cause." I doctored
vith good doctors and 'got .no help,
then 1 took almost anything which
some one else had been cured with,
but to no good. I was very bad last
summer and co'alfi not work at times.
"On December 2. 1902. I was taken
bo l>ad the doctor said I could not live
over twenty-four at the mo^t
and I made all preparations to
die. I could hardly â  eat anything,
everything distressed me and I was
â weak and sick all over. When in that
condition coffee was abandoned and I
was put on Postum, tne change Jn my
feelings came quickly after the drink
that was poisoning me was removed.
"The pain and sickness fell away
from me and I began to get well day
by day, 60 I stuck to it, until now I am
well and strong again, can eat heartily
vith no headache, heart trouble or the
awful sickness of the old coffee days.
I drink all I wish of Postum without
any harm and enjoy it immensely.
"This seems like a wonderfully
t-lrong: story, but I woald refer you
to the First National Bank, the Trust
banking Company, or any merchant
of Grants I^ss, Or., in regard to my
standing and I will send a sworn
statement of this if S'ou wish. You
can also use my name." Name given
by Postum Co., Battle Creek, Mich.
Stili there are many who persistent-
ly fool themselves by saying, "Coffee
don't hurt me." A ten days' trial of
Postum In its place will tell the truth
and many times save life."
"There's a reason."

CHEMIST DISCOVERS BLOOD
ON LEON SOEDER'S DAGGER
Professor Thomas Price Gives Important Testimony
in the Blaise Murder Trialâ Prosecuting Attorney
Closes Case for People and Defense Opens To-Day
Professor Thomas Price, an analyt
ical chemist of 526 Sacramento
street, testified before Judge CabanisB
yesterday that he discovered blood
stains on the knife found by Detective
Thomas Gibson in the room of Leon
Soeder, charged with the murder of
Joseph Blaise. Traces of blood were
found on the knife where the blade
joins the handle, and also in that por
tion of the handle that holds the
blade when the knife is closed.
When Detective Gibson searched
the room of Soeder on the day fol
lowing the murder of Blaise he found
a large, one-bladed knife of the dag
ger pattern. There were no blood
stains visible to the naked eye upon
it.' The knife was given to Professor
Price, who made a .chemical examina
tion and found that blood still ad
hered to the weapon. He did not make
a test to ascertain whether the blood
was that of a'human being, as he was
not instructed to do so by the police.
This evidence, if Professor Price - as
certains that the blood is human, will
be of the greatest value to the prose
cution.
Soeder was questioned by the police
at the time of his arrest as to where
he secured the knife and what he us*d
it for. He said he purchased the
knife in France last fall and that he
used it merely as a pocket-knife. He
was asked if he had ever cut any meat
or anything with it that might have
left traces of blood on it. Soeder re
plied that he had not.
KNIFE IS EXAMINED.
After eliciting this information
from him the police sent the knife to
Professor Price, who examined it for
traces of blood. Professor Price used
what is known as'the.Guaicum test in
his examination of the weapon for
traces of blood. He stated that had the
clothes Soeder took to the cleaner's
been washed in warm water, there
would in all probability have been
some trace of blood In the .water if
there was any on the clothes, but had
they been subjected to a' scouring in
cold water traces of blood would have
been hard to find.
Edward H. Osborne.was placed on
the stand at the opening of the hear
ing in the rnorning and completed his
testimony in regard to the insurance
policies. It did- not vary materially
from that already published.
I*. R. Parker; manager for the Hart
ford Life Insurance Company in this
city, testified that .Osborne presented
to him an application for a life insur
ance policy for $7000 on the life of
Joseph Blaise. He testified that the

United States Secret Service Agent
Hazen has recognized Harry Randall,
now in the city prison, as an ex-con
vict and counterfeiter. Randall was
arrested by. the police last Sunday for
robbing the delicatessen shop of H.
Tietjen at 38 Sixth street. Mr. Hazen
says that Randall has served a three
years' term in the penitentiary, at Fol
som for counterfeiting. He was con
victed under the name of Ed Petersen,
alias Miller. He was the missing mem
ber of the Callan gang of "counterfeit
ers arrested by Hazen a few weeks ago
and was the one that taught Callan
the business.
Thief in Salvation Barracks.
Captain Hellesath of the Salvation
Army barracks, 2726 Mission street,
reported to the police yesterday that
a cornet valued at $10 was stolen from
the barracks on Sunday night. The
members of the army were out
marching at the time.

and Blaise for the guarantee of the
payment. of the policy on its delivery
was signed by Joseph Blaise and in-
uursea oy j>eon ooeuer. ramer meii
tifled the signature, of Soeder on the
note as being identical with- that on
the letter received' by him (Parker)
on the morning'of January 11.
..LETTER IS DESTROYED.
Parker could not recall the exact
words in the letter written to him by
Soeder, -which he found under his door
on the morning of the date mentioned,
but stated that it was an inquiry re
garding the delivery of the policy. He
said he had destroyed the letter and
the defense objected to Parker's testi
mony on that matter. The Court sus
tained the objection and ruled that the
prosecution be required to show that
the letter Parker claims he received
and which was subsequently de
stroyed by him was actually written
by Soeder.
Captain Martin was next .placed on
the stand and told of his visit to the
scene of the murder and his subse
quent examination of Soeder in his of
fice. He said that Soeder told him
that Blaise had $200 in gold coin' when
they left France, which amount Blaise
had drawn from a French bank. Soe
der said he -had paid all Blaise's ex
penses and fare and that the dead man
had $90 in gold on .his person at the
time of .the murder. When Blaise left
his home ' he ! came ' to America with
Soeder with the understanding, Soeder
said, â  that they would come \ to ' San
Francisco .and Blaise would remain in
this city, secure work and send for his
family.
Martin 'detailed several conversations
he had had with Soeder.Mn -which,' the
accused denied having a gray suit or a
pistol. Soeder told Martin that' he < did
not pay- any money on the insurance
policies, and said that Blaise paid $102
on the life insurance policy for $3000 In
the Pacific Mutual Company, $3 on the
accident policy in the same company,
and a $5 deposit on -another policy,
leaving him in ffossession of $90.

SLEUTH GUARDS
Burglar Enters Basement of
an* Ellis -Street Residence
Unobserved by Patrolman
SECURES MUCH PLUNDER
Bluecoat Detailed to Catch
Crook, but the Latter Man
ages to Make a Big Haul
Almost every one knows that San
Francisco is blessed with. a corps of po
lice officers whose very names strike
terror to the hearts of porch climbers
and second story workers, but for all
that a gentleman with crooked tenden
cies outwitted one of these star sleuths
the other night and the latter knew
nothing about the trick until it was
turned. Then he was snbwn how it
happened, but refuses to talk. .
The man that double-crossed the boy
in blue was not a second-story opera
tor, but an under-story craftsman
one who prefers to make his hauls in
basements. The crime was committed
at the residence of Miss Croney, 1036
Ellis street, some time between the
dead of midnight and the breaking of
the beautiful dawn.
The thief had been at work on the
premises for several nights and the
closest vigilance on- the part, of the oc
cupants of the house availed nothing.
A few days ago Miss Croney went into
the basement of her home and discov
ered that the thief had paid the place
a visit on the preceding night and
had cleared up everything of value.
SWAG IX A SACK.
It was all packed up in a big sack,
the thief probably being frightened
away ere he had a chance to parade
down the strÂ§et with his swag. Miss
Croney telephoned to police headquar
ters for an officer to watch the house
that night and specified that she want
ed a man that would be a guaranteed
burglar catcher. f
That rilght the sleuth arrived. He
smilingly stated that he could catch
anything that runs and that burglars
were his special cake. So the family
retired early and dreamed of how the
fearless copper would corral that bold
thief and have him strapped to a chair
in the parlor, awaiting the family in
spection in the morning.
When the household awoke, the cop
per was still on his beat in front of
the hsuse. He told of how he had
seen burglars come within a block or
so of the place, but when they spotted
him they all took, to the woods in the
direction of Van itfess avenue.
Then the members of the family be
gan^ a quiet little search themselves.
The cellar door was open, but this they
did not mind, as the key was left in the
door at the copper's suggestion. . But
when the key was discovered under the
door the searchers murmured, "How
strange."
TRICK IS TURNED.
Still they had confidence in what the
smart guardian of the household said.
A hasty examination of the interior of
the cellar disclosed the startling 0 fact
that the feack of swag had disappeared.
No one accused the copper of having
taken it, so it was mutually agreed
that the burglar turned, the trick him
self.
The cop did not know how it all hap
pened; he knew nothing till he was
shown. Then he scratched his head
and took on an expression of wisdom.
He hinted at burglars having been
asleep in the cellar for several days,
but could not explain how the gentle
men made a getaway while he was
guarding the doorway of the cellar.
Several hundred, dollars' worth of
goods were stolen, including some sur
gical instruments belonging to Dr. Van
Meter, a roomer at the place. Miss
Croney had used the basement for a
storeroom and had. deposited Â° many
valuable articles there. The burglar
was a good judge and shrewd and he
overlooked lathing. Still the cop re
fuses to believe and hints at crooks
with wings.
