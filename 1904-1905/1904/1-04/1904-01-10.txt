had caused it, were dead, and the tone
of his voice made her shiver.
And the suffering he used to getâ
the suffering from trifles â the foolish
suffering from silly trifles!
He turned now, for he heard Judith
walking toward him. She was looking
him straight in the eyes and' was smil
ing strangely.
"I'm going to make you love me as
you used to love me."
Her lips were half parted from the
whisper, and he could have stooped
and kissed her â something that never
in his life he had done â he knew that
â but the old reverence came back
from the past to forbid him, and he
merely looked down into her eyes,
flushing a little.
"Yes," she said, gently. "And I
think you are just tall enough."
In a flash her mood changed, and
* she drew his head down until she
could just touch his forehead with her
lips. It was a sweet bit of motherli

falling with such maddening patience
on the tide, and to be away. All the
time, meanwhile, soldiers coming in â
more, and more soldiersâ- in freight
box, .day coach and palace car.
That night, in the hotel. Grafton
and Crittenden watched the crowd
from a divan of red plush, Grafton
chatting incessantly. Around them
moved and . sat the women of the
"House of the Hundred, Thousand" â
officers' wives and daughters and sis
ters and sweethearts and army wid
owsâclaiming rank and giving it
more or less consciously, according to
the rank of the man whom they re
presented. The big man with, the
monocle and the suit of towering
white from foot , to crown was the En-'

through the hotel as , though he had
the British Empire at his back. j
, "And ; he has, ; - too,',' said Grafton.
"You ought to see * him go down the

And the' 7 picturesque*' little "'fellow

"Think of it. Fourteen years I never
saw the first star without making the
same.wlsh for you and me'. : Why," he
went on, and stopped. suddenly .with a
little shame at making the, confession
even to himself, and at the same time
with an impersonal wonder that such
a thing could be, "I used to pray for
you always â when I Bald my prayers
â actually. And sometimes even now,
when I'm pretty hopeless and helpless
and moved by some memory, the old
prayer comes back unconsciously and
I find myself repeating your name."
For the moment he spoke as though
"It never comes but once." he said.
In a low tone that made. Judith turn
suddenly. Her eyes looked as if they
were not far from tears.
A tiny star showed in the pink glow
over the west â
Starlight. Â«t*rbriÂ«ht.
For a' moment Crittendan watched
her. He never realized before how
much simple physical beauty she had,
nor did he realize the significance of
the fact that never until now had he
observed it. . She had been' a spirit be
fore; now she was a woman as well.
But he did rote that If he could? have
learned only from* Judith, he would
never have known that he even had
wrists or eyes until that day; and yet
he was curiously unstirred by the
subtle change in her. He was busied
with his own memories.
"And I know it can never come
back," he said, and he went on think
ing as he looked at her. "I wonder if
you can know what it is to have some
body such a part of your life that you
never hear a noble strain of music,
never read *a noble line of poetry,
never catch a high mood from nature,
nor from your own best t houghs â that
you do not imagine her by your side
to share your pleasure In It all; that
you make no effort to better yourself
or help others, that you do nothing of
which she could approve, that you are
not thinking of her â that really she is
not the inspiration of it all? That
doesn't come but once. Think of hav
ing somebody so linked with your life,
with what Is highest and best in you,
that, when the hour of temptation
comes and overcomes, you are not
able to think of her through very
shame. I wonder If he loved you that
waf. I wonder if you know what such
love Is." '
diently and followed her to the porch,
but she did notsit down outside. She
went on into the parlor and threw
open the window to let the last sun
light in, and sat by it looking at the
west.
The buggy behind had made a little
spurt and the horses were almost
neck? and nock. Wharton looked ugly,
and the black-eyed girl with fluffy
black hair was looking behind Ju
dith's head at Crittenden and was
smiling. Not once had Judith turned
her head, even to see who they were.
Crittenden hardly knew whether she
was conscious of the race, but they
were approaching her gate now and
he found out
â¢\Shail I turn in?" he aske<V
"Go on," said Judith.
There was a long, low hill before
them, ar.d . up that Crittenden let
Raincrow have his full speed for th*
first time. The panting nostrils' of the
other horse fell behind â out of sight â
out of hearing.
"And if he doesn't get back from
the war, she will mourn for him sin
cerely for a year or two and then â "
'Marry some one. else."
"Why not?"
Thai v.-as what she had so often told
him to do, and now he spoke as
though it were quite possibleâ even
lor him; and she was both glad and a
'little resentful.
At the top of the hill they turned.
The enemy was trotting leisurely up
the slope, having given up the race
earlier than they knew. Judith's face
was flushed.
"I don't think you are so very old,"
she said.
Crittenden laughed, and took off his
hat very politely when they met the
buggy, but Wharton looked surly. The
girl v ith the black hair looked sharply
at Judith, and then again at Critten
den, and smiled. She must have cared
little for her companion, Judith
thought, or something for Crittenden,
and yet she knew that most women
emiled at Crittenden. even when they
did not know him very well. Still she
asked: "And the other things â you
meant other women?"
"Yes and no."
"Why no?"
"Because I have deceived nobody â
not even myselfâ and heaven knows I
tried that hard enough." , .
'That was one ?" she added, smiling.
"I thought you lenev* me better than
to ask such a question."
Again Judith smiled â scanning him
closely.
"No. you aren't so very oldâ nor
world weary, after all."
"No?"
"No. And you have strong hands â
and wrists. And your eyes are â " she
seemed almost embarrassed â "are the
eyes of a good man. in spite of what
you say about yourself; and I would
trust them. And it was very fine in
you to talk as you did when we were
tearing up that hill a moment ago."
Crittenden turned with a start of
surprise.
"Oh." he said, with unaffected care
lessness. "You didn't seem to be very
Crittenden had stop; ed to pull the
self -opening gate, and he drove almost
at a slow walk through the pasture to
ward Judith's home. The sun was
reddening through the trees now. The
whole earth was moist and fragrant,
and the larks were singing their last
songs for that happy day. Judith was
quite serious now.
"Do y*ou know, I was glad to hear
you Bay that you had got over your
old feeling for me. I feel so relieved.
I have always felt so responsible for,
your happiness, but I don't now,. and It
is cucb a relief. Now you will go
ahead and marry some lovely girl and
you will be happy and I shall be hap
pier â seeing it and knowing it."
Crittenden shook his head.
"No," he said, "something seems to
havo gone. out of me. never to come
back."
There was nobody In sight to open
the yard gate, and Crittenden drove to
the stile, where he helped Judith out
and climbed back into his buggy.
Judith turned in surprise. "Aren't
you coming in?"
"I'm afraid I haven't time."
"Oh. yea, you have."

kitchen.

-The prophecy"; In* the soldier's tone
soon came true. The smile nev^r left

'bruised' up that smiling was difficult;
but the onlookersknew that the spirit
of the smile was still there. ' Black
ford himself was smiling now. Crit
tenden struck but for one place at first
âReynolds' nose, which was naturally
word, acting as Crittenden's second.
Reynolds was the champion bruiser of
the regiment and a boxer of no mean
skill, and Blackford looked anxious.
"Worry him, and he'll lose his head.
Don't try to do him up too quickly."
Reynolds was coarse, disdainful and
triumphant, but he did not look so
confident when Crittenden stripped
and showed a white body, closely
jointed at shoulder and elbow and at
knee and thigh, and closely knit with
steel-like tendons. The long muscles
of his back slipped like eels under his
white skin. ' Blackford looked re
lieved.
"Do you know the game?"
"A little."
"Worry him and wait till he loses
his head â remember now."
"All right." said Crittenden, cheer
fully, and- turned and faced Reynolds,

(More sign language.) "Hell after
ward. Alt right now. got your policy,
go 'ahead."
Grafton nodded basely, and without
a smile:
"Thanks, old man â thanks. It's
very lucid."
A little'" later Crittenden saw the
Â¦tout civilian, Major Billings, fairly
puffing with pride, excitement, and' a
fine uniform of khaki, -whom he had
met at Chickamauga: and Willlngs.
the Burgeon, and Chaffee, now a brig
adier; and Lawton, soon to command
a division; and, finally, little Jerry
Carter, quiet, unassuming, dreamy,
slight, old, but active, and tough as
hickory. The little genera] greeted
Crittenden like a son.
"I was sorry not to see you again at
Chickamauga, but I started here next
day. I have : Just written you that
there was a place on my staff for you
or your brotherâ or for any son of
your father and my friend. I'll write
to Washington for you to-night, and
you can report for duty whenever you
please."
The' little man made the astounding
proposition as calmly as though he
were asking the Kentucklan to a
lunch of bacon and hard tack, and
Crittenden flushe'd with gratitude and
his heart leapedâ his going was sure
now. Before he could stammer out
hi3 thanks, the general was gone.
Just then Rivers, who, to his great Joy,
.had got at least that far, sat down by
him. He was much depressed. His
regiment was going, but two com
panies would be left behind. His colo
nel talked about sending him back to
Kentucky to bring down some horses,
and he was afraid to go.
"To think of being in the army as
long as I have been, just for this flght
And to think of being left here in this
hell hole all summer, and missing all
the fun in Cuba, not to speak of the
glory and the game. We haven't had
a war for so long that glory will come
easy now, and anybody who does any
thing will be promoted. But it's miss
ing the fight â the flght â that worries
me," and Rivers shook his head from
side to side dejectedly. "If my com
pany goes, I'm all right; but if it
doesn't, there is no chance for me if I
go away. I shall lose my last chance
' of slipping in somewhere. 'I swear I'd
rather go as a private than not at all."
This videa gave Crittenden a start.
and made him on the sudden very
thoughtful.
"Can you get me in as a private at
the last minute?" he asked presently.
"Yes," said Rivers, quickly, "and I'll
telegraph you in plenty of time, so
that you cÂ»n get back."
Crittenden smiled, for Rivers' plan
was plaint but lie was thinking of a
' plan of his own.
', '"*'â¢ Meanwhile, he drilled as a private
each day. 'He -was ignorant of the
Krag-Jorgensen; and at Chickamauga
he had made such a laughable exhibi
tion of himself that the old sergeant
took him off alone one day, and when
they came back the sergeant was ob
served to be smiling broadly. At the
first target practice thereafter, Crit
tenden stood among the first men of
the company, and the captain -took
mental note of him as a sharpshooter
to be remembered when they got to
Cuba. With the drill he had little
itroublfr â being a natural-born horse
man â so one day, when a trooper was
111, he was allowed to take the sick
soldier's place and drill with the regi
ment. That day his trouble with Rey
nolds came. All the soldiers were free
and' easy of speech and rather reck
less with epithets, and, knowing how
little was meant, Crittenden merely
remonstrated with the bully and smil
ingly 'asked him to desist.
"Suppose I don't?"
Crittenden smiled again and an
swered nothing, and Reynolds mis
took his silence for timidity. At right
wheel, a little later, Crittenden
squeezed the bully's leg, and Reynolds
cursed him. He might have passed that
with a last warning, but as they wheel
ed again, he saw Reynolds kick San
ders so violently that the boy's eyes
filled with.tears. He went straight for
the soldier as soon as the drill was
over.
- ; " "Put up your guard."
The word was checked at his lips
by. Crittenden's fist. In a rage Rey
nolds threw his hand behind him, as
though he would p^ll his revolver, but
his wrist was caught by sinewy fingers
from behind. It was Blackford, smil
ing into his purple face.
"Hold on!" he said, "save that for
a Spaniard."
At once, as a matter of course, the
men led the way behind the tents, and
made a ring â Blackford, without a
"No, old man* I was selfish enough
to think it, but I'm not self.:h enough
to do it. I won't have it."
"But I want to go back. If I can get
in at the last moment I should go back
anyhow to-night."
"Really?"
"Really. Just that you let me know
in time."
Rivers grasped hi- hand.
"I'll do that."
Next morning rumors were flying. In
a week, at least, they would sail. And
still regiments rolled in, and that after
noon Crittenden saw the regiment come
in for which Grafton had been waiting
â a picturesque body of fighting men,
and, perhaps, the most typical Ameri
can regiment formed since Jackson
fought at New Orleans. At . the head
of it rode two menâ one with a quiet
mesmeric power that bred perfect trust
at slight, the other with the 'kindling*
poWer of enthusiasm, and a passionate
energy, mental, physical, emotional,
that was tireless; each a man among
men, and both together an ideal leader
for the thousand Americans 'at their
heels. Behind them rode the Rough
Riders â dusty, traveled-stained troop
ers, gathered from every State, every
walk of labor and leisure, every social
grade in the Union â day laborer and
millionaire, clerk and clubman, college
boy and athletes. Southern revenue offi
cers and Northern policemen; but most
of them "Westerners â Texan rangers,
sheriffs and desperadoes â the men
hunters and the men-hunted; Indians;
followers of all politic.: iaiths. all
creeds â Catholics, Protestants, Jews;
but cowboys for the most part; dare
devils, to be sure,' but good-natured,
good-hearted, : lcturesque, fearless.
And Americans! â all!
As the last troopers filed rast, Crit
tenden followed them with his eyes,
and he saw a little way ~ Ulackford
standing with folded arms on the edge
of a cloud of dust and looking after
them too, with his face set as though
he were buried deep In a thousand
memories. He started when Crittenden
spoke to him, and the dark fire of his
eyes flashed.
"That's where I belong." he said,
with a wave of his hand after the re
treating column. "I don't know one of
them, and I I.now them all. I've gone
to- college with some; I've hunted,
fished, camped, drank and gambled
with the others. I belong with them;
and I'm going with them if I can; I'm
trying to get an exchange now."
"Well, luck to you, and good-by."
said Crittenden, holding out his hand.
"I'm going home to-night."
"But you're coming back?"
"Yjs."
Blackford hesitated.
"Are you going to join this outfit?"â
meaning his own regiment.
"I don't know; this or the Rough
Riders."
"Well," Blackford seemed embar
rassed, and his manner "was most re
spectful, "If we go (.jgether, what do
you say to our going as 'bunkies'?"
"Sure." 4
"Thank you"."
The two men grasped hands. A _
"I hope you will come back.** f
"I'm sure to come back. Good-by.**
"Good-by, sir."
The ungracious "sir" startled Critten
den. It was merely habit, of course,
and the fact that Crittenden was not
yet enlisted, but there was an unin
tended significance in the soldier's tone
that made him wince. Blackford
turned sharply away,' flushing.'
Back in the Bluegrass, the earth was
flashing with dew, and the air wai bril
liant* with a steady light that on its
way from the sun was broken by
hardly a cloud. The woodland was
alive with bird-wing and bird-song and
under them with the flash of metal and
the Joy of breaking camp. The town
was a mighty pedestal for flag-staffs.
Everywhere flags were shaken out.
Main street, at a distance, looked like
a long lane of flowers in a great gar
den â all blowing In a wind." Under
them,' crowds gathered â country' peo
ple, negroes and townfolk â while the
town band stood waiting at the gate of
the park. The Legion was making
ready to leave for Chickamauga, and
"The 'Governor* told me," he said,
"you couldn't do anything in this regi
ment that would do you more good
with officers and men. That fellow has
caused us more trouble than any
other ten men in the regiment, and you
are the first man yet to get the best of
him. If the men could elect you, you'd
be a lieutenant before to-morrow
night."
Crittenden laughed.
"It was disgusting, but I didn't Â¦Â«â¢
any other way out of it."
Tattoo was sounded.
"Are you sure you can get into the
army &: any time?"
"Easyâ as a private."
"What regiment?"
"Rough Riders or regulars."
"All right, then, I'll go to Kentucky
for you."
"You let that boy alone,"'he said, in
a low voice, and then aloud and calm
ly:
"I don't like thi?. but it's in defer
ence to your customs, f I don't call
names, and I allow nobody to call me
names; and if I have another flght."
Reynolds was listening no#l "it won't
be with my fists."
"Well, Mister Man from Kentucky."
said Abe. "I'd a damn sight ruther
you'd use a club on me than fists; but
there's others of us who don't call
names, and ain't called names: and
some of us ain't easy skeered, neither."
"I wasn't threatening," said Critten
den. quickly, "but I. have heard a good
deal of that sort* of thins flying
around, and I don't want to get into
this sort of a thing, again." He looked
steadily at the soldier, but the eye of
Abraham Long quailed not. at all. In
stead, a smile broke over his face.
"I got a drink waitin' fer you." he
said; and Crittenden laughed.
"Git up an' shake hands. Jim." said
Abe, sternly, to Crittenden's opponent,
"an' let's have a drink." Reynolds got
up slowly.
"You gimme a good llckin'." he said
to Crittenden. "Shake!"
Crittenden shook, and seconds and
principals started for Long's tent.
"Boys." he said to the others, Tm
sorry for ye. I ain't got but four
drinks â and â "the old sergeant was ap
proaching; "and one more for the Gov
ernor."
Rivers smiled broadly when he saw
Crittenden at noon.
maddening: taps on his nose made him
lose his head altogether In the sixth
round, and he senselessly, rushed at
Crittenden with lowered head, like a
sheep. - Crittenden Â¦ took him sidewisÂ»

slowly and quietly up the walk and
grow dim 1 ; heard her light, even step on
the gravel, up the. steps, across . the
porch, and through the doorway. Not
once did she look around. '
He was in his room now and at his
window, his face hard as stone when
his heart was parching for tears. It
was true, then. He was the brute he
feared he ;^was. He had killed his life,
and he had killed his loveâ beyond even
her power to recall. His soul, too. must,
be dead, and it were just as well that
his body die. And. . still bitter, still
shamed and hopeless, he stretched out
his arms to the south with a fierce
longing for the quick fateâ no matter
whatâ that was waiting for him there.

It was a . tropical holidayâ that 7 sail
down to Cubaâ a strange, huge: pleas
ure trip of steamships, sailing, in a
lordly column of three; at night, sailing
always, it seemed, in a harbor of bril
liant lights under multitudinous stars
and over thickly sown beds of tiny
phosphorescent stars that were blown
about like flowers in a wlrid-storm by
the frothing wake of the ships; by day,
through a brilliant sunlit sea, a cool
breeze â so cool that only at noon was
the heat tropicalâ and over- smooth
water, blue as sapphire. Music night
and morning, on each ship, 'and music
coming across the little waves at any
hour from the ships about. Porpoises
frisking at the bows and chasing each
other in a circle around the bow and
stern as though the transports sat mo
tionless; schools of flying fish with filmy
rainbow wings rising from one wave
and shimmering through the sunlight
to the foamy crest of anotherâsome
times hundreds of yards away. Beau
tiful clear sunsets of rose, gold-green
and crimson, with one big, pure, radiant
sta'r ever like a censer* over them ; every
night the stars more deeply arid thickly
sown and growing ever softer and more
brilliant as the boats neared the trop
ics; every day dawn rich with beauty
and richer for the .dewy memories of
the dawns that were left behind.
Now and then a litt\e torpedo-boat
would cut like a knife-blade through
the water on messenger service;, or a
gunboat would drop lightly down- from
the hill of the sea, along the top of
which it patrolled so vigilantly: and
ever on the horizon hung a battleship
that "looked like a great gray floating
cathedral. But nobody was looking for
a fightâ nobody thought the Spaniards
would flght â and so these were only
symbols of war; and even they seemed
merely playing the game.
It was Grafton said. Â» Far ahead went
the flagship with the huge commartder
in-chief and his staff, the gorgeous at
taches, and the artists and correspond
ents, with valets, orderlies, stenogra
phers and secretaries. Somewhere far
to the rear, one ship was filled with
newspaper men from stem to stern. But
wily Grafton was with Lav '.on and
Chaff ee, the only correspondent aboard
their transport. On the second day, as
he sat on the poop-deck, a negro boy
came up to him, grinning uneasily:
j "I seed you back In ole Kentuck,
suh." ;â¢â¢::Â¦
"You did? Well. I don't remember
seeing you. "What do you want?"
' "Captain says he gwine to throw me (

"What for?"
"I ain't got no business here, suh."
"Then what are you here for?"
"Lookin''-fpr ole cap'n, : suh."

"Until lately," she was saying, and
she was not saying at all what she
meant to say; but here lately a change
was taking place; something had come
into her feelings for him that was new
and strange â she could not understand
â perhaps it had always been there;
perhaps she was merely becoming con
scious of It. And when she thought, as
she had been thinking all day, of his
long years of devotion â how badly she
had rectuited them â it seemed that the
least she could do" was to tell him that
he was now first In her life of all menâ
that much she could say; and perhaps
he had always been, she did not know;
perhaps, now that, the half-gods were
gone, it was at last the coming of ther
the . She was deeply agitated now;
her voice was trembljng; she faltered,
and she turned suddenly, sharply, and
with a little catch in her breath, her
lips and eyes opening slowlyâ her, first
consciousness, perhaps, a wonder at his
strange silence â and dazed by her own
feeling and flushing painfully, she
looked at him for the first time since
she began to talk, and she saw' him
staring,flxedly at her with a half-agon
ized look, as though he were speechless
ly trying to stop j her, his face white,
bitter, shamed, helpless. Not a word
more dropped from her lipsâ not a
sound. She was moved; it seemed that
she was about to fall, and Crittenden
started toward her, but ; she drew her
self erect, and as she turnedâ lif ting her
head proudlyâ the moonlight showed
that her throat was drawnâ nothing
more. Motionless and speechless, Crit-
"It is all very strange," she said, as
though she were talking to herself, and
she rose and walked into the warm,
fragrant night, and down the path to
the stiles, Crittenden silently following.
The night was breathless and ..the
moon-lit woods had the still beautyof
a dream; and Judith -went on speaking
of herself as she had never doneâ of the
man whose name she' had never men
tioned, aritl whose name Crittenden had
never asked. Until that night he had
not known even whether/the man were
still alive or dead. She '/had
that was loveâuntil lately ihe'ihad
never questioned but . thatiwHen-that
was gone from her heart, 1 all was gone
that would ever be possible for her to
know. That was why. she had told
Crittenden to conquer his love for her.
And now she was beginning to doubt
and to wonderâ ever since she came
hack and heard him at the old audito
rium â and why and whence the change
now? That puzzled her. One thing
was curiousâ through it all, as far back
as she could remember, her feeling for
him had never changed, except lately.
Perhaps it was an unconscious response
In her to the nobler change that in
spite of his new hardness her instinct
told her was at work in him.
She was leaning on the fence how,
her elbow on the top. plank, her hand
under her chin, and her face uplifted â
the moon lighting her hair, her face
and eyes, and her voice the voice of one
slowly threading the mazes of a half
forgotten dream. Crittenden's own
face grew .tense as he watched her.
There was a tone in her voice that he
had hungered for all his- life; that he
had never heard but in his Imaginings
and in his dreams; that he had heard
sounding in the ears of another and
sounding at the same time the death
knell of the one hone that until now
had made effort worth while. All
evening she had played about his
spirit as a wistful, changeful light will
play over the fields when the moon, is
bright and clouds run swiftly. She
turned on him like a flame now.
She turned suddenly upon Him.
"Yesâ something has happened to
you. I didn't know what you meant
that day we drove home, but I do now."
I feel it but I don't understand."..
Crittenden flushed, but made no an
swer.
"You could not have spoken to me in
the old days as you do now. Your in
stinct would have heldVou back. And
something has happened to me." Then
she began talking to him as frankly
and simply as a child to a child. ' It
was foolish and selfish, but it had hurt
her when he told her that he no longer
had his old feeling for her. It was self
ish and cruel it seemed, and was â but
she had felt hurt. Perhaps that was
vanity, wh5ch was net to her credit â
but that, too, she could not help. It
had hurt her every time he had said
anything from which she could infer
that her influence over him was less
than it once wasâ although, as a rule,
she did not like to have influence
over people. Maybe he wounded her as
his friend in this way, and, perhaps,
there was a- little vanity in this, too â
but a curious change was taken place
in their relations. Once he was always
trying to please her, and in those days
she would have made him suffer if he
had spoken to her then as he had late
ly â but he would not have spoken that
way then. And now she wondered why
she was not anÂ«ry instead of being
hurt. And she wondered why she did
not like him less. Somehow, it seemed
quite fair that she shquld be the one
to suffer now, and Bhe was glad to
take her share â she had caused him and
others so much pain.
"He" â not e'ven now did she mention
his nameâ "wrote to me again, not long
ago, asking to see. me again. It . was
impossible. And it was the thought of
you that made me know how impos-,
slble it wasâ you." The girl laughed,
almost hardly, but she was thinking of
herself when she did â not of him.
The time and circumstance that
make woman the thing apart , in. a
man's life must come sooner or later
to all women, and women must -yield;
she knew that, but she had never
thought they could come to herâ but
they had come, and she, too, must give
way.
count of yourself* -I never knew > a
man of your name, who didn't."
"Thank you, sir.". ..
. There was a long silence.
"Basil will hardly have time ; to get
his commission arid get to Tampa."
"No. But he can come after us." -
Why not.
She felt a sudden warmth in her
cheeks, her lips parted, and as she
turned from the sunset her eyes had all
its deep tender light.
> Dusk was falling, and already Rain
crow and Crittenden were jogging
along toward her at that hourâ the last
trip for either for many a dayâ the last
for either in life, maybe â for Rain
crow, too, like his master, was going to
war â while Bob, at home, forbidden by
hi3 young captain to follow him ; to
Chlckamauga, trailed after Crittenden
about the place with the appealing look
of a dog â enraged now and then by the
taunts of the sharp-tongued Molly, who
had the little confidence in.the courage
of her fellows that mark her race.
Judith was waiting for him on the
porch, and Crittenden saw her from
afar. . T Â¦;''.*,;.'"
She was dressed for the evening in
pure white â delicate, filmy â showing
her round, white throat and round,
white wrists. Her eyes were sofb and
welcoming and full of light: her man
ner was playful to the point of co
quetry; and in sharp contrast, now and
then, her face was intense with thought.
A faint, pink light was still diffused
from the afterglow, and she took him
down into her mother's garden, which
was old-fashioned and had grass walks
running down through it â bordered
with pink beds and hedges of rose
bushes.jAnd they passed under a shad
owed grape arbor and past a dead lo
cust treef which a vine had made Into
a green tower of waving tendrils, and
from which came the fragrant breath
of wild grape, and back again to the
gate, where Judith reached down for an
old-fashioned pink and pinned if in his
buttonhole, talking with low. friendly
affection, meanwhile, and turning
backward the leaves of the past rap
idly.
Did hÂ« remember thisâ and thatâ and
that ? Memories â memories â memories.
Was there anything she had let go un
forgotten? And then, as they ap-,
proached the porch in answer to a sum
mons to supper, brought out by a little
negro girl, she said:
"You haven't told me what regiment
you are going with."
"I don't know."
Judith's eyes brightened. "I'm so
glad you have a commission.".
have no commission."
Judith looked puzzled." 1 "Why, your
mother "
"Yes, but I gave it to Basil." And he
explained in detail. He had asked Gen
eral Carter to give the commission to
Basil, and the general had said he
would gladly. And that morning the
colonel of the Legion had promised to
recommend Basil for the exchange.
This was one reason why he had come
back to the bluegrass. Judith's face
was growing more thoughtful while he
spoke, and a proud light was rising in
her eves.
"And are you coing as "
"As a private."'
"With the Rough Riders?"
"As a regularâ a plain, common sol
dier, with plain, common soldiers. I am
trying to.be an American now â not a
Southerner. I've been drilling at Tam-
and Chickamauga with the regu
lars."
"You are much interested?"
"More than in anything for years."
She had seen this and she had re
sented it, foolishly, she knew, and with
out reason â but. still, she resented it.
"Think of it," Crittenden went on.
"It Is the first time in my life, almost.
I have known what It was to wish to
do somethingâ to have a purpose â that
was not inspired by you." It was an
unconscious and rather ungracious
declaration of Independenceâ it was un
necessaryâand Judith was surprised,
Crittenden pulled a telegram from his
pocket.
"To-morrow morning. I got this just
as I was leaving town."
"To-morrow!"
"It means life or death to me â this
telegram. And if it doesn't mean life,
I don't care for the other. I shall come
out with a commission orâ not at all. If
dead. I shall be a heroâ if alive," he
smiled. "I don't know what I'll be, but
think of me as a hero, dead or alive,
with my past and my present. I can
feel a change already, a sort of, grow
ing pain, at the very thought." x
"When do you go to Cuba?"
"Within four days."
"Four days! And you can talk as you
do, when you are going to war to live
the life of a common soldierâ to die of ;
fever, to be killed, maybe," . her lip
shook .and she stopped, but she went on
thickly, "and to be thrown into an un
known grave or lie unburled in a jun
gle." She spoke with such sudden pas
sion that Crittenden was startled.
"Listen."
Judge Page appeared in the doorway,
welcoming Crittenden with old-time
grace and courtesy. Through supper,
Judith was silent and thoughtful and,
when she did talk, it was with a per
ceptible effort. There was a light In
her eves that he would have under
stood once â that would have put hi3
heart on fire. And once he met a look
that he was wholly at a loss to under- j
stand. ' After supper, she disappeared
while the two men smoked oil , the
porch. The mon was rising when she
came out again. The breath of honey
suckles was heavy on the air, and from
garden and fields floated Innumerable
odors of flowers and clover blossoms
and moist grasses. Crittenden lived
often through that scene afterwardâ
Judith on the highest step of the porch,

dress and her tightly folded hands:

her eyes glowed with a fire in them
that he had never seen before.
Judge Page rose soon to go indoors.
He did not believe there was going to
be much of a war, and his manner was
almost cheery when he bade the young
man good-by. %
"Good luck to you," he said. "If the
chance comes, you will give a good ac-
And so. durine her drive home, she
had thought all the way of him and of
herself since both were childrenâ of his
love and his long faithfulness, and of
ner _ herâ what? Yes she had been
something of a coquetteâ she hadâ she
had: but men had bothered and wor
ried her, and, usually, she couldn't help
acting as she had. She was bo sorry
for them ail that she had really tried
to like them alL She had succeeded but
once â and even that was a mistake.
But she remembered one thing; through
it allâ far back as it all wasâ she had
never trifled with Crittenden. Before
him she had dropped foils and mask
and stood frankly face to face always.
There was something In him that had
always forced that. And he had loyed
her throuch it all. and he had suffered
âhow much, it had really never oc
curred to her until she thought of a
sudden that he must have been hurt as
had sheâ hurt more; for what had been
only infatuation with her had been gen
uine passion In him; and the months of
her unhappiness scarcely matched the
years of his. There was none other in
her life now but him, and. somehow,
she was beginning to feel there never'
Â¦mould be. If there were only any way
that she could make amends.
Never had she thought with such- ten
derness of him. How strong and brave
he was; how high-minded and faithful.
And he was good, in spite of all that
foolish talk about himself. And all
her life he had loved her, and he had
suffered." She could see that he was
still unhappy. If. then, there was no
other, and if, when he came back from
the warâ why not?
How every detail of earth and sky
was seared deep into the memory of the
vromen left behind that afternoon â as
each drove slowly homeward; for God
help the women in days of war! The
very peace of heaven lay upon the
earth. It sank from the low, moveless
clouds in the windless sky to the sunlit
trees in the windless woods, as still as
the long shadows under them. It lay
over the still seas of bluegrass â dap
pled In woodland, sunlit in open pas
ture â resting on low hills like a soft
cloud of bluish gray, clinging closely to
every line of every peaceful slope.
Stillness everywhere. Still cattle brows
ing in the distance; sheep asleep In the
far shade of a cliff, shadowing the still
stream; even the song of birds distant,
faint, restfuL Peace everywhere, but
little peace in the heart of the mother
to whose lips was raised once more the
self-same cup that she had drained so
long ago. Peace everywhere but for
Phyllis climbing the stairs to her room
and flinging herself upon her bed in a
racking passion of tears. God help the
women in the days of war! Peace from
the dome of heaven to the heart of
earth, but a gnawing unrest for Judith,
who walked very slowly down the
traveled walk to the stiles, and sat
looking over the quiet fields. Only in
her eves was 'the light not wholly of
sadness, but a proud light of sacrifice
and high resolve. Crittenden was corn
in? that night. He was going for good
now; he was coming to tell her good
by; and he must not goâ to his death,
maybe â without knowing what she had
to tell him. It was not muchâ it was
very little, in return for his life-long
devotionâ that she should at least tell
him how she had wholly outgrown her
girlish infatuationâ she knew now that
it was nothing else â for the one man
who had stood In her life before him,
and that now there was no other
lover or friendâ for whom she had the
genuine affection that she would always
have for him. She would tell him
franklyâ she was a grown woman now
â because she thought she owed that
much to himâ because, under the cir
cumstances, she thought It was her
duty; and he would not misunderstand
her, even if he really did not have
quite the old feeling for her. Then, re
calling what he had 1 said on the drive,
she laughed softly. It was preposter
ous. She understood all that He had
acted that little part so many times in
by-gone years. And she had always
pretended to take him seriously, for she
Â¦would have eiven him mortal offense
had she not; and she was pretending to
take him seriously now. And, anyhow,
â¢what could he misunderstand? There
was nothing to misunderstand.
the town had made ready to speed its
going.
Out of the shady woodland, and into
the bright sunlight, the young soldiers
came â to the music of stirring^hcrn and
drumâ legs swinging rhythmically,
chins well set in, eyes to the front â
wheeling into the main street in perfect
form â their guns a moving forest of
glinting steel â colonel and staff su
perbly mounted â every heart beating
proudly against every blue blouse, and
sworn to give up its blood for the flag
waving over themâ the flag the fathers
of many had so bitterly fought five and
thirty years before. Down the street
went the flash and glitter and steady
tramp of the solid columns, through
waving flags and handkerchiefs and
mad cheerE â cheers that rose before
them, swelled away on either side and
sank out of hearing behind them as
they marched â through faces bravely
smiling, when the eyes were full of
tears; faces tense with love, anxiety,
fear; faces sad with bitter memories of
the oM war. On the end of the first
rank was the boy Basil, file-leader of
hfs squad, swinging proudly, his hand
some face serious and fixed, his eyes
turnir.g to right nor left â seeing not his
mother, proud, white, tearless; nor
Crittenden, with a lump of love in his
throat; nor even Phyllis^â her pride in
her soldier-boy swept suddenly out of
her aching heart, her eyes brimming,
and her handkerchief at her mouth to
keep back the sob that surged at her
lil.s. The station at last, and then
cheers and kisses and sobs, and tears
ar.d cheers again, and a waf'ing of
hands and flags and handkerchiefsâ a
column of smoke puffing on and on to
ward, the horizonâ the vanishing per
spective of a rear platform filled with
jolly, reckless, waving, yelling soldiers,
and the. tragedy of the parting was
over.
"Bunkie," said Blackford, 4o a dare
devil like himself, "welcome to the
Spanish bullet that knocks for entrance
here"â tapping his heart. Basil struck
the cup from his hand, and Blackford
swore, laughed and put his arm around
the boy. ""
morous mouth, there was a kindly
look in his blue eye that pleased Crit
tenden mishtily. As for the old ser
geant, he could never forget that the
soldier was a Crittenden-7-one of his
revered Crittendens. And, while he
was particularly stern with him in the
presence of his comrades, for fear that
he might be betrayed into showing^par
tiality â he was always drifting around
to eivo him a tvord of advice and to
shake his head over the step that Crit
tenden had taken.
Â» That step had done him good In body
and soul. It had made him lean and
tanned; It sharpened and strengthened
his profile: it cleared his eya and set
tled his lips even more firmly. Tobac
j:o and liquor were scarce, and from
disuse he got a new sensation of men
tal clearness and physical cleanliness
that was comforting and invigorating,
and helped bring back the freshness of
his boyhood.
For the first time in many years, his
days were full of work and, asleep,
awake, or at work, his hours were
clocklike and steadied him into ma
chine-like regularity. It was work of
his hands, to be sure, and not even
high work of that kind, but still it
was work. And the measure of the
self-respect that this fact alone brought
him was worth It all. Already his mind
was taking character from -his body.
He was distinctly less morbid and he
found himself thinking during those
long days of the sail of what he s!>ould
do after the war was over. His de
sire to get killed was gone, and !t was
slowly being forced on him that he had
been priggish, pompous, self-r.bsorbed,
hair-splitting, lazy, good-for-nothing,
when there was no need for him to
be other than what he meant to be
when he got back. And as for Judith,
he felt the bitterness of gall for him
self when he thought of her, and he
never allowed himself to think of her
except to absolve her. as he knew she
would not absolve herself, and to curse
himself heartily and bitterly. He un
derstood now. It was just her thought
of his faithfulness, her feeling of re
sponsibility for hlm-^the thought that
she had not been as kind to him as
she might have been (and she had al
ways been kinder than he deserved)â
all this had loosed her tears and her
self-control and had thrown her into
a mood of reckless self-sacrifice.' And
when she looked up into hl3 face that
night of the parting He felt her look
ing into his soul and seeing his shame
that he had lost his love because he
had lost himself, and she was quite
right to turn from him, as she did.
without another word. Already, how
ever he was healthy enough to believe
that' he was not quite so hopeless as
she must think himâ not as hopeless
as he had thought himself. Life now.
with even a soldier's work, was far
from being as worthless as life
with a gentleman's idleness had
been He was honest enough to
take no credit for the clean change in
his lifeâ no other life was passible; but
he was teaming the practical value and
mental comfort of straight living as
he had never learned them before.
And he was not so prone to meta
physics and morbid self-examination
a 3 he once was. and he shook off a
mood of that kind when it cameâim
patientlyâas he shook it off now. He
was a soldier now, and his province
was action and no more thought than
his superiors allowed him. And, stand
ing thus, at sunrise, on the plunging
bow of the ship, with his eager, sensi
tive face splitting the swift windâ he
might have stood to any thoughtful
American who knew his character and
his history as a national hope and a
.national danger. The nation, meas
ured by Its Bwift leap into maturity,
its striking power to keep going at the
same swift pace, was about his age.
South, North and West it had lived,
or was living his life. It had his faults
and his virtues; like him. It was high
eplrited, high-minded, alert, active,
manly, generous, and with it, as with
him. the bad, was circumstantial,
trivial. Incipient: the good was bred In
the Saxon bone and lasting as rock.
There was little perceptible change in
the American officer and soldier, now
tha.t the work was about actually" to
begin. Allttle more soberness was ap
parent. Every one was still simple, na
tural, matter-of-fact. But that night,
doubtless, each man dreamed his
dream. The West Point stripling: saw
in his empty shoulder-straps a single
bar, as the man above him saw two
tiny bars where he had been proud of
one. The captain led a battalion, the
major charged at the head of a thou
sand strong; the colonel plucked a star
and the brigadier heard the tramp of
hosts behind him. And who knows
how many bold spirits leaped at once,
that night from acorns to stars; and
if there were not more than one who
saw himself the war-god of the an
xious nation behindâ saw, maybe, even
the doors of the White House swing
open at the conquering sound of his
coming feet. And, through the dreams
of all waved aimlessly the mighty wand
of the blind masterâ fateâ giving death
to a passion for glory here; disappoint
ment bitter as death to a noble ambi
tion there; and there giving unsought
fame where was Indifference to death;
and, then, to lend substance to the
phantom of Just deserts, giving a mor
tal here and there the exact fulfillment
of his dream.
Two toasts were drunk, that night
one by the men who were to lead the
Rough Riders of the West.
"May the war last till each man
meets death, wears a wound, or wins
himself better spurs."

With the men, Crittenden was popu
lar, for he did his work thoroughly,
asked no favors, shirked no, duties.
There were several officers* sons among
them working for commissions, - and,
naturally, he drifted to them, and he
found them all good fellows. Of Black
ford, he was rather wary, after Rivers'
short history of him. but as he was
friendly, unselfish, had a high sense of
personal honor, and 'a peculiar rever
ence lor women, Crittenden asked no
further questions, and was sorry, when
he came back to Tampa, to find him
gone with the Rough . Riders. "With
Reynolds, he was particularly popular,
and he never knew that the story of
the Tampa fight had gone to all the'
line officers of the regiment, and that
nearly every one of them knew him by
sight and knew his history. Only once
from an officer, however, and steadily
always from the old sergeant, could he
feel that he was regarded in a different
light from the humblest soldier in the
ranksâ which is lust what he would
have asked. The colonel had cast an
envious eye on Raincrow at Tampa,
and. straightway, he had taken the lib
erty of getting the sergeant to take the
horse to the colonel's tent with the re
quest that he use him throughout the
campaign. The horse came back with
the colonel's thanks: but, when the or
der came that the cavalry was to go
unmounted, the colonel sent word that
he would take the horse now, as the
soldier could not use him. So Rain
crow was aboard the ship, and the old
cc-lohel, coming down to look at the
horse one day. found Crittenden feed
ing him." and thanked him and asked
him how he was getting along: and,
while there was a smile about, his hu-
It was hard for him to believe that he
really was going to war, even now, when
the long sail was near an end and the
ships were running fearlessly along the
big, grim coast . mountains of Cuba,
with bands playing and colors to the
breeze; hard to realize that he was not
to land in peace and safety and, in
peace and safety, go back as he came;
that a little farther down those gashed
mountains, showing ever clearer
through the mist, were men with whom
the culet officers and men around him
would soon be in a death grapplel The
thought stirred him, and he looked
around at the big, strong, fellowsâin
telligent, orderly, obedient, good na
tured and patient; patient, restless
and sick as they were from the dread
ful hencoop life they had led for so
many daysâ patient beyond words. He
had risen early that morning. The
rose light over the eastern water was
whitening, and all faces gray in the
coming dawn and their attitudes sug
gesting ghastly premonitionsâpremo
nitions that would come' true fast
enough for some of the poor fellows â
perhaps for him. Stepping between
between and over the prostrate bodies,
he made his way forward and leaned
over the prow, with his. hat In his hand
and his hair blowing back from his
forehead.
Already his face had Â¦ suffered a
change. For more than three weeks
he had been merely a plain man among
plain men. .At once when he became

tate as completely as though in the
process he had been wholly merged in
to some, other man. The officers, at
whose table he had once sat, answered
his salute precisely as they answered
any soldier's. He had seen Rivers but
seldomâ but once only on the old foot
ing, and that was on the night he went
on board, when Rivers came to tell him
good-by and jj to bitterly bemoan the
luck that, as was his fear from the be

"Bob, suhâ Bob Crittenden." . ' â¢
"Crittenden." repeated Grafton, smil
ing. "Oh, yes, I know him; I should
say so! So he^s a captain?"
"Yes, suh," said Bob, not quite sure
whether he was lying or not.
Grafton snoke to an 'officer, and was
allowed to take Bob for his own ser
vant, though the officer said he did
not remember any captain of that name
in the â th. To the newspaper .man,
Bob 'was a godsend: for humor was
scarce on board and "jollying" Bob was
a welcome diversion. He learned many
things of Crictenden and the* Critten
dens, and what great people they had
always been and still were; but at a
certain pbint Bob was evasive or
dumbâ and the correspondent respected
the servant's delicacy about family af
fairs and went no further along that
line â he had no curiosity, and was
questioning idly and for fun, but
treated Bob kindly and, in return, the
fat of the ship, through Bob's keen eye
and quick hand, was his, therafter,
from day to day.
Grafton was not storing up much ma
terial for use; but he would have been
much surprised if he could have looked
straight across' to the deck of the ship
running parallel to his and have seen
the dignified "young statesman whom
he had heard speak at the recruiting
camp in Kentucky; who made him
think of Henry Clay; whom he had seen

camp in the smartest turn-out he had
seen South â had seen him now as Pri
vate Crittenden. with his fast friend,
'Abe Long, and passing in his company
because of. his bearing under a sobri
quet, donated by his late enemy, Rey
nolds, as "Old Hamlet of Kentucky."
And Crittenden would have been sur
prised had he known that the active
darky whom he saw carrying coffee
and shoes to a certain stateroom was
none other than Bob waiting on Graf
ton, and that the Rough Rider. whom
he saw scribbling on a pad in the rig
ging of the Yucatan was none other
than Basil writing one of his bulletins

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CAL11
3(Copyright, 1903, by W. W. Hines.)
rv~^ "^"Ti3 *^ LETTICE was
I irlncX&PaYSt the mind of Donald
hearted gentleman
nÂ£a!j&tyX:iKffl a * ea fourteen, that
|>~^Â£anr~MTTYy<{J this fit of tears had
! Â»' - to do with the vis
itor who had Just left her.. There
fore, It was befitting- that this
visitor should return and make
prompt apology to Miss Lettlce
for anything in his words or actions
which might have caused tears. Zt
seemed to Donald that It. was both his
peculiar duty and much-to-be-valued
privilege to bring back this visitor and
see that the apology was made, even if
It should be necessary to resort to force
to accomplish the desired end.
There would be odds against him, he
reflected, as he* thought of the strang
er's broad shoulders and athletic ap
pearance, but odds in battle were not
to be considered by en Ordway, nor
was it well that one of the family
should contemplate the bare possibil
ity of defeat in any warlike undertak
ing. Of course, defeat was possible,
but one could and did put It out of his
mind In coins Into battla.
Therefore Donald set out hastily
along the oak arched driveway which
led to the big gate. It was his calcu
lation that be would be able to over
take the late visitor Just outside the
boundary of the Orflway demesne, and
this cheered him, for It would not do
to attack a guest within your gates.
Once outside the gates, the duties of
hospitality do not shield the offender.
This was in the code of Donald's blue
grass country, and was not to be ques
tioned by one who was raised upon
the lessons furnished by that code.
And Just beyond the big gates he did
overtake the visitor, who was walking
along the roadside towards the sta
tion, slashing angrily at weeds with his
cane. Donald had not figured on the
cane, and wished that he had thought
to provide himself with a weapon of
some sort But there was no time to
hesitate, and he made haste to put him
self alongside his adversary-to-be.
"Pardon me, sir," said Donald, "for
Interrupting you." The whole proced
ure must be carried through with per
fect politeness. Rudeness, even to an
enemy, was never justifiableâ Donald
recollected having heard his father
often say that.
The man with the cane came to a
stop.
"Well, what Is It, young man?" he
said, somewhat brusquely. This
brusqueness was very ungentlemanly,
thought Donald, but the man was a
Northerner, and this, in Donald's eyes,
pleaded that he knew no better.
"You are Mr, Douglass?" He had
seen the card on the tray in the hall.
"Yes,- what "of ft?" this brusquely as
before. Then, "Did Miss Mason send
you after me?" with * trace of eager
ness In his voice,
"Certainly not, sir/' said Donald, with
dignity, "I have come on my; own ac
count, sir." Zt was not in the code that
ons should drag the name of a woman
in the quarrels of men.
"Well, what do you want?" The
bruEqueneis was t gain quit* trident
"It will be necessary for you, sir, to
apologize to my cousin, Miss Lettlce
Mason." â¢
"Apologize to Miss Mason!" â¢
"You have heard me correctly, sir."
Donald was greatly rejoiced at the firm
dignity of his own tones. He felt that
he was carrying through. his part In the
affair In a way which would have, won
the sincere commendation of his father
and even of his grandfather, who had
been the most famous duelist of his
day and State.
"But, young man, I don't owe Miss
Mason any apology." %
"That, sir, is a question which you
must permit me to decide. Miss Mason
Is, as I have said, my cousin. We Ord
ways" â there was a quiver of oride in
the way which Donald pronounced the
nameâ "are not accustomed to receive
instructions from outsiders upon mat
ters of etiquette."
"What makes you think I owe Miss
Mason an apology?"
"Is it not enough, sir, for you. to
know that I deem an apology neces
sary?" .Â»
Now his prospective antagonist threw
back his head and laughed, loud, and
long. Donald waited patiently until
the fit of- laughter had passedâ it was
merely another item to 6e added to
Mr. Douglass' count of rudeness. There
had been nothing In the Ordway': blood
or the Ordway upbringing to teach this
fourteen-year-old . descendant of the
Cavaliers that there!; was anything
ridiculous in bis demanding, without
condescending to explain, an apology
from a bearded man of thirty.
"No," said Mr. Douglass, still half
choked with laughter. 'It Is not enough
for ma to know that yon consider an
be well to explain. J^ftr -.',
"Miss Mason, my cousin, upon whom
you called a few. minutes ago, went to
her rooms in tears as you left. I nat
urally take It for granted that you said
something to offend her.**
"In tears! Something to offend her!
Are you quite sure about the tears, my
boy?" There was eagerness In the
questioner's tones. '
"Certainly. I am sure."
"Then come with me and watch me
apologize."
And Donald's rather short legs found
much difficulty In keeping pace with
the longer ones of Mr. Douglass. In
fact, Mr. Douglass reached the house a
good five minutes before Donald came
up, puffing and blowing. He could not
understand why his cousin should be
standing there in the doorway with her
head on Mr. Douglass' shoulders and
crying at the same time. He pushed
forward fiercely.
"Oh, Donald, Donald, dear." said
Miss Lettlce, smiling almost happily
through a mist of tears. Donald went
forward more Blowly, confronting
something now which he did not pre
tend to understand. x
"I've apologized, Donald," said Mr.
Douglass. .
It was not to be expected that Don
ald, at the age of fourteen, should have
arrived at an understanding of woman
nature sufficient to comprehend that
Miss Lettlce had rejected Mr. Doug
lass, and' that the tears which she shed
were tears of regret at her own action.
Nor did he understand exactly the part
he had himself played in bringing back
the man who had been rejectedâbring
ing him back to be accepted.
But,, despite the fact that, he was
only fourteen, Donald was the best
man at the wedding.
apology necessary. 1 must catch my
train and will bid you good afternoon."
With this he turned and would have
walked forward, but i that Donald laid
a detaining hand on his arm. .
"Then you must fight me, sir."
"Now look here, you young savage,
why don't you pick out a man of your
size instead of trying to pick a quarrel
with a little fellow like myself?" Evi
dently Mr. Douglass was inclined to
consider the whole affair a joke, for he
threw up his arms In a position of de
fense which Donald could readily see
was burlesqued.
All that could be demanded of even
the Ordway courtesy was passed and,
the limit reached, Donald struck with
all his might at the head of his antago
nist. But the antagonist would not
fight fairly. He simply grasped both
of Donald's small . hands, in his own
big palms, held them fast and when
the upholder of the Ordway name at
tempted to kick he found himself ly
ing flat on his back.
"Now, youngster, come down off
your high horse a bit and tell me what
Is the matter with you."
Searching his memory for some pre
cedent of his own Donald
found nono. His ancestors had, some
of them, been imprisoned for uphold
ing what they believed to be their right
or. their honor, but none, so far as
Donald knew, had ever been so ig
nomlniously treated as himself. The
big tears welled up to, his eyes and
were prevented from overflowing only
by pride. 'His opponent caught. sight
of the tears and at onee released him.
Thie was putting Donald on honor not
to renew hostilities without due warn
ing. He drew himself up with all the
remains of dignity which he could
command.
"You have the better of me. sir. In
the matter of strength. But rest as
sured that I shall not permit the mat
ter to drop.. You will hear from me
again, sir."
"Now; youngster, tell me what Is the
matter. . If I . owe an apology you can
bet I will make it at once." I

Many parents who -are disposed to
give a regular, allowance to their chil
dren have not done bo for the reason
that they cannot decide what would be
a proper amount to give them. This is
a question which parents must decide
for themselves. However, It should not
be forgotten that, other things being
equal, the smaller the amount the bet
ter for the child. Too many children
have been trained by their parents to
become spendthrifts long before they
have left the parental roof. The chil
dren of some parents will need more
than the children of others. Five cents
each week will seem more to some chil
dren* than would five dollars to others.
In most cases the first mentioned
amount would be far better than the
larger amount; however, the age and
the proper demands upon the child and
other considerations must determine
the amount to be allowed. *
While many would change the nlan
to suit their own Ideas. It is believed
that some such plan as the one men
tioned might well be adopted by the
majority of the parents.
"Miss Woodford" â Jack looked at
her with mock reproachâ"I am pained
that you should thus undervalue my
yachtamanshlp. Nothing but patriotic
feeling prevented my offering my ex
pert services to Sir Thoraaa for Sham
rock III. Step on board the Widgeon,
ladies, and fear nothing."
But fear entered Gertrude's heart
more than once when they had left the
little harbor and she noted the darken
ing horizon.
Mrs. Armitage was sitting near
Garst, beautiful in her soft white flan
nel yachting suit. After half an hour's
Bailing Gertrude crossed to where
Jack Clifford sat at the helm, thus
bringing herself on Garst'a other side.
"Do put back," she whispered to
Clifford. "We are going to have a
squall, and a bad one."
After a critical glanca at the sky
Jack put the boat's head around. But
even as he did so a cold blast, which
was as the foreboding of coming ill,
shivered over them. Gertrude drew her
breath hard. She alone knew what the
wind would be when It struck them.
Suddenly, as IX she had received a
mortal blow, the Widgeon went over
over until her mainsail lay almost level
on the water. With a horrible hungry,
suggestive hisa the sea rose over the
combings of the hatchway.
Too terrified to scream, the Â¦nnmÂ»
held their breath, clinging for dear life
to whatever they could hold on by.
Mrs. Armitage flung herself oa Oarsfs
shoulder.
"Stephen! Save me!"
But In that moment when death
seemed upon them he was not even
aware of her presence. His arm want
around* the girl at his side and drew
her close, his llpa brushing her cheek,
while her damp hair blew against hia
face. Gertrude scarcely cared whether
It was life or death.
Then she suddenly wrenched herself
free and flung her weight upon the til
ler, putting it hard to port, for Jack's
amateur skill seemed to have deserted
him. The Widgeon came round, shud
dering 1. Into the wind, and lay ICee a
frightened thing with flapping Balls
while the squall raced by.
"I think we owe our lives to you.
Miss Woodford." One of the woman
from the Ocean View approached Ger
trude when they were safely landed on
the wharf, but Garst drew her aside.
"Sweetheart!" His voice vibrated as
he bent over her.
Mrs. Armitage turned to look after
them, lifting an end of her bedraggled
flannel skirt.

morning.
"You forget that I am a 'native.'
The summer people might object." she
said with a bitter Â¦ little smile, and
Garst set his heel Into the ground aa
he listened.
When they reached the wharf Ger
trude turned to Jack Clifford.
"Old Captain Lufkln la sick and
can't go, the boy tells me." she said
auickly. "I think we had better give
up the trip."
"The old nlan very considerately
'shuffled oft this mortal coil* two years
ago, leaving hef complete mistress of
his millions," Jack rambled on. "My
own opinion is that this alighting next
door to where she knew Stephen was
staying, in the subdued attractiveness
of second mourning. Is the beginning
of the end. You should have seen him
start when he saw her on the hotel
piazza to-night."
Gertrude rose quickly.
"How cold it is up here," she said.
with a rhiver. "Let us get back to the
house."
A group from the summer hotels and
cottages was standing near Mrs. Wood
ford's house, watching the sunset, when
they descended. Gertrude would have
passed on, but Jack Clifford detained
her. Unwilling as she was. she had' to
submit to an introduction to Mrs.
Armitage, Stephen Garst's former
fiancee. The latter turned to her at once
with a scrutinizing look. The girl was
too pretty not to be dangerous.
"It is beautiful here In these late
summer weeks," she drawled. * â¢
"I think it beautiful at all times. Tha
Cape is my home," Gertrude answered
quietly.
"Indeed! Then you ore aâ native.
I should hardly have thought it"
A 'faint color rose under the girl's
skin at the supercilious tone.
"Miss â¢ Woodf ord's forefathers settled
here over 200 years ago," Garst broke
In quietly. "I believe her ancestors for
six generations back are burled In the
little cemetery at Plum Cove. Not
many of us can go as far back as that."
Mrs. Armitage looked quickly from
Garst to the girl beyond him. But
Gertrude had left the group with her
head held high. She wanted none of
Garst's vindication of her family. She
had almost reached the house when be
overtook her.
"One moment,." he pleaded. "I want
so much to speak to you to-night."
"I am afraid I must auk you to ex
cuse me," she said icily.
Had Garst known that the cold, di
rect look which she sent Into hia eyes
was really the outcome of burning Jeal
ousy, he would not have turned away
with so heavy a heart.
Jack Clifford had hard work to per
suade her to accompany them on the
" 'For she is come, she is here,' as
Jean Ingelow says in 'The Letter L.' "
"Here?"
"Yes: at the Ocean View. I saw her
on the pin7za to-night as I came up
from the train. Handsorrfer than ever,
by Â¦Jove! Tall woman, with bronze
hair."
"Bronzed, you mean. I saw her ar
rive this morning," Gertrude said
coldly. /
"She tried to stuff it down Stephen's
throat that she was sacrificing herself
to save her father from financial ruin,
and I think he believed her," Jack went
on. "Then she attempted a platonic
correspondence with him after her
marriage, but he would have none of
it. All the same, I don't believe he has
ever, quite forgotten her. Anyway, he
could not do so now, even if he would."
â¢â¢What do you mean?"
"Well, I suppose it won't do any harm
to tell you," Jack hesitated, "though
we never speak of it when he is pres
ent. His leg was crushed in a railway
accident, trying to save the girl to
whom he was engaged."
"Did he save her?"
"Yes."
"Then why were they not married?"
\ "Oh, she threw him over for a man
twice his age and the trifling adjunct
of $3,000,000."
Gertrude Woodford drew her breath
sharply.
He was looking gravely into her eyes
and the color mounted to her temples.
"Stephen, the fish is getting cold," hls
cousin called impatiently, and Gertrude'
went quickly into the house.
In compliance with a previous prom
ise to Jack Clifford, she went with him
after supper to see the sunset from a
hill near by. When they were seated
on a bowlder, watching the vast sweep
of ocean and crimsoning sky, she
turned suddenly to her companion.
"Why is Mr. Garst lame?" she asked
gently.
in spite of the fact that he walked with
a slight limp.
"It Is heavenly here after even a day
in town," he said. "I have Just beten
thinking that the most marvelous
changes in our lives come when we
least expect them. I wonder if you
know what this summer has been to
me?"
"Who's trifling with my august ap- #
pellation," called a gay voice as a
young fellow sv.-ung himself on to the
piazza. "Miss Woodford, I don't know
which I shall devour first, you or the
peaches, I'm so ravenous." .
"I was Just going to say that your
appetite 5s i all right, anyhow," Mrs.
Woodward laughed. "Did your cousin
come down with you?" she added.
"Yes, Garst got as far as the ham
mock and collapsed."
"Go and call him, Gertrude. Supper
is ready," her mother said.'
The girl rose and went through the
hall. Inside the door she paused,
looking with darkening eyes at the man
who lay at full length in the hammock.
The slight clash of the screen as she
stepped outside caused him to turn. He
sprang up at once and came toward
her, showing a strong, clean-shaven
face and a figure singularly muscular

said, watching her daughter's pretty

Wooing "A Native"
â¢By M. Louise Cummins
The little schoolma'am bent forward
and gave the offending member a royal
slap with an oak ruler. Jules. howled
in pain, and Campbell rode en rejoicing.
It was a good commanding voice.
Campbell . waited. Jules stalked down
to the -desk, and was ordered to> crawl
beneath it In disgrace. A knothole of
fered golden opportunities, and Jule's
tongue wagged merrily through it to
an appreciative audience.
Campbell -stared at the new school
ma'am ; admiringly. More than that,
when her flock was safe inside he rode
leisurely up. to the open windows and
stared In them, not rudely but inter
estedly.
She looked absurdly young, perched
up. behind the rough plank desk. She
was fair. A bunch of purple wild flow
ers was fastened in ner hair. Jules
Chiboque fired a tattered hat at the
row of nails back of the teacher. â¢ It
fell short of the mark and struck the
bunch of purple flowers. Campbell's
leg was half cut of the saddle when
the girl called: s
"Jules, you come here."
ooys did him up one day when he called
Louis "a half-breed ignoramus." Louis
said he wouldn't be called any name
he didn't know the meaning of. The
risk was too great. So he did up the
teacher, and the key was turned in the
schoolhouse door.
He found out at the Arrow Head
Ranch that she was old Colby's niece;
and was boarding there. Also that she
was nineteen, from Chicago and her
name was Ethel Maude Colby. The
Colby did not affect him. but all the
way home from the ranch, and during
the weeks that followed, the name
of Ethel rang in his ears like a refrain
of half forgotten music.
Every day Campbell rode up the
river road and looked in the school
house window Just for a glimpse of
the pretty blonde head. One Satur
day night he started wildly for the Ar
row Head Ranch, and all the way home
Cyclone kept pace with his Joyous
whistling, for he had been introduced
to her, and she had blushed, and all the
world was full of promise. }
After that night Cyclone was rid
den at a breakneck speed every after
noon from Campbell's ranch down at
Five Forks, to the bend in the river
road, there to wait patiently and peace
fully until a certain ficrure in a trim
gray skirt and white shirt-waist rode
down the path from the schoolhouse
on a black pony,. and greeted him with
sky-eyed pleasure.
"Reckon Tom Campbell's shining up
to ye, Ethel." old Colby said gravely,
when the wooing was well advanced.
The girl laughed and bent lower over
her books at the kitchen table.
"It isn't anything. Uncle Ben."
The old ranchman glanced at her
keenly through the rifts of smoke from
his pipe.
"Aint it? Tom seems to think it is.
Got any objections to* him?"
Ethel laughed and shook her head. i
"He's just a cowboy," she said, and
Â¦J>vils Tower was to know discipline
at last.
"No. you mustn't. Wait till it lets
up a bit." He lifted her pearl handled
pen tenderly and curiously, as if it had
been a stray feather dropped from an
angel's wing. "That's a mighty pretty
thing, ain't it?" He met her eyes sud
denly. "Say. I -want to know If you
meant what you said yonder, about my
being a no account, rough and tumble
cowboy?" i
"I dldh't say that."
"But you meant it." Her lashes
drooped, guilty under his steady gaze.
"I don't blame you. I know I'm differ
ent from your city breed. But love
comÂ«s the same to a man whether he's
a professor or a cowboy, you know.
I'd make you mighty happy. Ethel. If
you'd let me." His voice was low and
tender. "Seems as If I don't want any
thing in life but you."
He bent nearer .over the narrow,
rtfughly painted desk, his eyes on a

foot-two blocking the kitchen door.
There was a look in his frank gray eyes
she had never, seen there, not of anger
or defeat, but simply determination.
The following day. long after the last
of thÂ« -children had gone, the school
ma'am still sat at her desk. It had
been raining all day. a wild, autumn
rain that came in fitful dashes against
the window panes, with now and then
the heavy crash* of thunder. The door
opened i suddenly with a bang, and
Campbell entered, dripping with rain
and smiling.
"I was just passing by." he began, as
if he had not raced his bronco for the
last five miles. "It's a bad storm, and
getting worse." â¢ i
"I must go, then." She rose hastily
and reached for her. hat on the row of
nails back of her desk.
He came over and leaned, on the
desk.
"I can't,". she answered over her
shoulder, as the pony shook herself
free. "The bridge is safe."
Before he could stop her she had rid
den forward on to the frail logs that
shuddered and strained at the shock.
There was a sudden rending, crushing
sound, and the next instant the logs
had parted and swept away on the
foaming waters with Gypsy's terrified
head and pawing hoofs showing be
tween them.
One cry for help reached Campbell's
ears, but that one changed Â»U the
world.
"Tom! Tom!" she called, and he
headed Cyclone down stream In a race
with the swollen, rushing river. As he
came abreast of her he raised himself
In his stirrups and swung hia lariat
straight for the pony's head. It fell
and drew taut. Cyclone braced for the
shock, as he had in many aVound-up
capture, and in a few seconds the black
pony was stumbling up the bank,
drenched and half-strangled, but with
her burden still safe in the saddle.
Campbell lifted the slim, fainting fig
ure down ajid held her close In his
arms, her white face on his shoulder.
For one brief Instant she seemed all hia
own, and he bent and kissed the pale,
sweet lips that had so nearly drained
the cup of death.
"Mine," he whispered beneath hia
breath. "Mine, Just for now."
Her eyes opened and she smiled up
at him.
"For always. Tom." she said softly*
"I'm glad you're a cowboy."
It was nearly two miles to the old
log bridge that spanned the river.
Campbell did not try to talk. He took
her silence and reserve as his answer,
but his face looked almost stern in the
shadow of his sombrero as he rode he
side the black pony. As they neared
the log bridge a vivid flash of lightning
made both horses rear, and he caught
Gypsy's bridle.
"We can't cress the river," he said.
"You'll have to turn back."

She had always hoped to go back some
day. but the spell of the open and the
glory of the freedom stole over her
with the lov/ music of his voice. Some
where in her heart she caught the echo
to his own words, and knew the power
of their meaning.

table and wrote rapidly:
"Dear Old Mac â You will find the ba

pretty good this morning. I have
taken some of your cartridges. I found
I didn't have quite enough of my own,

Yours, HENDERSON."
He folded the letter and placed. It
under Macdonald's cup. Then he took
the saddle to the stable, cinched It
tightly on the pony, took his rifle,
mounted, and rode away up the trail
which led directly Into the mountains.
An hour later Macdonald returned
with <flve rabbits swinging at his side.
He was whistling. In one hand was
his game and ln the other he carried
his rifle. When he reached the door
of the cabin he kicked it to attract
- Henderson's attention. "Open the
door, will you, old man?" he called.
There was no answer. Macdonald
put down his rifle and entered. "Prob
ably he's out at the stable," he thought
Then he saw the letter.
Macdonald sat down and stared
blankly before him. "Won't be back!"
he exclaimed. "Won't be back. What
In does all this mean?"
He went to the door and looked up
and down the trail from the stable.
There was no marks of a horse's feet
showing' on the frozen earth. Return
ing to the cabin he cooked his eggs
and bacon, ate hurriedly, and again
slinging his rifle over his arm he walked
rapidly in the direction of Alamosa.
Henderson rode all day. At night
he had come to the very crest of the
mountain where the trail descended
to the camp on the other side. It was
near Â« o'clock. A moon was rising
somewhere in the east, and Hender
son watched It eagerly. He took from
his saddlebag a can of meat and opened
It, eating ravenously. The pony
watched him. She whinnied, and called
his attention to the fact that she had
had nothing to eat since morning.
Henderson rose from the snow and
put her bridle rein back over the sad
dle and led her to the trail which led
back toward his cabin. "Go home, old
girl," he said, "but don't tell them
where you left me. This is as good
a place as any ln which to die. Go
home." â¢
The pony started down the trail.
Henderson took a cartridge from his
belt and fitted it Into his rifle. "I
wonder," he said,* "if they kill
quickly?"
He placed the butt of the trun
against a jagged rockâ the muzzle over
his heart Then he turned and looked
out over the east to the moon, which
was big and round and beautiful.
While he stood watching a soft, indla
rubber-like nose was pushed over his
shoulder, and the ugliest pony in all
the San Luis said as plainly as a horse
can say things that she was hungry
and wanted to go home. Henderson
dropped the rifle Into the snow. "We'll
give them one more chance, old lady.**
he said.
Then he climbed wearily Into the sad
dle and rode down toward the valley.
When he reached Alamosa he took
the pony to the stable and fed her
royally.
Afterward he went to the postofflce.
There was a letter there for him. This
Is what it said:
"My Dearâ I am so sorry, so dread
fully sorry, about It an. Mr. Macdonald
has written Frances how you would not
tell me about your failures and all that
sort of thing. Why didn't you? Why
couldn't you have told me. that you
wanted me to help you fight out? I
would, dearâ oh, I would. .And why
didn't you ask me whether I cared â
cared more than anything ln the whole
world? Why didn't you, dear? Surely,
to ask me to love you wouldn't be ask
ing so vary much. I am waiting, dear.
Will you come. KATHERINE."
Henderson came out of the postofSce
and found in front of the hotel a group
of men. They were mounted and evi
dently, ready to ride away. Macdonald
was with them. "We'll go first up the
trail toward Sunnyslde," he said.
Henderson walked over to the group.
"Were you looking for me. old man?"
he asked. "If you were you're Just in
time to go with me to the station. The
train leaves at midnight"
Then he handed the letter to Macdon
ald.
When the little narrow gauge train
pulled out that night Henderson occu
pied one of the bertha of thÂ« Denver
sleeper. Three days later he was ln
New YoTk. Katharine was waltlnjr.
The next spring Macdonald found tha
rifle at tha foot of the Jagged rock on
the -crest of the mountain.

twenty minutes, you know," he added.
"As you like," she said.
"They were ripping old letters," he
. asserted. "No one could ever write a
letter like you, Fil."
He untied, the string that bound
them and ran hastily through the en
velopes.
"Here's the one you wrote me from
Venice," he said. "Listen!"
Despite her look of anger he pulled
the letter from the envelope and read:
"Dear Old Dave: Your last outburst

He paused and looked at her.
"Well, ' you may thank me j now,"; she
said with a sorry attempt <"atÂ« levity. .

a sudden movement of her hand she

Then he refilled the glasses at the
punch- bowl.
"My turn now," he said. "To Mrs.

Flloroena's hand trembled as she
raised her glass. Potter noted this
from the corner of his "eye. He came

Her eyes suddenly filled with tears*.

the music and take his punishment, or
he can flee the country or commit
suicide. He puts off his decision to
the very last hour, hoping he knows
not what, but the hour comes at last
when he must make It. That hour
came to Tom Matthews, and he re
mained behind in the office to decide
what step he should take. He folly
realized that he must choose between
the three evils, but' the hours -went
by and he could not make up his mind.
He should have left tl â¢ store at 6
o'clock, but he was still there at 9, and
at 9 he was yet undecided. As he sat
with his face in his hands and the office
only dimly illuminated by a single jet.
something touched him on the arm and
he lifted his head to find a stranger
standing beside him.
"You must excuse me for calling so
late," observed the man, "but the fact
Is I had some difficulty in getting into
the store."
"Who are you and what do you
want?" asked Tom. more puzzled than
startled.
"Oh. as to my name you can pick
out any old thing, but as to what I
want I dropped ln to do a little busi
ness with you."
"But the store is dosed."
"Yes, I know, and that's my best
time for doing business. Don't you
saveyT"
"Tou don't mean that you are a bur
glarâa robber?" queried Tom, after
looking the man over for a moment
and wondering If it was a real live man
who stood before him.
"That's pretty close to it," laughed
the man as he sat down on the nearest
chair and brought out a cigar and
lighted It When he had taken a few
puffs he resumed:
'Tve had my eye on this plant for
some time, and when I got ln to-night
I didn't expect to have your company.
How does it come that you are here,
and what's the matter that you look so
seedy? I'd been spying on you for half
an hour before I entered the office, and
I think you've got a peck of trouble on
your mind. Let's hear what it Is."
It was a strange situation, but the
cashier was ln a strange mood. The
caller had said that he was a burglar
and had come with designs, but yet
there was a touch of sympathy in his
tones. Tom hesitated for a moment and
then told him all. The man listened,
nodding or shaking his head now and
then, and when be had heard all he
said:
"Look here, my boy, there's only one
way In this thing. You've got to be
either all good or all bad. You can't be
half and half and make a go of Jt I'm
all bad and I get along very well. What
are you going to do?"
"For God's sake, what am I to do?"
walled Tom.
"Want to turn had?"
"No."
"Is there money enough In the safe
to take you out of the country?"
"There's about $800 ln there, but I
wouldn't touch a penny of it I've yield
ed to temptation, but I'm no thief."
"Fudge!" Elizabeth's lip curled. "He's
younger than I am. I thought' I told
you that. He was my sweetheart ten
years ago. He was only 17 and I was
20. Think of the difference between 17
and 20! Of course. I didn't care any
thing about him; but he was an awful
ly nice boy and splendid company, and
he thought that he was so terribly in
love." : Elizabeth, leaned against the
back of the chair and smiled rexnlnls
cently. " ,
Marie sat up again, her face showing
renewed interest. "What are you smil
ing at? It's an incident. I know by
your eyes. Tell me about It and then
I'll know his character better and how
to captivate him."
Elizabeth's face flushed - and she
laughed guiltily. "Oh, it was nothing.
I was just thinking of the last time I
saw him. He was going to New York
and he came to make his. adieus. ,1
walked down to the gate with him ln
the moonlight and â and he kissed me
good-by." Again the flusn crept over
her face and the fascinating corners of
her mouth curled upward In spite of
herself, while the gray eyes,' shining
with merriment, kept. themselves fixed
persistently vpon the toe of her patent
leather slipper.
Marie gazed at her curiously. "Well,
what was there so amusing â¢ about
that?" she inquired tentatively.
"Oh, the kiss itself. It was so funny.
Positively the funniest one that I ever
had ln all my life. It was the first
time that he had ever kissed me and â
and â well. It was exactly the kind of
a kiss that he would have given to his
grandmother."
Both of the girls laughed.
"Really, Marie, you've no Idea how
funny It was. Such a gentle, pretty
little kiss. If it had not been for the
shadow of the lilac bush he certainly
would have seen me laugh. But there,
he was a dear boy." Elizabeth's tone
took on a little self-reproach. "And
it's a shame to laugh at him; but
truly, ' I shall remember that kiss as
long as I-llve."
"And Is he still a dear boy?" asked
Marie maliciously.
"How do I know? Tv* never saea
him from that day to this. He quite
distinguished himself In the war; went
willowy and thirty, balanced herself on
the arm of a veranda chair. "I Just
saw the register and Captain Bleazby
has arrived!"
There was a note of such genuine
pleasure in her tone that Marie dropped
back Into a reclining posture with her
hands behind her head. "Well." she
said slowly and disgustedly, "If you
are so wonderfully glad, what is the use
of my putting on the bib and tucker.
Who Is he, anyway?"
"Marie! Goosie! Don't be foolish.
Haven't I always taken a grandmother
ly interest in you. and tried my best to
find a satisfactory husband for you?
Now here is Captain Bleazby, the very
epitome of perfection, falling right into
your hand. Of course I'm glad!"
"But If you like him so much â " per
sisted Marie.
"Well. Johnson, I fed a- load off my
mind. Tom Is aa straight as a string,
&ad we need not worry about him. I
don't believe that he could be tempted
to do a crooked thing."
Never did a young man carry a
cleaner record Into an Â©ffloe. There
had been a thousand chances for peou
latten, but Tom bad not been tempted.
If any oae had whispered In his ear
that temptation was going to fat the
best of h*â¢ he would have smiled at
the idea, He had put In another yÂ»ar

easy that he gave It a whirl a month

looking off over the lake.
Marie's lashes shaded her eyes.
"Well." she said, meditatively, "evi
dently the campaign has been a fail

The pink color stole up around
Elizabeth's temple, and Marie went on.

Did you ever think of that?"
Two tiny wrinkles appeared between
Elizabeth's soft eyebrows, but she
made no reply.
Marie yawned and placed a hand
over her mouth. "I wouldn't In the

No answer.

A MAN'S ATMOSPHERE
BY THE PARSON
It Is very important that those upon
whom rests the responsibility of train
ing children should fully understand
the significance of the word "train
ing/.* That some who are following
these articles do not is shown by
many earnest letters. Many parents
still believe It means teaching. Such
is not the case. Primarily, teaching
means the imparting of knowledge.
Training implies, not merely the im
parting of knowledge, but also inspir
ing to repeat action, which results in
the formation of habits. Teaching en
ables the child to make use of the
knowledge he possesses. Teaching is
very important. Training is far more
important. Why teach many things
if nothing is to be used? Children
should not merely be taught to know
what Is right. It is not even sufficient
to teach them to be good. â¢ They should
be trained to be good for something,
and to do right.
Parents should ever be mindful of
the fact that all will receive some kind
of training. During almost every
wakeful moment every child Is being
trained. Every sense reaches out after
knowledge, all of which helps deter
mine his training. The. great aim
should be to roc to it that' the train
ing is of the right kind.
The parent who expects to leave the
training of a child until a later period
**p-f L.L. UfÂ« Is a constant warfare.
f 1 That of a child is especially so.
% y^ I While developing conscience and
JL embryonic reason strive for su
premacy, animal appetites and pro
pensities tempt to utter ruin by offer
ing. In exchange, all the pleasures in
the child's heaven and earth. Whether
the sweet babe shall develop into the
murderous Herod or the saving Moses
will be determined by the result of the
conflict. What the result of the con
flict shall be will depend largely upon
the character of the training which the
parents give their children. To the
child it means life or deathâ upon the
one side a life of honor and beneficence.
and a triumphant death; upon the
other, a life of shame and misery, and
an Ignominious death.
Those who have made the most care
ful, study of this important problem
agree that the most that can be claim
ed for heredity is a tendency to act
as did the parents. They also agree
that these tendencies require stimula
tion from without. Therefore, with
proper care as to these outside stim
ulations to action, a child can be
properly trained in spite of adverse
tendencies. '
The child may Inherit Impulses;
but a kind providence has foreordain
ed that he shall not inherit habits.
He may inhepft certain tastes, but he
does not inherit temptations. He may
bring with him into the world tenden
cies; but he does not bring with him
any prejudices. - In the very great ma
jority of cases a child's character will
be determined by his training and his
environments, rather than by Inher
ited-tendencies.'
All the child's powers exist bat as
germs, which are easily developed and
controlled almost at will by the wisely
directed, fostering hand. Pew will
deny that, as we can train to healthy
and well proportioned growth the
plant, which, if neglected. would,have
proven unsightly, dwarfed and â¢ bar
ren of good fruit, so by proper train
ing the dormant powers of a child
may be brought to healthy develop
ment; and by restraining the evil ten
dencies and stimulating the good vast
changes for the better may be made In
the developing character. Parents
should remember that as the twig is
bent the tree will slant; and in the
direction it inclines in life., so it will
fall in. death. Being responsible for
the first, they almost certainly deter
mine the last, not merely for all time,
but for eternity as well.
The third seven years may be termed
the analytic age. During this period the
youth, examines and questions more
closely all matters presented to the at
tention: : therefore the training which
might answer satisfactorily for the first
periods would be ; of much less value
during this third stage of development.
In spite of the fact that it is distinct
ly, their duty too many parents. try to
place upon others the responsibility for
training the child. Some look to the
church for the training which the child
A child born blind may be taught
many things better than other children;
,but he cannot be taught to see.
The second seven years Is the recep
tive age, when many of the most last-
Ing impressions are made. During these
periods every vicious mental, moral and
physical tendency should be suppressed,
and the natural activity directed to
ward some associated virtue. Thus,
much can be done to transform by
careful treatment, unwearied patience
and persistent effort the surliness, vul
garity and other evil tendencies into
their opposites. The great danger is
lest In these years the mold Into which
the child is cast may be a wrong one.
Many more look to the schools, which
are doing much toward training in
right habits, along moral and physical,
as well as educational lines. But for
the training many get in the public
schools of our land the outlook for the
future of many a child, as well as for
the nation, would be far more dis
couraging than It now Is. In spite of
this fact, however, it Is, primarily, the
duty of parents to see that the home
training is what it should be: and there
is no excuse for their attempting to
shift the responsibility. Certain it is
that the Inspiration of the church and
the instruction in the schools are in
finitely more effective when there Is
'proper home training.
; In considering the power of training
we must not forget that, whll? a vast
deal can be accomplished by training,
yet to the possibility of training there
are certain limitations. Each child can
be trained to do the best with his own
powers. He can be trained to go "In
the way he should go," not in the way
some other child can go.
There are different phases of growth.

should begin after birth and continue
until the age when it is freed from aU
parental authority.
With great plausibility some will con
tinue to urge the argument that a
child's nature cannot be changed. This
may be true, in part. It is even more
certain, however, that a child can be so
trained that it will give expressions <to
its nature in an entirely different way
than the same child would but for the
training. . ;
If the. training is begun quite early
and continues as long as the child Is
susceptible to impressions from without
it will have a marked effect upon every
stage of the child's existence. It is not
too much to claim that continued proper
training will so change the expression
of the child's nature that it will appear
as an entirely different creature. , Such
.training is In. reality, a process of re
creating a child into an entirely, differ
ent kind of being.
The training suitable for any child,
should not only be determined by the
health, the sex, the temperament and,
by other conditions; It should also be
determined by age. The treatment
which would be best for a young child
would probably be the very vforst for
older, children. As a child reaches
the age of adolescence it will generally
be necessary to relax absolute author
â¢ ity and make use of more reason. On
the other hand, it would be an even
greater, mistake for parents to feel
compelled to give reasons to the young
child for the purpose of securing com
pliance with their wishes..
Many will argue that a child's fu
i ture depends almost entirely upon
what it inherits. This is not the case.

Wm. J. Shearer
As before indicated, one great mis
take many parents make is, that they
do not begin the training of children
as early as they should. In answer to
the question as to why a mother per
mitted a certain action, she replied,
as most mothers would have replied
under the same circumstances, "Why,
he's only a baby." How often we have
all heard similar answers given by
conscientious parents who do not fully
appreciate the fact that, months after
the child should have been trained
to do differently, they have encdur :
aged the growth of the most vicious
habits, from the bonds of which he can
break with difficulty, if at all.
Though it is hoped they are not
many, yet there are some parents who
are disposed to nut off the training of
a child until they send him to school.
This is done, either because of the be
lief that the young child is not a fit
subject for training, or because it is
too much trouble. Regard for the
welfare of the child, if not sympathy
for the poor teacher, unreservedly con
demns such a practice. '$xÂ£
All who have had experience with
children will agree that they may be
trained in Important habits long be

It is not too. much to assert that by
the. time the. child is able to talk he may
be led away from many of the habits
which, in after years, would. cause both
child and parents much unpleasantness.
If not absolute suffering. "Without fear
of successful , contradiction - it may be
asserted that the training of a child
will find, when the time arrives, that
his training has already become ef
fective. Then will be necessary the
arduous task of lifting him out of the
ruts of Improper training that he may
be helped along on the smoother road.
Happy the parent who can overcome

This is probably a fallacy. Experi
ence and observation have given me a
secret, sneaking conviction that it is
undoubtedly a fallacy, and that the In
telligent woman, though she
may not display her goods as strikingly
in the window, has as large and
quite as valuable a stock on hand as
the "smartest" American; but it is well
for the latter that she has the cachet,
and she wrongs no one., not even her
rival, in "cutely" making, the most
of it.
All . these arguments' hold equally

to fight for. She or her parents prob
ably began life in the same sphere from
which the other has been recruited, but
a sewing machine, a patent medicine,
a tinned soup, a sleeping-car or a pe

A little of the fierce light which beats
upon a throne must beat upon her
there, and even though she be an
American the bright surface of her un
conventionallty will melt visibly in the
blaze of glory. Nevertheless she can
safely have a great deal more "fun"
than the English heiress. She can be
eccentric, and be thought merely orig
inal. She can be daring and know that
she will be excused, because "American
girls are brought up differently from
ours, poor things."
Suppose she marries an Englishman.
f*f HAKESPEARE makes Rosalind
X>v bid Phoebe "go down on her
M knees and thank heaven fasting
\^ for a good man's love." I think
it would be equally right to perform
this act of gratitude for the Joyful priv
ilege of being- an American woman in
England, for she becomes a member of
a privileged class.
It is very nice to be a woman any
v.-here, provided she have come prettl
ness, some youth and some money â or
the brains to get it. It is particularly
nice to be an American woman in
America; but I am Inclined to think
that the bonne bouche is to be an
American woman in England.
There are several cogent reasons for
this â as many reasons as there are
types and grades of such womenâ but
the principal reason lies like a nut In a
shell. It is the fact Just asserted, that
the American woman in England be
comes a member of a privileged class.
Indeed, she has created the class and
the privilege.
As to the class to which ehe belonged
before Ehe left the States, that is a
comparatively irrelevant matter, since
the status she is to take in her adopted
country depends upon herself, and upon
luckâ the latter being a separate part of
her own individuality.

It is upon this convenient state of
affairs that the clever young American
woman trades, whether wholly con

adopting England as her country.
Our nice girl comes gaily over, with
a friend of her own age, or even alone.
She proceeds to do things which she
would not dare to do at home, among
her old friends who know her well, or
in a strange American town where she
wishes to collect new friends. She has
"come over" armed with letters of
introduction, but she does not need to
ask herselft "Will these good people be
horrified, and fight shy of me. If I take

English people know nothing whatever
about the rules of social etiquette which
govern women in the States. They are
not aware that In some States a young
woman in society may never go out un
chaperoned, while In others chaperons
are considered as superfluous as fur
cloaks in July. They have accepted as
correct the portraits of American girls,
which they have seen in novels (mostly
by English writers who have not sifted
Eastern traditions from those of the
West), and they would consider a young
vroman from the States uninteresting,
rather than well brought up, if she
never surprised or even shocked them
a little. They expect her to be unex
pected, and if she Is not they are dis
appointed.
An American girl has gleaned from
story books penned by compatriots that
her English sister can say very little to
a man beyond ' yes" and "no," and that
her principal charm (one apt to pall
after frequent repetition) Is blushing
like roses and cream when looked at or
spoken to by a member of the opposite
Â¦ex. Consequently the American maid
en makes her voyage of discovery to
the other side of the great pond almost

absorbed these Impressions, strange to
her, in her babyhood, and she goes
about telling her English friends facta

TT7HETHER the average Amerl
1/1/ can reader of "Dodo" Benson's
"The Relentless City" reviles
the author as a British cad or smiles at
him for being a clever satirist must de
pend largely upon whether or not' that
reader takes small black pills with
every meal. Certainly there is excuse
for the more choleric criticism; un
doubtedly the majority will accede to
the latter appreciation. Not a few may
argue that Mr. Benson is possessed of a
bit of both qualities. After all it is a
matter of a good or a bad digestion.
"The Relentless City" purports to be
a satire upon the alleged "smart set"
of relentless New York. That the seed
of sarcastic criticism is sown on fruit
ful ground few outside of the glided
circle of that chosen band will gainsay.
We have had our monkey dinners, our
stable banquets and our. tawdry circus
parade weddings ad nauseam. The an
tics of the nouveau riche on Manhattan
who constitute themselves the ar
biters of swagger society have too long
become a byword and a hissing abroad,
as well as a gladsome Â¦- token to the
stout British shopkeepers. That Mr.
Benson, tha 'caustic English gentleman,
should have a tilt at such mushroom
growth should be a source of pleasure
to every well-minded American.
And right heartily does Mr. Benson's

OLD readers of Dickens are able to
sniff a very familiar scent in the
humorous writings of W. W.
Jacobs, whose "Old Craft" has recently
been published. It is the tarry smell of
the wharves and the typical Wapplng
whiff of the Thames which recall the
haunts of good old Cap'n Cuttle, the
odious Quilp and Rogue Riderhood. The
waterman and ship's watchmen of Ja
cobs' stories are very akin to the Im
mortalized characters of the great hu
morist. Dickens' fund lay In carica
ture; likewise Jacobs*. The master
story teller delighted in laying bare
all the ingenuous simplicity and child
like Improvidence of his people of the
humbler walk; the present sketch ar
tist of Ratcliffe and Splteaflelds allows
himself the same pleasure.
In his "Odd Craft" Jacobs presents
fourteen short stories brimming over
with laughter. They have for the most
part to deal with the adventures and
cogitations of the disenfranchised sea
man, whose haunts are the docks and
the "pubs" down at the river's edge.
His love affairs, his roysterings, his
griefs of a dayâ all of these serve as the
themes for Jacobs', inimitable* sketches.
The field Is his own and he Is acknowl
edged a master of it. Few such stories
of the sub-strata have been written
and none better than Jacobs'.
The author's people are not inherent
ly the kind who would appear at first
sleht to be the most | lovable in the
world. However, Jacobs has with rare"
art left their undoubted offenslveness
to be only guessed at by the reader.
From their debauches he picks out only
the uproariously humorous Incidents
and their honeyed words in occasions
of stress he glides over with due defer
ence to the proprieties.
By the irresistibly droll . method , Ja
cobs takes in holding his characters up
to view through, the mouth of some
water-front raconteur", his' stories 'gain'
much. , It is the pithy commentary,up
on the actions of Ginger Dick from the
oracular Small Small which brings the
laugh bubbling 'to the surface.'.

7 WO holiday editions of standard
poetry have appeared this season
which will each appeal powerfully
to a widely divergent clientele. These
are Howard Chandler Christy's artistic
edition of Longfellow's "Courtship of
Miles Standlsh" and a rich. little volume
of Moore's translation of the "Odes" of
Anacreon, embellished with designs by
Gerodet de Roussy. The one will call
strongly to the lover of art; the other
will be dear to the scholar. . . .-.-â J: ;*.
Mr. Christy has done a worthy work
in acting as the first standard art inter
preter of Longfellow's tale of old Mas
sachusetts. With a subtle skill he has
Invested the text with a charm which it
has never had before. The
sweetness and purity of the poem has
been embodied by the artist in pictures
which are each a little masterpiece of
the modern illustrator's art. There are
more than forty ..full-page' drawings;
some of them in color. They certainly
revivify the old tale to a remarkable
degree..
The ."Anacreon" is the golden font of
true poesy . for every lover of the
classics. The Moore translation, which
Putnam's have brought out on splendid
paper and artistically bound, holds all
the old Athenian's sprightly touches In
praise of Phyllis and the good Saxrilan
vintage. To read the 'odes is to catch
a' breath straight from the old. Aegean.

/-N "Fancies" " Henry Wise Wood, a
New England writer, presents a
dainty little volume of poems that
are somewhat above the ordinary
standard of present day verse. ,The
longer poems are written in a breezy
didacto-philosophical style that Is full
of freshness, and inculcates' sound ethi
cal principles.
The longest and most ambitious poem
is entitled "The Forge." Its burden is
the unassailable fact that after all is
said' and done "success Is the. measure
of the man." The ethical teachings are
occasionally relieved by slyly humor
ous effusions like "An \ Extraordinary
Bee," In which is outlined, the short
life history of ( a luxury loving but in
dolent insect.
, In the first â¢ short poem, entitled
"Awakening," the poet Intimates that
after a long residence in an affluent
city he sought rest in a country village.
It was a new world to him, and,, like
other singers, his muse thereafter
largely turned from the didactic to sing
of rural scenes and pleasures. To this
change must be attributed the graceful
little lyrics of our country themes, that
recall the sweet odors of the flowers
arid the love songs of the birds borne
by the breezes of spring and early sum
mer time. In these the poet Is seen at
his best. â¢ \
A few of the songs like "To My
Shadows," " 'Tis Only Death" and
"Worry" remind us of Barry Cornwall;
they suggest that Wood has been a
diligent student of that neglected but
charming lyric writer.
No poem in the collection is more
representative of the author's, style
than the following ode entitled "Phan
tasmal Night":
Come, greet with me tha arriving' stars of
nlrhtâ >
Pale, lucent pilgTlms. threading- silently
The boundless environs of space. . The sea.
Far-casting:, lies bedlmmed with their faint
' light,
All tossed and broken, ere to regal height.
They rise! O apeak, supernal melody.
Of motion*! Leadeat thou on' to destiny
The man, the state, tha star, th* Infinite T
The east fulfills the promise of the west;
Deep- hooded . spirits at the pyre of day
Invoke the morrow, and the lnterway
la Night, phantasmal Night, wheÂ»e rich be
quest
Of Immemorial paatsâ wan-winged arrayâ
Sweeps ever, mutely onward without rest.
"Fancies" is evidently Wood's first
printed work. The poems are of un
equal merit, but they give promise that
with further efforts he will be capable
of producing lyrics of considerable
merit An hour or two may be enjoy
ably and perhaps instructively spent
in perusing the little, book.

y^ROM the publishing offices of the
t~1 Salvation Army comes a neat
volume from. the pen of Com
mander, Booth-Tucker,.- the r . sub-v
Ject of which is hfe much-lamented
wife, whose tragic taking-off recently
caused such a shock to the Christian
world at large. A perusal of this work
shows it to be one of the most readable
and fascinating biographical sketches
issued during the year. The writer
having sustained the close relationship
of husband to Mrs. Booth-Tucker, Is
enabled to draw aside the veil and give
the . reader a series of glimpses .of a
most saintly life, and one no more
saintly than soldierlike, from the
standpoint of aggressive Christianity.
Mrs. Booth-Tucker's life is so Inter
woven with the history of the Salva
tion Army movement from the very,
time of its inception that her loss |Uji
naturally felt to be a very serious one.
And yet such a testing time as this
must necessarily have been only seems
to demonstrate' the solidity of the foun
dation upon which the organization is
built. Like the ring of the flawless car
wheel at the stroke of the tester as the
train lies in the railroad depot, fo do
these periods of test and trial tend to
emphasize the soundness and stability
of the movement.
The fruits possible to a life devoted
to one particular object, when. that ob
ject is in the line of religious endeavor,
are held up to view in a manner cal
culated-.to stimulate the Christian
worker of any and every denomination.
This "daughter of the regiment" (for
she was such in a very sacred sense,
having been raised to a life of militant
Christianity from the time of her baby
hood) has done more toward the mak
ing and molding of character in the
experiences of the quaintly bonneted
. Salvation lassies . than any other one
person, having, acted .as principal of
the j International Women's Training'
Home In London for a great number ot
yearsâ from the time of its opening
until her marriage with Commander
Booth-Tucker.
Since that time we may Infer that
this life of consecrated service met Its
fullest fruitlon-f-as co-leader of the
Important American- field,- with Its
manifold activities; taking a leading
seat at Its councils, legislating for its
Farm Colonies, its Rescue Homes, its

manners. -To her palatial home on Long
Island there comes a certain Bertie, a
bankrupt English nobleman, seeking
matrimony hyphenated by the dollar
sign. The fetes and the routs given
by the loud Mrs. Palmer to signalize
the advent of so interesting a possibil
ity do not read more strange than the
oft-recurrent press accounts of like
events outside the realms of fiction.
But in all fairness to those con
cerned, Mr. Benson has laid some of
the scenes of his story In England.
Though kinder in a measure to his na
tive folk, the author does not paint a
very inspiring picture of life aa it is
lived among the class jj of privileged
indolence. ' He does not hesitate to
speak out in meeting against the ut
ter listlessness which seems to be the
characteristic of the^Engllsh gentler
man â and lady, too, for that matter.
He rails at his brethren for sitting,
hands folded; and allowing the purse
fat Americans to point the way to suc
cess.
In all of this Benson writes with a
keen wit and a polish' of epigram
.which gives his novel a distinctly
buoyant and sprightly tone. Sincere
aa he at first appears, there Is, how
ever, throughout the book an under
current of burlesque which leaves the
reader In doubt as to whether or not
Mr. Benson's uncivil remarks about
some Americans are in themselves sin
cere.
'- As to New York, the relentless city,
there can be no doubt of the author's
genuine disgust entertained against it.
The people, the press, the streetcars,
the buildings, even the vagaries of the
thermometer; come under a sweeping
curse by bell and by book at the hands
of the English satirist. The word
"beastly" can be read between the
lines of every reference made to the
unfortunate metropolis.

low's history to popularize (If the term
may be so used) the subject of his
Investigation. He has tried to clothe
the dry bones of fact with a raiment
of romance. Losing nothing to accur
acy or appreciation of the general trend
of his subject, the author has skillfully
contrived to sound in his history, a note
of human interest which removes It
from the plane of mere scholastic grub
bers.
At the expense of minute records of
official orders, diplomatic sparring and
palace Intrigues leading nowhere, Bige
low has filled this third volume with
vivid portraits of leaders in the uphill
fight for a constitutional government.
With spirited style . he pictures such
strong men as Father Jahn, Fritz Reu
ter, Robert Blum and Louis Kossuth.
He tells of their aspirations, their seem
ingly fruitless efforts to raise their
country from tyranny, their heart
breaking "disappointments. Bigelow's
portraits breathe. Â»
It is almost impossible for us of to
day who see in the German empire a
world power to be respected mightily,
to imagine the deadly pall of reaction
which settled over the dissevered
states of the German-speaking peoples
after the terrible Napoleon had been at
last safely caged. When, from the
crafty and all-powerful Metternich, at
the court of Austria, there emanated
the repressive decrees which pushed â¢
back the defenders of their father
lands all over Europe, when Kings
were united in a hypocritical Holy Alli
ance to safeguard the principles of ab
solutism and no man's conscience was
his ownâ then was the time when he
roes no less great than Washington >
and Lincoln arose to fight for their in
dependence. BIgelow shows the inter
dependence of the republican move
ments of one country upon that of an
other, the alliance for protection
against these movements between one
King and another.
Not only does the historian recount
the political movements among the
Germans, which culminated in the rev
olution of 1848, but he reveals the part,
the very large part, in the emancipa
tion which philosophers, poets and even
musicians had to play. The revolution
sprang from the universities, where
such' men as Beethoven, Heine and
Humboldt worked and preached the
doctrines of liberty. Father Jahn, to
whom BIgelow is prone to attribute al
most too much credit for the awaken
ing of Germany, is carried in the
author's work from his college through
all the vicissitudes of a political agi
tator to his grave. !
Perhaps one of the best drawn por
traits and ;the one productive of the
most interest is that of Julie Krudener,
the woman who led Czar Alexander by
the nose Into the promulgation of the
Holy Alliance propaganda. This wo
man, half courtesan, half mystic, is
one of the remarkable female figures of
history. Bigelow has presented a lively
sketch of her personality.

/N one of his essays upon esthetl
< ism Schiller says: "Before truth
.-..-nds its conquering light into the
depths of the heart, the poetic im
agination catches its rays and the sum
mils of humanity begin to glow while
the damp night isÂ« still lying: in the val
leys." TLan this no more happy ex
pression of poetic truth could be found
to characterize the first published
thought of a neÂ«- ""estern poet. George
Sterling of Oakland has his name to a
modest volume of verse which is cer
tainly bound to carry by force the re
doubts of the rr ' stubborn critics and
win for its author a recognition of no
transitory character. For "The Testi
mony of the Suns" narrowly misses be
ing: a great poem; per", aps the readers
of ten years hence will vote it great.
In bald statement of theme, "The Tes
timony of the Suns" is a pDetic concep
tion of the first inklings of truth about
the grand scheme of the universe which
astronomers have just begun to g;ra*=p.
In the very essence of this fact lies the
application of Schiller's words to the
masterful poem which is Sterling's.
The poetic imagination, pays the great
philoBopher-poet. catches the first glint
cf half reveaied truth and heralds it
abroad to the souls yet unenlightened.
The poet is the frontiersman of thought
â the watchman who tells what of the
night. Just so has Sterling sought to
eee into and beyond the filmy concep
tion of the scientists and read the great
Law which is veiled behind tbe truth of
the telescope.
But the poem is more than that. A
bold plunge Into untrodden heights of
transcendentalism is "The Testimony
of the Suns." It is daring:; it could al
most be styled untoward in the realms
of poetry- The eternal ' why" is the po
etic spring of the work, but it is not the
query as applied to mere human life
which Sterling voices, but the illimitable
riddle of star space and worlds' cata
clysms which swings through his
stanzas. No attempt at an answer is
made. The monstrous crux of the en
tire Thing thinkable, of All that Is, is
chanted in a measure sonorous and awe
full.
The late Frank Norris once wrote
that were one to lie upon his back on
a cloudless day and gaze intently up
at the blue the crust of the sky would
part after long scrutiny and the
watcher would see bare space; hi3
soul will tlien wither within him at
the dread of It. This homely illus
tration is adequate to describe in a
measure the effect of "The Testimony
of the Suns." One reading with un
derstanding feels about him the utter
awfulness of stellar space. Here It is:
What Bounds shall pass the guilt where zrcma.
Their Â«uUen axles on the nijcht?
What thunder from the etrands of llrht
Whence Vegm eUxes on worlds unknown?
O deep whote very alienee stuns!
Where lifht la powerless to Illume.

Teat Awnst to motet the fiarinff rusi.
Sterling's flight into the realms
where Is
The wind, that blows between the worlds
has nothing of the classic deflnlteness
of Coleridge or the mystic gropinga of
Poe. In his "Ode to the Departing
Tear" Coleridge dwells upon the ste
reotyped group of gods in the high
heavens, come from every star; there is
no new concept there. Poe's misbegot
ten "Ulalume," like other figments of
that strangely disordered thought, pos
sesses no Image of the outer dark than
the fanciful figures of Poe's own usage.
In Its sublimity of concept and vivid
ness cf portrayal Sterling's picture of
the war of the worlds in the unplumb
&ble abyss of the universe is without
parallel. Rash and sudden though the
statement may be. It appears, never
theless, that the new Western poet has
caught a small part of the wondrous
Imagination of a Dante or a Milton.
Though In no way didactic. Sterling's
view of the supreme heavens brings
him to enunciate a doctrine which is
at one with the remarkable sublimity
of bis conception. Does little man, liv
ing but for a fleeting breath on this
puny world, dare to believe that to him
there will ever come the stupendous
revelation of all that great congeries of
forces ruling the Bkies? Is there even
an eternity for so small a dust speck
in the cosmic scheme?
Bow Taat tbe g-ulfa of man's desire!
ChUerca of chance, we dream to tfcar*
The battle-vl*ll of Altalr.
And watch treat Fcmalhaut expire;
So Areanpt thy sona on world* destroyed.
Whose dust a.IlureÂ« our careless eyes.
Ac, lit as last on alien ekies.
The taetecr raj!ts athwart the void.
There are other bits of verse In this
first volume of Sterling's which, aside
from "The Testimony of the Suns,"
are well calculated to give the author
prominence. The exalted note of sub
limity is in these subdued to a gentle
rhythm of tenderness and simplicity.
There are lyrics of short length, the
sonnet is tried with success, and in an
ode to "Music" the poet shows his fa
cility with blank verse. Into simple
verse form are cast all of Sterling's ef
forts. There is no striving for effect
with a tortured construction or arbi
trary rhyme scheme. His stanzas are
musical and flowing: and harmony has
been well molded to the thought.

Malcolm MacLeod took the strangers

The court wondered greatly at the
sudden disappearance of James Mac-
Donald. but nor.e dared to make in
quiry, some thinking he. had. escaped
to the north,~others that a dungeon" in
Stirling Castle might reveal his where
abouts. The Kins spent three days in
settling those affairs of the realm
which demanded immediate attention,
left . Sir Donald Sinclair in temporary
command, and rode off to Doune Castle.
From thls J stronghold there issued
next morning before daylight two well
mounted young men, who struck in a
northwesterly direction for the 1 wild
Highland coufctry. At is'.was uriadvis
able far them to. enter. Skye In anything
like state, the two travelers contented
themselves with an ordinary fishing
boat, which spread sail when 'the
winds were fair, and depended on th.e
oars of. the crew when the. sea was
calm. - They were accompanied by. two
gillies, who were intended .to be use
ful on any ordinary occasion and neces
sary in case of emergency, for the, boat
and Its crew were to wait in any. har
bor of Skya that was determined upon
and carry news to Loch Torridon if the
presence of the fleet was deemed neces
sary. ....

the Kiner, "and we will arrange It as

"My advice has been slighted so far."

another piece of it. "We are going In
a kittleish country. I advise you to or

Castle of Doune, and wait until I come,
which may be in a day or in a week."
"You advised -an army, which I shall
not take with me. I shall â¢ be" well
guarded by my good right arm and by
the still more potent right arm, if I
may believe his own statement, of my
friend Jamie McDonald of Sleat. ~
' "You " will Â¦ cet yourself out of Stir
line." continued the King,' "aslquietly
"Your Majesty does not .propose going
alone?", cried \MacDonald â¢ In- amaze
ment. Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦ . . . -. . , â¢ --.... i -
"Certainly not; ? I 'Bhall-" be well

"Ah, that is a different matter, and
exactly what I advised." â¢
"You are right in that. Jamie, and
the remark shows I have chosen a wise
councilor. Very well, then. I ; have
never seen the renowned island of
Skye. They, tell me It is even more
picturesque than Stirling itself. I nro
pose, then, to don a disguise, visit Skye
and find out if I can what . the tur
bulent islanders want. . If I am not
able to grant their desire I can at least
deal the better, with them for belnc
acquainted."- Â¦.Â¦*,;.
"If your Ma Jesty... will tell what you
Â¦have resolved upon, then I shall very
blithely . give you my opinion on' it.; It
is always easier to criticize the plans
of another than to put forward "sensi
ble plans of one's own."
"Next! I would raise an army and
march against him and ' make him
laugh on the other side of his crooked
mouth."
"Hum," said the King. "I am think
ing, Jamie, there are lions in the path."
"The lions are imaginary, your Maj
esty. The Grahams, the Stewarts, the
McNabs would rise not against -you,
but for you, delighted to be led by their
King. The Campbells themselves must
Join you, if your force were large
enough to do without them. Among
the MacDonalds alone I could guaran
tee you an army. You forget that the
Highlandman is always anxious for
warfare. Leave Stirling with a thou
sand men and you will have ten thou
sand before you are at the shores of
Sleat."
"It may all be as you say, Jamie.
Perhaps the Highlands would rise with
me instead of against me, but a pru
dent commander must not ignore the
possibility of the reverse. However,
apart from all this, I am desirous of
quelling the military ardor of the High
lands, not" of augmenting it. It's easy
enough setting the heather on fire' in
dry weather, but he .is a wise prophet
who tells where the conflagration ends.
I would rather carry a bucket of . water
than a sword, even though it may -be
heavier.".".." y "'
"That seems but just," concurred the
King, "still, I doubt if our friend the
humpback places very much value on
the writing of his august sovereign. He
knows he holds his lands as he holds
his sword â his grip on the one relaxing
when he loses his grip on the other.
We will suppose, however, the charter
withdrawn and the MacLeods laughing
defiance at us. What next, MacDon
ald?"
"Yes, 'that's the man, and a crafty,
plausible old gentleman he is.' He got a
charter under the great seal of all his
lands from my father, dated the 15th of
June, 1468. This did not satisfy him,
and when 1 ckmfe to the throne Mie
asked for 'a similar charter from me,
which I signed on the ISth of February
last. Its conditiens seemed to be most
advantageous tjo him,' for all that 'was
required of him was' that J he . should
keep for my use a -galley .'of twenty-six
oars, and likewise keep the peace, I
am Tiot aware whether the galley. h*s
been built or not, but there is certainly
very little peace, where a" MacLeod has
a claymore in his hand., Now, Jamie,
the MacLeods are your .neighbors in
Sleat. so tell me what you would'~do
were the King's crown on your head?"
"I should withdraw their charter,"
said MacDonald. \
The King threw back his head and
laughed the generous laugh of the all
conquering man.
"E-god, Jamie, my man, we may put
that to the test before long, but it is in
the high realms of statesmanship I
want your advice, and not In the frivol
ous- courts of love."
"Why does your Majesty wish to have
my opinion?" asked the Highlander.
"Lord. I'll want more than your opin
ion before this is done with, but I may
tell â¢ you at once that there's trouble
some news from Skye."
"Are the MacLeods up again?""
"Aye, they're ur> and down. They're
up in their anger and down on their
neighbors. I cannot fathom the intri
cacies of their disputes, but it may in
terest you to know that some of your
clan are engaged in it. I suspect that
Alexander MacLeod of Dunvegan is be
hind all this, although he may not be
an active participant."
"Ah, that is Allaster Crottach," said
the young man, knitting his brows.
"AUaster, yes; but what does Crot
tach mean?" asked the King. * . â¢
"It means the humpback."
Whether intentional or not, the King
had touched a sore spot when he re
ferred to the laying of a winsome las
sie's head on his shoulder, and Mac-
Donald drew himself up rather stiffly.
"In any ploy with the ladies," he
said, "your Majesty has the weight of
an ermine cloak in your favor, and we
all know how the lassies like milli
nery."
"Then. Jamie, In a fair field, you
think you would have the advantage of
me, as for example if our carpet were
the heather instead of the weaving of
an Eastern loom?"
"I Just think that,"' said MacDonald
stoutly
"Truth to tell, Jamie, your head
would be of little use to inc. were it not
on your shoulders. If the head were
that of a winsome lassie I might be
tempted to take it on my own shoulder,
but otherwise I am well content to let
heads remain where Providence places
them./" ; i< - *^
"If your Majesty means the High
landers they are easily enough under
stood. They are plain, simple, honest
bodies who speak .what's on their
minds, and who are always willing in
an argument to exchange the wag of
the tongue for a swoop of the black
knife."
â¢I admit," said the King, with a
smile, "that they are a guileless, pas
toral people, easy to get on with if you
comprehend them, but that is where
I'm at a loss and I thought your head
might supplement my own."
"I am delighted to hear you want my
head for no other purpose but that of
giving advice." returned the High
lander candidly.
When James the laird's son entered
the presence of James the King, the
latter eald as soon as the captain had
left them alone together:
"Jamie, my man. you understand the
Gaelic, so It Is possible you understand
those who speak it."
Some weeks after the Ill-considered
anti-royal threats had been made their
premulgator was one of a group In the
courtyard of the castle, when the cap
tain of the guard came forward and
said the King wished to see him in his
private chamber.
"Ah. well." commented James, "Kings
must take their luck like other folk,
and some day Jamie and I may meet
on the heather with no other witnesses
than the mountains around us and the
blue skv above us. and in that case I
'Bhall have to do the best I can. I make
no doubt that MacDonald's position in
Stirling Is less pleasant than my own!
He is practically a prisoner, held host
age here for the rood conduct of his
father, the firebrand of Sleat, so we
must not take too seriously the vapor
ing of a youth whose leg is tied. I was
once a captive myself to the Douglas,
and I coed words that would scarcely
have been pleasant for my gaoler to
hear had eome kind friend carried
them, co I have ever a soft side for
the man In thrall."
Now this was rank treason, for you
must never talk of swords in relation
to a King, except that they be drawn
in his defense. So it was not long after
these injudicious utterances had been
given forth that they "were brought,
with many exaggerations, to- the ears
of the King.
"You think, then," said his- Majesty
to one of the tale bearers, "that if
Jamie had the chance he wojuld run his
iron through my "royal person?"
"There is little doubt of it, your Maj
esty," replied the parasite.
"If the King," he said boldly, "w.-vs
plain Jamie Stuart, as I am Jamie Mac-
Donald, we would soon see who was
winner of the bonniest less, and if he
objected to fair play I'd not scruple
to meet him 6word in hand on the
heather of the hills, but not on the
stones of Stirling. It is the crown that
has won, and net the face underneath
it."
Â¦fTAMES was pleased with himself.
I He had finished a poem, admlt
\ ted by all the court to excel any-
Qj thing: that Sir David Lyndsay ever
wrote, and he had outdistanced
James MacDonald, son of the Laird
of Sieat. in a contest for the prefer
ence of the fairest lady in Stirling, and
young llacDonald was certainly the
handsomest sprig about the palace. So
the double victory in the art of rhythm
and of love naturally induced the Kins
to hold a great- conceit of himself.
Poor Davie, who was as modest a man
regarding his ewn merits as could be
found in the realm, quite readily and
honestly hailed the King his superior

but the strapping youn* Highlander

house and he took, his defeat less diffi

The little company without another
word retraced their steps to the small
boat and made for the ship, which was
now facing outward, anchor hoisted
and sails spread once more, so the
watching Highlanders had a view of a
large vessel superbly managed, as the
west wind which brought her Into the
harbor took her safely out again.
The royal young man had a striking
lesson on the fickleness of the populace*
Heretofore, as MacDonald had truly
said, no one had a good word to say for
the King; now It was evident that
James V of Scotland was the greatest
and wisest monarch that ever sat on a
throne.
Malcolm MacLeod had been always
so proud of his skill that this proclama
tion could hardly augment his self
esteem, but it suddenly changed his
views regarding his august overlord. In
conversation ever after it became, "I
and the King," and he was almost will
ing to admit that - James was -very
nearly as great a man a* AlÂ«ander
MacLeod of Dunvegan.
The reader now looked up from his
parchment and gazed over the assem
blage.
"Is Malcolm MacLeod here?" he
asked. "Let him step forward."
The giant, somewhat dazed, walking
like a man in a dream, approached the
foot of the cross. The officer rolled the
proclamation and presented It to the
shipbuilder, saying:
"From the hand of the King to the
hand of. Malcolm MacLeod."
Malcolm accepted it. muttering half
with a smile, half with a frown:
"E-god. the King knows a good boat
when he gets it!"
Then the officer uplifted his sword
and cried:
"God save the King," and now the
hills around re-echoed with the cheer

cerned. these Islanders would simply
take to the hills and defy it."
"Ah. well." said the Kins. "I'll make
them think better of me before I am
done with them."
The week's festivities /were to end
with a grand poetical contest- All the
bards of the island were scribbling; at
any rate, those who could write. But
this Homeric competition was endan
gered by disquieting news brought to
the island by the fishermen. They re
ported that a powerful fleet had been
seen rounding the northern coast of
Scotland, and was now making toward
the south. This unexpected Intelligence
seemed to change Instantaneously thÂ«
attitude of the Islanders toward their
two guests.
The King's alertness of mind saved
the situation. He had brought with
him from Stirling, 'in case of emer
gencies, several sheets of blank parch
ment, each bearing the Great Seal of
Scotland. Once more the useful Mac-
Donald was his amanuensis. A procla
mation in Gaelic was written and the
signature of James IV Inscribed
thereon- This document was Inclosed
with a communication containing di
rections to the admiral of the fleet, and
MacDonald intrusted the packet to one
of his gillies, with orders that sail
should be set for Loch Torrldon, and
the message given to the officer in com
mand. ' l â¢
Three days later the ferment on the
island was immeasurably Increased
when the guard on the headland report
ed that a ship of war was making di
rect for the harbor. A horseman was
dispatched full gallop to Dunvegan
Castle to inform the head of the clan

followed so sooa by the approach of
a belligerent vessel. 'But before the
messenger was ten miles on his way
the ceremony was over and done with.
The big ship sailed majestically
through the narrows, cast anchor and
fired a salute.' A well-; manned boat was
lowered and rowed to the shore. There
stepped from the 1 boat* 8n officer in a
splendid uniform, followed by a lieu
tenant and half a dozen men. one of
whom carried the flag of Scotland. This
icomRany marched ti> the cross, which
stood in the center of the village, and
the crowd sullenly followed, with Mal
colm. MacLeod at their head, not
knowing what the action of the naval
officer might porfend. and in absence
of 'definite orders^ from their chief.
hesUating to oppose this inland march.
Many of those on the fleet were High
landers, and 'the second in command
was one of them. This man mounted
the three steps at the foot of the cross
and. stood with his back against the
upright stone. His "chief handed him
a roll of parchment, and the subordi
nate officer In a loud voice, and in ex
cellent Gaelic, cried:
"A proclamation from his Most Ex
cellent Majesty. James V of Scotland!
God save the King!"
At this the chief officer raised his
sword in salute and his men sent up a
cheer, but the aggregation was not sec
onded by any of the large concourse
there gathered. Undaunted by this
frigid reception the officer unrolled
the manuscript and read its contents
in a voice that reached to the farthest
outskirts of the crowd:
"I, James of Scotland, lawful King of
this realm, do proclaim to all loyal sub
jects that the safety and liberty of my
land depends on an unconquerable fleet,
and that the merit of the fleet consists
In stout, well-built ships; therefore the
man whom I, the King, delight to honor

"It's mine." he protested k stoutly.

Lutie grew very red. She was angry
with her father for the jest; angry with
"Swaps" for what he had' done; but
most of all she was angry at Sandon.
It was unmanly, she declared to her
self, to make her the subject of a jest.
For a moment it looked to "Swaps"
as though the elegant trade was off.
Before he could spoil things by argu
ing, a note came from Sandon.
"Don't think," he wrote, "that I was
Joking when I let Jimmy have the ring.
It wasn't that, dear heart, but I have

For a moment Sandon was non

some day; hoped to make her his wife.
He had more than enough -\ for two,
and he felt that he was in every way
eligible, but he couldn'tpropose. The
set v forms he found In guides to court
ship were too flowery, and the set
speeches 'he formulated himself were
"too' blunt. .'
By skillful questioning he arrived at
the 'truth>f the. matter, and saw that
"Swaps'*; had accepted the proposition
seriously.,' Why should he. not turn
the , Â¦ JokV the other way and be as
serious as Swaps"? He reached out
his hand. "It's' a .trade, .'Swaps,' "he

ring." It .was an engagement ring
he had purchased when he had visited
New /York I the summer before. He
had dlways carried it with him, but
had never -had the courage to offer it.
"Swaps" was not without a poetical
vein, and the Ying gave him an idea.
He sought out his slater.

prefaced. She shook her head laugh

you forgive what is an impertinence,
because I saw In it my only chance to
tell you that I love you? Now that I
have found my voice I shall say It to
my dying day."
Lutle cried a little, but she put on
the ring and "Swaps" knew that he had
made the trade of his life. Mr. Carleton
was taken aback when he saw the turn
affairs had taken and added his apolo
gy to Sandon.
They had Sandon over to supper, and
a merry party It was after the Ice had
been broken by "Swaps" naively re
marking. "Say, Harry*d make a bully
swapper. He gives Lutle a ring to be
his. What's hers Is his, so he's got

And yet Jimmy was not miserly in
his habits. He- was quite willing to
sell a dilapidated watch case, for
which he had given a penny lead
pencil, to another for 10 cents, and
then treat to a soda at the corner
stand, where, soda might be. had for
2 cents the small glass.

When he went -Into the second reader
he eet aside the dollar which had been

and blue pen holder and three pens
which had not been used past a point
where they would write with a little

the series, from which It may 'be

CUPID'S CAPTAIN OF INDUSTRY
These days portieres are a great ad
junct to a well appointed house, and
the most beautiful ones are made to
match the tone of the room to a T.
Tapestry In any dull, rich tone is al-
harmonious. "But beautiful things
cost money," you say. That's very true,
but they do not cost any more or as
much, many times, as the ugly ones,
and In this day and generation there
Is an 'immense j line of conventional
hall papers that are offered the home
decorator. If your hall is small and
narrow put a smooth, soft gray paper
on It that never falls to be cool and
pleasing to look upon and let the few
pictures that dot it here and there be
landscapes that will give depth. But
if tbe hall is of any size the swellest
paper that can be purchased is an imi
tation of leather, and when It Is found
in a Pompeiian red with great sprawly
scrolls of silver, and copper In it it Is
the best kind of decoration in Itself.
Golden oak is a good, serviceable
woodwork and gives the room a cheer
ful aspect at- the same time, and there
Is scarcely a color that falls to blend
with it In a charming manner. And
then the allj-burnlng question of car
pets arises and confronts you with a
cold, etony gtare.* "Oh. don't put car
pets down" is heard from all sides, but
If you can afford a red Axmlnster car
pet, in' rather a mottled design, and
then throw as many Turkish rugs
about as you please, it adds on air of
cozlness and warmth that hardwood
floors and a wealth of nigs never does,
or can for that matter. If the house
does not belong to you it is far better
to Invest in rugs, as they are a decided
economy In the long run and can be
carried from; house to house with the
same good results.
If you have an old home begin by
tearing down a section of the partition
and forming an arch or. putting in a
great sliding door, and then turn your
thoughts to centuries long gone past.
If you would have it very dainty and
fetching choose Louis XV style, but. be
sure to remember that any period ] as
pronounced as this one does. not' permit
of. any old furniture, for then you
would have neither one thing nor the
other, but *a' most unpleasant jumble.

To be apropos, the carpet should be
brown, and as this room probably Is
one of the most popular a good scheme
is to use filling and then throw down
one brown and green carpet rug, which
has the advantage of being easily taken
up and thoroughly cleaned.
Perhaps the prettiest furniture Is
after the mission style, and it goes so
nicely with the room that It is almost a
shame not to select It. Put a high, old
fashioned clock In one corner to warn
people not to sit and toast their toes
quite all night, and decorate the walls
and the tiny shelf that encircles the
room with hunting scenes, or, in fact,
anything that especially catches your
fancy, provided they are. in the pretty
browns. And, above all, don't forget
the mantel, for a den wouldn't be a
den without an open fireplace, for con
tentment always rises with the fire
flickers, and the most delightful air
castles build themselves almost unbid
den.
Every one can't afford such a luxury,
but they cannot get along very well
without a dining-room. Jf you are wise
select a hunting scene in tapestry with
which to cover your walls, for that In
itself Is one of the handsomest adjuncts '
to a dining-room. Of course, tapestry
comes in an almost endless variety, but

every time you step across
the threshold? that rests
you every time you have an opportun
ity to sit down and look about? Be
cause, forsooth. If that Is the case you
can twist and turn, add a little here
and take away a little there, until you
will scarcely recognise your own house,
and certainly no one else would.
But one thing is absolutely necessary
to work this transformation and It Is
the gift of originality, and it this is
lacking your home will be merely a
house that is entirely innocent of any
expression or that boasts of the least
bit of individuality.
As a rule one house is precisely like
another and that is what you want to
avoid as though it were a deadly pest.
Instead of having the generous supply
of gingerbread work about change to
the simple, straight lines and low open

dignity that Is a positive relief.
In the first place the clumsy oak ban

always seems on the alert to catch the
hurrying folk Is a thing of the past.

homelike as you possibly can, so that
the room may be wqrthy of its name.

THE FURNISHING
OF A HOME
By Colin G. Colins
10case they will feel nÂ«!te at home, for
the "New Jerusalem" with World's
Fair crowds In attendance will be
very much like the old Jerusalem at
Eastertide, when thousands of pil
grims throng its narrow streets.
These streets themselves are calcu
lated to astonish the Occidental pll
frrlm. Hardly any of them exceed ten
feet In width, and some are much nar
rower. In the center Is & ditch or trench
for the passage of beasts of burden. As
the trenches are wide enough for only
one beast at a time it is quite probable
that here, as In the real city m Pales
tine, there will be various fierce rival
ries for the right of way between the
owners or renters of camels and don
keys. .
Fifty camels from Jerusalem will be
brought to the new city. A considerable
number of donkeysâ the real Jerusalem
sortâ will belong to the necessary fur
nishings of the city. These animals
will provide a source of amusement to
the visitors and profit to the conces
sionaires. The pilgrim to Jerusalem,
tiring of walking through the narrow
streets, may hire a donkey or a humpy
camel and ride triumphantly between
the rows of houses, his legs almost
touching the walls on each side at some
particularly narrow points along the
way.
Across the moat that bounds the cit
adel Market square Is being laid out.
This is a wide space leading off from
the Street of David. Here the Inhabit
ants of the "New Jerusalem" will buy
and sell goods necessary for culinary
uses. The plcturesqueness of the mar
ket place need not be pointed oat.
In the Mohammedan quarter of the
city a big Arabian cafe will be located,
where the hungry pllgrrtnis may dine la
tree Oriental style.
Across from market square Is a row
of buildings Biore modern In pattern
than most of the structures in the city.
These are the Austrian postofflce, the
United States consulate and Cook's
tourist office. On the other side of the
square the outer gate of the citadel ad

Climbing the Inner terrace one enters

Tower of HIppicus.
egy and bribery, and even then at great
risk, could any person other than a
Mohammedan enter.
It Is this sacred 'Inclosure, with Its
grand mosque and other Interesting
structures, that Is being reproduced at
St. Louis. During the exposition the
temple area will be given over to the
Mohammedans, the general visitor of
course being admitted. Here the fol
lowers of Mohammed from Jerusalem
will carry on their forms of worship.
Among the wonderful things to be
shown in this transplanted temple area
are the tomb of David, the great King
of Judea, and the throne of King Solo-'
mon, his son and the builder of the
temple.
The mosque Is octagonal in form,
each side measuring 67 feet. Various
colored marbles form the lower portion
of the wall, arranged in intricate and
beautiful patterns. Fifty-six pointed
windows of magnificent stained glass
pierce the upper portion. The great
dome is covered with lead, surmounted
by a tall gilt crescent. Underneath the
dome is a remarkable limestone rock of
irregular shape, which is believed to
be the natural surface of the ,rock of
Mount Morlah, upon which the Im
mense platform supporting the mosque
and the. temple area is built. An Iron
railing surrounds this, sacred stone, to
protect it from the touch of pilgrims.
At' one corner of the rock Is an exca
vated chamber, which, according to Mo
hammedan tradition, was successively
the praying place of Abraham, David,
Solomon and Jesus. ; .Â¦ â¢
In the" "New Jerusalem" at St.* Louis
the Golden Gate will be restored. This
famous gateway, the exact location' of
which has been' lost for ages, was used
in Solomon's time .and for centuries
thereafter as an entrance to the temple
area from outside the city. The Golden
the temple area and called the Haram
es-Sherlf by the Mohammedans, has
been holy ground for nearly four thou
sand years. Temple after temple has
been bullded upon it, to rail before suc
cessive invadersâ Assyrian, Roman,
Mohammedan. Within this area have
worshiped the followers of the God of
Abraham, the believers in Jesus of
Nazareth and the zealous and fanatic
adherents of Mohammed. Even, a pagan
temple, built by Hadrian, has occupied
the site of Solomon's magnificent tem
ple. At times, for generations, the area
has been but a tumble of ruins, yet It
has not i ceased for a moment to be
venerated as a holy place by the fol
lowers of some great religious prophet.
Around the walls razed and rebuilt
from time to time the great religions
of the world have surged and struggled
for possession of the area. These walls
have been drenched with blood and the
maimed bodies of defender and ag
gressor have strewn the area. Even
the Saracenic mosque now standing has
changed masters repeatedly, being
taken by the Crusaders under Godfrey
of Bouillon In the year 1099. Then the
cross took the place of the crescent,
until the expulsion of the Christians by
Saladin, when once more the Moslem
symbol was planted.. * .
' Now the Mohammedans hold the area
and ' worship within the mosque built
by the, great Omar, ; or at ; the prayer
places here and there within the sacred
inclosure. It was; not '1' until ''recent
years that Jew or Christian . per
mitted to enter this ' Inclosure .except
on peril of death, so zealous were Its
Moslem keepers i lest the , sacred space
be .profaned by those Â¦who,' from .their
'standpoint, 'are unbelievers.;: Strenuous
efforts were made - for many years \ to
obtain photographs or. drawings of the
Interior of the mosque. Only by strat-
Gate wiil form the mid-northern en
trance to Jerusalem.
St. Stephen's Gate is at the north
west corner of the wall. It was near
this entrance to the Holy City where
the stoning of Stephen took place.
The gate leads Into the Via Dolorosa,
mentioned before. It leads also to the
inner gate of St. Stephen's, through
which, at the exposition, the visitor
will pass into a hall in which a dio
rama of the Mount of Olives will
show memorable scenes in the life
of Christ, the Garden of Gethsemane
and other localities of sacred interest
being shown.
In the several acres of land lying
between the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher and the temple area there Is
rapidly building . a great array of
smaller houses, exact copies of the
buildings that' occupy the corespond-
Ing streets in -Jerusalem. When com
pleted about three hundred of these
houses will appear, more than a
dozen streets being completely repro
duced. Among these thoroughfares
are the Moorish street. Chemists*
street. Coppersmiths* street. Silver
smiths' ' street, Jewish street and
others.' The name of each thorough
fare affords an idea as to its charac
ter. In Jerusalem the workers In one
occupation pre-empt a whole streetâ
that is to say, all the coppersmiths
have their shops on one street, all the
chemists on another, and so on.
In these streets, whjch are very
narrow, .the IWorld's Fair visitor will
find native artisans and tradesmen of
Jerusalem plying their vocations. The
silversmith will live above his shop.
Just as he does at home. It is. not at
all unlikely that some of the natives
who come to, St. Louis, will be 'â¢Â¦ privi
leged to occupy the very house â¢ that
corresponds to their own, and in that
Within this citadel Herod erected hi*
palace, building noble towers at three
of the corners to serve for defense and
ornamentation. Josephus, the great
historian of antiquity, says that these*
towers excited the admiration of Titus,
the conqueror, after the destruction of
the rest of the city, and were left
standing, partly as memc rials of his
conquest and partly as shelter and pro.
tection to the camp or garrison which,
he left behind upon his departure.
Herod named these towers after hl3
wife, whom he had put to death be
cause of his Jealousy; his brother.
Phasaelus, and his friend, HIppicus.
The Tower of HIppicus still stands.
The towers named for Phasaelus and
for Mariamne, the dead Queen, have
perished, though newer structures have
arisen In their stead. One of these,
called the Tower of David, is being re
produced opposite the Tower of Hippl
cus, and near the Jaffa gate also arises.
In stone-like staff, the Tower of Pha
saelus'.
At the remaining corner of thÂ» cita
del is the Jewish Synagogue, In which
the Hebrew natives from the Holy City
will worship during their sojourn at
the World's Fair. Not far away,
across a garden, is one of the most cu
riously interesting features of the en
tire reproduction. This Is the Jews*
wailing wall. Here the Jews are wont
to gather, against a wall which sepa
rates them from the temple area, and
pray for the restoration of the sacred
inclosure. Until comparatively recent
years the Mohammedans refused to
permit the Jews to approach even this
near to the sacred Inclosure, but after
much persuason It was permitted tho
descendants of the builder of the tem
ple to approach this wall and wail out
their, sorrow because of the loss of the
sacred soil of Zlon. and pray for Its
restoration to toe Jews.
The large court In front of the church
its pavement worn by the feet of In
numerable pilgrims, is to be reproduced
accurately. Beneath the central dome
of the church, which was rebuilt by
the Greeks after having been destroyed
by fire, is the sepulcher within a white
marble edifice. This is divided into two
small edifices, in the first of which Is
found the stone where the angels were
seated when they repjied to the holy
women, "He is not here, but is risen "
The second sanctuary incloses the sep
ulcher. Lig-hts from lamps of gold and
silver are always burning In this chapel
and the air is redolent with burning
perfumes.
At Oberammergau there is an annual
production of the Passion play, which
has attracted world-wide attention
There the living. Christ is Impersonated
by an actor. Here at St; Louis will
be shown in reproduced outward as
pect what many persons believe to be
the sepulcher of the Savior. For long
ages devout men and women have
made pilgrimages to that spot from
many carts of the world.
But there Is now building within this
world's fair tract a structure which is
a more prominent architectural feature
In Jerusalem than the Church of the
Holy Sepulcher. The Mosque of Omar
Is being reproduced in staff/resting
upon Its mighty platform, with Its won
derful dome towering high above the
city. The site of the Holy Sepulcher
Is disputed, but no one questions that
the ground upon which stands the
Mosque of Omar is the Identical site of
Solomon's temple and the temple of.
Herod the Great, from which Christ
scourged the money changers.-
This considerable ; tract cf land in
Jerusalem, known to Christendom as
but certain features of the medieval
architecture remain, and these are be
ing reproduced In connection with the
.replica of this venerable church at St.
Louis.
which stands the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher, with the holy sepulcher it
self reproduced in proper position at
the east end. This Church of the Holy
Sepulcher has been for centuries the
subject of controversy among schol
ars and ecclesiasts. Traditionally, it
is built upon the site of the crucifixion.
The original Church of the Holy Sepul
cher was erected upon the present site
by ,the Emperor Constantine. The
church was destroyed and rebuilt re
peatedly, in the centuries of flerc*
struggle for possession of the Holy
City between Christian and Moslem.
When the. Crusaders took Jerusalem
they enlarged the extent of the church
considerably. The present building was
erected early In the nineteenth century.
Here the Mohammedan will find hia
sacred mosque, the Jew his synagogue,
the Christian his church or chapel.
Here each will walk about familiar
streets, dwell In houses identical In
pattern with those in which they dwell
at home, and engage in the same trades
or other occupations that engage their
time and talents in the Holy City.
In short, seven months of next year
Jerusalem, St Louis, U. S. A., will
be peopled by natives of Jerusalem, the
Holy City. Arrangements are being
made v.hereby about one thousand In
habitants of Jerusalem will be brought
to St. Louis to take up their residence
during the seven months of the expo
sition ir.slde this 11-acre walled city.
Amor.; these people will be Mohamme
dans, Jews and Christians, each wor
shiping after his own fashion and liv

city, just as he lives and worships at
home.
fy T. LOUIS, Jan. 6.â If any Ameri-
Oy can child had desired to spend
YJ Christmas in Jerusalem, the
Holy City, it would not have
been necessary for him to cross the seas
and travel alar in alien lands. He could
have ccme to St. Louis, where on a
tract of land included in the World's
Fair grounds Jerusalem is being built.
True, it Is not the actual Jerusalem of
Bible times, but It Is a reproduction,
xsarvelously accurate, cf the Jerusalem
that stands to-day u^on the site In
Palestine which for thirty-eight centu
ries has been holy ground â revered
alike by Jew. Christian and Moslem.
Many remarkable things are being
prepared for the World's Fair, but none
that surpasses this in any of the essen
tial elements of human interest. Here
and there throughout the grounds are
reproductions of celebrated buildings,
each as have been seen before at other
expositions, though not in such number
and excellence cf selection: but here,
for the first time in the world, a city Is
being reproduced, and that city the one
of all the world most intensely inter
esting to the people of Christendom.
This is not a panorama, or cyclo
rama, it may be proper to point out to
those who are incredulous; it Is an
actual city, which is being built out
doors of wood and etan*; and it is no
toy city, but is of actual size so far as
the area that is being rebuilt goes.
This reproduction of Jerusalem oc
cupies over eleven acres of land. It in
cludes practically all the features of
the Holy City which are of deeply in
timate Interest to the Bible student
and to any person to whom the won
derful story of Jesus of Nazareth, or
the narratives of the Old Testament,
are of interest. When the World's Fair
opens, nothing will be lacking In "The
New Jerusalem," as this reproduction
Is called, to show life in the modem
city of thÂ« great King as It really isâ
with Moslem and Jew and Christian
dwelling in separate quarters or ming
ling together in the curious and quaint
marts of trade.

One of the points of interest on the
right-hand side of the Street of David
is the wheat market, with dirt floor,
in which Jew and Gentile strive for
commercial . mastery. It is vastly less
magnificent than the Stock Exchange
in New York, but as a place of busi
ness activity in this sacred city it has
its unfailing Interest. *, c, - Â¦â¢

while farther along on that 3lde ap
pear two modern hotels, which are re

ing the exposition the numerous per
sons connected with the management
of the "New Jerusalem." The Street
of David runs on to the west gate,
crossing the Via Dolorosa, along which
thoroughfare, according to tradition,
Jesua bore his cross on the way to the
crucifixion on Calvary. Here will be

over with houses, will be Jerusalem
transplanted for the time in the New
World, and as such cannct fail to at
tract the attention of millions of per
sons who are unable to visit the ac
tual city In Palestine. Any boy or girl
who is reasonably familiar with mod
ern Jerusalem, through pictures or
books, would find much to suggest the
Holy City in the reproduction now
building here, should a visit be paid
to the site. First to attract the at
tention would be the outer wall of
the city. The entire tract is being in
closed In a wall of the dimensions of
the actual wall of Jerusalem. Wood
and staff, instead of stone, are used in
the construction, but so cleverly is
the staff molded and colored that it
closely resembles the real stono
"round about" Jerusalem. The arch
itect visited Jerusalem personally and
studied with minute care the con
struction of the walls, towers and in
terior dwellings and other edifices
which they v.-ere to reproduce at St.
Louis, so that in all essential respects
the "New Jerusalem" will be identi
cal in appearance with ita original.
Travelers now may go from Jaffa
to Jerusalem by railroad. Thousands
of pilgrims, however, annually ap
proach the Holy City by the ancient
highway, on the backs of camels or
donkeys or trudging along on foot.
For the sake of comparison we may
let the Palace of Fine Arts stand for

start from this superb edifice, filled
with ancient and modern .works of

11Keep Touch With Your Friends.
On the other hand. If a man has a
good wife he has the best friend it is
possible to have. "A man's best friend,"
says Bulwer Lytton, "Is a wife of good
sense and good heart, -whom he loves
and who loves him. In woman there
is at once a subtle delicacy of tact and
aÂ»plaln soundness of Judgment which
are rarely combined to an equal de
gree in a man.' A woman, If she be
really your friend, will have a sensitive
regard for your character, honor, re
pute. She will seldom counsel you to
do a shabby thing, for a woman always
desires to be proud of you. At the
same time her constitutional timidity
makes her more cautious than your
male friend. She, therefore,, seldom
counsels you to do an imprudent deed."
A wife best shows her .. friendliness
by clipping - from her husband's
moral nature little twigs that 'are growi
ing in the wrong direction. If. he. say
anything silly . she will , affectionately
tell him so. If he declares that he will
"candid friends," as they called them
selxes. but as they were without sym
pathy and cared more to inflict pain
than to morally improve us, their fault
finding did no good. An old man once
quaintly remarked that though his ac
quaintances would fill a church, his
real friends could be packed in a pul
pit Too many so-called friends are
like the London omnibuses, hailing us
in fine weather, and shunning us in
wet When, however, we have got a
friend who Is always the same, who
knows the best and the worst of us,
and who lores us in spite of our faults
âthen we have a fortune indeed.
- In one respect friendship is above
blood-relationship. I cannot -help hav
ing relations, but I choose my friends.
If my chosen friend is great, I am
great; for to make a friend of one
truly great we must be able to appre
ciate greatness. Nothing dignifies and
soothes the ordinary affairs of life so
much as friendship. When It exists be
tween mistress and maid the servant
difficulty disappears. If a parent and
child are not ;riends, the parent is a
despot and the child a slave. What
can we call married life without a
friendship, but joint-stock housekeep

your nose at so recklessly."
Mr. Larkins finally grew decidedly
discontented and a little puzzled.
"I don't understand you, ma'am," he
admitted, in one of his mental apos
trophes to the widow. "I have so far
modified my, views as to give you every
opportunity to signify your wish to be
come airs. Larkins, and yet you're as
cool and calm as a bale of snow. I'm
not used to it, ma'am, and I won't
stand it. I'll give you three weeks more
to get interested in me, and then I'll
take and propose to youâ that's about
what I'll do."
When the allotted three weeks of
grace had expired Mr. Larkins, in des
peration, executed his threat and re
ceived a plump "No!" â the result of
Miss Podderly's championship and a
streak of contrariness in .the widow's
disposition.
He accepted the sentence with visi
ble disappointment, but bore it with
manly fortitude.
"I'm sorry, ma'am," he said, frankly,
"tearing sorry. I've taken more of a
shine to you, somehow, than I ever did
to any one, and I'd be good to you,
you can bank on that. But If you can't
like me you can't. There now, ma'am,
don't go and cry â don't I wouldn't
hurt your feelings for forty farms," for
the widow's "heart all at once had
smitten her sharply, and some subtle
pathos in Mr. Larkins' simple accept
ance of defeat caused her eyes to brim
with misty tears.
"I'm so-oo-o sorry," she faltered,
blushing and sobbing, "I "
"Don't mention it," Implored Mr.
Larkins, "don't you be miserable or
blue about it. But if you should â kind
of change your mind, you know, ma'am,
Just let me know; won't you?"
Mr. Larkins dove headlong into his
garden patch and hoed vigorously to
distract his thoughts, and the widow
sat down on the edge of her porch and
swung her neat little foot dejectedly.
"I do believe I'm half-witted." said
she under "her breath. "I dare Bay I've
lost as good a man as I'll ever meet,
and all because Henrietta Podderly told
me to run after him. I needn't have
run after him. but I could have thrown
him away, and I ain't half as smart as
I thought I was. I'm lonely and mis
erable, wooâ ooâ oo." Mrs. Bittersweet
ran Into" her eittlng-room and cried as
heartily as Mr. Larkins hoed.
After that she smiled suanily when
ever she met him. He smiled genially.
Th^. widow daintily became more lone
some and more convinced that she had
discarded a congenial spirit
"He won't propose. again In a hun
dred years," shs bemoaned herself,
"aild.no wonder he don't want to risk
another snub. He did tell me to let
him know If I changed my mind: I hate
"Took about as much notice of me as
she would of a brindle dog," he com
plained to himself; "in fact, not as
much. She pets up all the old stray
dogs and gives 'em bones. What's the
matter with me. I'd like to know?"
He looked anxiously Into the mirror
as he brushed his hair. He saw therein
a good looking and fairly good natured
face, the chief defect of which was an
expression tending toward self-conceit
"Now, ma'am," he observed decisive
ly, addressing the absent widow,
"you've got to see me and : appreciate
me: then If you choose to take advan
tage of leap year privileges, I don't
really know as I'll run away."
' Meantime Mrs. Bittersweet's atten
tion . had j been directed to. Mr. Larkins
by her friend, Miss Podderly.
"He's the smartest man In Blbbvtlle."
said she, ."and got - everything , in his

'rwell."- said -Miss Podderly, '?Iwlsh
I had : the opportunities you turn up

Mr. Alonzo Larkins stared ap
iuchensively out of his window,
as% - if he expected to see his
newly arrived neighbor flitting up his
porch steps in search of him >wlth a
lasso. Instead he really did Bee a small,
-'inoffensive looking woman walking se
renely from her doorway toward her
own front lawn, bearing a pot of pan
sles and a trowel.
â¢'Oh, of course," he continued caus
tically, "wants to make a good impres
sion first before- she lets out at me.
Well, ma'am, my- heart Is tough. But
you are a neat little bundle," he added
with a slight change of tone; "trim as
a sassafras whistle. That's right â let
that ruflitd up pink contraption slide
oil' your head. Gum, what shiny brown
hair! And look at the little curl bob
bing over her off ear!" â¢ v
Little Mrs. 'Bittersweet did not seem
at all troubled by the orb Mr. Larkins
deemed it expedient to keep focused
upon her. .She trotted around about
her. own business, paying little heed to
the doings of her bachelor .neighbor.
The first time she met him plump and
square she gave him a sweet, indiffer
ent little neighborly "Good morning,"
which somehow excited his discontent
and Ire.
When Kingsley attributed his success
as a writer and a clergyman to the fact
that he had a friend he was probably
thinking of his wife. Indeed he used
often to say that but for her sympathy
and influence he never would have be
come a writer. He met the girl. who
was to be his wife when he was only
20 years cf age. He was at the time
full of doubts about religion and his
face, with Its unsatisfied, hungering
look, bore witness to the state of his
mind. He told her of his doubts and
she told him her faith, and the former
was dispelled by the latter. Writing
to. Mrs. Kingsley- from the seaside,
where he had gone in search of health,
he said: "This place Is perfect: but It
seems a dream 'and Imperfect 'without
you. Absence quickens love Into con
sciousness. I never before felt the lone
liness of being without the beloved be
ing whose every look and word and mo
tion are the keynotes of my life."
Not a few great men have confessed
that they were marriage- made to a
very considerable extent. "It is often
the cas'e when you see a great man,
like ,a ship, sailing proudly along the
current of renown, that there Is a little
tug â his wife â whom you cannot see.
but who is dlre'cting hig movements and
supplying the motive power." Could
any one have had a better friend than
Sir James Macintosh had in his wife?
He says that by tender management of
his weaknesses she gradually corrected
the most pernicious of them.
When a man is unpopular, and the
world frowns -upon him, then the
friendship of a good wife is as faith
ful as it is valuable. Lady Rachel
Russell sat beside her husband day aft
er day during his public trial, taking
notes and doing everything to help him.

History of Paley's Christianity.
When the celebrated theological
writer. Archdeacon Paley, was an un
dergraduate at Oxford, he associated
v.1th a fast set and wasted his time.
One night after a "wine" the wildest
cf these companions came to his bed-
Bide and said, ."Paley. I have been
thinking that you are wasting your
opportunities by your idleness. We
have rot brains, and could not do much
even if we worked, but It is different
vrith you. and If you do not work I
xrxuKt give up your society." Such words
corcir.g from such a eource made Paley
think. He lay awake all night arrang
ing hoars and plans for work, and from
that night was an altered man. He
may be eald to have written hie "Evi
dences cf Christianity" and bis other
work* because he had a friend who was
less afraid of giving offense than of
allowing: him to throw himself away.
It is of course very difficult, how
ever, to get a friend who is as faithful
as this. We may have suffered from

One golden afternoon when both were
sitting, In an unusually pensive mood,
upon Mrs. Bittersweet's porch, the wid
ow's heart suddenly prompted her to a
little prospecting.
"Mr. Larkins," she said, softly. "do
you ever change your mind?"
"No," returned Mr. Larkins pluxapJy,
"not without solid reason."
"We-ell," she continued, TÂ»"ldf"r her
breath at her own boldness, "would you
still like me toâ Â«râ Â«r â beâ be" â
Her meaning rushed through Mr.
Larkins like a streak of electricity. He
sprang out of his lolling attitude at a
bounce.
"Polly, If you're asking me If Yd
like you to be my wife, I say yeÂ»â yeÂ«â
yes. I didn't dare to ask you again,
but you've a perfect right to ask me.
even if I hadn't told you to. for it's

"Why, I've actually as good as asked
you to marry me." gasped Polly, "Just
what I've always declared I'd die rather
than do! Oh. well." as Alonzo's arm
stole protectlngly around her waist, "I
guess I was excusable this time. But.

"Never," vowed Alonzo, kissing her.

MRS. BITTERSWEET'S PROPOSAL.
How miserable it must be for hus
band and wife, as they si^ opposite to
each other, day by day, not to be able
to say, "I have a friend" in him or h$r.
Perhaps they are not upon . speaking
terms, in which case the tete-a-tete
meals which . they take together must
be sad and awkward indeed. Often,
too, painfully ludicrous consequences
result when the master and mistress of
a house are not friends. Reynolds In
his "Life and Times" tells of a free
and-easy actor who passed three fes
tive days at the seat of the Marquis
and Marchioness of without any
invitation, convinced (as proved to be
the case) that, my lord and lady not
being on speaking terms, each would
suppose that the other had asked him.
"According to Milton, Eve kept silent
in Eden to hear, her husband talk,"
said, a gentleman to a lady friend, and
then added, in a melancholy tone,
"Alas, there have been no Eves, since."
"Because," retorted the lady, "there
have been no husbands worth listening
to." Certainly there are too few men
who exert themselves to be as agreeable
to their wives (their, best friends) as
they are' to the comparative strangers or
secret ; enemies J whom -. they meet at
clubs and other places of resort It is a
great thing for husband and wife to be
able* to .'say, after years of married life
that each: has in;the other a true friend.
This : was the : happiness of James" Nas
myth, the inventor .'of the steam ham
mer, anaVnls Â¦; wif e. v The former said :
"Forty^twoj yeans of married life finds
us the 'same 'devoted cronies that we
were": at the beginning." ' This was bet
ter, than ,the mere, gunpowder passion
that barely survives the honeymoon, i
The experience which Klngaley had
of the value of true friendship made
him the more able and willing to ex

everything she wants in this world,

But she is a comfortable, practical
sort of little person, a good manager
of household finances and at all times

being bamboozled, she is about the
most interesting type of wife you can
find.
There is one type of woman who goes
through the world successfully solely
on the strength of her profile. She is
the woman with the so-called Grecian
nose. Usually she is large and ox
eyed, stupid and statuesque, but so im
posing in appearance that she manages
to hold an important position wherever
6hR goes, without doing trÂ»e least thins
to merit it. She is made president o?
her club simply because she looks im
pressive in the chair of honor. Her Â¦
husband adores her and treats her with
a deference that is due â her Grecian
nose. But the man who marries the
woman with the Greek profile has to
work for his honors. She requires a
handsome setting and invariably being
ceased to struggle. If you want a
pretty picture warranted to wear well
and to adorn your drawing-room, a
wife v.ho will always be a credit to you
and ma.ke your neighbors' wives ap

ths Grecian profile.
The girl with the irregular nose Is in
a class all by herself. She is a fas

She was never born to be married, and

attributes that a man demands In a
wife. Stupid she is never, she is seldom

regularity of a woman's face. Deep

they cut gracefully and give it! a beauty

woman with the irregular nose, unlike
any of her sisters, possesses a sense of
humor. But she Is as unreliable as the
winds. To-day she Is in love with a
man and to-morrow with a book or a
picture or a profession; to-day she is
satisfied to sit at home by the domestic

woman who keeps a man's nerves in a

The average woman does not half
value her profile. She will spend hours
massaging her complexion, curling her
hair and beautifying her eyes, and then
will dismiss her nose with a dab of the
powder puff. Elizabeth of German gar

friends: "She has a good nose; but

It la not the shape of the nose but
the way a woman carries It that makes

nose may be carried with an air that

It is possible to carry a perfect Ore

woman with the Greek profile should
carry her ehln erect, but not tilted up

give her profile Just sufficient promi

ALEC AND
HIS COUNTRY
COUSIN
(Copyright, 1903. by Albert Britt.)
PS-wi NCE upon a time there was a tailor-made
gS-js'j article of the Aleck brand whose princi-
pal occupation and amusement con
Â«Â§H s * stC( * ' n burning large red holes in the
'&M night air along Broadway. He was the
!5Â£i<fj real original rounder. What he didn''t
know about the little old town after the
gas lamps were lighted wouldn't have
made even a first-class police captain's report, and the
things that he did know would have kept Dr. Parkhurst
in good spirits for at least three sermons, two inter
views and a letter to the Mayor. According to his own
account of the matter he was one of the most prominent
discouragers of the overproduction of spirituous liquors
in the borough of Manhattan. Half the chorus girls on
Broadway called him by his first name and any nighthawk
in the tenderloin could take him home at 2 o'clock in the
morning without looking in his inside pocket for his
card. His nightly course down the Rialto was barked
by' a broad trail of empty bottles and hiccoughs and his
landlady had a funnel around the keyhole in the front
door so that Aleck could let himself in without scratching
off all the varnish. It may appear from these few sug
gestions that Aleck knew his way around somewhat.
Now, Aleck was afflicted with a country cousin who
rejoiced in the artistic cognomen of Hen, marked down
from Henry. To the untutored eye Hen was most of
the things that Aleck was not. He couldn't tell the dif
ference between a dry Martini and a Krag-Jorgcnsen and
his wildest diversion was being drawn on the jury at
Kenosha* Center every two or three years. He wore
freckles and a two by eight smile cut bias and spent most
of his leisure time trying to get away from his hands and
untangling his feet.
One fall after" all the pumpkins were husked and the
undersized potatoes had been properly and carefully ar
ranged in the bottoms of the barrels and other simple
agricultural duties had been attended to Hen sold a
couple of fat steers and announced his intention of in
vesting the proceeds in one glad illumination of the me
tropolis. When Aleck heard the tidings of the bucolic
relative who was about to be visited upon him he went
away by himself to conceal his joy. The difference be-
tween black and white is Infinitesimal as compared with
the great gulf that is fixed between sticking the inof
fensive country cousin for a month's board in the summer
time and putting up for that same country cousin for a
few days during the ensuing winter.
When Hen arrived to begin his career of crime in the
heart of the metropolis Aleck mildly suggested that they
start in gently with a trip to the Eden Musee. Hen
didn't know what it was, but the Eden part of it tickled
his fancy and he allowed that he reckoned he was game-
After a thorough investigation of this chaste and uplift
ing exhibition Aleck led, his innocent .and confiding rela
tive from the tall grass a wild chase up Fifth avenue and
showed him the dining-room .'of the Waldorf-Astoria
through the windows â and some of the homes of the un
happy rich. The next night he proposed to gladden his
soul by a visit to the dried fruit show at Madison Square
Garden, which he assured Hen was one of the swellest
affairs on the Â¦ programme. Then they could wind: up
their career of wild dissipation by'a two hour seance in
the' bosom of the annual convention of the Young Men's
Association for the Suppression of the Morning After
Feeling. i
At this point in his wistful meditations Hen pulled his
city relative down to earth with a thump and whispered in
plaintive accents that he hadn't come down to New York
to cultivate his intellect and otherwise add to the dull
ness of the universe. A man didn't need to leave home
to do that. What his soul thirsted for was the flicker of
the'gaslamps with the red shades and the soft gurgle of
the Maraschino cherry in its native lair. The next night
they foregathered with a 50-cent table d'hote in Twenty
seventh street, one of those; abodes of Bacchus haunted
by, wit,' beauty hnd the incense of somber, dark-browed
Swiss cheese, run by a Frenchman from Long Island _City,
where the wine is throWn Â»in and ought to be thrown out.

from up State; and daring tourists' from faraway Rahwaji,

NEMO'S
FABLE FOR THE
FOOLISH
New Jersey, so that they can tell the folks at home what
a devilish place New York is after dark. If Aleck thought
that his bucolic cousin's thirsty soul was going to be sat
isfied with any such imitation dissipation as that he wa3
barking up the wrong tree. Hen's soul didn't get thirsty
more than once or twice in a lifetime, but this was one
of the times that no one could ring an overworked table
d'hote in on him and call it an adult entertainment. A
man who has been brought up on hard cider and alcohol
flavored with A little water desires something with more
teeth in it than Rhein wine made in Jersey.
After they had absorbed a few samples of food they
wandered out into the stilly night again and the pro
cession moved up Broadway with Hen in the lead. Every
time he saw a. door that swung both ways he executed a
flank movement and lined his forces up along the breast
works with one foot on the rail at the bottom. Inside of
half an hour he had his hat on the back of his head and
was ordering his nerve tonic without any advice from
Aleck. At first Aleck entered into the spirit of the occa
sion, but there was too much spirit for even him, and be
fore they reached Forty-second street he was among the
also rans and Hen was asking him if he had been eating
something that disagreed with him. Just as he was going
down for the third time Aleck had a vague recollection,
of seeing Hen giving the dispenser of liquid refreshment
instruction in the manner of filling a new prescription for
snake bite. He came to as Hen was tucking him away
in his downy couch just long enough to hear his unso
phisticated relative from the backwoods announce that
he was going out to begin all over again where he left
Off.
The next morning Aleck was a close imitation of a
lemon that has been working overtime at a church so
ciable, while Hen was as fresh as a daisy and ready to
go to bat for another inning. It was three times and out
for Aleck. The next two nights were blazing reproduc
tions of the first round, and when Hen retired to his
rural fastness he had reduced Aleck to such a sad condi
tion of body, and mind that he would go three blocks out
of his way at the sight of a picture of a goat of the Wil
liam persuasion with his front feet on a barrel.
As will have* been observed this touching tale has
neither moral nor morals, but the point of the whole
matter is that not only are two heads better than one, but
some. heads arc better than others, and by no means all
the cabbage-heads are grown in tLe country.

Yet, as Me.ca.ulay says In substance,
"Parties often survive long after the
issues which called them into existence
have been settled," bo the cry for free
coinage did not cease. In the canvass
of 1900 It was still an issue In the Far
West, and those Republicans who had
left their party to support Bryan in
18% on account of it did not escape
criticism if they returned to their al
legiance.
There was a great political meeting
in a far western community and the
speaker of the evening was a noted free
coinage advocate who had returned to
the Republican fold. He explained the
reason for his action, and claimed that
for the United States alone to attempt
free coinage would be- to Mexicanize our
currency. Thereupon a loud voiced op
ponent in the audience interrupted him
with the question, "Which is the beÂ«t
for us to become, a Mexican colony or
to remain as now slaves of England?"
The speaker paused. "I cannot answer
that question," said he. "Ah ha! 1

appointed colonel. I selected all of the
staff and most of the company officers,
and the regiment did good service, al
though as it happened it was never
called upon for service in Alabama.
When the war was over we/were mus
tered out, and I went to California and
opened an office in San Francisco as a
mining stock broker.- 1 corresponded oc
casionally with my old comrades. One
day after reconstruction had been ef
fected and Alabama admitted . I re
ceived by pony expressâ for the rail
road was not then completedâ a letter
signed by several of the former officers
of my regiment. They,/ stated in sub
stance that they had been eleceted
members of the State Legislature,
which would convene in a few months;
that two United States Senators were
to be elected: that there were a dozen
candidates; that they had no prefer-*
ences, and If I were on the ground they
believed that they could*, effect a com
bination that would secure my election.
I wired my acceptance of that proposi
tion, and the next day my broker's of â¢'â¢
flee was for. rent and I was en route fojr
Alabama by the overland road. Al-
"I wondered." said Nesmlth. "when

that Black had an appointment with

fully explained to me when Black add

Finally Mr. Black appeared arrayed
In a dressing gown and slippers. The
twain entered Into conversation and
conversed and _ conversed and con

then 9. then 10. By this time Nesmith
was thoroughly acquainted with the
history of-Pennsylvanla from the time
of William Penn, and Blade .was pos
sessed of all the details of the Lewis
and Clark expedition.
Shortly after 10 o'clock Black arose
and said, "You will have to excuse me.
Senator, for I have an appointment
with a lady."
Nesmlth used to tell his friends of
his having accepted an invitation to
dine with Jeremiah S. Black. The exi
gencies of life in Oregon demanded
for evening dress the old-fashioned
long-tailed double-breasted broadcloth
frock, which was the very summit
of fashion. But Washington was dif
ferent, bo the Senator placed a hnrry
order for a dress suit. It arrived Just
in time, and with his stalwart form
incased in it he hurried to the home
of the Pennsylvanian.
The servant showed him Into the draw
ing-room and took his card. Nesmith
seated himself and waited for some
time.
Our hopes were not fulfilled, for the
ledges "petered" and I returned to law,
practice. Before I left that section I
was employed by a gentleman named
Shirley in a cattle case. Among the
Idiosyncrasies of * Oregon legislation
there is or was a law by which a
Grand Jury consisted of only five mem
bers, and three of these could find an
Indictment. It was doubtless Intended
to prevent shooting scrapes among cat
tle owners. . When there was a
quarrel the disputants. Instead of
shooting each other, .would have
each other indicted for stealing
steers. There was seldom a con
viction, but the prosecuting ; wit
ness could put his enemy to the cost
and vexation of a trial and enjoy the
roasting which his victim would re
ceive from the lips of the lawyers. My
client, who was one of the wealthiest
cattle owners in Eastern OregQn, was
absent In the East at the time the
other man's steer strayed into tlic
Shirley herd, but an Indictment was
found nevertheless, and I was engaged
for the defense. While we were pre
paring for trial the Jail and Court
house at Baker City was destroyed by
"If free coinage is denied us," said an
Oregon farmer tc an_advocate of the
single gold standard, "silver will go
down and the price of grain will follow
that of silver, and what shall we do
with our wheat?". "Make pork of it,"
replied. the speaker, airily. "But," an
swered the farmer, "the gold bagrs don'4
eat pork."
The Oregonlan looked up and ex
claimed: "Well, Senator, when I flrat
came I wondered how It could be that
such a man as I am could have been
elected a United States Senator. I have
been here three weeks, and I wonder
now how any of you ever got here."
Is there an Oregonlan of the vintage
of 1860 who will fall to recollect Sena
tor J. W. Nesmlth? His crisp, com
pact, sententious speeches, his breezy
style of address and his caustlo wit
â¢will be long remembered by his col
leagues of what is now the "Million
aires' Club." Shortly after his election
to the United States Senate a New
England Senator approached htm In
the cloakroom, where he was enjoying
an after lunch cigar, and patronizingly
inquired: "Well. Brother Nesmlth,
how does it feel to be a Senator of the
United States?"

RECOLLECTIONS AND REFLECTIONS
OF THOMAS FITCH
14all he loved the master's son. Why,
nobody knew.'
Jack Lindsay, the master's son, was
not a favorite. He had a naturally in
born, cruel nature; he had been a tease
as a boy; he had grown to be a bully.
Handsome, tall, upstanding as all of
his race, dark-eyed, black-haired, lithe
of limb, at 21 he was the catch of the
county, but he wasn't liked, save by his
father, who adored him, and the' men
who spent his money freely.
Mothers of many daughters kept their
eyes on him and girls too young to
know an inborn, vicious nature
thought perhaps too much of Jack.
Other women there were who saw more,
yet cared less. ' â
Cripps grew apace. Strong, limbed,
big maw, with a solid muscular body,
strong clean legs, he came to be a per
fect type of dog. He took his exercise
manlike. He bathed, he ran, he kept
himself In perfect condition. When it
was necessary, to fight, he fought; if he
could keep from it. like a gentleman, he
did eo, otherwise he killed.
Almost against himself, the master's
son got to like him. â¢ It was hard to
battle with such affection. No matter
bow many the; kicks, no matter how
many the blows, the dog, partly grown,
would Eldle away and come back
smiling. â¢
One fear he had. The master gave a
dinner In rooms at Oxford one night.
The bottles traveled freely and i after
the table had been cleared, Llewellyn, a
Jack. He grew with him and became
of him a part. As he gathered years
he took, on i knowledge and - loved the
blue sky. the green fields," "the water,
the universe itself; with* all its health
giving properties. _ One fear only he
had and that we knew about.
And Jack; Jack loved him in his way,
a. careless way; loved him enough to
have him always with him. ". But Cripps
loved as a woman loves. He loved Jeal
ously, fiercely, sometimes savagely, but
always nobly. The dog never let Jack
remember the Â¦ slur, of his babyhood or
the | knockout i blow of j his youth. He
loved and all' he asked was love In re
turn.
He didn't mind blows if there was a
caress ; to Â¦ follow. He took his lickings
cheerfully,. because a. kind .word would
come his way. : later. He never
pered! : His crejed was sacred \ to . him.
When he was alone he did his dear
est .thinking. pondered on his past
and' figured 5 on'his future, but most of
all he thought of his love of the ' mas
ter's' son and" how he could best keep
that love intact."!. ;^ /.
: , . Those were - : the V days Â¦ of : hla youth
dreams, when he was , growing to < his
greatness ; and Jack began to think of
marrying.
- Out on the great lawns at the grange
the hoar frost glistened asd there corn-
boon companion and an amateur boxer
of some note, suggested a bout. Lind
say took him- up, himself no slouch,
and soon the men had the room cleared
and the two went at it. :
A careful observer, might have saw
the shifting of a big red body in Jack
Lindsay's corner, the gradually spread
ing muscles of great fore legs, the
bristling of crisp hair, the glistening of
eyes quickly becoming bloodshot. , .
An uppercut took Lindsay fair* and
square under the right side of the Jaw.
There was a cry "Look out for
Cripps,". and the big dog was In mid
air, with a howl of fury.
Quick as a flash Lindsay had recov
ered and caught the dog midway with
a heavy right' It caught him fair on
the nozzle and threw him half way
across the room. He lay there stunned.
The men stood still for a minute. \ The
room took on a great silence. ; ' :
Then*X.indsay went quickly to him:
Down on his knees, ; he . took the big
head in his lap, saying: /'Poor old man,.
God knows I didn't mean that to be so
hard."_ . Â¦ . , , Â»â¢ â
1 Cripps looked up through blood and
foam, smiled and licked a blood mark
on Lindsay's ' hand. Never, again but
once did he face a fist gloved or bare. -
j There was not a dry eye that night
"as they made the young hero comforta-^
bie. He sighed with satisfaction, sorely
hurt as he was, that he had saved the
"master's" son."
From that time Cripps never left
pact and .massive, stood Cripps, gazing
out into the vastâ what, a* nothing.; a
gaping void. Something had happened
weeks before, and to-day was the mar
riage day. and his strong great love had
gone for. nothing somehow. Some one
had come : between,- a , sweet, pretty,
clear-eyed' girl, who loved Jack as he
loved him, but. whom Jack loved best
when he wasn't around.
This was their wedding day; all he
knew was that something strange had
been going on. There had been the
laughter of young 'â¢ girlish voices; there
had . been much bustling about, and ;
even his own corner had been besieged
by a sweet young girl, who had tender-'
ly patted him, almost mournfully.
There in the cold morning air he
sniffed the coming of evil, of a great
sorrow. Might he* cry Just once. Just
once?; Down on his great' limbs he ;
slipped and there in the cold of the win
ter dew. he thawed out the hoar frost in
his great sorrow. . . â¢ '
z Then, up (like a strong man,' whose
grief has been wrung from him and is a
thing to be known only between Mother

stiffly, and walked the stable.

j .^i^isTMjjjw JÂ§ there was to go â his
deep-set brown eyes
looked up and asked a question. With
that questioning look, with that hard,
rough kick, began the love of a little
animal for the master of Moffat's son.
Cripps was an Irish terrier pup, not
a thoroughbred, though behind him was
the breeding of the great ,"Mary Queen"
strain. He stood for a moment after
that great kick on his little half -formed
side, and, puppy-like, he thought to
himself: "Maybe I'm not full bred, yet
the master of Moffat is master here and
the master's son is breed of the breed
and I haven't whimpered and maybe â "
but he got no further, for the voice
came again: "Get in your little cur.
Foxley, and keep the little brute Inside
your stable." This to the head stable
man. "Very good, sir," came the an
swer, and Cripps lay down to ponder
further on the stupidity of pups. ' v
Cripps, snub-nosed, yellow-haired,
bright-eyed, understood from that time,
human-like, everything you said . to
him. He loved Foxley, he loved the
master of Moffat, but over and above
the gamekeepers might guess; for In
their toll by night they said later that
they had seen Him racing through the
woods, a specter of a dog.
When'he returned it was to be at the
master's" heels. The master's word was
law, and what he said Cripps did; but
the dog was no longer the Cripps of old.
True, his outward body was the same,
the. perfect, symmetry of form was
there, the huge muscles, but .the eyes
were the eyes of an old man grief
stricken.
The master, petted him.- had him al
ways .with* him, - took ( mm to the new
house so soon to be ready for the young
bride, and he went as a human, goes
whose days are done. and whose life is
finished. â¢ . . . â¢ â
They came at last. Jack and his bride,
came to the ; Old Grange ; for the re
union- of families and made bright the
old house. The master and Cripps-'
stood; in the great- hallway to receive
'them. . * . "> : â¢â¢.â¢.

.and while, his. poor understanding. could.
not quite fathom .the â difference, theirs
learned at once that his .heart was
.breaking. ".'â¢"'..â¢Â¦ '
It was on the following' day, and Jack :
and his wife were in the morning "room

THE PRETTY BRIDE AND GREEN-EYED CRIPPS
IT would probably be impossible to
point to any single ornament to
which so much Interest is attached
as to the finger-ring; during centu
ries it has been associated with most
Important concerns of life, in. mat
ters of ceremony and sentiment. Its
origin ts enveloped in the mist of fable;
the Greeks believed that the fashion
emanated from no less personage than
Zeus himself: and in their mythology
the little finger-ring 'was consecrated
to Mercury, the patron of thieves. Not
to Epcak of the evidences we find in
the mountains of ancient Egypt, we
read that even the simple patriarchs
were susceptible to this adornment. In
the books of Moses we find records of
the use of finger-ring; It originally ap
pears to have been a signet, used
as we now do a written autograph, and
It Is not a little curious that the un
changed habit of Eastern life Is as
common to-day aa It was 3300 years ago.
When Tamar desired some token by
which she should again be recognized
by Tadah, she requested his signet
(Fig. 1) ; this Is the usual form of these
rings; It has a somewhat clumsy mova
ble cube, engraved on each of Its facets
with symbolical devices.
The next in Importance Is the ring
which was given by Pharaoh to Jo
seph. Upon opening, in 1824, a tomb
In the necropolis of Sakkara, the work
men discovered a mummy, every limb
of which was cased in solid gold; each
finger had Its particular envelope, in-
Serapi3 at wÂ»e extremity and* of Isls
at the other. â¢
(Fig. 5.) The above massive ring be
longed to Pope Pius II, better, known*
by his literary name of Aeneas Sylvius;;
it is of brass, thickly gilt, set with, a
topaz; on the hoop are chased the
arms of the family, Picolomini, the pa
pal tiara with the;; inscription. "P a P a
Pio," and on each of the four sides is
placed in relief one of the four beasts
of the Revelation, to typify the Evan-'
gellsts. (Fig. 6.) The recent election
of Plo X has made every one acquaint
ed with all the sanctity and importance
attached to the official ring of the Sov
ereign pontiff, the celebrated "Fisher
man's Ring," which Impressed upon
briefs ' was once more powerful than
the authority of kings. It is a steel
seal made in the fashion ofaRoman
signet; it ,bears upon it a representa
tion of St. Peter seated in the prow of
an ancient boat, holding a net in each
hand. It is taken possession of by the
cardinal chancellor .with great Bolem
nity when the Pope dies; the signet is
then destroyed and not restored until
a new Pope has been elected; this is
not worn by him, but is used for briefs.
(Fig. 7). This is the ring of some
early Christian, "I rejoice" Inside, and
the monogram upon the signet is evi
dently the name of Jesus, in its earliest
form, made'.up of the letters X "and <I,
as commonly found in the catacombs
of Rome. The rings of the Anglo-,
Saxon sovereigns are very interesting,
having sometimes names upon them.

Albany.. (Fig; 9.)" X
,;piieen' Elizabeth's history.^and that
of h^er unfortunate favorite, the Earl of
Essex,' is 'popularly, known, and may ue
briefly" told. At the. time when most
passionately; attached to the Earl, she
gave him a' ring. ,' with 'the assurance
that she would pardon any fault Of
which he might.be accused on the re
turn of the pledge. (Fig. 10.) When, in
later, years." he was condemned for
treason, she expected to receive this
token,' and was prepared to grant the
promis'ed pardon; it came not! The
Queen was .confirmed in the belief that
he had ceased to care for her. ' The
Earl, in the last extremity of despair,
â¢had entrusted the ring to the Countess
of Nottingham, wife of the Lord High
Admiral, an enemy of the unfortunate
Essex, who forced his wife to conceal
the trust entirely, and secrete the ring.
The Countess upon her deathbed sent
for her royal mistress, and for the first
time told of her. guilt, humbly implor
ing mercy" from her God and forgive
ness from her earthly sovereign, who
did not only refuse to give it, but hav
ing shook her as she lay in bed, sent
her, accompanied with most fearful
curses, to a higher tribunal. (Fig. 10.)
William Shakespeare's ring was
found March' 16, lÂ§10, by a laborer's
wife in the mill close, adjoining Stat
ford-on-Avon churchyard.
â¢Poison rings were in frequent use In
ecrlbed with hieroglyphics: "So Joseph
died, being 110 years old; and they
embalmed him, and he was put in a
coffin In Egypt."
In connection with this ring it is nec
essary to remember what occurred:
Pharaoh took his ring from his hand
and put it upon Joseph's hand, and he
made him ruler over all the land of
Egypt; the seal has the cartouche of
Pharaoh upon it. (Fig. 2.)
The Romans literally reveled in rings
of all styles and sizes. We have a trans
lation of Juvenal by Dryden:
Charged with light summer rings, his fingers
sweat.
Unable to support a gem of weight. '
They were made very thick, with
such large stones in them that it is no
wonder a fop should reckon them a
little cumbersome in the summer sea
son in so hot a climate; we have as a
proof the thumb ring which bears the
portrait of Trajan's good queen Plo
tina. The coiffure is remarkable and
splendid, being composed of three rows
of precious stones cut in facets. (Fig. 3.)
This bust would of course come out
side the hand, the narrower part of
the wreathed ring passing between the
thumb and first finger. The gorgeous
inconvenience of the whole thing is
very apparent.
In the comparatively modern era of
Roman rule in Egypt, rings of more
fanciful construction were worn (Fig.
4); here is a remarkable one, having the
convolutions of a serpent, the head of
One of these Vrellcs, * the remarkable

In the year 1852 some citizens of Cal-V
ifornia presented President Pierce with
a gigantic ring; lt'ls of massive gold
and was designed by George^ Blake, a
mechanic of San Francisco; on the cir-,'
cular portion of the ring are groups
representing the history of California.
The part reserved for a Veal is covered
by a solid carved plate of gold; bearing
the arms of the State of California, sur
mounted by the banner of the* United
States; this lid opens and presents to
view, nine separate compartments, con
taining specimens of ores found in the
country^ with the inscription: "Pre
sented to Franklin Pierce â the four

(Fig. 11.)
George Washington made bequests in
his wilj to each of. his sisters-in-law
arid friends of a mourning ring of the
value of $100, as mementoes of his es

A valuable one that- has come down
to our time is the signet-ring of. Mary.
Queen of Scots. . It is thought that
this was Mary's nuptial ring when she

nails or screws that had been used to
fasten a coffin. , : ,â¢Â¦Â¦Â«-.-
Italy in the Middle Ages: they -/were
called "Death's rings." The most fa
mous of these employed to kill an .ene
my was that- whlch-belonged .to- Caesar'
Borgia â a grasp from the hand wearing
the ring Insured; a very slow but cer
tain death; It contained. a virulent poi
son, which found vent through a small
spike pressed out by a spring when the
hand was grasped, and which was so
slight in its operation as to be scarcely
felt, and not usually noticed by the per
son wounded- during the 'excitement of
the hearty friendship so well simulated.
We wish to mention some of the num
berless rings -of antiquity which were
supposed to .possess magical charms
and medicinal virtues in the estimation
of the credulous; even In our days some
will purchase galvanic rings to. cure
rheumatism.
The glyptic art may be said U have
reached Its perfection la the century
which preceded and the century
which followed the Christian era;
then flourished the most eminent gem
engravers of antiquity, "Pyrgotelea,
Apollonldes, Solon and' Naualaa.
Three-fourths of the ancient .engraved
stones have been r plowed, up from
the soil, or dredged up from tha rivers
of classic lands, after lying burled for
a thousand years.' * ' '."Â¦* â¢ â¢'" \ â¢' *
Within the -last century there has
been a renaissance of the â¢ study of
this art and ft Is now quite a society
fad In "our country. ....
ertneas.. Queen Elizabeth received oas
.from her gallant Chancellor Hatton,
with minute Instructions tor her guid
ance: "A ring against Infected air, to
be worn between the sweet dugs of her
bosom." "
Â¦ Lady Cathcart, on* marrying her
fourth husband,' Hush' Maguire, In 1713,

wedding ring: "â¢ - - ."â¢ . .' Â¦"Â¦'

Â¦ PARIS, Jan. 9. â Correspondent
called by appointment upon Bartholdi.
the famous sculptor, who gave to New
York the colossal statue of Liberty
Enlightening the World, at his fine
villa, comprising studio and home,
with a garden and rear court. No. 82
Rue d'Assas. on the left bank of the
river Seine.
' The ; artist, now in his seventieth
year. Is suffering from a complication
of ailments, but his eye Is still bright,
his* mind is clear and he does light
work daily himself in addition to di
recting others.
Bartholdi said that he is always
cherishing as his favorite idea the
turning of Bedloe's Island into a sort
of National American Pantheon, girted
Â¦with "the statues of those who have
contributed to their country's fame â
with Washington, Lafayette and other
famous generals, perhaps, as a central
group.
He would also have the bodies of all
the Presidents removed to Bedloe'3
Island, and would have a comprehen
sive museum of national relics estab
lished.
He believes that such a spot would
prove a mecca for all- Americans, in
stilling patriotism into the yotrag.
The correspondent inquired about
the project attributed to him for light
ing Montmartre with a lofty pillar to
which he had planned to attach an
electric balloon.
"The press has mixed up two of my
projects." Bartholdi smilingly, ex
plained. "Some years ago when back
of Montmartre was a great plain. I
suggested the idea in question, but
since the Church of the Sacred Heart
. has been built that plan Â»i3 no longer
necessary.' The papers have con

A PANTHEON
OF BEDLOES
LONDON*. Jan. 3. â Mrs. "Jack"
L*sliÂ«, who was Leonie Jerome, sister
of Mrs. George CornwalHs West (Lady
Randolph Churchill), has captivated
a place of prime importance in the
.family of the Duke of Connaught, the
King's brother. Since the Durbar, and
largely because of it, Mrs. Leslie has
l>een practically lady-in-waiting to the
Duchess of Connaught, and the favor
ite chaperon of the pretty Connaught
girls â Princesses Margaret and Patricia
â the first American woman to come
8'j close to the royal family. Ever
since the return from India, Mrs. Les
lie has lunched with the Duchess in
the unconventional outings her Royal
Highness likes so well, and people at
Prince's and the Carlton have grown
accustomed to see the two together.
While en shopping expeditions the
Duchess win have none other than
"Mrs. Leslie with her. The young
Princesses also demand much of the
American lady's time. At the .Stafford
House concert (when thÂ»Â» Duchess of
Sutherland loaned her historic home
Â¦ tot charity) the daughters of the
Duke Fat one on cither side of Mrs.
Leslie.
STORY TELLING THE SECRET.
Mrs. Leslie has accomplished all
this by telling good stories. The Duke
â¢and Duchess are said to have voted
her the most amusing woman in Eng
land. ShÂ» is sometimes rather daring,
but on the whole her frit Is considered
charmingly light and wholesome. Un
til now, Mrs. Leslie has been thrown
somewhat into shadow by the fame of
Lady Randolph Churchill, but not
even Lady Randolph can approach
her now. Nor yet Mrs. Moreton
Frewen, the third daughter of that
historic New York lady known in days
long gone by as "Mamma Jerome."
This title clung to the indefatigable
old lady until her three daughters suc
cessively took up their homes In Eng
land.
Mrs. Leslie Is not blessed with such
a share of beauty as has made the
now Mrs. Cornwallis West famous, al
though she has fine eyes and a dark
rich coloring. tShc fully understands^
that h^r tongue is her fortune. She
talks about her gift for story-telling
tnd general conversation as a musi
cian discusses the technique of his
I-erformance. She is reported to have
Baid, "Oh, I've brought home enough
jrood stories from the Durbar to last
me two years!" Now that she and
Mr. Leslie have been summoned to
Ireland, an Englishman observed in
my hearing: "The next thing we hear,
America will be talking about Mrs.
Leslie as the Vice Commandress-in-
Chief of Ireland. There's almost as
much reason for such a title as for the
curious one of Vicereine conferred on
Lady Curzon."
MISTAKEN FOR DUCHESS.
All this greatness so recently thrust
tspon Mrs. Leslie was the result of
Etrong liking on the part of the Con
r.aughts for her. But an accident
gave the opportunity to the man
nhoni the King calls his "immaculate
brother," to do the thrusting'. He
went out to India with a certain aid
de-camp who fell ill. Some one had
to take his place. "Jack" Leslie, a
civilian, contrary to all custom, did
the taking rather than an army man.
While in India, Mrs. Leslie was again
and again thought to be the Duchess
cf Connaught. Frequently her Royal
Highness insisted that the delusion be
kept up. Qn one occasion, she told
Airs. Leslie to mimic her, just to help
".the delusion along, which she did with
erusto.
As the Duke and Duchess of Marl
borough couldn't call their huge new
London mansion Marlborough House
â that being the name'of the resi
dence of the Prince of Wales â they
have taken the next best available
name :n the choice of Sunderland.
The daughter and heiress of the first
fcnd great Duke of Marlborough mar
ried the Earl of Sunderland, who thus
became the ancestor of the present
Duke. If he chose, the husband of
Consuclo Vanderbiit could call himself
the Earl of Sunderland. as well as
I-*a ron Spencer; Baron Churchill and
Prince of Mindelheim in Suabia. An
other of his titles he has conferred by
â¢ ourtesy on his small heir, who bears
the name of Marquis of Blandford.
Sanucrland House, which is at last
finished, bo far as the exterior goes,
h?.s yet much to be desired in the way
of interior decorations, and was not
ready for occupancy on January 1, as
the Duchess had hoped.
HOXBLHGHtrS LONDON* HOUSE.
I hear that architects* plans have
act.ua.lly been drawn in detail for the,
London house of the Duke of Rox-,'
burghe, and that the promise that it
will be even more palatial than the
Marlborough-Vanderbilt mansion is to
be ke^t to the letter. But it will take
fully two years to build it, and in the
meantime the Goelet Duchess will
have to play second fiddle to the Van
derbilt Duchess as a London hostess.
A new American and English club
has just been started in Brussels, vice
the old "English Club," which died of
inanition some two years ago. The
new group is to be called the "Union,"
as fitting all nationalities. E. M. Enr
lich. barrister of Chicago, is responsi
ble for the inception of the club, hav
ing with untiring energy called It like
a iihenix from the ashes, and is one
of th* committee. Colonel R. Hes
k**th of the English Indian army Is the
chairman. All officers are elected for
â¢ ine year. The club will establish it
self at Wiltcher's Hotel, Boulevarde
Waterloo, where new premises are be-
Ing prepared for it. American visitors
under-offlcials of the office to boss the
office boy and the minor clerks, and
they resented this liberty with their
authority. They sent a delegation to
the Duke and told him that he must
confine himself to his own part of the
work in the establishment. In conse
quence, the Duke has abandoned his
democratic ideas and the old dignified
style of time-wasting has been re
stored. Having succeeded in remov
ing one grievance, the permanent offi
cials are now satisfied to wait for the
removal of his Grace to a higher office
â¢before they agitate for more favorable
terms. It is noticed that the Duke is
taking things much easier than he did
at the beginning, when he used to
work eight or ten hours a day â some
times even more.
\* MARQUIS' ADOPTED CHILD.
The most noble Marquis of Angle
sey has- made a new Investment, of
which news has not yet reached the
English papers. Play-acting has long
been the favorite pastime of the,Mar
quis, who at the present moment with
his company is engaged in going the
round of a number of towns in the
United Kingdom, where he performs
* his favorite roles and gives the money
bo obtained to charity. As t is well
known, the Marquis also derives much
satisfaction from the possession of in
numerable jewels and gems of the
first water. "With these distributed

habit of dazzling the eyes of his re

A3IERICAX SCOUT'S RECORD.
Major F. R. Burnham, the American
scout, a record of whose adventures
would make one of the most exciting
books ever penned, has just returned
to London from another difficult ex
pedition to East Africa â this time
through the East Africa Protectorate
and Uganda to the borders of the
Congo Free State, penetrating: about
a thousand miles and exploring much
territory that has never before seen a
white man. The major was accom
panied by several hundred blacks, and
twenty white men, three of , whom died
of fever, and six were invalided home.
The most interesting result of the
expedition was the discovery of a lake
of about forty-nine square miles com
posed almost entirely of pure carbon-,
ate of soda, forming a, snow-like crust
so thick that the party walked across
on it. In some places the chemical is
solid clear through to the ground. It
is the largest deposit of the kind that,
has ever been found. The lake is fed
by mineral springs carrying soda in
solution, and the deposit is formed by
the evaporation of the water under
the burning equatorial sun. In years
to come when the Inevitable railroads
run through Uganda, this chemical
lake will doubtless be of enormous
value, but at present it is one of na
ture's inviolable reserve funds. â¢
An active volcano was found at
Lake Rudolph, and severed others
which were busily spouting mud and
steam were seen.
Major Burnham was accompanied
as far as the uplands' of Nawasha by
Mrs. Burnham, who is also a Califor
nian; and by their 5-year-old son
Bruce, who distinguished himself on
one occasion by spending seven hours
In the paddle.
MARLBOROUGH'S ENERGY.
Alas, the Duke of Marlborough has
slowed up! As second in command at

The distinctly important feature of
the week was the Ayers-Searles nup
tials. The affair was celebrated at
home, but it possessed all the salient

which Is really saying a great deal, In
asmuch as there have been so many
charming brides up to date.
Sitting as we are on the right hand
of the continent, with men and women
of note passing through our gates to
and from the Orient, the day is near
Â¦when we must expand socially, even as
we have commercially â for In all lands
one follows the other as the night the
day. And if we would repel social tor
pidity in our smart set a welcome must
be extended to the wanderers from
abroad â they, of course, who come
with the right kind of passports.
Now in London, Paris, Vienna, Dres
den, Rome, Florence and other Euro
pean centers, it is at the salon of some
social leader â and often at a Sunday
E&lonâ that the stranger is entertained
and presented. And with his new
ideas and new impressions the conver
sation is freshened and fertilized; and
where a clever, tactful, versatile
hostess is at the helm dullness and its
progeny, ennui, are impossible.
Another advantage we possess â here
we are with one of the largest army
posts in the country Just around the
corner, and likewise within sound of
the sunset gun of an Important naval
station. Here is a fecundity that few
other American cities share with us.
And what a leaven to a social function
is a bunch of gajiy caparisoned offi
cers! And let it be said in truth that
their charm is not all in the glitter of
braid and brass, but in that which lies
in their manly heads and hearts.
Besides these various facilities for
the establishment of a salonâ and there
are many more â there is not in any
city of its size a larger number of
beautiful homes suited to entertaining
than are located in our city. There is
the Flood mansion, the old Phelan
home, the De Your.g place, the Parrott
place, the Spreckels palace and scores
of others far too numerous to mention,
from beneath whose vaulted domes the
intelligent hospitality of San Francisco
would become a thing of renown.
And as for the women who could lead
in such affairs as to render social life
a genuine joy â rather than a cheerful
sorrow â there are scores of them. And
the inanities, the ostentations and the
hollowness that now prevail would
give way to sane sayings, sane amuse
ments and some real pleasures.
Let us hope for the success of the
San Francisco salon. Here's to It!
There are gathered here upon our
hillsides coteries of men and women
from the artistic and literary centers
of Europe, drawn to our shores by the
charms that are ours by gift of God.
and of a part with the allurements of
their own lands. And these besides
our own clever people who play and
sing and paint.
No other city on Uncle Samuel's ros
ter outside of New Orleans, New York
and Washington is so admirably adapt
ed for the establishment of the salon
as our City by the Golden Gate.

A suggestive coincidence in con
nection with the terrible theater fire
in Chicago is the appearance of an
article in this month's Theater Mag
azine, entitled "Are Our Theaters
Safe?" Written before the colossal
disaster In Chicago, the paper deals
with the safety of the actors and the
ater goers in New York in case of fire
or panic, the writer's (Harry P. Maw
son) conclusions being the reverse of
reassuring to the playgoer. Mr. Maw
son's facts are startling and grewsome
and before we can thank God our lo
cal theaters are not as these much
will have to*be done. Here is an
extract from Mr. Mawson's most timely
protest:
"The laws governing the construc
tion of theaters in the State of New
York are most stringent and adequate
for the safety of the theater-going
public,* provided that the theater is of
recent date, but there are at least
eight prominent theaters in active
operation to-day in New York City, to
say nothing of Brooklyn, which are
nightly a menace to the public and the
licensing of which must take some ex
traordinary political 'pull' to secure.
One of these has a stage , entrance
down a flight of cellar stairs from an
adjoining street with all the dressing
rooms for the actors underground.
The place has one stairway to the bal
cony and the 'gallery gods' take wing
down a side entrance to- the building
from Broadway. Another theater
which adjoins a prominent hotel Is
practically â¢ upstairs and the aisles
barely accommodate one person to
pass at a time. The rows of seats are
so shockingly close together that as
the auditor sits in his place, his knees
and his nose are In such close proxim
ity to each other that he has the back
ache if not the stomachache, before
the end of the first act of any play.
Should a panic, occur In this theater
only a football player could get out
alive. Still another theater is upstairs
and has one solitary flight of winding
stairs down which the entire audience
must plunge in time of panic, to meet
another flight of steps before reaching
the street. It is well known that
winding stairways are a deadly source
of danger in time of panic. One more
theater, originally built as a music
hall, has a stage which is below the
level of the street, to reach which the
actor descends what is called a stair
way, but which is nothing, short of a
narrow steep ladder. What the pow
ers that be had on their minds when
they. passed this construction, would
furnish an interesting item to the
cause of 'graft. uprooting' and munic
ipal reform. However, her.ef the au
dience is reasonably safe, so the poor
factor and the stage hands 'be
danyied.* A popular theater, facing
on Broadway, has a rotten wooden
stairway In an old building by which
these whose income admits of 50 cents
for a seat must enter from the street
Other theaters are overcrowded as to
seating capacity. Nothing is of more
vital importance In a theater than
wide aisles, stairways, roomy seating
arrangements, numerous ""exits, fire ex
tinguishers, hose lines, sprinklers over

DUBLIN. Jan. 9. â Before leaving

Roscommon, to spend Christmas.
Viceroy Dudley, accompanied by the
Countess, went on an extended tour
through the poorer quarters of Dublin
and distributed right and left good

where people were behindhand in
their rent Lord Dudley presented gold
pieces to help make good the de
ficiency.

had little or no furniture was that
piece by piece It had gone . to the
pawnshop. â¢ owing to want of work-
Lord Dudley induced her to show him
the pawntickets and gave her enough
money to redeem them.
The Earl and the Countess, who
were unknown to the recipients of
their bounty, were both deeply moved
by the wretchedness brought under
their notice. .' >,.
A week of exceptional interest at the
theaters begins to-night at the Colum
bia with the first local production of
Ibsen's "Ghosts." among the most
powerful work of the author. As in
"The PillarB^or Sopiety." "The Doll's
House," the*"pfayTvrlght is again at
tacking existing social conditions with
*for his stern text: "The sins of the
fathers ;_ shall descend .upon' the chil
dren." J Purely pathological as is the
theme, . its deYeloprrfent is highly "dra
matic. The drama is in the hands of
five people only: Mrs. Alving, the
mother of the idiot son of a degener
ate husband; Oswald, the son. doomed
to hopeless idiocy â the play shows him
in the shadow and clutch of it â -for the
sins of his father; Iieglna Engstrand,
illegitimate daughter of.Alvins, as Is
later shown, with whom Oswald is in
love, a woman of splendid physique
and uncertain morality; Jacob Eng
strand, her supposed father, and Par
son Manders, who suggests a combined
Pecksniff and Urla:i Heep.
The scenes take place within the nar
row walls of a Norwegian cottage, the
play depending wholly for its interest
.upon the somber drama involving these
five people. Problem play it is, its
gloom wholly unrelieved, its thrill of
pure pain. Its people almost wholly re
pulsive, yet with a lesson unescapable
and making powerfully for righteous
ness. Mrs. Alving, /nut like Nora in
"The Doll's House," has stayed with
the husband she justly despises, more.
In line with the Parson Manders theol
ogy, has become mother of his child.
The problem posed is self-evident, and
though Ibsen avoids answer his moral
is not to be evaded.
Alberta Gallatln, of whom one hears
good things, is to Interpret the difficult
part of Mrs. Alving. Clans Boyd, who
did leading roles with Mrs. Fiske, is to
.have the role of Oswald. The others uf
the company are. John Ravold, Allen
Davenport and Rose Curry. There will
be only one performance.
Very different will the Columbia's bill
on Monday evening be. when Mrs.
Langtry, the ever-famous Jersey Lily,
will present a new comedy, "Mrs. Deer
ing's Divorce." The actress is said to
have an uncommonly good medium in
her new play, that depends neither
upon the apotheosizeu gown nor the
social prestige of its wearer, for its
success. - Mrs. Langtry s last local ap
pearance was in 1886, and, then only
an indifferent actress, she has since be
come an accomplished comedienne She
is still, beautiful, and her coming will
doubtless be of conspicuous Interest to
theatergoers. She will be supported by
members of the Imperial Theater ,(her
own)- of London, and it goes without
saying will have a galaxy of gowns.
Next comes the Tivoli, with the first
production of light opera In the new
house, the Stange Edwardes
opera, "When Johnny Comes March
ing Home." The occasion will be 'the
local, premiere of the work, and will
doubtless be of considerable attract
ive power. The story is military, and
the opera is said" to afford the* ' ex
cellent company the Tivoli has gath
ered together a good opportunity.
The Alcazar will have "The Moth and
Next Fischer's, with - a new bur
lesque, , entitled "The BeautyShop."
Again the patriotic . proprietors have
gone in for encouraging local genius,
"The Beauty Shop" being, from the
pen of a local newspaper man, â¢ Mr.
J. C. Crawford, the music by a San
Franciscan composer. The thing
promises to be very f.unny, and has
been amply rehearsed and lavishly
mounted by the -management. Miss
Helen Russell, the new leading
woman, and John Peachey, who suc
ceeds Winfleld' Blake, will both make
their first bow at Fischer's in the new
show. Â¦ '-.'.. BHBfiflSBi
"You will not see her." my editor
warned, as I hopefully suggested Patti
as the subject of my chat for the 'week.
"I'm afraid you will no.t see her,"
Marcus Mayer. Patti's urbane repre
sentative, prophesied.
But would I not! I who â but
wherefore the recital of that pride
that goeth before a fall!
"At any rate, there is the baron" â
I suggested.
Of course there was the baron, not
the rose, but very near the rose, the
Baron Cederstrom, the youthful Swede
who succeeds Nicolini, and the Mar
quis de Caux. And so, armed with
a letter of introduction to the baron,
and with the brash confidence born
of long contact with the willing-to-be
interviewed. I set off for Sacramento,
there to invade Craig-y-nos. the trav
eling citadel of the queen of song.
I was not alone. At Sacramento I
met a clever confrere with an inter
view already written, awaiting only
the august approval of the lady who
could, would or should have said the
things therein contained. There was
els.o a lone representative of the capi
tal press, who had apparently neg
ated to prnvide himself with one
of these ingenious labor-saving de
vices. Apart from this Sacramento
took no more interest in the diva's
advent than in mine. For ten min
utes there she sunned her auburn head
on the back porch of Craig-y-nos with
an occasional brakeman as sole au
dience. The few stragglers at the sta
tion seemed wholly unaware that
within a few feet of them was Patti
of the incomparable voice and art,
arid â the intejviewers were busily en
gaging the baron at the other end of
the car.
It is useless to deny that my accus
tomed heart did not play an unaccus
tomed prank or two as Patti's train
swung into the station. Patti! There
is yet a big thrill in the name. Patti!
Old men> eyes gleam at the word and
women's lips are reverent. Patti! who
filched the very heart of song from its
heaven. And I was to see her. That
went without saying. I would ask this,
and this, in the five minutes I hoped
she would grant me. I would ask her
why. in her opinion, there were no
Pattis among the youthful generation
of Fingers. I would ask if she thought
that the Wagner music-drama would
prevent there being any in the next.
I would ask to what she ascribed the
phenomenal preservation of her own
â¢voice. I would* ajk if the present sys
tem of teaching was the system likely
to develop a Patti. I would ask if the
possible Patti were herself as sacri
ficially in earnest in her devotion to
her art as the older artists. I would
ask â but the train plunged heavily
into the station, and almost before Its
groaning ritardando had ceased, I was
aboard Craig-y-nos.
"May I see the BaroiT Cederstrom?"
I asked of a quite baronial looking
person, tall, slim and distinguished,
who stood on the. steps of the adjoin
ing car. "Or perhaps you "
"Xo," the baronial person smiled.
It is never mistaken to ascribe great
ness to the others. Yet, I thought, "I
might have known." I never yet saw
a king that looked like one, but Lau
rance d'Orsay!
The baronial person courteously
pointed me then to a gentleman
"standing in the door of Craig-y-nos.
"Ach! German!" I thought, as the
ehort and genially rotund "baron"
took my letter of introduction.
"Baron Cederstrom?" I asked.
"No," he bowed, "I will tell him you
are here," and vanished into theinner
regions of the car.
There wore by this time several
other possible barons on the steps. I
learned later Anton Hegner, the 'cell
ist; TVIlfrfd Virgo, the tenor; Signor
Sapio. the conductor; Claude A^ Cun
ningham, the barytone, and others â
all ol the little queen's suite. At last
the genuine baron appeared with my
letter in his hand. He looked worried.
"You wish â " he began.
"Five minutes* chat with the baron
ess, if I may?"
My confreres preferred hastily a
similar request.
"Impossible," the baron said with
chilly courtesy.
'Mr. Mayer thought she might give
me just five minutes â "
"She sees noMme," her husband an
nounced seriously.
He is very serious. I never met
any one quite so serious. Even Edwin
Ste\"ens himself must give place here
to the Baron Rolf Cederstrom. Evi
dently the responsibilities of his posi
tion are of ..the. serious sort and the
slender, frigid, worried gentleman
that faced us as evidently takes them
very seriously.
I was not as yet sufficiently under
the superstition of the situation, and
asked again: "Not even for a mo
ment?"
"She makes no exceptions," the
baron said then, frigidly final.
"Then, baron, may I have a little
talk with you?" I asked.
I wondered afterward* at my cour
age. Perhaps it was induced by the
delightful incongruity of the baron's
background â the Craig-y-nos coal-box
and kindling â even as thine and mine!
"Certainly," he bowed, and stood at
attention.
"Hardly here."
Then I led the way into the other
car, my Ingenious confrere meantime
informing the baron of his written-to
flt interview.
I should give Baron Cederstrom
quite the thirty-two years he has been
credited with. Not more. His" thin
nish oval face is dark and smooth but
for a small curled must he, his eyes
are dark and anxious :.: 1 set a little
too closely over the thin, hooked nose,
his slender figure tall, straight and
lithe as becomes his supposed athk: 'i
tendencies. His simple traveling suit
of gray and a Scotch cap sat easily
and becomingly upon him. He looked
less "difficile" sitting down.
"Where's Cunningham?" someone
asked here. The train was out from
Sacramento a few moments. Then
amid a chorus of laughter, it devel
oped that the adventurous Mr. Cun
ningham, barytone of the company,
had been* left to the delights of Sac
ramento.
The baron was probably too busy to
smile at this. He didn't, at any rate,
but began gravely: "What do you wish
to ask?"
"I should like to know," I began,
"just to what madame attributes
the extraordinary preservation of her
voice? To regular habits of living
and "
"Yes," the baron replied. He evi
dently thought the reply sufficient.
"Is it because of fatiguing the voice
that she refuses to be interviewed?"
â¢â¢Yes," said Baron Cederstrom.
"Entirely?"
"Noâ she has been made to say
absurd things in the papers and so de
clines to say anything."
"Does she not find all this traveling
very tiring?"
* "She is very well."
"This is almost the end of your
tour?"
"No, only the tenth concert."
"There are fifty?"
"Forty." ;-f '
"There will be a very large house to
greet her in San Francisco."
"Ah!" the baron looked faintly in
terested. .
"I should very much like to know
the baroness* opinion of the modern
school of singing," I ventured then.
"Ah, that I can say nothing of. She
has naturally her opinion, but does not
care to be quoted. Fine weather," he
volunteered politely, looking out on
the green and gold fields spinning by,
the circlet of Â«.pal hills surrounding
them.
"Slightly different from your Eng
lish winter weather? But you are not
English? You speak English so well
' "No, I am a Swede."
"You may go, Baron," I said then,
after a ' little more desultory -ossip.
The 'd ea had occurred to me that other
less responsible members of the party
in the new Tivoli. "Zara," of course,
was mentioned â the signor shook his
head over the theme.
"Why add music when the dramatic
interest is so vivid as to destroy all
consciousness of the, music?" the con
ductor asked. ".You never, I am surfc,
had 'Tosca'?'â you never, I am. sure,
have heard the music at the end of
the second act." .
I was obliged to confess I could not
recall it. .
The old and new Italian opera then
came up, and with it Patti again. |
"Does she like the 'new Italian
school?'.'
"Oh,, yes. And the baroness is also
very fond of Wagner. . We often spend
whole evenings.ovec.the operas." ;..,:.+-â¢-
| The baron had told me that he and
the. baroness went' every season to
Bayreuth, though he ' would not say
whether or 'not she considered the'
Wagner music-drama a grateful vo
cal field. Signor Sapio, liowever, in
formed me that Patti herself sings
much of the "Tannhauser" music.
- "Does she ever practice?" I" ven
tured' then.
"Hardly ever. For ten minutes
sometimes. She sings almost- every,
day though."
"I wonder â perhaps you can tell me
â if she would be willing to answer a
few questions -"
"For example?"
"As to whether she considers the
present system of teaching singing as
good as it was in her day? Why there
are no more Pattis, Sembrichs, among
the young singers?"
"Voices are born," the signor began.
"And. made, too," I ventured.
"Jenny Lind- "
i "Oh, yes, the brain is a big, motive
force, but you must have the throat,
too. Madame Patti could not help
singing with her throat.
"Still, it seems .to me from my read
ing that vocal study was a very differ
ent thing in Patti's day from now?"
"No doubt, no doubt/" Sapio admit
ted. "I myself have had some little
experience of that." He was for four
years head of the .New York National
Conservatory vocal department. "Stu
dents, now desire to get through six
years' work in two. ..They make their
debut unprepared, the voice is ruined,
e't voila! failure all round. I think
madame \yould subscribe to that
statement."
â¢ I sent In again my note to madame
then, and heard of her smiling over it
and my friend's "interview" at Beni
cia. It. came out later "approved."
which means that Patti believes the
few following things.^
1. That any singer, with reasonable
care, may preserve her voice as the
Patti voice has been preserved.
- 2. That regular habits of eating,
drinking, sleeping and so on, are the
first essentials. " .
3. That freedom from worry is also
imperative to the preservation of the
voice.
4. That. the older. 'Italian opera is
more grateful to the voice than either
the newer Italian school or the Wag
ner music-drama. ? /.L
5. That the modern fashion of vocal
teaching is as good as in Patti's vocal
echool days. . -;:/'Â¦,"'
She would not say why there were
no more Pattis, if throats, or students
were at fault, but acknowledged. deep
pleasure In coming again to San Fran
cisco, "the scene of some of my pleas
antest associations."
"At last the train swept into the
Oakland mole, and there I caught my
first glimpse of the little, lady. Three
or four porters, the hackman and a
few newspaper folk shared it with me.
With-a pathetically regal air; â for the
tiny audience â^she put one hand upon
her' husband's arm, the other upon
her manager's, as she left 'the car , : and
swept into the hack awaiting her,
leaving behind an impression of dark,
bright eyes, an extraordinary aureole
of auburn ' locks, and sables.
; On the boat I asked' a large, inno
cent, pink policeman , the reason for
the unusual crowdâ a racing one, I
found. ,. .'Â¦."'. '.".:.Â¦'Â¦'
"Do ye see that hack?*' he said.
I did.
â¢:Well. there's a woman in there
they Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦callâ Patth-I think 'tis. They
say she's a great singer. That's what
the (jrowd's about. Ye can see the
old lady if ye step up here."
And so Patti came to San Francisco.

might be more interesting.
"There is nothing else?"
"Nothing, thank you."
He bowed as he left and went sol
emnly to his duties at Craig-y-nos.
Almost then I had begun to feel the
tremendous importance j of traveling
with a prima donna, particularly as
her husband. Later I was to realize it
more strongly. However slender
Patti's hold upon the imagination of
the present day may be her sover
eignty in her own small circle is abso
lute. Much of charm and reason
there must be in it, too. Her com
panion, Miss Karoline Burmeister, has
been with the diva for thirty years,'
her secretary, Signor Marini, for fif
teen. The baron? Oh, for four.V .
"Well?" I said to the artist. He
also had his five minutes with *the
baron, from across the aisle.
"Scared," my experienced friend de
cided. He added a slight touch of
hawkiness to the baron's nose as he
said: "These soft snaps are not all
they're painted." â¢
We went then tb^the rear platform
to thaw out and were immediately be
friended by first one and then another
member of tire company. The ro
tund person whom I had mistaken foi
the baron was admiring the scenery
from Craig-y-nos back door.
"Very like Rome," he said hand
somely. Then asked: "You saw the
baron?"
"Yes. but not the baroness. But I
suppose no one sees her?"
"No â not I even, sometimes."
"This must be Signor Marini or per
haps Signor Sapio," I said to myself.
Then aloud, "She â ever â¢ one talked
of 'the' â "she is very careful of her
self, of course?"
â¢'Oh, yes, one must not do this, one
must not do that to sing," he put it,
importantly.
"No tea or coffee, no -"
"Oh, yes, she takes both. Cham
pagne, too. Not much of anything,
though. At breakfast only tea and a
couple of eggsâ very simply she lives."
"I wonder," I began â a brilliant
idea haying arrived â "I wonder if she
would answer a question or two for
me on paper?"
"Possibly," he said, doubtfully.
"Could you, would you ask for-me?"
With gravity befitting the occasion
he consulted another Patti subject and
decided to prefer by request. On tip
toes he returned with my note a mo
ment later to say that madame was
lying down and must not be disturbed.
But I saved the note, :id at Benicla
Madame read and "approved" it.
"And to whom am I indebted?". I
madame read and "approved" ik.
â¢â¢T^e baron's valet, mademoiselle."
I hope my return' bow was as splen
did as this gentleman's.
We returned then to the inside of
the car, and there met the long-time
friend and conductor of Patti â Signor
Sapio. Miss Zamels, the violinist,
square and intense of face, and most
luminously eyed, was in the next seat.
She divided her glances between Miss
Margolies â whose piquant French
lilted across the way â her violin and
the golden country flying past. Anton
Hefner, the 'cellist,, nearby smiled
sympathy for our troubles and affec
tion for the khaki-covered 'cello in
front of him. The tenor, Wilfrid
Virgo, drolly remembered every now
and then the dropped barytone, "who
had ieft his 'cowt,' you know." Signor
Sapio, keen and thoughtful of face
and one of the best conductors we
have, was in front of us wjth cour
teous intent looking from his quiet
eyes. Altogether it was like getting
home again. We chatted awhile of
various things, of the Moody-Manners
English grand opera company for one.
The conductor for a while led the
company, during Ihe time when Stan
ford's opera, "Much Ado About'Noth
ing" was produced. He had many
good words for the opera. The inter
national prize recently offered the
Moody-Manners people for a grand
opera he told me was won by a young
Englishman, one Lester, with an opera
entitled, "The Cross and the Crescent"
- â "scholarly, but without much purity
musical value.' Still, promising, as the
author is young." Signor Sapio was
much interested in the De Lussan .en
gagement at the Tlvoli last year. Also
the stage, asbestos curtain*, and also
a system of separate lighting for the
fire escapes and lobbies entirely de
tached from the lights on the stage or
the body of the house. Nothing adds
to panic so much as the sudden col
lapse of lights and continued darkness
In the .auditorium, yet in some thea
ters In New York there are no such
extra lights and if the electric lights
suddenly failed the house would be
plunged Into absolute darkness, mak
ing egress almost impossible. A panic
under such conditions is<a\vful to con
template."

At 12:30 o'clock the Clallam went on
her beams end and began sinking rap
idly. At 1:07 o'cJock she Â»settled and
the tou lines were cut. A few minutes
later she lurched and disappeared be
neath the waves. Only her top works
and floating wreckage remained to
show that she had "ever been.
By -heroic efforts the crews " of the
two tugs saved the lives of nearly all
who had remained aboard the Clallam.
A few were swept away and
in the blackness of the storm, with none
to .heed their shouts and cries. /
The closing scene' in this, the most
terrible marine tragedy ever known in
these waters, was eight miles north of
Protection Island, only a short; dis T
tance north of Port Townsend and ap
proximately thirty miles from Victoria!
The Holyoke picked the Clallam up off
Smiths Island. â¢ The survivors, of - the
cheated of their .prey and still more
lives were to be sacrificed to the god
of the waters. The hull of the Clallam
began to rive way before the terrific
assaults of the waves and the strain
of the towline completed the work the
seas had begun. The tug Sea Lion
sighted the Holyoke and her tow about
midnight and stood by to* assist.
Â¦ SEATTLE, Jan. 9.â Charles G. Ben
nett of 2771 Twenty-fourth street, San
Francisco, a passenger, remained on
board the Clallam until she sank and
witnessed all the principal scenes both
before she foundered and sank and im
mediately afterward, when the last life
raft was launched. v
Bennett had not recovered from the
effects of the exposure and Bcenes in
cident to the wreck when he arrived
on the Dlrlgo to-night and seemed to
be in a half, dazed condition. He col
lected his thoughts, however, suffi
ciently to* recall what was probably
one of the most thrilling and pathetic
incidents of the wreck. This was the
action oC a "man unknown to Bennett
who. after 1 his wife and. two children
were drowned before his eyes, became
f rantic , and , plunged headlong into the
sea. He was undoubtedly lost. ' as
neither Bennett' nor any of the crew
saw him come to the surface and no
lifeboats were near him at the, time.
In Bennett's opinion there was; some
misunderstanding between ; the officers
of the ill-fated vessel and the, crew in
charge of the tug Holyoke over signals
at the critical moment, [ this fact
Bennett believes resulted in the \ loss
of many lives among those who' stayed
with the doomed ship who might oth
erwise have been saved. Bennett
speaks in the highest , praise of the | ac
tion of the crew on the ; tug Sea' Lion,
who, he says, rendered every, assistance
possible from; the moment they arrived
on the K scene. ,
Bennett also witnessed a lifeboat cap-

I also noted constant expressions of

is doing. Evidently a strong suspicion
exists in the minds of Russians. Added
to the published fact that the latter
portion of > the German Emperor's
speech at the Guards* barracks has
been suppressed,, if is here stated to
have referred to Germany's policy in
the Far East in the event of war.
The conviction prevails here that any
aggressive action by the German Em
peror In the present crisis would be a
signal for France's immediate entry
upon the scene.
From what I have heard the official
class has formed a conviction that thÂ«
United States will morally assist' Japaa
when asked to do so.
I made a number of visits on the
Russian Christmas among the official
classes and found the opinion prevail
ing that Russia i3 to-day virtually at
war with Japan, although, what is actu
ally being done in the way of assuming
strategical positions is concealed by
both sides.
"When the time comes." the Russians
say, "you Will find that just as many
Russian troops have been smuggled
into desirable points in Korea as Japa
nese, who are well known to be pour
ing in."

Two boats were launched and in
these some of the passengers were en
trusted to the angry waters. The first
boat contained only women and chil

going off in her. The boat was over
whelmed C00 feet from the Clallam and
its occupants shrieked in vain for aid
from those aboard the steamer. Not
a hand could be raised to aid them.
The second boat rowed away into the
darkness. On board the Clallam men
were seen as the waves tore them from
the boal, but later she was still afloat.
The third boat, containing only men,
was swamped in launching.
From that time on the members of
the crew and a few passengers who
had volunteered to remain aboard, de
voted themselves to the task of trying
to save the vessel. The pumps were
impotent and three gangs of bailers
were pet to work. In spite of their

VICTORIA, B. C Jan. 9.â When the
steamer Clallam broke down she was

Isaac Hewitt, a passenger, who re-
Fides on Vancouver Island, stayed with
the Clallam until she foundered and
went down. He shares the opinion of
Charles G. Bfer.nett that had the Holy
oke responded promptly to the signals
of the crew on board the Clallam many
persons would have been saved who
The distress Vof the vessel had been
noticed by watchers ashore. The steam
ship company owning the Clallam
begged steamer and tugboat owners of
Victoria to put off to relieve the vessel
and hurried an American fleet of six
tugs to the relief of the Clallam. But
the Victoria boat owners refused to
risk their craft in the gale. One steam
er, the Maud, started out of Victoria
harbor to go to the Clallam's rescue,
but after striking the storm *vas com
pelled to put about and run to safety.
Distress flags were flying from the
Clallam from the time she became dis
abled. There was no boat in sight at
the time the flags were hoisted, but it
was with the chance that a passing
vessel might sight her or those an
shore be attracted by the Clallam's
fight against the odds of the sea that
the signals were suspended.
.After the vessel had been fighting for
two or three hours to keep headway
or to preserve the safety of the pas
sengers a steam schooner passed astern
of "the Clallam. three miles distant.
Aboard the Clallani the vessel could

But they passed on up the straits with

human strength was but a feeble pro

the boat would carry the news of the
Clallam's distress. It was impossible
to make out the name of the passing

San Francisco.
Had this ve3ael stood by and given
aid to the Clallam the disaster might
have been avoided, or in any event the
extent of the horror minimized. -Had
word been carried at that time to Vic
toria or some other nearby port there
is a possibility that relief might have
been sent earlier, though the refusal
of Victoria steamers to go to the res

riences. We wanted to wait, he said,
until the cause of the accident was
known, before telling his story.
Morris was a passenger for Victoria
and did not know a jingle person on
the boat. When the call for volunteers
to help save the ship went forth, how
ever, he was one of the first to respond,
and he baled water until his head
swam. He says, he worked below for
full ten hours. He was in no hurry
to leave the disabled ship, he says, for
he had figured .it out that b*ng a
wooden vessel she would be hard , to
sink. The fact that every boat launched
sank while yet in sight of those 'on the
Clallam made it easier for those ;jyho
stayed to be contented, for it seetned
like certain death to try to get away
in any of the boats.
Morris was on the Clallam when she
sank. He says he Cannot swim much,

"Morris says the conduct of the pas
sengers and crew who stayed by the
boat was admirable. There was no
contusion, but every man worked as
hard as he knew how and aid, exactly
what he was told. He says; tons and
tons of freight were thrown 'overboard

water was nearly up to 'his -neck and

"The Clallam's pumps refused to work

only by the efforts of the passengers 'Â¦

A great deal of the water poured in

as it accumulated. AH this time we
were working in the belief that if the

had stayed with the ship in the belief
that at the critical moment the Holyoke
would abandon her tow and come
alongside to rescue the passengers.
"We all believed that the Holyoke
would let go her line and come along
side when . it became apparent that
further effort to save the ship was use
less," said Hewitt. "This belief served
to keep us buoyed up until a few min
utes before the ship sank.
"We signaled the Holyoke repeatedly
to come to our aid, but she continued
to tow us with a line which put her
out of range of the human voice. I
noticed red lamps were used by the
crew on the Clallam. I don't know
whether this is the proper signal in
such cases, but in any event it had no
visible effect upon the Holyoke's crew.
"The Sea Lion wasted no time when
she arrived In rendering all the assist
ance possible. Every member of the
crew rendered heroic assistance and it
was largely due to her efforts that any
of the survivors live "to tell the story

HURBOWIIIG SPECTACLE.
There was no confusion on board.
The women and children were out in
boats and then every able-bodied man
turned in and tried to save the ship.
John Smith, who worked alongside of
me, was drowned. We were in water
up to our necks and were chilled to
the bone, when Captain Roberts
dered all hands on deck to save them
selves. While, we were at work be
low we were expecting the Clallam to
go down every minute, and how the
steamer lived through 3ome of those
seas ois a wonder to me. *
â¢ "I rushed on deck and saw a boat
swinging from the davits. I chopped
it loose with an- ax and she swamped
in the heavy sea running. I got aboard
and though the boa.t was filled to the
brim with water and a terrible sea
was running she did not go down. I
was chilled "to the bone, was hungry
"The sight of those poor women and
children being killed right before our
eyes was a terrible- one," said Parker.
"The first boats were launched about
3 o'clock in the afternoon when it was
seen that the Clallcn was filling: de
spite our efforts to bail her out. The
wat-. put out our 'fires, so that the
whistle could not be used, and the fog
made it impossible to see our signals
of distress.
. "Three boats were launched and
they all went down right, before our
eyes. The first boat contained women
and children, the next was a boatload
of men and the third had women and
children. The first boat lived about
half an hour as near as I can recol
lect; the others were, swamped before
they hardly got clear of the ship.
There was an awful sea running in
the straits and it looked to me as if
the waves were as high as this dock.
"The crew and the men passengers
â¢worked down below trying to bail out
the water, but work as we would it
kept crowding on us. We threw
everything loose overboard and tried
to plug up the holes with bundles and
boxes, but it was pf no use. She
floated something like ten hours from
the time she sprung a leak and lived
through seas that threatened to
swamp her every minute.
SEATTLE. Wash., Jan. 9.â E. Parker,
an. oiler on the Clallam, fought against
the flood that poured into the hold of
the ill-fated vessel until the water was
up to hiÂ» neck, and then got away in
the only boat that lived through the
storm, \tfhen Captain Roberts shouted
to the men below that the ship was lost
and ordered them up to save them
selves If they could, Parker grabbed an
ax and cut loose the last remaining
boat on the Clallam.
The lifeboat swamped, but Parker
held on and he drifted about all the
rest of the night, a lone passenger In
a boat that Was level full of water, but
still did not go down. He was picked up
off Smiths Island about 5 o'clock this
morning by the tug Sea Lion while he
was drifting about helplessly In plain
sight of the lighthouse, but unable to
attract the attention of the people on
shore. He was weak from exposure
and cold, but the men on the Sea Lion
poured hot coffee into him, gave him
dry clothing and he arrived in Seattle
on the steamer Dirigo not much/ the
worse for his ' experience, except that
his nerves were badly shaken by the
terrible sights he had witnessed.
Parker was the last man to leave the
sinking vessel except Pilot Doheney.
It was a scramble for life without hope
of saving the sinking vessel when Par
ker came up on deck. He says he cut

into the sea. He thinks Doheney

Bryan returned to-day from his Euro
pean tour. Asked about the great men
he had visited, Bryan said that he re
garded Balfour, England's Premier, as
on* of the most scholarly men hÂ» had
ever met. He spoke in terms of high
praise and gratitude of the manner in
which he had been received and helped
by Embassador Choate and all the
other American representatives to
whom he had applied. "
"I met President Loubet of France,"
Bryan said, "and I found him very
pleasant. President Deucher of Switz
erland is a very genial man, with Ger
man characteristics strongly marked.
The Czar of Russia also appeared to me
to be a charming man. The Crown
Prince of Denmark is friendly to a de
gree. With the exception of President
Loubet. all of them spoke English well.
I enjoyed the visit to the Vatican and
was presented to the Pope by Father
Kennedy, the head of the American
College in Rome. The Pope did not
speak English. I was greatly impressed
with the friendly feeling everywhere
exhibited to the American people. I do
not think it was the friendship of awe.
They seemed to like us."
"Do you agree with other travelers
that the people are really more the
rulers in England than in this coun
try?" he was asked.
"In England, I think," Bryan said,
"public opinion prevails more than in
any other place I know, except perhaps
France and Switzerland. Switzerland
is far more democratic than the United
States. Public opinion controls there
more quickly than anywhere I know."
Bryan said he was going to Connecti
cut on Monday and that he hoped to be
able to go to Nebraska before the, end
of the coming week..
Asked if he favored the holding of
the Democratic National Convention in
New York, Bryan gave an emphatio
negative answer. He said:
"If you people have as much money
as you say you have you can afford to
| go into the center of the country. You
| have been boasting about your wealth.
! and can afford to spend a' little of it. I
I am opposed to any extreme point of the
j country being selected for the conven-
I tion."
Bryan would not say where he would
like the convention to be held, but sug
gested come city In the center of the
country-
Bryan would not talk about the plat
form. .He said he knew of nothing that
should be taken out of the last plat
form and could not Bay what should
be added. He refused to discuss the
Panama situation, saying he wanted to
know more about it.
MARRIAGE OF BANKER *
MORSE IS ANNULLED
New York Jurist Decides That Wife
Had Not Been Legally Divorced â
From Her First Husband.
NEW YORK, Jan. 9. â After a union
of two years the marriage of Mrs.
Charles F. Dodge to Charles W.
Morse, banker and former president
of the American Ice Company, has
been annulled by Supreme Court Jus
tice Bischoff, on the ground that when
she became his wife she had not been
legally divorced from her first hus
band.
It appears that Mrs. Dcyige was
married to Charles F. Dodge, a hotel
proprietor, in Atlanta, GfL. March 28,
1877. In 1898 she obtained a de
cree of divorce and in 1901 married
Morse in this city. Recently Dodge
had the decree set aside on the ground
that it had been Illegally obtained in
that he was not properly served with
notice of the suit.
This decision rendered the Morse
marriage illegal and petition for its
annulment was necessary In order to
straighten out the tangle. Dodge is
said to be at present in New Orleans.
Much serecy has been thrown about
the case, lawyers connected with it
even denying that Morse, the banker,
is a party to the sut.

has been directed to return to Japan
immediately.
The reports that the Russian answer
is of such a nature that some time
must elapse before any decisive action
be taken are apparently borne out by
the information received in diplomatic
circles here. The reply is said to raise
new questions, which will require time
for consideration.
VIENNA, Jan. 9. â The Austrian-
Hungarian Foreign Office has received
a cable message from Tokio saying
Japan has no intention of taking any
offensive measures in Korea so long
as the negotiations with Russia are
going on. The officials and diplomats
here are hopeful. They believe the
chances for a peaceful adjustment of
the dispute is distinctly better, since
the Russian answer apparently is more
favorable than the early reports sug
gested.
Their Coa*ideration by Japan Insures
Weeks of Delay.
RUSSIA RAISES XEW QUESTIONS.
NEW YORK, Jan. 9.â In the forth
coming edition of the Xew York Med
ical Journal Dr. S. B. Tracy discusses
the, therapeutical possibilities of ra
dium, advancing the belief that it may
be ultimately used internally as a med
icine. He says:
"The property possessed by radium
of imparting its activity to various
fluids, as shown In experiments, seems
to offer reasonable ground for hopa
that, in this way, it may be therapeut
ically administered internally and the
fight against bacterial disease be waged
directly in the tissues affected, through
the agency of the blood and lymph cir
culations and the various internal se
cretions. It IS true that such retention
of properties in the radium fluids is
only temporary, but â¢ the process of
manufacture is so simple that when
radium is available .in greater quan
tities than at present there will be. no
difficulty in* any suitable case in keep
ing up 'the supply of freshly prepared
and active solution^"

The Stock Exchange relapsed into a
distressing state of apathy. This was
deepened on Friday by a rumor that
the Russian reply was altogether un
satisfactory and that Japan had 35.000
troops ready to start for Korea. Con
sols made a fresh low record, but clos

S Meanwhile Continental bourses have
continued calm, if not optimistic. Paris
throughout the week remained a buyer

declared that war was_ inevitable.

It . is not known whether Russia's
concession goes to the extent of relin
quishing her contention for a neutral

understood that it relates chiefly to
giving definite assurance of Japan's
rights in Southern Korea.
Although reports of mediation con

PARIS, Jan. 9.â Official advices re
ceived to-day further convince those
in the highest authority that the Rus
so-Japanese war crisis has been avert
ed, at least for the present, and that
the. situation is being brought distinct
ly within the lines of diplomatic adjust
ment.
Reports, chiefly from Tokio, "but also
from St. Petersburg, give a clear view
of the circumstances leading up to the
sudden improvement at the situation.
They show that the Russian answer
actually reached Tokio the night of
January 6, and proved to be the turning
point. Prior to its receipt Japan had
been maRing strenuous preparations
for sending two divisions to Southern
Korea. The official reports establishing
"these preparations are beyond '-. the
slightest , question, but the note re
ceived on the 6th disclosed to Japan for
the first time that Russia fully conced
ed Japan's paramount rights in South
ern Korea. â¢â¢ : Â¦'Â¦Â¦-.
Russia's concession thus gave Japan
practically what she had been prepar
ing,^ assert by force, and, accordingly,
military activity .was suspended, as
Russia's concession made unnecessary
Japan's forcible assertion of paramount
position;; in Southern Korea.
The three days succeeding January 6
gave. an opportunity to the authorities
in Tokio to consider and. recognize Rus
sia's concession. Whether it will be
satisfactory the reports have not dis
closed, but the suspension of military
activity Is regarded as removing the
most dangerous aspect and as giving
hope that Japan is likely to receive
Russia's answer in a conciliatory spirit.
Belief That Russian Concessions to

Japan, it is further stated from the

HOPE REVIVES IN PARIS.
The Temps this evening gave promi
nence to a statement, purporting to
come from important private Russian
sources, explaining Russia's present
pacific tendencies. It asserts that Bezo
brazoff, who has been looked upon as
the leader of the Russian war party,
recently incurred the hostility of the
Grand Duke Alexander and that the
latter, who strenuously opposed war
with Japan, succeeded in impressing
his views upon the Czar. The paper
adds that as a result of the personal
feeling aroused by the incident, Bezo
brazoft obtained leave to go abroad and
intends to depart from St. Petersburg
during the next two or three days, thus
confirming previous London and St.
Petersburg reports that Bezobrazoff
had lost the favor of the Czar.
steps have been- taken by France to
ward mediation. It is pointed out that
such a movement, if addressed to-Ja
pan, probably would originate with
Great Britain, owing to their close po
litical relations.
PEKING, -Jan. 9. â The Chinese Em
peror has ratified the American and
Japanese treaties of commerce with
China.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â In view of
Minister Conger's last advices, the of
ficials here were prepared for the news
of thecommercial treaty's signature by
the Emperor. Besides,' they knew that
certain extraneous influences adverse to
the treaty had disappeared, or, at least,
had been suspended. The next step In
order is the exchange in ratifications of
the treaty.
Profiting by past experiences in the
deliberate methods of Oriental diplom

General Goodnow, to allow a very liber
al period of time for this part of the ne
gotiations, so that the date was set a
year ahead, making it next October.
However, the department, with the con
currence of the Chinese authorities, will
make every effort to secure a speedy
exchange.

Not the slightest difficulty is expected

pared for this by submitting: estimates
to Congress for the salaries of Consuls
and nominations will be sent in very
soon. On their confirmations the Con
suls will proceed to Peking, present
their credentials, obtain their exequa
turs, and. repairing to their posts, will
open consular offices, ready to clear
American merchant ships for the first
time from interior Manchurian ports.

ordinary diligence in its dispatch should

hence. The exchange must take place
in Washington between Secretary Hay
and Sir Chentung Liang Cheng 1 , the
Chinese Minister here. After that cere
mony the treaty will' be proclaimed by
the President and a date set for its pro
visions to take effect. As these largely
concern customs dues and affect ship

time on these points.

TOKIO, Jan. 9. â Japan addressed a
note to Russia to-day, through Min
ister Rosen. Its character has not
been disclosed, -but it is- said that
Japan requires an answer within a
given number of days. Whether the j
note mentions the time, making the
document an ultimatum, or whether
the time is intimated otherwise, is un
known. The Government, however, is
determined to obtain an early response
and close the discussion, if it should
prove to be fruitless.
It is understood that Japan adheres
flosely to her original contentions,
and. r It is believed, that if Russia fails
to fairly- met the demands, war will
ensue.
The attitude of the British and
Americans greatly encourages the
Japanese war epirit, vrhich is stronger
than ever.

has been deferred, for a day or two.

PILES.
Cured Quickly and Without Pain.
There are pile ' remedies without
number, but there is only one cure,
and that is the Pyramid Pile Cure,
which is in the form of a suppository
and Is applied directly to the seat of
the trouble.
Any physician will tell you that for
the proper treatment of Piles nothing
can compare with a suppository,
whereas the greater number of prep-
arations that are offered to you for
the treatment of this disease are lo-
tions, salves and ointments." "Why?
Because they are not so expensive as
a suppository, which is bound to con-
tain more costly ingredients and
which requires special machinery
to make it; moreover, a suppository
inserted up the rectum comes in direct
contact with the cause of the com-
plaint, and j no other form of treat-
ment does so.
Wallace Cookman. Hallerton. P. Q.,
Canada, writes: "I have had two sur-
gical operations for piles' and they
were not a success; after using three
boxes- of Pyramid Pile Cure I feel as
though I never had piles, and they
have afflicted me for twenty-flve
years.".
B. H. Palmer, Windsor, Cal.: "After
suffering from piles for fifteen years
and trying different salves and olnt-
: ments in vain I was completely cured
by the use of two fifty-cent packages
of Pyramid Pile Cure."
. These and thousands of similar let-
ters go to show that piles can ,be
cured, are cured. Cured to stay cured.
Cured so they won't come back. Cured
j without cutting. Cured without dan-
1 ger. Cured without- pain. Cured with-
out detention from work. Cured with-

Benson's hearing was called earlier

Attorney Campbell of San Francisco
contended that such a course amount
ed to harassment: that his appearance
here was unnecessary and would have*

of said church: that the next high
est governing body in said church
is the twelve apostles, con
sisting of twelve -members of
said church, who 'are under the di
rection of the first presidency,' and
said apostles on the dissolution of the
first presidency for any reason what
soever, then and not otherwise, have
authority equal to such first presi
dency..
"Respondent further alleges that
since the manifesto of President Wll
ford Woodruff was Issued in 1890
.neither a belief in nor a practice of
polygamy or polygamous cohabita
tion has either been taught or en
couraged."
CONTROL OF THE CHURCH/
Smoot admits that the first presi
dency of the Mormon church is vest
ed with supreme authority,,- in all
| things spiritual and in all things tem
poral, so far as temporal things per
tain to the affairs of the church. He
denies that the first presidency or the
twelve apostles are supreme in the
exercise of the alleged mandates. He
says the only accepted standard works
of the church are the Bible (King
James' version), the Book of Mormon,
the Pearl of Great Price and the Doc
trine and Covenants, together with
the manifesto of President Wllf ord
Woodruff, dated 1890. So far as quo
tations are made from any of the fore
going and correctly quoted, the re
spondent makes no complaint, but he
denies the construction placed upon
them by the protestants.
It is admitted that the Mormon
church made a rule in regard /to - its
leading officials taking part in poli
tics, but Smoot denies that this rule
Is fully or correctly \ set forth in the
protest.
In reference to the deposing of Mo
ses Thatcher from the twelve apostles
and his defeat by the church in his
contest for senatorship in the Legis
lature, the respondent denies that the
defeat was due to his opposition to
the rule of the church. He. admits
that remarks were made by George Q.
Cannon, Wllf ord Woodruff, Lorenzo
Snow, " John Henry . Smith, Brigham
Young and Joseph Smith on the sub
ject of such deposition, but denies that
such* remarks are corectly quoted : in
the protest.
termlned at the Coroner's inqueat,
which will be held next week.
Concerning the political significance
of his election as United States Senator,
Mr. Smoot says that" In May, 1902, he
announced he would be a candidate be
fore the Legislature to be next elected,
and that : such declaration was of his
own Judgment.
" Continuing; he says "that the Demo
cratic papers In the State of Utah, op
posing the candidacy of this respond
ent, r staled over and over again In
prominent headlines and in strong edi
torials* that a vote I for the Republican
ticket meant just that much toward
the selection of this respondent as the
next Republican United States Senator
from the State of Utah; that the mem
bers of the Legislature were named and
elected on the issue, and your respond
ent^as the choice by a large majority
of such Legislature as the Republican
United States Senator from the State of
Utah, , and most of the gentile Repub
lican legislators .voted -for this respond-r
eht for such office. ; At the ' time . all of
the Democratic Mormon legislators op
posed his nomination to such office and
voted for another candidate."
TEIXS OF. HIS ELECTION'.
polygamy or that Smoot or any body
of officials sought to pass a law nul
lifying, enactments against polygam
ous cohabitation. It is admitted that
such a law did pass the Utah Legisla
ture in 1891, but it is asserted that
many of the Mormon members voted
against the bill and that, it was vetoed
by the Governor and-that the veto was
sustained by the Legislature, a large
majority of -which were members of
the Mormon church.
Smoot admits the charge that he is
a director, of'Brigham Young Acad
emy, but alleges that he Is not fami
liar with details of the employment of
instructors.
The charge that Smoot, from the
high station of United States Senator,
would urge war upon the home, is
denied in strong terms. He agrees
that the home is the basic institution
upon whose purity and perpetuity
rests the very Government ; itself , and
he alleges that he has as sacred regard
for the station of Senator and for its
duties as has any of the protestants or
the most loyal citizens. He admits
that the enjoyment of the privileges
of statehood must depend upon the
observance of the sacred compact
upon which statehood was secured;
also that the rights thereby granted
are not inalienable, but denies that he
is or ever will be unfitted to make any
law.
the Thirteenth District for next fall's
election. The district leaders have de
cided to offer him the nomination and
all that now remains to make Vander
bilt the candidate is his acceptance
when the nomination is tendered. The
leaders say their only fear on that
point is that the young millionaire
may not care to fight Francis Burton
Harrison, who is now the Democratic
Representative of the district. They
roomed together at Tale and are the
closest, of friends. The district is nor
mally Republican.
"As to the charge that he is a
polyguinlst, the respondent says that
he was married on the 17th day of
September. 1SS4. to Alpha May El
dridge- She is stiil his wife and is
the mother of all his children. He
has never had another wife and has
never cohabited with any other
womzn.
"Second â That he is bound by some
oath or obligation which is inconsis
tent with the oath required by the
constitution which was administered
to him before he took his seat as a
Senator.
"Both these charges respondent de
nies.
"This respondent is advised and
avers that but two of the charges
made against him in said protests,
either directly or by implication, are
-such as, if true, could legally affect
his right to hold his seat in the Sen
ate. These two charges are:
"First â That the respondent Is a
polygamist.
TEXT OF THE PROTEST.
Senator Smoot's protest is as fol

GRASS VALLEY, Jan. 9.â A faithful
watch dog played the part of a life
saver in the fire which destroyed the
home of Farmer James Stead and his
famfly in Pleasant Valley, near this
city, early this morning.
A\vak6ned by the furious barking of
the dog, Stead arose shortly ( after mid
night and was' nearly suffocated by a
'volume of smoke. On opening door
flames and smoke swept in from anoth
er room. Stead's shouts awakened the
members of the family and they were
compelled to flee in their night clothes
with the flames close behind them.
- Simpson and Alexander started their
prospecting early last winter. They
uncovered their strike in January last,
but did not make, (he find known until
now. They had little means and sub
sisted precariously, their chief diet be
ing salt pork and beans. Both are ex
perienced miners, and they knew that
everything pointed to a strike further
on and persisted in their work. Every
two ( week3 one oir the other would. go
into "town and procure supplies, but
they were .careful not to divulge the
success; they were meeting with. or the
location' of their prospect.7
"It was on New Year's day of this
year that the strike was made. ' The
vein was uncovered at last, and as they
probed it deeper. It widened out.
The lucky and determined prospect
ors are now arranging to develop their
find upon the proper scale. Mining men
are enthusiastic over the ore displayed,
and it Is likely that there will be some
thing like a rush to the vicinity of the
new discovery.-
WADSWORTH, Nev., Jan. 9.âCon
siderable excitement has been caused
here by tl^ display of ore samples
taken from a strike recently made and
which may prove to be the richest ever
discovered in Nevada. The samples
show a range in value of from $2000 to
$3000 to the ton. The discovery was
made about twenty-nine miles north of
Reno by William J. # Alexander and
John W. Simpson after a year of hard
work and privations. It is said that
there is a large area of pay rock in the
vicinity of the big strike, and tbat the
locality may prove to be another Tono
pah. Mining men are agreed that if
there is any considerable quantity of
ore like the samples displayed the mine
that it comes from will prove one of the
heaviest producers in the West.
The rock was taken from a tunnel at
a depth of fifty feet. It Is free milling
and fairly glitters with the yellow met

Clmrtreijsc to Fizure in Lawsuit.
Chartreuse is going shortly to be the
cent: il feature of a lawsuit almost as
remarkable as the liqueur itself. To put
it briefly, the French Government,
through Its official liquidator, claims
that by the forfeiture clauses of the
law it becomes vested cot only In all
the trade-marks and the patent rights,
but even in the very formula or recipe
itself, and the action will shortly be
tried at Grenoble, with Father Rey, the
late procurator of the onastery and
legal depositor yof its rights, as de-
fendant. The manufacture was first
placed under the protection of the law
by Father Greceer in 1871. A merely
nominal value of Â£4 was placed upon
the business when he transferred his
rights to his successor. Father
Gramier: but when the latter relin
quished them about six years ago to
Father Rey the value was declared at
about Â£180,000 â a year's turnover. â New

When an old chap marries a young
woman he must feel like a man who
has robed his best friend.
Porter was a man about 5 feet ''9
inches in height and of medium frame.
At the*time he disappeared he wore
dark clothes and a black sweater." One
of his intimates here states that he
had several gold teeth.
A party of hunters. Porter among
them, proposed making an extensive
hunt, and he went out to search .for
good territory. He was last seen start
ing out of Los Banos toward the Coast
range. The road he was on led direct
ly into the Pacheco Pass, where -the
skeleton was found. The wheel beside
the skeleton was a Rambler, bought in
this city In April, 1895, from S. M.
Thompson. Unfortunately Thomp
son's books previous to 1896 have been
destroyed. However, it is known that
Porter bought a Rambler wheel, wi*
copper plated steel rims, from Thomp
son some time during 1895, and it was
on this wheel that he rode away. The
theory has always been held here that
Porter got lost in the slough country
or perhaps met with an accident and
died there. Now, however, there are
many of his intimates who believe he
started through the Pacheco Pass to
visit his parents at Santa Cruz, a trip
he had made once before.
L. M. Gilkey, a bicycle repairer, stated
positively this afternoon that the wheel
was not the one owned by Dunham.
He had done some work on Dunham's
wheel the day before Dunham killed
the McGlincy family. At that time
Dunham had an Ontario wheel. This
one is a Rambler. Thebonea are those
of a small man, while Dunham was
large. While the party who discovered
the remains believed they were Dun
ham's, Sheriff Langford and his depu
ties take small stock in it. They are
more inclined to believe the remains
those of T. F. Porter, a printer of Fres
no, who disappeared in 1894 or 1895.
FRESNO, Jan. 9.â The belief is held
in this city that the discovery of a
skeleton and a bicycle in the Pacheco
Pass explains the disappearance of T.
F. Porter, a printer who rode away
from this city on his wheel in the early
part of December, 1895, and. has never
since been heard from. Porter was an
enthusiastic wheelman and made nu
merous long trips on his bicycle. The
occasion of his trip at the time he dis
appeared was to find a good duck hunt
ing field in the sloughs in the western
part of Merced County. . .
SCOUTS DUNIIASI THEORY.
Nothing was found that 'would di
rectly lead to the identity of the man.
A key ring and five keys were among
the effects. The keys were those of tin
boxes or satchels and a Yale key num
bered 21,076. 1
The front wheel of the bicycle Is bad
ly broken and would Indicate that the
rider had had a bad fall. The rim and
many spokes are broken. , . '
Two o'clock this afternoon they
brought their exhibit to the County
Jail. It consists of the skull, cross
bones and a few ribs and other bones.
There is a F. & W. 38-caliber revolver,
a box nearly full of cartridges, a pearl
handle penknife, scraps of a blue or
black sweater and part of a leather
belt. In the lower jaw the second and
third molars are filled with gold, and
in the lower jaw the second and third
molars on the left and the second molar
on the right are gold-filled. Two of
the chambers of the revolver were
empty. A whisky and vaseline bottle
tvere also- found. The bicycle is a
Rambler, model 12, 1S93 . make, and
numbered 3740. It had had copper rims
and the. tires appeared to have been
new one8, r and from the patent on the
tires they were put on the wheel after
1894.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 9.â A grewsome ex
hibit of skull and bones and a broken
and weather-beaten bicycle is puzzling
Sheriff Langford and his deputies. It
is possible that the bones are those of
James C. Dunham, the sextuple mur
derer of Campbell. P. B. Payne, A. W.
Hall and E. Weisendanger, all of
Campbell, found the remains in the.Pa
eheco Pass hills yesterday,- and they
brought them to the County Jail to
day, thinking that they were relics of
Dunham. William A. Beasly, an attor
ney, accompanied them to see that they
lost none of their rights in making the
demand for ih<> $10,000 reward that the
citizens of San Jose had offered for the
murderer of the McGlincy family.
The Payne party had been hunting
for geese in the San Joaquln, near Los
Banos, for a week, and Thursday start
ed for their homes at Campbell. About
{our and a half miles above Bell sta
tion, in the Pacheco Pass, Payne got
out of *he rig to hunt quail on the side
of a hill. He had taken but a few. steps
in the brush when he came on a skull.
He called to his companions, and they
made a search of the place. The skull
lay about fifty yards from the fence on
the north side of the road. On a little
flat 100 yards farther up the hill, under
some oaks, the remains of a skeleton
and a "bicycle were found. Scattered
about on the ground were particles of
clothing and a revolver. In the skull is
a bullet hole just behind the right ear,
which shows that the man committed
suicide or was murdered. Payne and
his comrades gathered up everything
they could find that belonged to the
remains ahd brought them to this city.
PISTOL AND BICYCLE.
When Plumbing Inspector Chapman
learned of the Governor's action in
sending to Oakland for a plumber his
official dignity was offended and he an
nounced that unless Pierce came back
and did his work over again according
to local regulations .he would place
him under arrest.
The Governor met this threat of the
Plumbing Inspector by formally charg
ing him with incompetency, and ap
pearing before the Board of Health
in person to substantiate his charges.
He was accompanied by Editor Dan
iels of Oakland, who was his guest at
the time the sewer gas pervaded the
mansion, and Daniels told, of his de
tection of the odors and his -inspection
with the view to finding the cause.
The Governor's charges are formal in
character and uttered with great re
gard for legal exactness.
The Governor signs the charges in
his capacity as a doctor of medicine*
Chapman's defense will be that he is
not supposed to hunt for sewer gas;
that is the Sanitary Inspector's duty.
The hearing will be resumed next
Thursday night. - , 4 ,
The proceeding arises from formal
charges filed last night with the Board
of Health by Governor Pardce against
City Plumbing Inspector Chapman.
Soon after he installed his famlJyin
the newly purchased executive man
sion Governor Pardee was struck by
the foul odors which filled the apart
ments. He sent for a local plumber,
who informed the Governor that his
new home was infested by bats. .The
Governor, not satisfied, called in^_the
Plumbing Inspector, who coincided in
the bat theory of the local plumber. .
The odors increasing, the Governor
sentUo Oakland for Fred Pierce, a
plumber, and the latter, after an in
spection of the . premises, discovered
the seat of the trouble in an open
sewer under the mansion. The Gov
ernor was Indignant over the situa
tion and expressed himself in strong,
language concerning the peril in which
his family had been placed from the
deadly sewer eas.
SACRAMENTO, \ Jan. 9. â Governor
George C. Pardee and G. B. Daniels,
publisher of the Oakland Enquirer*
have Â¦.been notified by the City Board

A young woman of Lexington, Ky.,
Miss Florence Graham Offut, has hit
upon a new method of publicity. She Is
out with a "card to the public" discuss
ing the reasons that prompted her to
refuse to marry the rich and aristo
cratic Judge Stout unless she could
continue in her profession, which la
that of "teacher of physical culture"
in the State College. Her work is pure-,
ly a matter of conscience, It seems â a
sort of protest against "the senseless
round of gayety" in which most women,
travel. "Any woman can maintain &
home and a profession if she cares to.
It is a matter of attending fewer card
parties, that is all." Marriage and di
vorce do not afford enough opportunity

in support of such a movement.
The resolutions were introduced by
Congressman McNary, who classed OI
ney as one of the J'foremost Americans
and foremost Democrats." He thought
that if the Democrats were to win .this
year they must carry the Eastern
States, and said that the nomination
of a man from New England would
have the immense advantage to the
Democrats of establishing a, large East

GREAT FALLS, Hpnt, Jan. 9. â J.
M. Reeves, accused of having headed
the .alleged . whitecapping party that
visited the home of George Gould in

December 30, was last evening given
a preliminary hearing before Justice
H. L. Descombes In Belt and bound

WHITECAr LEADER r
IS HELD FOR TRIAL
He aided Lamar in saving Missis
sippi from political misrule, and was
empowered by Governor Hampton to
look after South Carolina's interest,
having canvassed the State foT Its re
demption with Hampton, and after the
adjournment of Congress secured the
removal of troops from Carolina. For
this he received the historic dispatch,
'.'South Carolina thanks you." His life
size portrait hangs in the State Capitol.
The ladies sent his little daughter, born
in Washington, a silver urn, with
Hampton's dispatch on it, and to Gen
eral Gordon a superb silver service,
each piece mounted with ' a gold pal
metto tree. As Governor his adminis
tration was faultless. The New. York
Sun declared his first inaugural
"worthy of Thomas Jefferson"." His
last election as United States Senator
was a marvelous political victory. Un
opposed, until he antagonized the sub
treasury plan of the Farmers* Alliance,
which had four-fifths of the Legisla
ture in its favor, he was elected after
the most exciting contest of the time.
In the wild enthusiasm succeeding his
victory he was borne by the multitude
through the Capitol to -the streets,
placed on a caisson and drawn, about
the city among shouts and rejoicing,
while the whole State was ablaze with
bonfires. General Gordon has been all
his life a model of social worth and an
ardent Christian worker.
TIIAXKED BY A STATE.
After the war he gathered his wing
of the army and njade the greatest
speech of his life to his heart-broken
men, exhorting them to bear the trial,
go home in peace, obey the laws, re
build the country and work for the
weal and harmony of the republic. His
seven years' service In the United
States Senate was brilliant and states
manlike. He delivered powerful and elo
quent speeches upon finance, civil ser
vice reform and made a masterly de
fense of the South, exerting a conserva
tive influence. In the Louisiana trou
bles he was chosen by the Democrats
in Congress to draft an address to the
people of Louisiana and the South,
urging patience, endurance and an, ap
peal to the returning sense of Justice
to cure wrongs. He took a masterful
part in the debate, and a serious vari
ance between him and Senator Conk
ling was adjusted by Senator Bayard
and others. The farmers of Georgia

soldier. An English correspondent of
the London Times declared him the ris
ing genius of the South. He was sec
ond only to the great Lee. He was five
times desperately wounded. His de
voted wife, who accompanied him dur
ing the entire war and whose narrow
escapes would equal any romance, by
her care and faithful nursing saved
his life when pierced by five bullets at
Sharpsburg. He led the last charge at
fateful Appomattox, taking the Fed

BERLIN, Jan. 9. â Professor Gunkel
has come to the conclusion, from
scriptural evidence, that Mount Sinai
was an active volcano when Moses led
the Israelites to it.
According to the narrative a thick
cloud lay on the mountain, the smoke
of it ascended to heaven. There was
thunder and lightning and a voice like
a trumpet- The mountain is also tie
scribed as quaking.
Putting all these things together.
Professor Gunkel. who is one of the
most advanced of Berlin theologians,
insists that Sinai was selected by
Moses on purpose. Moses spent years
in the wilderness before he went to
Egypt and knew of the existence of
this volcano.

He declined the use of his name as
a candidate for United Slates Senator
in 1871, when Norwood was elected,
and the same year went before the
Congressional committee to defend
his State in the "Ku-Klux" Investiga

Rational Democratic Convention at
Baltimore in 1672, opposing the nom
ination of Greeley; was elected Unit
ed States Senator in IS 73, and re
elected in 1879. He resigned in 1SS0
and raised money to build the Georgia
Pacific Railroad. He was elected Gov
ernor of Georgia in 1SS6, and re-elect

United States Senator.
General Gordon was one of the illus

He was mining when the war be
pan, but enlisted at once and served
heroically to the close, becoming in
succession captain, major, lieutenant
colonel, colonel, brigadier general,
major general and lieutenant general
in command of one wing of the Array
of Virginia. He settled in Atlanta
after the war. He was a member of
the National Union convention of
Philadelphia in 1866, delegate to the
National Democratic Convention in
1S6S and Seymour and Blair elector
the same year- He declined the use
of his name as a candidate for Gov

of his party, was elected and counted

made yesterday at a .conference be

be released in 1904. The exact date
of her release is not yet fixed.
Baroness de Roques says that her

For an hour last night the corpse of

SALUTING "WARSHIPSâ Subscriber.
City. The origin of forts or warship*
in a harbor saluting a foreign war ves
sel on entering the port is traced back
tcÂ» very ancient times. The discharge
of guns was to show the approaching
strangers that those in charge of the
fortifications or war vessel3 had such
faith in their visitor's peaceful mission
and intentions that they did not think
It necessary to keep the guns loaded.
The Fatal Finger Mark.
Gl.oves will soon become an indispen
sable part of every burglar's outfit. The
other day Mr. Denman of the London
courts sentenced a man to twelve
months' hard labor on the sole. evidence
of the impressions of the middle finger
of his left hand. This method of identi
fying a prisoner, far more certain than
photography, was in usa we believe in
China years before Its adoption in any
European country, and in conjunction
with the Bertillon system has been used
in France successfully for a decade or
so. It is a strange thing that nature
should have so provided every man
with a witness against himself â a wit
ness which he cannot be rid of. Dis
guise can alter the face until a photo
graph, however careful, is useless for
identification, and even the elaborate
Bertiilon system can be upset by the
deliberate Infliction of some new mark
on the body. But If a criminal mutilate
the end of : his finger such mutilation
alone would suffice to make him sus
pected. ' In attempting to avoid its evi
dence he practically confirms his guilt.
âLondon Pall' Mall Gazette. â¢
The Supreme Court of Ohio has strucjc high water
mark in the flood of American legal absurdities. Sim
ply because a jury, listened to the confession of a fiend
who boasted that he had murdered five people a new
trial has been granted. The astounding reason is given
that the jury must have been prejudiced against the de
fendant by the recital. One may say with as much jus
tice that the thoroughness /with which the prosecution
presents its case creates inevitable and illegal bias
against an accused.

0W r IXG to the number of extraordinary events
that have occurred to distract attention from
the progress of politics in Great Britain, com
paratively little heed has been given of late in this coun
try to the contest going on over Chamberlain's proposal
to safeguard British industries- by the establishment of
a protective tariff. In Great Britain itself, however,
there has been no diminution of interest in the cam
paign. The. main issues involved have long since been
threshed out by the papers and the political leaders, but
still the eagerness of the people for further information
is such that every new speech on the subject draws*
large crowds, and the daily journals continue to give a
great amount of space to speeches, to letters and to edi
torial comment on every varying phase of the campaign.
A recent issue of the London Globe in noting the
rousing reception given to Chamberlain on his recent
address at Leeds says: >Â¦ "'"'. Vs / '':!l :% T-.
. "The city, like Yorkshire at large, has in its popula
tion a solid body of hard-fighting Radicals, hitherto
steeped to the lips in Cobdenism of the most 'con
vinced' character. It is a remarkable and significant
change, therefore, that the citizens af ,this great and
busy town should have accorded to the champion.of-fis
cal reform, not only a closely attentive hearing, but a
welcome which, for heartiness, .could not be surpassed.
The audience's' cannot have been attracted by the ex
pectation of hearing some* new thing.. *. * * It is
a growing conviction among all classes that he is in the
right that chiefly draws together' these enormous meet
ings." " ;-. \
It must not be supposed the campaign is one sided.
The free traders, or "Free Fooders" as they prefer to
call themselves, are making a united and vigorous ef
fort to fasten upon Chamberlain the charge of advocat
ing a tax upon the bread of the poor. In their attempts
to explain away the prosperity that prevails in protective
tariff countries, like the United States and Germany,
they have no hesitation in resorting to the most extraor
dinary statements. Thus Winston Churchill is reported
by the Daily. News as saying:
''"Why, then';- it will be asked, do these clever Ameri
cans, these scientific Germans hold to a system which
is found to be so inferior? It is because once a protec
tionist system takes root in a country it cannot be torn
up except with terrible loss and suffering, and all the
forces of wealth, monopoly and privilege are banded to
gether .to prevent it being torn up jatx-ail. .* * * But
our industries stand on the solid earth. They do not de
pend- on "acts of. ParliameJit, or the caprice of powerful
politicians, or the appetites of great millionaires, but on
the resources of our island and the skill and intelligence
of its' people. And ; the people* of America and Germany
âthe poor people I mean â know that: they are being
cheated and bled on every article they buy for.thcun
natural^and .illicit profits of a few rich' manufacturers
and speculators.". â¢ ,' j
Thatis a very, finepicce.of rant, but it would .not. take
Chamberlain very long to expose the absurdity of it,
since, the conditions 'of Â¦ workingmen \ who are -alleged to
be '."robbed" 'in, America by the protective tariff ; are far
superior ,to "those; of the' workmen in Great' Britain, who
under a regime of Jree trade- and so-called "free food"
get very little .u;6r]Nand_ very little; food. The .Daily
Mail has, been running.Aseries, of articles under- the. title

CHAMBERLAIN'S CAMPAIGN.
The world is now watching the astounding spectacle
of a German nnd'a French warship hovering ominously
on the coast of Hayti, to terrorize that republic into
modifying the sentence imposed upon rascally bankers
caught in gigantic dishonesty and properly punished.
This conduct of Germany and France may be consid
ered by diplomats as within the legitimate province of
nations, but to a layman it looks like a cross between
piracy and the bluff of a highwayman.
Young America.
A few days ago twelve boys, rang
ing in age from S to 15 years, occupied
the chairs in the jury box in Judge
Murasky's courtroom during the ses
sion- of the Juvenile Court. There
were traces of tears upon the cheeks
of elaven of them and the head of
each and every one , of the eleven
drooped in shame. But the twelfth,
a ragged urchin about 10 years of age,
sat bolt upright in his -chair. Not a
tear bedimmed his eyes and the looks
he gave the Jydge and the spectators
contained no trace of tears or shame.
He watched his eleven companions go
up to' the Judge as they were called,
and when each of them burst into
tears at the first question asked by the
Judge, he snickered aloud and cast at
them a scornful look.
AC last his turn came. When the
clerk called the name of Mickey r>u
gan he 'arose and with no sign of
haste <Â¦ swaggered up to the Judge.
Every one smiled and even the Judge
had to hide his mouth behind his
hand.
Boldly the little street arab stared
at the Judge and there was scorn in
the glance he gave the two big officers
who stepped forward to tell the court
what the boy had done.
"Mickey." said the Judge, "what
were you arrested for?"
Mickey pointed a dirty forefinger at
the larger of the two officers and grin
ning said: "I punched him in der jaw."
SENATOR PLATT of New York took occasion at
the recent banquet of his. Congressional colleagues
to point out that the prospects of the coming Pres
idential campaign are highly favorable to the Repub
lican party, but at the same time to give warning that
the very brightness of the outlook might prove a source
of danger by engendering among Republicans a sense of
security that would lead them to fall short of the efforts
required in the campaign to make success certain.
'Among the portents of the time, said the Senator, are
signs that the Democratic party is becoming "sane and
dangerous." The signs~ are well known to the public
and # have been frequently commented on. It seems
clear the party will have just about enough sanity this
year to nominate a candidate of known conservatism
whose personality will be attractive to a good many of
that large class of people who are. more or less indiffer
ent to political principles and are fond of voting for a
change whenever they think they can do so without dan
ger to the country. If such a nomination be made the
party will undoubtedly be dangerous, and it is, none too
early to warn the public of the consequences that would
follow. f
, Another dangerous element of the situation is one
which the Senator has learned to recognize by reason of
his long experience in politics. It is a danger whose
statement involves something of a paradox. * Senator
Platt put it thus: . .
: "The Government, under President Roosevelt, has
been strong and wise: but it often happens in politics
that a political party .whicTi has had a long lease of power
is never so much in danger as when nobody has any
thing in particular to complain of, for it is then that
many people vote not with regard to great political prin
ciples, but with regard to trivial events."
Under such circumstances ' it becomes important to
remind the public of the often proved incapacity of the
Democratic party- to govern well, or even effectively,
whether well or ill. Supposing a strong candidate were
nominated by the party and through some aberration of
the popular mind were elected, he could do nothing in
office without the support of his party, and his party is
strongly tainted with a radicalism that tends to social
disturbance as well as to wildcat finance. No soonef
would the supposed conservative Democrat take office
than the radical Bryanites would be raging about him
demanding recognition, place and power. The result
would be cither a surrender of conservatism to the radi
cal wing. or "else a self-stultified administration like that
of the second term of Grover Cleveland, when the Presi
dent was denouncing the tariff of his party as a measure
of "perfidy and dishonor" and the party was denouncing
the financial policy of the President as a betrayal of the
people and a 'surrender to Wall street. ' ;*. ; â¢
This country has had ample experience with .. tariff
smashers and currency - debasers, and no intelligent
patriot can have any desire for further experiments of
that kind. For that reason it is timely to remind the
curious ones who would like to see a change of what tbe
nature of that change would surely be. Or, as Senator
Platt put it, "We, must through the, coming campaign
keep constantly before the people the often proved in
capacity of the Democratic j)arty to conduct public af
fairs and the; menace to business which proceeds -from
its very constitution."

Remarkable Promotion.
Sir John Harrington, who has Jtat
been advanced to the rank of Minister
Plenipotentiary, enjoys the distinction
of being the only British envoy who
has literally risen from the ranks, hav
ing enlisted in 1S84, at ths age of 20,
as a private in an infantry regiment.
At the age of 24, after successively
holding the grades of corporal and ser
geant, he received a commission as sec
ond lieutenant of the Middlesex Regi
ment, and fifteen months later hs was
transferred to that picked body, the
Indian Staff Corps. Before long he vol
unteered for service as vice consul
at Zailah. a pestilential place, which is
one of the seaports of Abyssinia, tha
post In question being avoided as much
as possible by the other members of/th9
Indian Staff Corps by reason oÂ£ its
loneliness and unhealthfulness. Â¦ So
good was the use which Harrington
made of his opportunities that hs was
able to render invaluable assistance to
the special mission of Sir Rennell Rodd
to Emperor Menelik in 1897, striking
up a great friendship with Lord Ed
ward Cecil, the soldier son of the lats
Lord Salisbury, and who formed part
of Sir Rennell's staff. The result was
that when the British Government re
solved to establish a permanent lega
tion in Abyssinia, where British | In- *
terests are exceedingly important, both
Sir Rennell and Lord Ed ward warmly
recommended Lieutenant Harrington to
Lord Salisbury for the post. He has
since received military promotion to
the rank of colonel, and the influeno*
which he has been able to acquire over
the dusky potentate to whom he is ac
credited is so remarkable that it has
completely relegated into the back
ground that it Russia and of Franc*/
which formerly predominated.

Ccngo Slave Traders.
ny TTTLMAM STAMPS CHFKRT.
(A.'rlcÂ«.n Traveler. Explorer and Bisr Otme
Hunter.)
â¢""orrrie-ht, 1304, by Joseph B. BowlÂ«Â«.)
The backbone of the slave trade in
the Cor.&o has been broken, but it dies
hard. It is estimated th3t before the
Interference of the European powers
SO. 000 natives were taken from the
Congo country annually and sold into
slavery. The most of these we/e de
ported to Egypt, Arabia. Persia and
Turkey; a;id so very cheap was hu
man life that i 00.000 more were killed
in the raids or dird on the way to the
coast. Think of it. over a thousand
human beings killed or taken into cap
tivity every day! But. although the
az-ea of the slave trade has been re
stricted, the Arabs still carry on their
nefarious business. Their former
Â¦.method of operation was to employ
emissaries', whom they sent on in ad
vance to the villages. These emis
saries were received as friends and
employed their advantage and repaid
the kindness shown them by forming
plans of attack. Shortly after their
iloparture the villages were invaded,
pillaged and burned, and the natives
who were considered marketable were
carried off as slaves. The Arabs have
now discovered a more excellent way.
They do not engage in the slave raid
ing themselves: they get the chief to
do it for them, and they buy the
Flaves cheaper than when the}' secur
ed them by personally conducted
iaid.Â«. There are other advantages in
this method besides cheapness. There
is no risk of life, and by keeping free
from war they make fewer enemies.
It is but too evident that in former
times they did thorough work in raid
ins the country north of the Mobangi,
as there are wide districts entirely de
populated.
It lias sometimes been charged that
the Arabs have been severely dealt
with by the Belgians and other Eu
ropean, power?. I do not think so.
They are a bad lot and have been the
scourge of Africa. From first to last
I have had a great deal to do with
thrm. When at Stanley Falls in 1S90
1 had my quarters in a house built
by Tippo Tib, the Arab chief, who had
been placed ns governor of the falls
and region around for the purpose of
repressing the slave trade west of the
falls. When our party arrived there
v.s.5 great excitement. Rashid had
just come in from an expedition east
of the fall?, which was in reality a
Blave raid on a gigantic scale. He had
with him a miscellaneous company of
about a thousand people, S00 of whom
were slaves. They had traveled up
ward of a thousand miles and as they
tame into camp they presented a woe
begone appearance. *
Hunger and forced marches had re
ducd them to the appearance >of
walking skeletons. Smallpox had also
broken out among them. And what a
Eight the camp presented! Anderson
villc must have been a paradise com
pared to it. The nlthir.ess was inde
scribable. Owing to a failure in the
rice and manioca crops the food sup
ply, which, was scant enough before
their arrival, was utterly inadequate
to keep them from starvation. The
deaths from smallpox and hunger
numbered over twenty a day. The
dead remained unburied aiid were
either thrown aside into the bush or
cast into the river. Every few hours
a dead body might be seen floating: by.
Great as was the destitution at the
f;ills at the time of Rashid's arrival,
the event was celebrated by a banquet
upon a scale cf royal magnificence.
The material for the feast had been
carried from Zanzibar on the heads
of men for six weary months.
During the progress of the feast a
curious dish was served up. Several
Arabs entered the banquet hall, ac
companied by slaves carrying sacks
v.hich contained round-shaped objects
which looked as if they might be pine
apples. The newcomers prostrated
themselves on their faces in oriental
fashion, and when commanded to rise
they ordered their slaves to present
their offerings; when opening their
sacks a number of human heads rolled
en the floor. This ghastly course did
not help to whet one's appetite. Trie
evident purpose of this bit of panto
mime was to impress all present with
the sure retribution that would befall
the traitor. The heads were those of
revolters in the Nyangua territory.
Rashid showed himself to be a man
of genius, with administrative gifts
like those of hi3 old Uncle Tippu Tib.
The Arabs under his command, like
Arabs generally, were hospitable peo
ple, reflnedj' in manners and scru
pulously clean in their personal habits.
They look cool and comfortable" in
their loose, flowing robes of immacu
late whiteness. How they manage to
k*ep th^m so clean is a marvel. A
true Arab is a strange contradiction.
He nill not stoop to do a mean thing;
his daves do that for him. "
Excrpt in remote districts bordering
on th^ desert Arab slave raiding is a
thing Â«jf the past, but the Arab slave
trading flourishes in Congo "Francaise.
After a war between two tribes the
Arabs are soon upon the scene barter
ing for ihrÂ» captives. I have Been hun
dreds of slaves taken from Bangas&ou,
Itcfai and Iseniio fastened together with
eharkles, bent so us to form an inprc
nibus^DUZzle. It was impossible, for the
captives 1-j tak* them off. The. slaves
vert* chained two and two. ko that the
'outer fe<t were free. Very few of them

and children, the fom:*r when good

their wives and families, who hays

an annual visit to the island. Now.
what a blessing: those fifty Bibles will

THAT the appointments of the Mayor will be sub
ject to many adverse criticisms is to be expected.
No one will like all of them, perhaps even the
Mayor himself does not do that; some people will not
like any of them.- Dislikes~of that kind go without say
ing, lor such is the (nature of man. Taking the commu
nity as a whole, however, the appointments' will be
judged in the light of practical politics, and the Mayor
will have no reason to be dissatisfied .with the tone of
public sentiment with regard to them. _
The desire of the people at this time is for a good
municipal government conducted along lines which will
be sufficiently beneficial and progressive to assure a feel
ing of harmony among a^ll classes of the population.
We have been riding the crest of a high wave of pros
perity, and we cannot reasonably expect to continue in
definitely in that fortunate condition. Already in the
Eastern States there are signs of a comiHg depression
in trade and in industry,, and eventually we shall feel the
effects of' what happens there. It would be a very bad
thing for us if the ebb of the tide of industrial activity,
that is now threatened, should find us menaced by any
political or social disturbance to aggravate the evil. An
era of such genuinely good local government as will
help to assure and continue industrial peace is what is
needed, and fortunately every move of the Mayor's new
administration thus far has confirmed the hopes of good
citizens that such is^the kind of government he is going
to do his best to give us.
Gloomy as are some of the portents in the East, where
stocks are tumbling.- prices falling and wages diminish
ing, there can be no question that California and
San Francisco can safely pass the crisis if only a proper
care be exercised by those who are either officially or
financially the leaders of the people. We are about to
enter upon what is for us an unexampled era of public
improvements. The sums of money to be expended in
that way by the municipality will encourage further en
terprises in the way of improvements by private capital
atjd energy. In addition we have the promise of' good
crops and of a further increase in our Oriental com
merce. Thus we shall have strong forces to assist us in
counteracting whatever movements are now tending to
check our recent prosperous progress.
About all that we need just now is good government
and public harmony, and we have said the Mayor's ap
pointments show a desire on his part to provide them.
Minor criticism upon the wisdom of this or that choice
will not affect the attitude of the communky toward his
administration as a whole. The people wish it well, and
will uphold the Mayor in all his efforts to make it an era
of municipal progress, prosperity and genuine good
feeling.
Murbhxs Secret.
Two bits of wooden slats, to which
was roughly tacked a faded branch
from one of those ornamental ever
greens, formed the Christmas tree.
From a eastaway tomato can the label
had been stripped and slashed
into Irregular pieces/ the bright
red furnishing color. These were
tied to the three with cotton twine,
borrowed or begged from Hugo at the
corner grocery. The can had been
laboriously cut into bits and the shiny
tin stuck on to the meager foliage. - A
couple of pieces of ordinary tallow
candles, also drawn from Hugo, served
as finishing touches of decoration.
A pair of red apples, a scaly orange
and a gaudy bandana handkerchief
loomed amid the>slckly light, symbolic
of "Peace on earth, good will toward
men."
Policeman Murphy peeked through
a crack ; in the window of a Bouthside
basement tenement and what he saw
has been described, except for three
mites of raggedy urchins, who were
gleefully romping about that homely
altar. The tears came to the rugged
patrolman's eyes. Softly he stole
aAvay. Down to Hugo's he went. An
hour later the rosy-cheeked German
was knocking at the tenement door.
A pale faced, thin woman responded.
"I'm sorry." she said, "but Tom's
been sick and out of work this three
months. We'll pay you as soon as we
can. We're honest, you know; only
we are awful hard up just now."
"Pay? I don'd vant p"ay. Here's a
Christmas box for you," replied the
grocer's boy.
Indeed it was a box, for Murphy had
ordered a store of things that had
long been absent from that cupboard.
There was a Christmas indeed that
night in the humble tenement. But
they never knew whence it came. And
for Murphy, why he will go down un
sung, for Murphy isn't his name, and
he has flatly refused to let it be made
public.
looking supplying harems of the
Waddaiâ and. like the Sabine women
whom the Romans took captive, they
tjecom** the mothers of a race superior
to their own.
On the upper Mobangi slaves are
cheap. 1 knew a. Frenchman who had
bought a woman for S2 sous, and was
proud of his bargain. Another had
added to his harem a new wife for
whom hÂ«-tiad given on old muzzle
loading gun. The regular price for a
good slave is from 10 to 100 gingaw.
When bought with beads a few hand
fu!s are givenâ possibly 5 or G francs'
worth. A gun will buy five slaves in
the Banda region, and if they are small
more. When slaves are plentiful a
good article can be bought for 200 gun
caps, and can in turn be traded off for
ivory. Nothing is cheaper in the north
western Congo than human flesh.
In the village of Moinga. a Veadire
chief who had made friends with the
Arabs, I was surprised to run into an
Arab settlement of about 1000 souls.
Some of these Arabs were passable
looking, but most of them were a scaly
lot, and some of them were among the
most villainous looking specimens of
Arab humanity I had ever seen. Had
I known of this cobra's den 1 would
have given It a wide berth.' I was any
thing but comfortable, knowing that
my throat might be cut at any moment
if they only had the courage to do it. I
found a few hundred native women
and children in their camp. They had
been selected with good taste; the boys
and girls were bright and intelligent
looking, and the women young and well
formed. They did not treat them badly,
any more than a man treats an animal
badly that he wishes to keep in good
condition and sell at a large price. They
wore no shackles, but had heavy ank
lets thai impeded their locomotion and
kept them from running away. The
Arabs swarmed around me like bees,
examining my firearms. I indulged in
a little target practice to show them
the use I could make of them. I told
the Sultan that he had better warn
his people not to come to my camp
after nightfall, as it was my habit to
shoot without asking questions. I never
permitted any one near after dark. I
loaded my guns and kept watch while
my men slept the sleep of the just. It
waÂ« a long night, and I was glad when
the moon came up so that I could see
the Eights of my gun. In the morning
I was again besieged by my Arab
friends, but I took good care not to al
low any of them to get behind my
back. I never realized before what a
convenient thing for concealing a knife
these big flowing robes are. After con
siderable parleying I was thankful to
get away with a whole skin, and I did
not feel easy until I had reached- the
village of Madda, where the people hate
the Arabs and had given evidence of
their hatred by massacreing four of
them the night before.
On my way back from the Kotta I
met a caravan of Arabs. They had a
number of native women whom they
had bought at the rate of one tusk
for two young girls of marriageable
age. And as one gun of the old muz
zle loading musket order sold among
the Veadires for three or four tusks
of ivory, this made some six or eight
women for 15 francs, the value of a
gun here, a cheap enough bargain sure
ly! A poorly blooded pup at home
would cost more than an African
maiden.
at Sangaly an Arab wanted
to sell me his greegree. or sacred
charm, which consisted of a portion of
the Koran and a prayer, sown up in
leather and fastened to a belt. It was
too biz to wear around the neck, be
ing about the size of a pocket Bible
I toM him the white men did not be
lieve in charms. He swore by all the
holy orophets that this particular gree
gree had saved his life many a time,
and he stoutly maintained that no rifle
ball could hurt him while he had it on.
I told him to stand back a hundred
paces and let me test it. and if it with
stood my rifle ball I would give him
what he might ask for it. He declined
the test. He, however, agreed to hang
it on a tree and allow me to shoot at
It, for he said that the ball could not
touch it. but would fall harmless to
the ground. After praying to the Allah
he hung it up, and I shot it to pieces
with my bis gun. The Arab was fu
rious, hut the natives yelled in deri
sion. They had often been duped by
the Arabs, who had worked off many
greegrees upon them for their big ivory.
But while I am at it I want to chron
icle my opinion that the effects of slave
raiding, terrible as they are, have often
been greatly exaggerated. If any one
was to pass over a district recently vis
ited by the slave raiders, as I have
often done, he would exclaim: "How
great the havoc; how cornplete the des
olation!" But things are not quite so
bad as they seem. On the first alarm
they, in all probability, hid their ivory
and fled into the bush, where you could
find them just as easily as you could
find the proverbial needle in the hay
stack. Some, of course, were captured
in the act of flight, but the majority
got away. Looking at their desolate
and smoldering villages, you might
conclude that they had been wiped out
of existence. The fact that not a single
native was in sight might confirm this
impression, but your conclusion would
be utterly false. They had merely scat
tered., to recombine and come back
again to their old haunts when things
settled down or to move to a new place.
The expedition of Commandant SIo
rain. raided and burned two villages
of 10.000 people, and, although some of
the villages were taken by surprise, not
more than eight or ten natives were
killed, and when I returned up the
I river some months after all the villages
were rebuilt on the same sites.
Slavery as It exists among the na-.
tlves themselves will be a hard thing
to stamp out- It is part and parcel of
tbe social order. One thing which ren
ders the slave problem perplexing is
the difficulty, if not the impossibility,
of an escaped slave returning to his
tribe. Every native has peculiar tribal
marks: he is also in possession of the
legends of his people, so. that if he at
tempts to pass through strange tribes
he is H^sely examined, and if he can
not stand the tests- applied to him he
is retained, as a slave, and. more than
likely he is fatted for a feast at the
next full moon.' A" distinction muet.be
made between -slavery as -'it exists
among the natives Â¦ themselves and
slavery under the Arabs. 1
country are even now seeking for employment without
being able to find it.
Some of the statistics that have been brought out to
show the effect of free tradeupon" British industries are
very striking. For example, the silk manufacturing in
dustry of the kingdom was protected down to i860 by
a duty of 15 per cent, but in that year the duty yas re
pealed. Statistics of the Board of Trade show that in
1857, when the industry was protected, Great Britain im
ported 12,000,000 pounds of raw silk and exported manu
factured silk to the value of Â£2,119.000. After forty
five years of fret trado the industry has been so far de
pressed that the importation of raw. silk amounted in
1902 to less than 1,300,000 pounds and the exports of
manufactured silk were virtually nothing.
Such has been the effect of free trade on'.tha* industry.
Many other examples of the kind are being cited and the
cry is going up "England expects every foreigner to pay

THE SAN FRANCISCO C^Lt, SUNDAY. JANUARY 10, 1904.
The brutal and. unpunished outrage perpetrated by a
negro soldier upon a defenseless woman a few days ago,
while riding.on a street car, has suggested to the au
thorities the- necessity of more police officers in the
neighborhood of the Presidio. It might be wise also to
suggest to the street .car companies the "advisability of
securing conductors courageouY enough and able to pro
tect their patrons from insult and assault.
C: TREES â Old Subscri
ber. The custom of the use of. trees at
Christmas time springs from a period
far anterior to the revelation of Chris
tianity and seems proximately to be
derived from the custom prevalent dur
ing the Saturnalia of tbe inhabitants
of Rome in decorating their temples and
dwellings with green bough's. In Ger
many, away back in' early history, ami
in Holland, it was customary for some
one to appear as Santa Claus or Kris
Kringle about Christmas time and re
ward the good children of the household
with gilt nuts, sweetmeats and other
presents, and if the child for whom a
present wa3 intended, did not respond
the -"?'was hung on the branch ot a
decorated tree. From this sprang thÂ»
modern custom of placing presents^oa
the Christmas tree.

Special Dispatch to The Call
STOCKTON, Jan. 9.â As guardian ad
litum for her two minor children, Iva
A. and Harvey M. Odell, Mary B. Per
cival to-day *began a suit for $50,000
against the estate of William S. Moss,
incompetent.
The suit Is an echo of the killing of
Dr. Odell, then her husband by her
brother, the present defendant, nearly
sixteen years ago. , After returning
from a hunting trip the two got into an
altercation and Moss shot his brother
in-law to death. He was acquitted on
the ground of self-defense and subse
quently deeded to his sister, r farm
worth about $20,000 In consideration, It
is said, of the Ios3 she. had sustained
through her husband's death. Later
Moss became incompetent and his
guardian sued for the return of the
property, alleging lack of consideration,
and the Supreme Court finally restored
the property to the estate of the In
competent.
Mrs. Percival now sues for $50,000 In
behalf of her children. The Moss fam
ily owns much land and Mrs. Percival
is rated as wealthy.

Minister Deprecates Carrying Arms.
Italy's Prime Minister, Slgnor Gjo
litti, has recently had a protest ad
dressed .to him against the practice
of the police and constabulary of car
rying revolvers stropped to their belts
outside their tunics, it being urged
that the sight, of these revolvers was
sufficient to provoke attacks. To this
the Premier replied that no one ever
drew the teeth of a watchdog, and
that as far as keeping the revolvers
out of sight one might just as well
ask soldiers to hide their rifles from
view. So Italian policemen will con
tinue to go s armed as heretofore,

Count Schouvaloff's Error.
A story is told of Count Shouvaloff, a
former Russian Embassador to Eng
land. He greatly admired English wo
men and was heartily annoyed when
he offended any one of them. While. In
London he learned English, and hav
ing heard one famous -English- beauty
say "Shut up!" to arfother. he imagined
it to be a phrase of polite agreement,
such as, "Say no more." In this sense
he himself addressed it to an illustrious
lady the next night at dinner, to the
lady's consternation, and his own.
when later he discovered his mistake.
l^csc-Majcstc Abroad.
Many people think that "lese
majeste" is confined to Germany, but
this is not the case.* It is a high
crime in the first-class clubs in New
York for a servant to awaken a sleep
ing member on whatever pretext. If
has come to be understood by men
who have lots of money that no busi
ness is> more important than sleep
when one falls into it by natural pro
cesses. It has been observed that the
shock of suddenly awakening a sleeper
and compelling him to concentrate
his mind on business usually operates
to cause extreme j restlessness and
sometimes prevents the victim from
sleeping a^ain until he is exhausted.
Hence the rule. â Correspondence
Ptttsburg Dispatch.
NEW YORK. Jan. 9. â Prices made
small additional advances in to-day's
stock market on a fair volume of
business. Damage to the private wire
service and Interruption of the outW.
Bide quotation aervice by the tickers
had little effect on the volume of busi
ness done in stocks, indicating the
largely professional character of the
trading and the large proportion of
business originating on the floor of
the Stock Exchange itself. The main
influence on the advance in prices was
the more cheerful tone of foreign
markets and a feeling of restrained
hopefulness over a possibly peaceful
outcome to, the Far Eastern negotia
tions. The bank statement also met
expectation in cash items, which
showed an Increase of over $10,000,
000. The continued expansion of the
loan itemJto the extent of $7,421,000
was not received with as much satis
faction and induced some conjecture
as to the source of the borrowing. It
was suggested by some banking au
thorities that the low rate to which
interest in New York has declined has
induced pome reduction of trust com
pany and out of town banking loans
wiiich had to be taken up by the
Clearing House banks. London dis
counts continue to advance, but the
weekly statement of the Imperial
Bank of Germany made a strong show
ing and sterling exchange at that
center advanced. Amalgamated Cop
per continued strong to-day and the
Pacifies, grangers, coalers, trunk lines
and prominent industrials made quite
uniform advan'ces. The closing was
steady, but slightly below the best.
PRICES ARE SLUGGISH.
The opening week of the new year in
the stock market had proved somewhat
disappointing to those who bought
stocks in the last weeks of December
in the hope of an awakened demand for
securities with the turn of the year and
the resultant easing of the money mar
ket. Attempts to take profits by these
previous buyers have proved an . over
weight on the market, and some sharp
declines have resulted. The latter por
tion of the week has seen som'e diminu
tion in selling pressure and sluggish re
coveries. The acute stage reached in
the Far Eastern war situation and the
passing of the United States Steel divi
dend on the common stock and the poor
showing of earnings made by the cor
poration for the December quarter
have been important contributory
causes to the last demand for stocks
and to the disappointment of specu
lators long of stocks to lessen their
holdings. The action of the United
States Steel directors in discontinuing
the dividend on the common stock had
been accurately foreseen in circulars,
but the great decrease in net earnings
for the quarter proved a trying thing
for stockholders, verifying as it did
about the worst intimations circulated
by the bears before the publication.
Current trade reports were not calcu
lated to remove entirely the feeling of
discouragement over the situation, as
they pointed to a continued waiting at
titude on the part of the consumers
and a confidence that they would bp
able to fill their requirements, as they
hoped, on satisfactory terms.
RAILROADS DISCONTENTED.
It is believed that railroads are still
dissatisfied with the price of steel rails
and reports were current that conces
sions were being mad. from 'the offi
cial price. The preferred stock of the
corporation, however, made some re
sistance to pressure on buying attrib
uted to supporting orders by the bank
ing interests associated with the cor
poration. Speculators gave some at
tention to the argument that the de
pression In the price of the stock was
sufficient to discount the unfavorable
conditions in the trade and that better
results were to be expected from eco
nomics by wage reductions. Reports of
discontent on the part of some of the
employes and threats of strikes against
reduced wages partly offset this argu
ment. There were signs also that the
fears of the effect of the hostilities be
tween Japan and Russia had reached a
climax. The influence of t'.iese fears
was conspicuous in all the speculative
markets during the week, both here
and abroad, and the New York stock
market had to absorb large offerings
of American securities for foreign ac
count.
WAR TALK AFFECTS WHEAT.
The action of prices made clear that
war is expected to benefit the market
for our food products, wheat rising
sharply on all war reports, while cotton
ran off as sharply on the belief that
war fti the Far East would affect the
Chinese demand for cotton cloth. From
the financial standpoint there is little
apprehension of any direct effects upon
our markets. Holdings of Russian se
curities In this country are limited in
amount, It is believed, to about $15,000,
000, principally by some of the insur
ance companies for the purpose of com
plying with the Russian laws for doing
business in that country, French hold
ings of Russian Government and indus
trial securities, however, are known to
be very large. There was the proba
bility of the entry upon a war by Rus
sia would develop money requirements
in Paris. . w
As French capital is very heavily
committed to the London financial pa
per markeU large withdrawals of
French capital from London might be
apprehended, which would presum
ably spread to other money markets.
Our money market has relaxed to; a
condition of very pronounced ease,
without resulting in. Investment" de
mand for securities which was hoped
for.

Special Dispatch to The Call
ST. LOUIS, J.n. 9.â The/ story was
made public here to-day that the notor
ious House of Delegates combine laid
a careful plot for the removal of Joseph
W. Folk, circuit attorney, at the time
when his investigation of municipal^af
fairs led them to believe all were In
danger. According to the story the
combine passed a resolution to the ef
fect that Folk ought to be got out
of the way and proceeded to draw lots
to determine who should carry out the
task. The member who drew the paper
slip bearing Folk's name" was not to
make known the fact, so that he could
better protect himself.
Harry A. Faulkner, one of the com
bine, was not present at' the drawing,
but heard immediately what had been
done and discovered "*â¢â¢Â» name of the
man who drew the fatal. lot. He pro
tested against the proposed crime, but
was laughed at. * Then he turned his
entire attention to following the man
who was charged with putting Folk out
of the way. He kept tip his self-im
posed task until, with threats and ca
jolery and by sheer persistence, he
brought about the abandonment of the
project.
The story became known through the
refusal of Folk to agree to give. another
continuance in the case of Faulkner,
who is sodn to be tried on charges
growing out of the transactions of the
combine.
Former Lieutenant Governor Charles
P. Johnson told Folk what Faulkner
had done, but this did not change the
determination of the circuit attorney
to bring the accused man to an early
trial. Folk said that, of course, he was
grateful to Faulkner, but that he could
not be influenced in his duty as public
servant.
Harry Faulkner was one of the rnem-
Ders indicted for perjury in connection
with the suburban bribery deal. On
his first indictment he was tried, con
victed and sentenced to two years in
the penitentiary. Subsequently the
Supreme Court reversed the decision
and remanded his case for trial again.
At the second trial the Jury disagreed.
Folk tried him a third time and he was
convicted of perjury on October 5, 1903,
and sentenced to three yehrs in the
penitentiary. .
It was in looking for a continuance
for this last trial that Governor John
son disclosed tKe story.

Interesting Gathering of Mem
bers of Artillery Corps Mili
tary Society Held in New York
?
NEW YORK, Jan. 9.â Military pomp
has attended the annual dinner of* the
Veteran Corps of Artillery, Veterans'
Military Society of 1812. Incidentally
the ereat victory of Jackson at New
Orleans, eighty-nine years ago, was
duly commemorated.
The toasts, of which there werevsix,
were all inherited from previous ban
quets of the corps. General James
Grant Wilson, who * responded to the
tc/ast "George Washington," which has
been handed down from the dinner of
the corns held on July 4, 1814, told of
a visit to the estate in England of the
Duke of Wellington.
"When I was |mvn in the stately
drawing-room," said the general. "1 no
ticed with some 'surprise that a por
trait of Washington occupied the place
of honor. When I asked the then Duke
how it happened to be 'there, he told
me that the first Duke had placed it
there because he thought Washington
the noblest and purest man of the time.
"I was told, too, by the Duke that
Wellington, when offered the command
of an expedition against, the United
States in the war of 1812, declined it
on the ground that he could not fight
against Washington's countrymen."
Of the 734 original members of the
corps only one is now living â Hiram
Cronk of Sacketts Habor. He is 104
years old.

a painter residing at 909 Folsom
*treet, was probably fatally burned at
her home about 7 o'clock last night.
From accounts furnished by neigh
bors it appears that the couple were
drinking considerably during the .af
ternoon.>\Just before the tragedy the
husband; left the house. While he
away hia wife attempted to start a
fire. In some manner her clothing be
came ignited and soon she was envel
oped in flames.
John Wymanra next door neighbor,
heard the woman's terrified screams,
and rushing into the house, tore off
what few clothes remained on the
unfortunate woman. A '"-still alarm
was sent to Engine Company 6 and the
incipient blaze in the house was soon
extinguished.
Wyman telephoned for the emer
gency ambulance and Mrs. Tuttle was
taken to the hospital. Dr. Millar,
who attended her. found that she had
been badly burned over her entire
body and gave it as his opinion that
the unfortunate victim could live but
a few hours. , ,

No large sales of local realty have
been completed during the week just
closed. The feature of the week has
been the number of building contracts

ing for the expenditure of something
more than $160,000. Among the new
projects in view is the erection by
Christopher A. Buckley of\a six-story
building to cover 45:10x137:6 feet on
the southeast corner of Market and

be something like $170,000. Bernard
The City Realty Company has au
thorized Baldwin & Howell to sell
fifty-eight . lots on Parnassus heights
at auction on January 21. The lots
are situated in the blocks between
Fourth and Fifth avenues and Hugo,
H and I streets, and the, terms are so
attractive that not only v homeseekers
but builders, speculators and invest
ors should be interested in the sale,
as the first cash payment calls for
only 10 per cent of the purchase price
a.nd the balance is to be in equal semi
annual payments extending over a pe
riod of five years. The auction will
be held at the salesroom of Baldwin &
Howell, 25 Post street, on Thursday,
the 21st inst., at 12 o'clock noon.

Schmitz in relation to obtaining the
necessary assistance from the city
for the opening of H street to the
ocean, more street lights and a fire
engine-house and police patrol and
the improvement of the Ocean boule
vard. The Mayor agreed that the
growing Oceanside district was enti
tled to these concessions, as^ he per
sonally went driving in that district
and was convinced of the necessity of
all such requirements. The commit
tee on streets reported a petition
should be sent to Assessor Dodge ask
ing him to place an assessment of

On Thursday of the present week
will be auctioned the block of land
which faces Golden Gate Park and the
Fell-street boulevard, the only block
on the sunny side of "the Park Pan
handle that can be subdivided, as all
the other 'blocks on the north side of
the Panhandle are. subdivided and
built upon. This block is bounded by
Fell. Clayton. Cole and Hayes streets.
It will be sold in thirty-efyht subdivis
ions by Henry, Stern of Da"Vid Stern &
Sons at his salesroom, 11 Montgomery
street, on Thursday at noon. Mr.
Stern' says, comparing: this property
with all properties in San Francisco,
that during the dull period of the real
estate market in this city a few years
ago this was the only one that en
hanced in value. From present indi
cations the demand for this choice
property is greater than the supply.
Those that secure a^lot in the block
are doubly certain ' fk securing an ele
ganfvhome site as^yell as a choice
holding that is bound to improve ow
ing to its facing the grand drive of the
Panhandle to Golden Gate Park. In
all large cities, as New York and Chi
cago, history repeats itself, and all
property facing the parks has been
very much in demand. Fabulous
prices have been paid for some of
these locations.

RICH MEN ARE
NOT AliL HAPPY
Croesus, King of Ljrdla, Had Troubles
of His Own, and There Are Others.
Croesus, the John D. Rockefeller of
the kingdom of Lydia, was very -well-
to-do In worldly goods and chattels.
"As rich as Croesus" is a saying about
2500 years old. .He had his troubles,
however, and some of them were full
grown. He was taken captive once by
Cyrus and only saved himself from be- â¢
ing burned alive by quoting: a saying'
of Solon the Sage. He finally had to
flee his kingdom for parts unknown.
Many of the rich; man's troubles to-
day come from high living and could
be. avoided. They are brought on by
eating all kinds of rich, heavy foods at
irregular times, lack of proper' exer-
cise, undue mental strain, unnatural
stimulants, etc., and are commonly
known as indigestion, dyspepsia and
weak stomach. They are serious
troubles all right, but' not only can
they be avoided but can also be cured,
and that without loss of time or
proper food and nourishment.
Stuart's Dyspepsia- Tablets are the
certain relief of dyspeptics, rich and
poor alike. There is no such thing as
slopping their onward progress now.
A great nation has placed it3 stamp
of approval upon their, noble work.
The thousands and thousands of cures
they have effected and the happiness
resulting therefrom have made their
name a household word throughout
the land.
The story of j Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets can be told in a word. They
actually do the. work that the weak
and wasted stomach"- is unable to. do
and allow it t| recuperate and regain
its strength. . They contain all the es-
sential properties that V the gastric
juice, and other digestive fluids do,
arid ''they digest the food, just as a
sound and well stomach would. They
relieve thelstomach: just a3 one Vested
and refreshed; workman relieves
one on /duty that is tired" and 'Worn,
and Nature does* her own work of
restoration. â¢ .- It ;*, is ; a . simple, Â¦ natural
process that a child can understand.'
You can eat all you. want .without fear
of results. ; Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
"are* for," sale by all -druggists at , ; 60
cents a ibox., ; Druggists "all^ know bet-
tei-A than" to V try ! : to " get along"^ without"
them, as the. demand for them. is great

Reno, Nev., has the distinction of be
ing the only city in that State which
can, under present laws, maintain a
public library by taxation. Cities with
less than 5000 population cannot thus
establish libraries. The work on the
new Carnegie building is progressing
rapidly. One thousand volumes,
ordered for the beginning of the libra
ry, are expected to be ready for use
when the building is finished, about
March 1st.
A notable bequest of $200,000 has re
cently been made to Webster City,
Iowa, a place- of 5000 population. By
the will of Kendall Young, the sum of
$25,000"is to be devoted to the erection
of a fireproof library building. The
remainder of $175,000 is to be invested
for a perpetual endowment of the li
brary. This is the largest legacy left
in late years to any city in Iowa.
Lesal Light for Laymen.
In Cicero's "Treatise on the Laws"
Marcus is asked by, Atticushis opinion
respecting the nature of law, and part
of the answer is as follows: "We have
had many great men in Rome, who
have made It their profession to â¢ex
pound it to the people, -and explain its
doctrines and practice. But though
they professed to be acquainted with
its majestic theory, they were rather fa
miliar with its minute technicalities.
What can be grander or nobler than
jurisprudence? or what can be more in
significant or quibbling than the prac
tice of lawyers?â necessary as It is for
the people. Not that I think that those
who adopt this profession are alto
gether ignorant of the principles of uni
versal legislaion; but they are far more
attentive to civil law, which gives them
a hold on the interest of people.- Are
then the sublime â¢ and recondite princi
ples of jurisprudence less necessary or
less useful? 'Certainly^ not. â¢ * *

the first ones to be occupied for such
purposes in any new library building in

The Carnegie library building- in
Redding, for which $10,000 was given,
has been completed and the keys turned

Capitola street car line gave a day's
receipts to the furnishing fund of ths

LARGE ATTENDANCE.
Work of Sending: Out Collec

quarters Now in Progress
The force of men engaged in putting
the last finishing touches to ' the
sheathed protected cruiser Tacoma has
been gradually reduced to a few who
are laying oil cloths and putting in
place the furniture of the officers' and
men's quarters. Commander B. F.
Nicholson, who has been detached from
the bureau of navigation of the Navy
Department, Washington, is now on
the way, and in a few days the Taco
ma will be put into commission and re
ceive active orders.
Where the Tacoma will be ordered is
as yet a secret. It was at first intended
to send her to Panama, but the neces
sity of additional naval reinforcements
at that point is not obvious, and it Is
more than likely that she will be dis
patched to Japan if war should be de
clared in that part of the world. The Ta
eoma is the only one of all cruisers built
after her type that fully equaled speed
requirements on her first trial. The ur
gent request of the municipal authori
ties of the Washington city after which
the Tacoma is named that the new
cruiser might make a visit .had to'be
declined on acount of the exigencies of
the service. On returning to the coast
the Tacoma will take. in Puget Sound.
Progress on the superstructure of the
big battleship Ohio is necessarily slow.
Her completion is a matter of a year
at least. The turrets are nearly com
plete and now the -workmen are en
gaged in pkicing pponsons and in fur
nishing exterior details. The. great six
inch riries which constitute her second
ary armament are on the deck and
roady for placing aboard. - - .
The protected cruisers California and
North Dakota are making rapid pro

able. The California will not be ready
for launching before June next.

CRUISER WILL
GO TO ORIENT
Dietrich Meyer is the village black
smith who stands beneath the spreadr
Ing chestnut tree out Twin Peaks way.*
He took some of the fallen chestnuts
before Judge Mogan yesterday. He
was arrested on a charge of having,
lottery tickets in his possession and
the arresting officers had the goods to
show. Meyer admitted that the tick
ets were in his possession, but he could
not account for the fact. .He said he
was making a tour of Chinatown and.
some evil-minded Oriental must have
slipped them in his pocket.
The Judge made a sudden dive
through a little black book he keeps for
When the three sailor men have tes
tified to the happenings of Turner's
carving operations they will be set at
liberty, and they may learn a lesson
that if the right eye offend to cut it out.
Also to cut out the left eye â in fact, to
cut out everything that is liable to in
volve one in trouble, and not to know
very much about anything.
Judge Mogan will hold court in the
McNutt Hospital on Monday. This un
usual procedure is actuated by the fact
that three men are being held in cus
tody in the City Prison without just
cause. Somewhere in the dim and dis
tant past, which, measured in the epochs
of the Police Courts means about three
weeks ago, Thomas Tamer took a knife
and slashed B. Hansen somewhere be
tween the left shoulder blade and the
watch pocket. For days the wounded
man played tag with death, but he beat
the grim reaper out. Now he is going
to recover. Three sailor men witnessed
the assault unwittingly and have been
in jail ever since so that the facts they
could testify to might not be merged in
tales of the forecastle . on a whaling
voyage or' buried deeply in the shim
mering waves of the' South Seas.
Ralph E. Reinoehle, who was. once
a special policeman at the Orpheum,
was before Judge Mogan yesterday on
a charee of passing fictitious checks.
He is said to have fallen into the habit
of signing the name of Charles Wesley
Reed, ex- Supervisor and orator, to cer
tain forms on white paper that called
for money at the paying teller's win
dow of the Columbian Banking Com
pany.
Reinoehle was arraigned before Judge
Mogan on a charge of forgery yester
day and his case was continued until
January 16. In the meantime the de
fendant is resting in the City Prison
under bonds of $2000.
James Kelley is a negro with a Celtic
name, and he claims to have been born
in Ireland. He was arrested for beg
ging and came before Judge Mogan yes
terday for hearing. He told' the court
that it was no crime* to ask' for alms
in Ireland, and when he emigrated to
the United States he thought that he
might enjoy the same privileges that
were accorded him in his native land.
"You hardly look like an Irishman to
me," said the Judge. "I never saw any
Irishmen begging for a living, anyway.
Suppose you take twenty- four hours in
jail, and when you' get out make a hot
foot for that Stockton boat you say
employs you. If you appear here again
there will be something doing."
Victoria Ferslow, the woman who
thought that broiling on a hot stove
was the pr6per corrective measure for
the delinquencies which a two-year
and-a-half-old child might commit, ap
peared before Judge Cabaniss 'yester
day. She was not prepared to present
her defense, although the prosecutiol!
waa ready with the baby and a num
ber of witnesses to prove the utter de
pravity of her cruelty to the little one.
At the woman's request the case was
continued until to-morrow.
William Whitney, who is known in
pugilistic circles as "Kid White, the
Honest Fighter," ' was convicted of
petty larceny in Judge Cabaniss' court
yesterday. The original charge was
burglary. He entered a room at 904
Kearny street and stole a quantity of
clothing from the occupant. He was
allowed to rlead guilty to the minor
charge and was sentenced to four
months in the County JaiJ.
Minnie Harvey wears gl-la-ases and
looks like a Boston schoolteacher, al
though she is rather better looking
than the ordinary run of Eastern fe
male educators. She was arrested for
vagrancy and her appearance prompted
Judge Mogan to call her case among
the first. She told him that the Ar
rest was an outrage. In the midst of
the oration she was delivering to the
Judge a policeman, with a chest on him
like a Saratoga trunk, came forward and
passed up the, record of Miss Harvey
to the Judge. It showed that she had
been convicted eight times on charges
of vagrancy and only a few weeks ago
was discharged from the County Jail.
Miss Harvey was told to go "way back
and sit down," and further instructions
will be eiven hÂ«r Monday.
Temple killed himself Friday after
noon by casting himself before an in
coming San Jose train. He was ground
to pieces.
There were three charges in Judge
Mogan's court against Temple. He was
accused of battery on Miss May Cadoza
and on Miss Marjorie McLiennan, and
an additional charge of disturbing the
peace was lodged against him. He en
tered the telephone exchange of the
Starr King building and attempted to
kiss the two young women. When male
assistance came to the rescue lie fought
hard to resist being taken into cus
tody. At his first arraignment his bail
was fixed at $200, and he secured his
liberty by furnishing the necessary
bonds. Rather than face a trial he
killed himself.
The charges, against the dead man
were dismissed by Judge Moga'n and
Temple's record on this earth was
made judicially clean.
All proceedings in mundane courts
that were registered against Louis
Temple were dismissed yesterday. The
unfortunate man had taken an appeal
to a tribunal higher and more just
than earthly courts can be. It is to be
hoped that the last great arbitriment
may be merciful.
reference and then looked up with
bland, blue eyes, like a boy coming
from a* bath. "I flnd," he said, "that
you h'ave been arrested a number of
times for this same offense, and once
for frequently a lottery place. Truth

though in some cases not before the
time limit has expired. In this case she
merely dropped to her knees. Â¦ If" you
had not lied I would have dismissed
you, but now I find you guilty and I
will pronounce sentence Monday."

Announcement of the date is made
early so that no o^her functions will
be set for the evening of the bal
masque. It is also considered that
time should be given for the making
of costumes. The fancy of society
leaders mav turn to something strik
ingly original in the art of costuming.
The design for the invitation should
have the merit of originality a^nd at
tractiveness, as Mrs. Albertlne Randall
Wheelan, whose reputation for illus
tration extends across the continent, is
to have charge of this line of work.
Artists John M. Gamble and Harry

The- directors of the San Francisco
Art Association have decided to hold
the Mardi Gras ball as usual this year
and special efforts will be made to ren
der the function agreeable to the art
ists, the members of the association
and to other representatives of society.
The event will take place Tuesday
evening, February 16. At a recent con
ference of the directors, plans for dec
orating the house and, designs for the
Invitation were topics of discussion.
The board decided to adopt a liberal
J policy in regard to the expenses of the
i function.
Under a decision rendered by Judge
Slosa yesterday C. F. Serra, Consul
General for Italy in this city, and not
the Public Administrator, is entitled
to letters of administration upon the
estate of Giosue Gazzara, a citizen of
Italy who. died here. In accordance
with his decision Judge Sloss issued an
order revoking the letters of admin
istration upon the estate of Gazzara
previously issued to Public Adminis
trator John Karnham.
The decision is one of unusual in
terest in that it determines the value
of the laws of a State and thpse agree
ments, made in treaties between this
country and other nations. Judge
Sloss based his decision on the fact
that in a" recognized opinion by n
Judge of the Surrogate Court of New
York it was decided that a Consul
was entitled to administer upon an es
tate of a citizen of his country under
the â¢ "most favored nation" clause.
In' this particular case this clause and
article D of- the treaty between this
country and the Argentine Republic,
which provides for the "intervention"
of a Consul in the matter of an estate
of a foreigner, were cited by Consul
Serra. Sloss sustained both points.
Judge Sloss, following the decision
of the New York Justice, decided also
j that International law gave the Con
' sul risrht to' letters of administration

PHYSICIAN NAMED' BT MAYOR SCHMITZ AS ONE OF THE NEW MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.
AND SOME OF THOSE WHOHAVE BEEN APPOINTED TCTDESIRABLE POSITIONS. IN THE VARIOUS
BRANCHES OF THE DEPARTMENT. ' -. . '
. Isador Golden, who was appointed
by Governor Pardee to the office of
Justice of the Peace of this" city made
vacant by the election of Percy V.
Long to the office of City Attorney, is
at least entitled to possession of Long's
courtroom, according to a decision ren
dered by Judge Muraaky yesterday.
The court dissolved the injunction re
straining Golden from interfering with
Walter E. Dorn, who was app6inte<l
Justice of the Peace by the Board of
Supervisors, in his possession of the of
fice. Judge Murasky. who issued the
injunction upon application of. Dorn,
dissolved it. on the ground that Dorn
failed to prove his claim that he was
in possession of the office at the time
the complaint was filed.
The decision is a direct slap at the
methods pursued by Dorn and his at
torney, former Assistant City At
torney Sims. Dorn . was not ap
pointed until forty-eight hours
after Golden had received his
commission from the Governor and
had Â¦ served a dav as Justice of the
Peace. After Golden had been in un
disputed possession for a day and de
parted. Dorn and his attorney secured
a key to the place, rushed Into it and
out acain to the chambers of Judge
Murasky and secured, by/Vepresenting
that they had possession of the prem
ises, an injunction restraining Golden
from interfering with them. The next
morning they took the place by force
from Golden and when he objected
they coolly presented him with the
order of court directing him to keep
his hands off. ,
Murasky'a decision, though it doe3
not decide the merits of the Mayor's,
the Board of Supervisors' or the Gov
ernor's claims to the right to make the
appointment, effectually 'disposes of
Dora's Immediate interest In the posi
tion. The opinion handed down with
the decision is as follows: '
, "I am convinced from the established
facts of the: case that when plaintiff's
complaint was filed he was not in. pos
session'of"' the . office of Justice of the
p"eace; that 'defendant.. Golden, was
then the de facto officer; that there can
be only onede facto^offlcer; that pos
session of the office under color of au
thority is necessary to sustain a claim
for the relief herein invoked, 1 and that
therefore -the -motion -to dissolve shcruld
beffrantea. It 4s so ordered."

PLACES 4N' BOARD'S
OFFICE ABOLISHED
AND CREATED ANEW
The new Board of Health yesterday j
effected a radical reorganization of j
the various departments under its im
mediate supervision by removing from |
'their positions more than fifty em- i
ployes. To accomplish its declared j
policy of retrenchment the board
abolished certain positions pronounced
unnecessary by Mayor Schmitz in his !
'Veto message of thÂ»* last municipal j
â¢"budget. A number of new positions \
â¢were created and appointments there- j
to made, while other pieces were de- j
dared vacant and the successors to I
(those thus ousted were immediately j
appointed.
The upheavals among: the employes !
.affected even' department under the
board's control, including the general j
office. City and County Hospital, j
Aimshouse and Emergency Hospitals j
and the appointments confirmed In J
ever>* instance the advance informa- i
Tien given in The Call, including: Dr. j
D. F. Rapan, Health Officer: Dr. G.

peon; Dr. T. A. Rottanzl. City Physi- J
cian; Frank A. Schmitz. Superinten
dent of the Almshouse; Mrs. Frank A.
Srhmitz. matron of the Almshouse. |
and John N. Elbert, warden of the City I
and County Hospital.
There were present at the meeting
Dr. James W. Ward, the senior mem- j
ber, who called the meeting to-or
*der; Dr. J. C. Stinson, Dr. TV. A.
Harvey. Dr. John V. Hughes and Dr.
Joseph F. Poheim, the last three :
named beinc new members, who pre
sented their commissions sitned by
Mayor Schmitz and took their seats.
The first official act of the board
was to receive as a member President
Herbert Schmitz of the Board of
Â¦Works, who te ex-officio a member of
the Board of Health, to succeed Com
missioner Casey.
Mayer Schmitz had previously an
nounced the appointment of Dr. Jo
seph Francis Poheim as a member of
the Board of Health to succeed Dr. W. j
T>* Letrltt, who resigned. The latter's
resignation was brief and as fol
lows:
/'Hon. Z. E. Schmitz â Sir: I hereby:
tender my resignation as a member of j
.the Board of Health of the city and j
county of San Francisco and request
that th* same be accepted. Yours re
spectfully. "W. B. LEWITT, M. D.
â¢January 8, 1904."
The Health Board then effected or
ganization by electing Dr. James W.
XX*ard . president by acclamation for i
: ihe ensuing year. Dr. Ward paid a {
'tribute to Mayor Schmitz. who. he
/said. -had been defined worthy of the
confidence of the people.
"The reorganization of the Health
TVpartment has been effected on the
']Wes of efficiency and economy," said
' W^rd^ "There are change* in the
main office alone that will effect a
f-avir.s of $3900 y.early.

Which Are Declared Vacant and New Places Are *
Created, to Which Appointments Are Made.
Board of Education Installs Two Newly Appointed
Members, Thomas F. Boyle and Lawrence F.
Â¦Walch, Who Were Named by Mayor Schmitz.
THE new Board of Health began its term of office yesterday by inaugurating an upheaval in the various .depart a small army of employes, who were summarily
removed from their positions. The board abolished "numerous positions, created many new ones and rewarded men who had taken an active interest in Mayor Schmitz's recent campaign by appointing them to the positions
thus created. The fact that a number of the positions abolished were under civil service did not deter the board in. its policy of effecting a complete reorganization oHts various branches, an d thereby effecting a saving of ap
proximatelv $io.ooo yearly in salaries. 'â¢ , . 'Â¦ . % ; â¢ - - . - >^

SAN FRANCISCO CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
Namtor, with Otto Wonderly .up,
landed the mile and a quarter selling
affair by a narrow margin from Ni
grette. Frank Reagan's horse was so
well thought of that even money, was
the first quotation. Later, when a play
on Nigrette developed, 7 to 5 could be
obtained. Kunz astride Nigrette set a
slow pace for the first mile, never,lead
ing the favorite more than half a
length. This brought it down to a quar
tt;r-mlle sprint, and Wonderly had the
better of the argument with the lighter
boy, earning the decision by a neck In
2:07. Larson took the show with Rosa

"With the approach of old age Moco
rito seems to sharpen and improve. In
the concluding mile and fifty yard se
lection, after Hipponax, the 'favorite,
had raced Kitty Kelly into subjection.
See on Mocorlto made a "bid for it. The
first choice appeared all in, and the an
cient mare scampered home first, by
four lengths. Prestolus ran third, â¢ be
hind the favorite.

After quite a rest Bay Wonder, from,
the stable of H. F. Newman, made his
reappearance In the slx-furlong selling
fixture, next decided. The fast gelding
was played down from 6 to 5 to 4 to 5,
and won all the way. Louis Wagner
disposed of Harry Thatcher, a 20 to 1
shpt, for the place. Emshee, a stoutly
supported one, ran disappointingly.
Rollick, -cut off at the start, never
loomed ud as a dangerous factor.
XAMTOR BEATS N1GRETTE.
Johnny Millin started his recent pur
chase L.aura F M in the second, and
the mare was installed a 7 tp 10 favor
ite. She showed some early speed, but
quit badly, finishing third. Yellowstone,
a 10 to 1 shot, with Jack Martin up,
was fn front all the way, crossing the
line the easiest kind of a winner over
Waterpower. Hoar succeeded In getting
almost left v.-ith Meehanus.
Lady Kent closed a slight favorite
over Ethel Abbott for the first event, a
slx-furlong sprint. The mare looked a
winner turning; into the stretch, when
Hildebrand on Ethel Abbott skimmed
through on the rail, beating the favor
ite with ridiculous ease. Lee Jackson
on the lfiylo 1 shot Rinaldo took the
show.
Favorites fared badly in nearly all of
the races run. Bay Wonder and Nam

spite this the major portion of the
bookmakers claimed to have quit to the
bad financially.

nerve-rackingr finish was first by a
head on the inside. Fossil beat Jockey
Club a like distance for the place. .The
time demonstrates that loafers had no
businees in the game, for the first
three-quarters was covered in 1:13%,
the seven furlongs in 1:26.
A good horse won beyond question,

horse does not stand on plates in this
country than Fossil. It must not be
overlooked that Dainty ran an excel

might have added another head to the

was fancied 'by a' large following at
3Vi to 1. Golden Rule held steady
at 4 to 1 and Haviland at 5. Golden
Rule set a hot pace for almost sbc fur

fourth.
The hurdle handicap at a mile and
a Quarter was marred by a mishap

r a DEMON OF DISCOMFORT
Â¦ t When to the other discomforts of winter is added the torments of Eczema, existence
becomes a long-drawn-out period of bodily suffering and untold misery. Of all the varied
types and forms of this violent and terrifying skin disease, that which comes in the winter
season is the worst. While Eczema is aggravated by the cold, penetrating winds, it is not
due to atmosph,eri cconditions or external causes. The disease itself is located in the blood,
and is an internal, constitutional disorder. The pent-up secretions,- the biting acids and
poisonous matter that have accumulated Jn the system because of an inactive, torpid state
of the bodily organs, are absorbed into the circulation,
polluting the blood, filling the veins with acrid particles .Â£^p^?SÂ£" T35t"Â»5g5Â£ Â¦

grows and spreads and becomes a lingering torture. No
permanent good comes from washes, salves and ointments; they are helpful but not curative.
The disease is running riot in the blood, the acid poisons are circulating all through the
system, and nothing applied to the surface of the body can penetrate deep enough to reach
the fountain source of the trouble and root out the real cause of this terrible skin disease.
Eczema must be fought through the- blood system, and an internal remedy that enters
into the circulation and searches out and neutralizes the acids and destroys the poisonous
secretions offers the only chance of permanent relief.
The various mineral preparations are bad on the stomach and digestion, and the tempo-
rary good they do is over-balanced; by the harmful after-effects. In S. S. S. is offered a
remedy absolutely, vegetable ; it doesn't contain a single mineral or injurious drug of any

THE EUGENE BOWLERS
The. new green of the Scotch bowl
ers at Golden Gate Park was not in
condition to be used yesterday, and no
tournament matches were decided.
The grass is dying and it was thought
best to allow the new gras3.to come
up. A few of the t most enthusiastic
players Journeyed to the old green at
Recreation Park and indulged in prac-
Hice games. The closest and most ex
citing match was that between D. Dal
zlel and W. R. Eaton and E. J. Clin
_ton and Dr. Hamilton. The match
was even up to the last two ends,
which were won by Dalzlel and Eaton.
The score In their favor was 21 to 18.
Another match that was close was
that in which Dalziel and Eaton beat
M. L. Crowe and Dr. Hamilton. The
winners were In fine form in both
matches and did some clever bowl
ing. , The score was 21 to 19. Three
other matches were played, -but they
were all rather one-sided. They re
sulted as follows: Stewart and J. Mc-
Lachlan beat ; R. Park and J. Stott
21 to 8; James Gray dnd Dr. Gunn
beat J. C. Moffatt and A. Foreman 21
to 12; G. C. Patterson and James Gray

Some interesting experiments are In
course of prosecution on the Berlin ele
vated electric railway. Complaints
have been frequent concerning the
noise made by the cars on the elevated
structure. The first experiment con
sisted In inserting three layers of felt
between the rails and the wooden cross
ties on which they were laid. This was
inadequate, however, although It gave
some improvement. Next, hollow iron
girders filled with loose sand were sub
stituted for the wooden sleepers; this
also was partially effective, but not
entirely so. The rails were then laid
"on long longitudinal sleepers with
cushions of lead under them. Finally
the car wheels have been lined 'with
wood, so as to break the continuity of
the path for vibrations through metal.
These experimental remedies are still
on trial, but no definite conclusions con
cerning them have been announced.â

pace told more on her. Miss Eatcliffe
won the first two games and aiso led
at 3-2. Miss Hotchkiss, by clever
placing took the next two games, mak

she won. The next two games were

The finals of the women's handicap
single-tennis tournament at Golden
Gate Park yesterday was by far the
closest and most interesting match
ever played by the fair racket wielders
on the public courts. The contestants
were Miss Hazel Hotchkiss and Miss
Ethel Ratdiffe. both of Berkeley. They
met on even terms and the tennis
played by both was a surprise to the
spectators. Miss Ratcllffe won by a
small margin and now leads in the
race for the Jackman cup. She won
the last tournament and has two victo
ries to her credit. Miss Hotchkiss also
has her name on the cup.
The first set was much the best of the
three and was remarkably long. Al
most every game went to deuce vant
age. Miss Hotchkiss started playing
better tennis than her opponent and
the score soon read 5-2 and 40-15 in her
favor. Miss Ratcliffe braced, and by
clever playing evened up the score at
5-5. From this point to the end first
one was ahead and then the other
until Miss Ratcllffe won. 11-9.
In the second set Miss Hotchkiss
played a game that the Suttons would
have to hustle to beat. Miss Ratcllffe
played as hard as possible, but her
clever opponent did not allow her a
game.

For the sailors' Alexander and Hol

SATURDAY HOKXETS ARE %
BEATEN -BY SAILORS
In his sworn statement given to In- 1
spector Fulkerson Dusenberry declared j
that they were locked to prevent per
sons entering portions of the house to
which their ticket did not grant them
admission. It was the duty of Dusen
berry to see that these two gates were j
locked before every performance and
then unlocked after the second act. j
When asked by the inspector why a I
/nan had not, been stationed in place j
of the gates, to direct the audience, i
Dusenberry said that he merely re- J
ceived his orders from Davi3 and Pow- i
ers. the managers of the theater, and !
had carried them out.
"I found these gates after the fire.'
said Inspector Fulkerson, "all battered
and bent inward, but still standing and Â¦
both of them tightly locked. I ques- J
tioned Dusenberry about them at the J
time, but did not care 'to say anything !
publicly until I had secured his sworn!
statement, and this I now have."
TO PUNISH THE GUILTY.
A meeting x>Â£ the relatives of per
sons who perished in the fire was held j
this afternoon to agree upon concerted j
action toward establishing responsi- |
bility for the fire and for accomplish- j
Ing the punishment of persons who
should be.found guilty of criminal neg
ligence. Several of the speakers at the s
meeting urged that If the Coroner's
Jury fixed the responsibility of the dis
aster upon any of the city officials they
should be attacked In the civil courts
and made responsible for damages as
long as their property should last#
Miss Lizzie Haley, a teacher in the
public schools, created something of a I
sensation by declaring that many o%J
the public school buildings were abso
lutely without protection against fire,
and that repeated protests by the
teachers and principals had produced
no result and had not even been hon
ored with a reply. i
It was the sense of the meeting that
damage suits should be instituted j
against Klaw & Erlanger, who repre
sent the Eastern stockholders in the j
theater, and the manner of doing this j
will be decided upon at the meeting
next Wednesday night.
The Iroquois Theater death roll con
tinues to grow. Another death result
ing from the fire was reported to the
Coroner to-day. Mrs. M. A. Helms
died at the Samaritan Hospital from
burns and injuries. Her death In
creased the total to 569.
To-day George X. Dusenberry. head
usher of the theater, admitted to Fulk
erson that these gates were placed,
one across an exit from the ilrst bal
cony and the other across an exit from
the second balcony. Both gates were
locked securely with padlocks and were
never at any performance unlocked un
til after the second act of the play.
On the day of the fire the second act
had not been completed when the
catastrophe occurred, and the gates
were still standing. They were "so
strong that the firemen- were not able
to batter them down with axes after
the flre, and to the frenzied people who
sought .safety through these exits
they were absolutely impenetrable.
OBEYED TILE MANAGERS.
' CHICAGO. Jan. 9.â It was discovered
to-day that two iron gates, the exist
ence of which had not been known to
the public and .were removed
from the Iroquois Theater after the
fire, played a deadly part In the de
struction of life in the ill-fated play
house. Fire Inspector Fulkerson. who
knew of their existence, was not able
until to-day to obtain sworn evidence
concerning them.
"You think that President McKin
ley made a mistake when he made
General Wood a brigadier general?".
Answer: "I think he made a deadly
mistake. When he made that ap
pointment I think he gave the great
est shock to the sense of discipline and
fairness of the American army that it
has ever received."
General Wilson further stated, as re
ported exclusively in The Call, that
General Wood was not at the battle of
San Juan, and told the committee that
he had informed the President, then
Governor of New York, of this fact.
This evidence was refuted by Secretary
Root when he went on the stand a few
days . later. Root said that General
Wood was not only at the battle of San
Juan, but that his division comnjander
had reported him for conspicuous brav
ery and for handling his troops so well
that he desired to recommend him for
promotion. The Secretary further said
that General Wood was at the bloody
ford, "in the hottest and heaviest fire
that our men had to endure, when men
were falling all around him." Continu
ing he said:
"I think I ought to say, too, that a
part of the facts upon which President
Roosevelt determined, so far as was
within his power, to keep General Wood
in the same order of relative rank
where President McKinley had put him
was his personal knowledge of General
Wood's presence in that fight and of
the extraordinary gallantry and effi
ciency he displayed."
Regarding General "Wilson's state
ment that President Roosevelt asked
him not to mention the fact that Wood
was at the rear during the battle of
San Juan, Secretary Root said:
"I think I ought to allude to the re
marks of General James H. Wilson
here as to the conversation with the
President. Of course, the President
cannot be a witness. The President In
forms me that General Wilson Is mis
taken and that no such conversation
regarding General Wood's presence at
the San Juan tight that day ever took
place between him and General Wil
son."
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.^â Testimony
offered In the hearings before the
Senate Committee on Military Affairs
concerning the nomination of Briga
dier General Leonard Wood to be
made major general has been supplied
to all the Senators. The printed tes
timony shows that General -James H.
t Wilson was particularly severe in his
criticism of General Wood, and while
on the stand also criticized President
McKinley for making him a brigadier
general. This criticism was brought
out by the following question from

But it was only a dream. . He had
been here but a short time when she
noticed a change in his demeanor. She
grew nervous and excitable because of
the change, and soon her mind weak
ened under the strain. She realized
that treatment was necessary, and
when her husband suggested that she
go to a sanitarium she readily consent
ed, little knowing that her removal to
a hospital was the first step in her
husband's plan to rid himself of her. \
It was while she was in the hospital
that the papers in divorce were served
upon her. Thr % shock almost killed her,
but her friends rallied to her side and
told her that such an infamous pro
ceeding could not be tolerated in the
American courts. Affidavits were made
by these friends, in 'which Anthony's
knavery was exposed, and they were
filed with, the County Clerk. But they
were never presented, for A'nthony,
learning of the care exercised by his
wife's friends", went to her and by rep
resenting to her that" unless she de
nounced her friends to be victims of
mistaken zeal in her behalf he would
withdraw his charge of desertion and
sue on the ground of infidelity. With her
mind weakenetl by lllne.ssand by the
worries consequent upon her husband's
actions, Mrs. Anthony consented, and
when Anthony promised her that with
in a period of six months he would

joined her at the home of his sister,
where Fhe had been residing since her
arrival from* South Africa. He greeted
her effusively, and she thought that
here in this land of the free, undis
turbed by war or rumors of war, theirs
would be a happy life.
NOTICES CHANGE.
A short time after getting the decree
of divorce Anthony left the city 'and
went to Los Angeles. From there he
went to Yuma, Ariz., where he took unto
himself a second wife. With her he went
to the Orient, only returning in time
to appear and defend himself against
the charges made by his real wife.
Anthony has rendered himself liable to
prosecution on a charge of perjury, for
when he filed his action in divorce he
swore that he had been a resident of
this country one year, a statement ut
tery disproved by the testimony taken
in the proceedings instituted by his
wife.
er, exercised his control over her and
persuaded her to send them away and
to refuse them an audience. But they
persisted, with the result that a suit
was filed to set aside the decree of di

obtained by methods calculated to de
ceive the court. . ,

Mrs. Lovell White declared the an

controlling the forests should be be
yond the vacillating power of Individ
uals and vested solely In. the Govern
ment, either State or national, for
that, and that alone, will insure to the
future the proper protection that we
have been all too slow in recognizing.
"However, the fact that we .must
face is- this: That we must, first of all.
take steps to obtain proper forest leg
islation, and then submit the law to
the Supreme Court to pass upon iw
validity. That done, the first great
step toward scientific | forestry wilt
have been {aken. And when framing
this law the lumberman must be pro
tected in the same ratio as the pub
lic. He must be protected from firs
and not taxed to death.
"In France and Switzerland the
most stringent forestry laws in. tho
world prevail. It is to be hoped, how
ever, that an intelligent understanding
by our people of the necessity of for
ests will not necessitate such drastic
measures as obtain in those countries.
But the fate of Spain, denuded of her
trees and despoiled and impoverished,
by. drought, carried a warning to her
neighbors that bore good fruit."
Mr. McXaught closed his talk by
quoting President Roosevelt, who em
braced the whole of forestry policy in
the fololwlng terse sentence: "The
preservation of the forests is the wise

With heart gladdened she returned to

Then they returned to South Africa,

til Anthony suggested that for the sake
of their children she should return to
this country. Because of her love for
them fihe cons^pted to come here, with
the understanding that he would fol

Mrs. Anthony's story of her wrongs
is a romantic tale. It was in 1887 that
she, at that time Christina YVcssels.
heiress and cousin of President Stein of
the Orange Free State, first met An

proceedings and that Mrs. Anthony was
entitled to the relief she prayed for.
namely, a restoration to her of her
good name and a setting aside of the
decree of divorce.
COURTS OPINION.
Justice has at last been meted out
to Christina, the wife of Dr. Richard
S. Anthony. Though tardy, it is com
plete, Â»nd she now has it in her pqwer
to mekc it decidedly warm for the man
whose life she saved and who repaid
her for her devotion by restraining her
cf her liberty and branding her as an
unfaithful wife, and who then, by
means of threats of violence and ap
peals to her love for her children and
by playing upon fears engendered by
her religious belief, secured her consent
to allow him to secure a decree of di
vorce.

An election was held last week in
Company I, Fifth Infantry, to fill a va
cancy In the position of first lieutenant.
Major D. A: Smith presided, and there
were present fifty of the fifty-six mem
bers. Second Lieutenant L. Schoenfelt
was elected to fill the vacancy, and
Corporal . W. Beck was .elected second
lieutenant. The last named is a very
popular young man, who has been with
the company- since it was organized
and is a most enthusiastic guardsman.
This company will in a short time move
into a new armory, which is being spe
cially fitted up for it. After the election
Major Smith talked to the members for
some time on the line of the lecture
that was recently delivered" by Colonel
Wilhelm to one of the local organiza
tions. In this way the company was
instructed as to what the United States
inspector expects to see. t
The field officers of the Fifth Infan
try will hold a meeting this week for
the purpose of laying out work for the
year.
VACANCY FILLED.
If the board can frame a law that
will come up to expectations the rank
and file will have something that will
become a useful guide. The present law
is fearfully and wonderfully made. up,
and is such that no two men if not in
consultation can reach the same idea
as v to the meaning of many of the para
graphs, and when one concludes that
he has placed the right construction on
a section he finds further on another
section that upsets his former ideas,
and then still further on he will find
something that makes him greatly
doubt the meaning of the other sec
tions.
The "law" is an aggregation of sec
tions that areÂ«not up to date and are
entirely at variance with the provisions
that require the National Guard to
keep up with the United States army
ideas. It is to make sense out of what
now is nonsense that this board has
been appointed. .
â¢^The resignation of Captain W. A.
Varney, Battery A, First Artillery, has
been accepted and an election order is
sued for the latter part of the month
to fill the vacancy. An election will
rIso be called shortly to fill the vacancy
in the signal corps in this city occa
sioned by the resignation of Captain
Selfridge.
Colonel Thomas Wilhelm, U. S. A.,
will commence the inspection of the
guard of this State during the current
week. ' â¢
A remarkable condition exists in the
guard at this time. The several organi
zations have been furnished Krag-Jor
gensen rifles, and the old Springnelds
have been boxed ready j to ship to the
United" States arsenal at Benicia, but
while the men have been furnished the
arms they have not been' furnished am
munition for such, nor have they been
furnished belts in which to carry the
ammunition. In case of need the guard
would find Itself with a lot of empty
guns, without anything to put in them
and the old guns unavailable.

A USEFUL GUIDE.
The officers also displayed a change
for the better and seemed to realize the
fact that, when in uniform and before
men in uniform the intimate friendship
that exists in every day life is not con
ducive to the best interests of the State
soldiery. The officers maintained an
unusual degree of dignity and the men
a remarkable amount of respect for
their superior officers.
. After a month's rest the officers of
the local organizations of the National
Guard assembled in their respective
armories on company night, and it was
apparent that there had been a deal of
brushing up during the month of rest.
The men'in the ranks appeared to have
profited by the lectures they received
during the last few months, and ap
peared more like soldiers than they
have for a long time past. There was a
neatness and smartness that was most
noticeable, and it may be taken as the
first step in the line of improvement
for the better. Â¦

"The Judicious friends of union labor
deplore these excesses, and thoughtful
citizens are alarmed because the places
in our industries that should be filled
by trained .American youth are occu

into unions and taught that it must de

the union oath, and not upon the laws

"It is not necessary further to discuss
the effect of denial or limitation of the
right to learn a trade. It means a sen
tence of American youth to moral
death, and its effect is seen in the mul
tiplication of State reform schools and
in the lowering of the age of criminals
at date of first conviction, until now
the average is a little above' twenty
years, showing, that enforced idleness
in youth leads to crime before the vic
tim reaches his majority. This means
steady moral decay infecting society
and the State.
"In addition to this denial of the
right of aprenticeship to American
youth, ambitious labor agitators claim
the right to license Amp rican labor and
to enforce the license by denying to
all non-union labor the right to work
at all. This extraordinary Infringement
of natural right is enforced by the boy
cott and by maiming and murder. The
employer undertakes to control "his
business: at the risk of Us destruction
and his ruin, and the free laborer
makes his own contract and performs
it at the risk of his life.
"With our. youth forbidden gainful
occupation, it is no wonder that our
national pride is shamed by the fact
that our percentage of criminal popu
lation increases and exceeds that of
Europe. Industrial training curbs li
centiousness, decreases the use of stim
ulants and narcotics and forms good
character, with habits of thrift, temper
ance and industry requisite for good
citizenship. Our criminal statistics
show that SO per cent of our prison pop

trade or handicraft.
RIGHT TO LEARN TRADE.
and as a matter of supreme interest to
its many readers presents it in full. Pt
is as follows:
"Kxoessive industrial organization
has been diverted from its professed
legitimate purpose into an instrument
of arbitrary power, often used willfully
and in denial of natural rights. In this
aspect the labor union has usurped and
exceeded the sovereignty of the State,
and assumes to be superior to the civil
and moral obligations of citizenship.
"These conditions have naturally
roused antagonisms which seriously
disturb the commerce and block the
progress of the country.. The misuse of
the power of organization in the hands
of the agitators has' not only caused
serious and defiant violation of law
and destruction of life and property,
but it has gone further than present in
jury by striking at the future welfare
of the country in certain matters of
such vital importance that it is folly
to ignore them. The limitation of ap
prenticeship to the handicrafts ha3
practically outlawed our native youth.
Forbidden the right to learn a trade,
they must either overcrowd the profes
sions or fester in the vices of idleness
until they require the restraint of re
form schools and prisons.
For some time it has been known in
this city that a movement was on foot
to organize a third force in the conflict
between employers and union labor or
ganizations. The matter has excited
the deepest, interest in industrial cir
cles, and new developments have been
anxiously looked for.
The organization has so far pro
gressed that an executive committee
has been formed and a statement of
the alms of the new organization has
\)een drawn up by the committee. The
Call has been able to obtain the state
ment from a member of the committee.
"With all the resources of the law, it
will defersrl those whose rights 'are in
fringed: will meet every emergency in
volving danger to life, liberty and prop
erty, caused by the lawless use of pow-.
er, with every legal weapon, and it will
punjue such admonitory policy as will
discipline the administrators of the law
in a more dutiful discharge of their
trust. These being its purposes, it in
tends to fearlessly administer a^ lesson,
useful alike to the. oppressor and the
oppressed, when rights are imperiled
and laws are defied."
"These great voices, in stating the
rights of man and the essentials of civil
liberty, have uttered the platform of
the Citizens' Alliance. We welcome im
migration, bu; deny to the immigrant
the right to- outlaw-' our. native youth:
We make no objection to labor unions,
but demand that the equal right ot
all men to labor be respected, and that
the laws which protect i' be enforced
impartially. We will not tolerate re
strictions on the employer to prevent
his employment of union labor, but his
right to employ non-union labor is of
equal <i:gnity and must not be re
strained. Every, restriction on Ameri
can citizens, other than those imposed
by the law, must { u destroyed, to the
end that' no man in this country shall
be subieet to the arbitrary will of an
other. When "these principles are rec
ognised and enforc 1 there will be In
dustrial peace and justice.
"It is the purpose of the Citizens*
Alliance to insure peace to every man
in the prosecution of his business and
the performance of his labor." and to
make him safe in his home and on the
street, from the insults and assaults
heretofore encouraged by agitators.
PLATFORM OF ALLIANCE.
â¢In his 'Faith of Our Fathers,' Car
dinal. Gibbons says: 'A man enjoys
civil liberty when he is exempt from
the arbitrary will of otiiers, and when
he is governed by equitable laws, es
tablished for the general welfare of
socitey; so long as, in common with
his feilow citizens, he observes the law
of the State any exceptional restraint
imposed upon him in the exercise <rf
his rights as a citizen is so far an in
fringement upon civil liberty.'
"In a subsecuent publication Cardi
nal Gibbons says: 'The right of a non
union laborer to make his own contract
freely, arid perform it without hin
drance, is so essential to civil liberty
that it must be defended by the whole
power of this Government.'
"One of. the greatest American ju
rists, a Justice of the United States
Supreme Court, in a decision says: 'The
equality of right, with exemption from
all disparaging and partial enactments
in the lawful pursuits of rife through*
out the whole country, is the distin
guishing privilege of American citizen
ship. To American citizens 'everywhere
all pursuits, all vocations, . all prof cs
sions are open vtfthout oth^r restric
tions than such as are imposed equally
upon all others of the same age, sex
and condition. The state may prescribe
such regulations as promote the public
good, but the pursuit or "calling, must
be free to be. followed by every citizen
who is within the conditions desig
nated and will conform to the regula
tion. That, only " a free country, in
the -American sense of the term, under
which the inalienable right of every
citizen to pursue his happiness is un
restrained, except by just, equal and
impartial laws.'
"Blackstone says: 'Civil liberty, the
great end of all human society and gov
ernment, is that state In which each
individual has the power to pursue his
own happiness,' according to his own
views of his Interest, and the dictates
of .his own conscience, unrestrained ex
cept by Just, equal and impartial laws.'

âÂ¦" 'The' allurement of -the fiscal advan
tages made in these money contribu
tions undoubtedly prolonged the illu
sions and concealed the vast injury
they did to industry and their infrac
tion of natural rights. This delusion
has extended so far that it is asserted
that the 'right to work at all is a royal
privilege, which the King might sell,
and that his subjects were bound to
purchase of him. We hasten to correct
this error and to repel the conclusion.
God, in giving to man wants and de
sires rendering labor necessary for their
r.atlsf action, conferred the right to la
bor upon all men. and this property is
the first, most sacred and imprescripti
ble of all. The King therefore regards
it as the first duty of his justice and
the worthiest act of benevolence to
"It stands for law and order and for
the primitive rights of man. Adam
Smith, in his "Origin of the Wealth of
Nations," says: 'The property which
a man has Is his own labor, as it is
the original foundation o*f all other
property, so it is the most sacred and
inviolable. The patrimony of the poor
man lies in the strength and skill of
his hands; and to hinder him* from
employing: his strength and dexterity
in what manner he thinks proper, with
out injury to his neighbor, is a plain
violation of the most sacred property.
It is a manifest encroachment upon the
just liberty of both the workman and
of those who might be disposed to em
ploy him. As it hinders the one from
working at what he thinks proper, so
it hinders the others from employing
whom they think proper.'
"The trade unions and jurandes <rt
France, deterred by .fear of the law
from denying the right* to labor," by
(Subventions' and financial contributions
to the King, persuaded him that it was
the royal prerogative to license or for
bid men to labor. When the great
Turgot "became Minister of Finance of
Louig XVI he persuaded that monarch
to repudiate this monstrous doctrine in
a decree which he wrote for tho royal
signature, in which he said:
A\ TIIOH1TIKS QUOTED
'"By these means there has been es
tablished an absolute control of every
man's private business 'by those who
have no legal interest in it and no legal
right to intrude upon it. This interfer
ence extends to manufacturers, farm
crops, building material and strikes at
every point vital to community life.
Using the sympathetic strike and boy
cott, assault and assassination, it in
tlicts loss and injury upon employee
and laborer alike, and \vh(?h no ques
tion of hours or labor is involved fre
quently paralyzes transportation and
business merely to enforce a demand for
recognition, which means the outlawing
of free labor and denial of the right ot
private contract and of. freedom of
crioice to the employer \jf tho material
he can use or the merchandise he will
handle. Under these conditions various
organizations of employers, manufac
turers and others have been made in
response to sudden emergency, their
purpose being of necessity limited by
the quality of the emergency. But the
far-reaching nature of the injury in
flicted by these excesses of power has
seemed to demand a more thorough and
thoughtful treatment than can be ex
pected of men who band together to
meet a risk in their personal affairs.
So the Citizens' Alliance- has risen, an
organization of the community, of the
third party, heretofore not considered
in those industrial wars, hut the party
that endures their cost and loss and
stands impartially between the parties
to the conflict.

The reader* of The Call get thp latest and best
nrt pictures in the market, and next Sunday's offering,
an exquisite pair of panels hi colors. "Colonial Dame
and Virginia Belle," Is only further proof of the
above statement. . %
It is a double attraction ami is from thp brnsh of
the eminent painter, IMcrre Carricr-Bclluesp. It rep-
resents two charming and graceful young women, two
superbly interesting fijjure**; in fact, they are compan-
ion pictures and on the same plate. To a remark-
able degree they possess that quality which the
French call "chic." n quality which Is made up of
dash, attractiveness and skill. They represent two su-
pcrbly drawn form.*, while the beauty of contour of
tlicir figures is delicately suggested under the mass of
/ drapery which dominates the charmins: characters.
The t-olors are simply delightful, notes of pink and
j;reen beins set off by contrasting notes of pink and
black.
The artist who created these beautiful women Is
a pupil of Cabanel. and shows the sympathy, the
grace and the atmosphere of that famous master.
Pierre Cnrrier-Belluese was born In Paris nearly
fifty years ago, hns received the highest medals at, the
universal expositions in 1880 and In 1900 and is a
member of the Society of French Artists.
Thousands are having these beautiful art pictures
framed. Nothing has ever been given away that pos-
sesses the. novelty and artistic, cleverness that "Tho
Colonial Dame nnd Virginia Belle" does when in-
closed in a neat cold frame.

it is the present intention of the rail

He said to-night that the signs had
been put up in conformity with a rule
of the corporation, but that the charg

charged, he said, but that may be a

there is no intention of charging fares

The university 'will have the refusal
of this allotment until February 1. By
that time the Board of Regents will
have decided whether an appropriation
will be made. V ,
Professor Christy found that there
are a number of advantages about the
place, particularly In regard _to loca
tion. The space is in one of the vesti
bules, where sightseers will becoming
and going constantly through the eight
entrances. Between these entrances
there is a large amount of wall space,
v/hich may be utilized for pictures and
maps. The aisles, which will be fifteen
feet wide,' will absorb considerable
floor space, but there will remain suffi
cient to make exhibits in cases along
the walls. A space ten feet square will
remain in the center for utilization.
There seems to be some doubt as to
the position the regents will assume
in regard to the proposed exhibition.
It will take at least $5000 to make a
creditable exhibit and in view of .the
recent disclosures with reference to
finances, involving probably the loss ofr
$35,000, the Regents may feel that they
would not be justified in appropriating
such a sum for mere advertising. The
whole thing will be decided, however,
on January 12, when the Regents meet
again; that is, if the JIcKowen scandal
docs not absorb" all the attention of the
board at that time.
The decision to accept the allotted
space was made after the committee
heard from. Professor S. B. Christy,
who returned this morning from St.
Louis. Professor Christy was largely
instrumental In securing the space and
was so familiar with its location and
advantages that he was enabled to give
a ecod account of it.
It now devolves upon the, Board of
Regents of the University of California
to say whether the university will be
represented as an' exhibitor at the St.
Louis World's Fair, the faculty com
mittee appointed by President Wheeler
having decided at a meeting to-tfay to
accept the 1600 square, feet of space as
signed to the university by the fair of

The executive committee of San
Francisco met at the Mayor's office and
after considering the matter decided
to return the unexpended money to the
original subscribers.
Cornelius Bliss, treasurer of the fund
in New York, was notified, and yester
day A. Sbarbo'ro, treasurer of the fund
in San Francisco, received a check for
one-half of the amount subscribed in
this city, which will now be refunded
to all subscribers. Checks will be
mailed to all known subscribers, and
others will be paid on the presentation
of receipts. The national committee
reports that it received subscriptions
from nearly one thousand persons.
San Francisco sent donations from one
hundred and thirty subscribers.
The committee appointed by the
President, after having made all the
disbursements for aid which they could
judiciously make, found that they still
had on hand one-half of the total
amount received from subscribers,
whereupon notices were sent out to the
different committees asking them
whether they desired the money col
lected refunded to the subscribers or
whether they wished to appropriate
the same for the relief of suffering
Filipinos.
The persons that subscribed to thÂ«
relief fund for the aid of persons ren
dered homeless by the recent destruc
tion of towns and lives In the West
Indian Islands by the eruption of a
volcano on the island of Martinique
are to have one-half of the sums they
subscribed refunded.
At the time of the disaster the ap
peal was so spontaneously answered
that in a short time the President
notified all the committees to stop re
ceiving subscriptions, as all the money
required for the purpose of aiding the
sufferers had been received.

Profesror Christy said that he was

"II the resents do not make a suf

grant colleges, that is those that re
.ceive appropriations, will be repre

arrange thorn.
"We have been offered space In the
Mining Building adjacent to the Cali
fornia State exhibit and may be forced
to tcil;e that in case the plnns for the
exn\bit in the Educational Building do
not maturp." Â« '
Of this 16,000 square feet a portion
400 feet square has been set aside in
a good location for the mining exhib
its of these twelve colleges. Originally
only 200 square feet had been assigned
to the mining colleges, but after some
little maneuvering Professor Christy
was enabled to have the allotment In
creased to 400 square feet.
"Of course not much of an exhibit
can be made even in this enlarged
space," said Professor Christy. "The
be.Â«t we can do is to exhibit maps and
transparencies showing the work at
the different colleges. There will be
no r.ttempt to exhibit specimens or
machinery, as it would be impossible
to find a place for them.
Professor S. B. Christy of the Uni
versity of California, director of ex
hibits for the land grant mining col
leges at the Louisiana Purchase'Ex
position, returned from St. Louis to
day after looking over the ground in
behalf of the exhibits of which he has
charge.
Professor Christy saw much that
was interesting and wrestled with
some problems that could only be de
termined by personal observation and
appeal. There is still the largest
Question to be solved, however, that of
finance, and unless the board of re
gents makes some kind of an appro
priation the mining department of
the University o* California will not
be represented at the fair.
As it stands now there are 10.000
square feet of space set aside in the
Educational Building for exhibitions
by the land grant colleges of the
United States. The Government has
appropriated 5100.000 for. the exhibi

which there are twelve. The activi

The deed was sent some days ago
by mistake to ex-County Recorder
YioJ Church by Georgo Hodges, a
lawyer of Tallahassee. Fla.. to be re
corded. Kodges said it had been
given him . by Shorter as a. fee for
defending him.
Investigation 'showed that an al
leged deed purporting to convey the
property mentioned from Mrs. Wil
liams to Shorter had been recorded
several years ago. Mr. Church com
municated with Mrs. Williams and she
said she knew Shorter h^re and gave
him a home. He became acquainted
with the piece of land she owns and
sayd that he evidently forged her
name to the deed and placed it on
record before he left here. When ar
rested in Florida he represented to
Hodges, an attorney there, that he
owned a piece of property here and
gave him the deed as a fee for defend
ing him.
Mrs. Williams claims she. never
deeded the land to Shorter and has re
tained counsel, who has brought suit
to quiet title to the land and have the
deed declared a forgery. The notary
before whom it was sworn to Is said
to be dead. >*.';.
Mrs. Lilia "Williams, an asred colored

counterfeiting:. The property is lo
cated on the outskirts of East Oak

The men who take their- "morning's
morning" and do the "route" at night
are aghast. The threatened war be
tween Russia and Japan is nothing in
comparison with the threatened break
ing off of diplomatic relations between
the proprietors and the men who mix.
A's the matter now stands the bar
tenders have asked for a day eff a
week. A hundred proprietors o" sa
loons met to-day and by an almost
unanimous rising vote said "no." The
reason argued is that on the bartend
er's day off his particular, customers,
with a highly developed taste, would be
inconsolable. If a strange man were
put behind one man's bar one day and
another man's the next, taking the
places of those who were off, the trade
secrets would be let out of the bag.
The amount of cash that goes into the
till and water Into the barrel would
alike be at the mercy of a loquacious
itinerant bartender. The saloon men
cannot trust themselves nor their bar
tenders, and war has been declared. At
the meeting held to-day the saloon men
appointed Pete Hanrahan and A. Bel
tink to have a "confab" with the union
and try to call It off. The matter, how
ever, has been put up to them by the
union good and strong and is the talk
of the town to-night.

It' was learr.ed to-day that General
Reyes has seen a number of adminis
tration Senators during his stay here,
r.rnoag them Lodge, Spooner and El
kins.
General Reyes can suggest no means
by which the Colombian and Panama
governments can settle their differ
ence?. He believes It possible that the
dispatch of a special envoy to Bogota
from this Government might result sat
isfactorily, and he suggested to-day
th;it Minister Bo wen, in Caracas, who
speaks Spanish fluently and whose in
fluence in South America has been in
creased by his work for Venezuela, or
Minister Buchanan might be able to
bring about a solution of the Colombia-
Fav.ama problem if either were sent to
Bogota at this time.
Up to the present time General Reyes 1
last note to the State Department, re
questing that his presentations of the
Colombian case be forwarded to the
Senate, has not been answered. His
reasons for making this request were
that, as a treaty was under considera
tion b'y the American Senate hostile to
the interests of his country, the Bo
gota Government desired that its side
of the case should be presented. Gen
eral" Reyes believes that in this way
the Senate will be better able to reach
a fair decision.
WASHINGTON. Jan. sT-General
Reyes, the Colombian representative,
to-night said he was yet hoping for
an answer to his last request that the
correspondence be sent to the Senate
and that he could not ray deflnitely
w hen he would leave Washington? He
added that when the time came for so
ins he would officially take leave of
the President and other officials with
whom he had come in contact.
. In a lone cablegram which general
R^yes has dispatched to General Mar
roquin h* has reviewed the negotia
tions in Washington and informed the
Bogota Government that, after doing
everything in his power to save some
thins from the wreck, he has failed.
<ieneral Reyes has not supplemented
this announcement with a word of ad
vice as to the course his Government
shall -pursue. Naturally, he expects, in
view of the high feeling prevailing in
Â«'olombia, that it will be very difficult
to restrain his people longer. Through
out the negotiations General Reyes
brought to bear all the pressure in his
power to prevent a rupture between
the Washington and Bogota govern
ments, and he Is gratified that his peo
ple have kept their word and not de
clared war while there was hope of
effecting: a settlement by diplomacy.
This means havins failed, General
Reyes does not feel that it is his mis
sion further to advise the Bogota Gov
ernment as to its course.

a feeling of sacred reverence for his

to one with a tone of Vere de Vere in
Its pronunciation. But one has only
to glance through a directory i to j see
how many people are "cursed i from

to this torture of their children by giv
ing them Christian names which in
tensify the uncomfortable character of
their patronymic. Oliver Wendell

NEW YORK, Jan. 9.â The Financier
says: The most notable feature of the
official statement of the New York As
sociated Banks last week was the close
correspondence between the gain in
cash as shown by the statement and
the increase as estimated on the basis
of the. traceable movements of money
during the week. ; The bank return re
corded a gain of $10,028,700, of which
$5,726,100 consisted of specie and $4,302,
600 of legal tenders. The estimated in
crease in cash was $11,806,100, making
the difference between the official and
the preliminary figures $1,837,400, which
may very easily be accounted for by
the average system and also by the
fact that the' br.nk statement included
the movements of Friday. 4 The depos
its were increased $19,534,400, in conse
quence of which r. serve requirements
were augmented by $4,883,600. Deduct
ing this sum from the increase in cash
leaves $5,145,100- as the increase in sur
plus reserve, which item now is $14,
686,975, or only $123,225 below the sur r
plu3 at the corresponding date a year
ago. Calculated upon the basis of de
posits, less those of $36,698,600 public
funds, the surplus is $23,861,625, it may
be noted that the deposits at this time
In 1902 were $2,477,600 greater.
The amount of the Increase in loans
was . $7,421,700, making the gain in this
item $37,252,000. during the past three
weeks. The sum of the Increase, in
loans 4 and of the gain in cash was less
j by $2,084,000 than the Increase in de
posits;, therefore the statement did not
balance. The daily - average of the
clearings for the week was $245,000,
000, or $17,000,000 greater than in the
previous week, reflecting operations in
cident to the distribution of interest
and dividends. The excess of loans
over deposits. .was $10,278,900, or about
$12,000,000; less than in the previous
week." '
, Comparisons show'that seven of the
largest banks ' gained . $4,600,000 net in
loans, while five of these banks in
creased cash holdings by $3,400,000 net.

Arundel Castle, the ancestral home
of the Duke of Norfolk, and which is
now once more to have a gracious
young chatelaine, has often been de
scribed and visited by nearly every
American who tours in England. Most
people know that it was occupied for
years by Alfred the Great, that King
William Rufus, son of the Con
queror, stayed there; that Empress
Mathilde of Germany found shelter
within its walls, and that its posses
sion carries with it a seat in the House
of Lords and the Earldom of Arundel.
But few people are aware that it
was for many years the prison of the
late Cardinal Howard. This prelate,
who was one of the most magnificent
figures of the church at Rome during
the reign of Pius IX and during the
early part of the pontificate of Leo
XIII, and invested with many digni
ties, including that of arch priest of
St. Peter's, suddenly became violently
Insane. He was a man of huge stature
â he had in his youth been an officer
of the Horse Guards in London â and
was possessed of great physical
strength. Some means had to be de
vised for placing him under restraint,
especially as his case was pronounced
incurable. Moreover, it was impera
tive that he should be removed from
Rome, where his presence might have
become more embarrassing, as there
was no precedent by which to go.
Thereupon his kinsman, the Duke of
Norfolk, conveyed him to England,
had one wing of Arundel Castle fitted
up for his detention, with barred win
dows and all other requisite precau
tions, and then established him there
with a large staff of trusted keepers
and physicians. He died there with
out ever having recovered his' reason
a number of years later. â Baltimore

Now the bride that is to be does not
have to wait till herSvedding day for
visible assurance of the affection of her
friends. The announcement of her en
gagement brings her a multitude of
dainty gifts, and every anniversary re
peats them. Even before these there
have been the delightful tissue-papered
mysteries of birthdays and Christmas
and New Year and St. Valentine's day
and Easter, and once or twice the ex
citement of commencement, with its
flowers and boxes, and frequent pres
ents from visiting . friends or other
friends returning from journeys. "We
live truly in an era of gifts, is the
childâ or the grown-up child, for that
matterâ greatly the happier for all
these gifts? Probably not, and for two
reasons. One is the grave old law of
compensation, so often the leveler of
unequal fortunes. A gift cannot mean
so much to one who receives a hundred
as it did to one who cherished his soli
tary treasure.
The other reason is that the great
gift of all to any' life, no matter
how few or how many the years it
counts, is love. The child who has that
can easily spare material wealth. There
is, nevertheless, one other side to this
matter of giving. If luxury in living is
increasing every day, 'as it seems to be,
it is surely a\ pleasant thing that one
phase of it Is the devising of new and
graceful ways of showing our sympa
thy with friends in everything, wheth
er joy or sorrow, that touches their
lives. â Youth's Companion.
If the making and receiving of gifts
contributes vitally to the joy of exist
ence the children of the twentieth cen
tury have reason to congratulate them
selves upon their good fortune. In no
way has the increasing luxury of
American life revealed itself more wide
ly than in this. Our grandmothers
could' often count upon their len fingers
the gifts of their childhood. The aver
age American baby of any except the,
poorer families probably receives more
gifts from admiring relatives In the
first year of, his life than his great
grandmother received In her first twen
ty. For in her day, except for the oc
casional rare treasure bestowed by
some especial kindness of fortune,
there was but one time of gift-making
and receiving, and that the wedding
day, when the friends and relatives
brought their simple presents of house
hold goods and plenishings and provi
sions to help furnish the new home.

TIIE HAPFY TIME *
OF GIFT MAKING
A notable feature of the visit thus far
has been the apparent lack of restraint
surrounding the movements of King
Edward. There has been no show of
guards. On several occasions when the
King rode to covers on his favorite
hunting pony the natives gathered to
see the royalties. On one occasion a
solicitous village constable endeavored
to drive off those who desired to see
the royal party. The Duke of Devon
shire heard this and called out:
"Let them all come and see the fun."
The King apparently enjoyed the ex
perience and laughingly acquiesced in
the Duke of Devonshire's order. The
bag this week consisted of about 5000
birds.
Queen Alexandra during the week
visited Bakewell workhouse, where
she conversed briefly with a number
of the sick and poor inmates and left a
$250 donation.
The striking feature of the house
party was the appearance of A. J. Bal
four, the Premier, as the guest of the
Duke of Devonshire. His presence
was the subject of much political com
ment, especially in view of the report
published by the Pall Mall Gazette on
Thursday of the Impending return of
the Duke of Devonshire to the Liberal
party, but it only indicates how little
party, politics affect social Ufe in Eng
land, where royalty is concerned.
LONDON, Jan. 9.â King Edward,
Queen Alexandra and Princess Victo
ria will leave Chatsworth, the seat â¢of
the Duke of^Devonshire, in Derbyshire,
where they are now visiting, on Jan
uary .11. The King will return to Buck
ingham Palace and the Queen to Sand
ringham, where she will be joined by
the King in a few days.
This is the first visit as King and
Queen their Majesties have paid to the
Duke of Devonshire's magnificent seat,
which is the greatest show place in
Middle England. The distinguished
guests have displayed a most demo
cratic spirit. They visited the sur
rounding country several times in a
motor car and everywhere have been
enthusiastically received. They took a
motor car ride to Chesterfield, where
the town was decorated and the popu
lace turned out- to greet them. The
royal party escaped a civic ceremony
there, however, the corporation having
prepared an address of welcome on the
occasion of the proposed visit to Ches
terfield, which was delayed by the
King's illness a year ago. This address
was afterward forwarded to London.
The party, therefore, passed on directly
to Hardwick Hall, another beautiful
Midland seat of the Duke of Devon
shire, where luncheon was served.
"They set examples of child neglect,"
he is quoted as saying. "I do not for
a moment mean cruelty in any shape
or form, but they are too busy gadding
about to study children or to educate
them in the right paths and win their
respect."
Nothing, indeed, could be more, idle
than to conceive -such a thing about
American duchesses who have been
over here some time and occupy a.so
cial position which is regarded as im
pregnable. The only English people
who would discuss the possibility of
such a social (frusade were those with
out high social position. Certainly
there has been no disposition manifest
toward the latest comers other than
of the most cordial character.
One clergyman, pastor of a fashion
able West End church, has joined
forecs with, that much quoted per.son
who, under the name of "Rita," con
tinues a crusade against society evils
by flinging vemon at American women
in interviews. The clergyman says
the "human exports" which "Americans
send us have had an effect on the mor
ality of our country. American women
in London, he says, have used their in
fluence against the binding ties of hus
band and wife, and they helped to re
duce love and friendship to a money
value.
LONDON, Jan. 9.â One of the sensa
tional, papers recently filled two pages
telling how a league had been formed
here against American duchesses. The
Duchess of Somerset was-, named as
playing the leading part and it was
declared that a systematic social boy
cott wonld bo organized against the
new Duchess of Roxburghe. The Duke
of Somerset has* gone to considerable
trouble to deny this.

Best Way to Preserve Peace.
Peculiarly interesting to San Fran
cisco, the homa of the Tivoll. is an
article in this month's Theater Maga
zine on the French opera in New Or
leans, senior by sixty years to our own
grand opera institution. It is from
the pen of Charles Stewart Booth and
throughout interesting and suggestive
in its light on another opera-mad town
than ours. We are haughtily left un
mentioned, however, though more than
once the hospitality of San Francisco
has been extended to the New Orleans
opera singers. Grand opera in New
York again is dismissed as "the fad
of a few millionaires, who allow' them
selves the luxury of listening to the
highest-paid singers to be found in the
world." Like ourselves. New Orleans
folk seem to pride themselves on loving
opera for opera's sake, and they have
at least ninety-one years of an attach
ment to show in support of their claim.
Here, however, is Mr. Booth on the
subject:
"Famous the world over as the home
of gay revelry and brilliant pageantry,
the annual festival of the Mardi Gras
end the French opera have given New
Orleans added and unique distinction
among American cities and are insep
arably connected with her civic and ar
tistic history.
"Deep rooted in the historic past as
both these purely local institutions
are, time has not weakened their popu
larity. -They have to-day as firm a
hold upon public sentiment and pat
rcnage as in those earlier times when
the city was wholly under French dom
ination and influence. For the visitor
to New Orleans there is much to in
terest at any time, but now the opera
season has begun the town is decked in
holiday garb and will remain in festive
attire until Lent. Where else in Amer
ica are there thoroughfares more pic
turesque or possessing more points of
historic interest than Bourbon, Royal
and Chartres streets? Here we are in
the center of the old French city and
carelessly strolling along the -ban
quette," past the old bookshops with
their bright displays of yellf w-covered
French novels, signs in a foreign
torfgue meet the eye at every turn:
'Cafe de lX^pera,' 'Restaurant de
Paris,' etc., etc.. until one rubs one's
eyes, not quite sure If he is not In the
French capital Itself.
"In the very heart of New Orleans,
and yet only five blocks away from Ca
nal streetâ the JBroadway of the South
â stands the French Opera-house, an
Imposing building, and with the excep
tion of the Metropolitan Opera-house
of New York the largest and best
equipped home of opera in America.
The French Opera is indeed the center
of social, artistic and musical life in
New Orleans. In New York grand
opera is indulged in as the fad of a few
millionaires, who allow themselves the
luxury oMlstening to the highest-paid
Eingers to be found in the world. In
the North It is a matter of fad and
fashion rather than love of art and
music, and although Director Conried
promises to remedy this, It is doubtful
whether he can so long as society con
trols the purse strings and dictates the
policy. It is different In New Orleans,
where grand opera is loved for Its own
sake, and has grown to be one of the
cherished traditions of the population.
The visitor to the Crescent City is soon
impressed by this fact. He realizes
how much more opera is part of the
life of the people than in any other
American community and how much
more enjoyable It Is than in New York,
without being as showy and expensive!
This is the result of time, the outcome
of years of musical education, because
New Orleans has cultivated a taste for
opera in the same way that New York
cultivates a taste for baseball and be
comes expert at it, because everybody
understands and appreciates it, pluto
crat and pauper, and more especially
because a large part of the population
understand and speak the language in
which the operas are sung. Opera in
New Orleans is generally given in
French, very rarely in Italian or Ger
man, and then only when the artists
cannot sing In French. As one-fourth
of the population of New Orleans
speak French in their ordinary inter
course, and more than half understand
that language, It is evident that the
opera must be a more popular institu
tion than in other American cities
where French is not understood, and to
a great majority of the audience the
performance is a perfect blank, except
the music.
"Opera in New Orleans is nearly a
hundred years old. Davis, a French
refugee from the massacre of San
| Domingo, went to Louisiana in 1790,
and soon after began giving theatri
cal and operatic performances, first
[Â¦in the old St. Philip-street Theater.
I afterward in the New Orleans-street
Opera-house. The first season in New
Orleans was in 1813, ninety-one years
ago. Since then, almost without ex
j ceptlon, New Orleans has had grand
opera every year. The Orleans The
ater, or was erected by
John Davis in 1816. The most fam
ous portions of the old edifice were
the ball and supper rooms connected
with the\ opera-house; indeed, the
parquet in the latter was frequently
floored over and occupied as a ball
room, thus furnishing:, when brilliant
ly lighted, in connection with the suite
adjoining, a coup d'oeil not to be sur
passed for effect In America. Those
were fiery days, when the New Or
leans Creole was very jealous of hla
honor and dj^nily and the slightest
impropriety called for an Interchange
of cards. The Orleans ballroom is
said to have been the origin of more
duels than any other edifice in the
World. '
"The audience was, in the â¢'earlier
days, almost exclusively French and
Creole, and in that ante-bellum period
social customs -were established -which
have clung to the opera ever since.
Patrons were required to be in full
evening dress. The grand operas of
Meyerbeer, Rossini, Mozart and others
of the old composers were required to
be performed in the most perfect de
taiL There were.* ho 'cuts* in the
score, and In order to give the full
opera. the- performance usually com
menced at 6 o'clock, closing at mid
night. In .those days the operaSi'as
almost the only form of social amuse
ment. Every family had its box^nd
the opera-house was always crowded;
but as the city grew larger and richer*
the Orleans Opera-house was consid
ered too small, and the present fine
building, the third generation of
opera-houses in New Orleans, was
erected , at Bourbon and Toulouse
streets. During the period of "nearly
I a century, almost every famous singer
'the. world has produced and almost
"A feature of the opera-house, com
mon enough in Europe, but not seen
in America outside of New Orleans,
are the loges grillees, or latticed boxes., ;
These are boxes, covered with latticed
windows in front which can be closed
if necessary- and are really small rooms
where one can have all the seclusion
one desires. They were originally in
tended for families in mourning. The
Creoles wear mourning for distant cous
ins, and for a long period. The conse
quence is that in the families so Inter
married one death will put? a score of
persons in mourning. While dressed
in black, they did not care to give up
the opera; so the loges grillees came
into use. Through them one could hear
the opera without being seen. This
practice, however, has long since pass
ed away, and the loges grillees are now
as fashionable as any other part of
the theater, and preferred by those who
like comfort mere than show.
"The opera-house is seen at its best
on Mardi Gras night, when 6000 to 8000
persons find room in the auditorium
and the various foyers. Then the house
presents an animated and brilliant
spectacle. Beautiful wome*nâ the vol
uptuous beauty of, the South â with
their gloric/us eyes, sit in the radiance
of the dazzling light, reflecting its own
splendor, while it seems as if all the
world had been robbed of its flowers,
eo profusely are the spoils scattered.
Yet brilliant as is the, opera night, the
scene is eclipsed by the grand carnival
balls which end the opera season and
usher in Lent. Then these same floors
are crowded with the same beautiful
women, still more gorgeously attired;
while mingling: with them are heroic
or grotesque figures, representative of
all climes, all eges, an epitome of his
tory and the world, as beautiful, as
fantastic. The . light, the Jewels, the
air heavy with perfumes and the odor
of the flowers, the passionate music â
all this recalls some Oriental feast
rather than a scene in prosaic twen
tieth century America.
"The strength of the opera in New
Orleans lies In the support it receives
from the public. It is regarded by the
people of New Orleans as part of one's
musical education, and ' children are
taken there to hear the music as soon
as they learn their notes. The humblest
wage-earner stints himself In order to
secure a<imlssion to the opera. But the
popular support is not sufficient to pay
expenses, and appeal has to be made to
the richer classes and the Opera Asso
ciation or Club. The boxes are sold as
far in advance as April, seven months
before the opera opens, to enable the
director to go to Europe and engage
artists. The French Opera Association,
with H. Laroussini, president, and G.
W. Nott, secretary and treasurer, is
the gTeat promoter of the opera in
New Orleans, and it is due to their un
tiring efforts that the opera has proven
a success. This association guarantees
against loss and runs the opera if no
manager is willing to undertake the re
sponsibility."
every opera of Importance has been
heard in New Orleans. On its stage,
too, the great Patti made her debut
and won her earliest laurels.

AN object lesson to rent payers: We are build-

Fifteenth aves. : 'the man for whom we are
building is aattafied to live in 3 rooms rather
than pay rent; the home ls small, but he
would rather manage In 3 rooms cf hie own
than to pay rrnt to the landlord for 6 rooms.
Why don't you follow this man's example?
It will mean a home to you. .We can rive

FLOW OF CALIFORNIA RIVERS.
When the British ship Eurasia left
â¢here December 13 che -was sound of
ppar and hull. She was bound for the
United Kingdom and seemed fit in
every respect for the long trip and in
condition under ordinary circumstances
to give a sood account oi herself In any
l:ind of battle the elements might offer.
â¢ She was still in good condition at 2:43
p. m. of December 21. when in latitude
ZZ 40 north, longitude 120 40 west, a
trusty, easterly wind about-faced and j
went roarinsf % in the opposite direction.
When the wind changed the Eurasia's
sails had to be shifted to conform with
tho new state of affairs. The order was
Klveh, the braces were manned and
â¢about 2:*0 p. m. the Eurasia's sailors
were haulins round the yards. There
was a eudden crash, and in less time
than it takes to tell the Eurasia's spar
ac.d canvas scheme was in a writhing
tangle. The vessel came limping back
to. port early yesterday morning, and
will have to undergo extensive repairs
aJeft and on deck before she rseumes
â¢&er voyage.
â¢ The origin of the trouble was the
carrying away cf the sling of the main
"'yiird. which snapped as the spar was
being hauled around. The rest of the
chapter reads like the story of the
' house that Jack built, inverted. The
of the sling left the main yard
' inn to obey the law of gravity. In its
downward flight it brought the lower
ard upper topsail yards, breaking the
-latter eps.r into two pieces. The tum
bling Epars smashed the lower cap and
â¢fell with damaging force against the
mainstay and foretopsail braces.
.The mainsail, lower topsail, up
per topsail. topgallant sail and
royal were ripped into rags, and
the whole tangled collection showered
in an avalanche to the deck, while the
terrified seamen hunted cover and in
fearful anticipation awaited other hard
ware showers from the other masts.
Clearing the wreckage was a terrible
task, to which the rolling of the ship
added tenfold. All the tangled gear had
to be thrown overboard, and when the
tack was completed Davy Jones' locker
had been equipped with a wholesale
supply of Junk, which included nearly
all the Eurasia's canvas^
' The bulwarks and rail were damaged,
the deckhouse injured and the main
pump put out of business in the tug-
Blng and tearing necessary to clear
Â«.way the wreckage. A survey showed
that the cap of the lower mast had
been broken and stays and rigging gen
erally bo badly strained that Captain
' Hughes followed his mate's advice and
put back to this port for repairs.
: Tn his report of his troubles Captain
Hughes makes no mention of the fact
that the liner Mariposa offered assist
ance, nor does he give any reason for
* his failure to acknowledge the steam
ship's signals. This seeming discour
' tesy on the part of the British skipper
?will probably receive some attention
at. the investigation which the under
" writers will make.

was reoorted efforts would be made to avert
hostilities in the Far East. There was con
siderable wheat here at the start for sale and
May was Hfe%c to lower at S6^ac to
S7c. A little support from the leading long sent
May up to 87Â©S7%c. but offerings were so lib
eral that the demand from this source was soon
satisfied and the market eased off again. Later
In the day the big bull operator became an open
seller and prices slumped badly, May declining
to 85'S,f}S5%c. The domestic situation was
mostly bearish, a large increase in visible sup
ply being expected for Monday. Covering by
shorts caused % better sentiment. May closed
at a6c.
Corn was comparatively firm early In the
day. due to small receipts and the poor quality
of the corn coming In. together with higher
Liverpool markets. May opened %c to *jc
lower at 47c to 47',4c. and after selling at 47%c
the price declined to 40% c, closing at 40~i<g47c.
Oats weakened along with wheat, but there
was not much enthusiasm on the short side,
for the reason that the big line held by the
leading long is still Intact. May opened MÂ«f5>

CORNâ The market Is apparently working
around into a firfner condition, as the dry
v.'tath2r In the San Joaquin Valley and SojthÂ«r.i
California has forced stock-raisers . during the
past week to feed Corn to their sheep and
cattle. At present they are using Western and
Inferior California Corn 1 , but /as soon as sup
plies of the latter ore exhausted they will be
compelled to feed No. 1 Corn. They are get
ting their Western Corn from Western points
direct, so this market is not being drawn upon.
But San Francisco Is affected by thin diversion
of the grain to stock feeding, for Corn which
otherwise would come here is being sent to
the grazing lands, hence receipts of domestic
product here are insignificant. The sltuatlcm
la therefore a very steady one.

There was no life In Apples or Pears. Stocks
of the latter were light, but Apples continued
abundant.
There was some little activity in the fruit
market during the early morning hours, but
trade was of much smaller volume than usual
on Saturday. During the greater part of the
day there was practically nothing doing, as
the cool weather continued to discourage buy
ers, and piicÂ«-s of all descriptions stood as
previously quoted. Tangerines and Manda
rins were the weakest descriptions in the Cit
rus line and dealers reported that It was Im
possible to effect salts, even at concessions.
The quotations for these descriptions are
largely nominal. Eight or ten cars of Oranges
will be auctioned to-morrow.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
NEW YORK. Jan. 9.â The cotton market
opened to-day with moderate activity at an
advance of 10C12 points. The volume of
business was small, but the market was-strong,
at one time showing a net advance of 26@J1
points, the opening prices being the lowest of
the session.

for cold storage.
The week closed on a very firm Butter mar
ket, stocks being greatly reduced and the de
mand good. Dealers made their own prlcei
and buyers were at a disadvantage. Some
sellers quoted 27c. but the largest handlers
did not advance their prices beyond 26c.
The depression in Cheese is becoming more
pronounced, and prices are %c lower again.
Stocks are away above the absorbing capacity
of the market. Receipts in 1003 were 6.206,356
Ib3. against 4.0S4.520 in 1002. Last year
Southern Oregon began' to produce Cheese in
large quantities and entered this market as an
active competitor for trade, and it is largely
from that source that the Increased supplies
in 1003 were received. From now on that
quarter will, be an important shipper to this
market. Cards are being sent out offering all
brands at lower quotations than those hereto
fore ruling.
Eggs are also lower and quiet, with receipts
and stocks elowly increasing and dealers mak
ing concessions to work off the goods. .Cold
storage descriptions, though almost cleaned
up. are qiloted lower, and store Eggs are now
being preferred to all others, owing to their
cheapness.
Receipts were 22.200 lbs Butter, 879 cases
Eggs arid 3300 lbs Cheese.

Poultry closed the week rather easy, al
though the market was pretty well cleaned up.
As usual on Saturday the receipts were very
light, but there was practically no demand, for
live chickens, as all retailers were well sup
plied with Western stock. A car of Western
came in, making the seventh for. the week, and
was held over lor Monday's market, when an
other car falls due. There was not much in
quiry for dressÂ«?d\Turkeys and the light receipts
were just about sufficient to satisfy the. de
mand. Nine cases .came in and sold at the
previously quoted rates. Game arrived freely
and fine large birds met with the usual Sat
urday demand at steady prices. Some dealers
who were liberally supplied were anxious to
ck-an up. and as a result several kinds were
quoted lower.

"Brazil coffe* in the New York market has
steadily advanced during the past month, be
ing fully lc per pound higher for the actual
article and about %c for futures. The volume
of business on the Exchange has been enor
mous, nearly 3,000.0<X> of bags during thÂ»
period mentioned, and whatever may be
thought of the present and prospective merits
of the position of actual Coffee, it Is clear that
the heavy speculative interest which has cen
tered in the article during the past three months
is a factor which will have its influence from
now on, apart from the natural law of supply
and demand. Cables regarding the present and
Browing crop continue unfavorable, the present
being estimated at 10.750.000 bags, and the
growing crop at about the same figures, or
rather less. Compared with the lowest point
of last fall, the advance amounts to 2^'t'itSc per
pound in that market. Coffees either than
Brazil (known as '"mild") have also appre
ciated In Drice, but have not followed Brazils
to the full extent.
"The local market has kept pace with the
movement in a central way. but operations
have been largely restricted by reason of the
lack of a complete assortment and business has
consequently b*en small h*re during December.
The present stock in first hands consists of
only 13. COO bags Central American and 6000
bags of other" kinds. Trading between second
hands, which was a feature at the time of our
lost review, has subsided, as their stocks have
also sold down to a point limiting further
transactions.

a further reduction proved of no" avail
until last October, when the California
Asphalt Sales Agency decided' to send
Its manager. John Baker,, to Chicago
to confer directly with the principals
of the railroads. Before the last nam
ed Baker squarely placed the griev
ances* of the California producers,
whom he represented as suffering
greatly from the disadvantages of com
petition â¢with the producers.
Evidence was shown the heads of the
railroad companies to prove that Cali
fornia was In reality the largest pro
ducer of asphalt and that with a rea
sonable rate to the East its product
could be placed In the markets on- a
fair footing with the material from the
South for use in paving and roofing,
the lining of reservoirs, the coating of
buildings, manufacturing of paints, for
Insulating, pipe dipping and a hundred
other purposes. The rate existing at
the time, it was explained to the rail
road officials, had made cimpetltion
ruinous and seriously threatened the
growing industry, .- 'â¢
Assurance was. given Baker that the
matter of a further reduction would re
ceive proper consideration, but the first
definite answer given to, the appeal: of
the California producers was inthe an:
nouncement made yesterday, that the
former $10 rate would be restored,on
