so' thoroughly that four of the men
were soon unconscious and it was with
the greatest difficulty that those most

Bartnett's return to this city was as
sudden as his going, but before he had
returned instructions had . been re
ceived from him in the East, calling his
purveyors in and ordering work along
the route of hi? surveys to cease. About
this time II. H. Yard, who was sur
veying a road up the Sacramento
Ttiver from Orovilie. in the direction of
Eusanville. paralleling for many miles
the route of the Western Pacific and
constantly anticipating the course
taken by the surveyors in the
employ of Bartnett, suddenly called
a halt in his operations and
the next thing the people of Northern
California knew Yard was piloting
Bartnett's superintendents over the ter
ritory through which the rival com
panies were planning to build. While
operations were at a standstill in the
Bartnett and Yard camps the South

porating a company for the Â»Ueged
Before Bartnett left for the East the
Southern Pacific Company's officials
displayed no end of uneasiness over his

suggestion that he was being backed
by the Goulds or VandcrblltK and

are many shrewd railroad men and
â¢ financier* in this city who will readily
give the story much credence. Among
the bankers of the city and. other men
of finance, who are constantly watch
ins new railroad enterprises, the fre
quent reports that the Western Pa
cific has the backing: of the Goulds or
Vanderbilts has been scoffed at and
many reasons given for their doubting
that either of these bis interests has
anything to do with Attorney Bart
nett and his mysterious undertaking.
In fact, the belief is common among
local financiers that the Western Pa
cific is simply a private enterprise,
having in view the completion of a
survey feasible for the construction of
a new road from the East to San Fran
cisco, attended with rights of way and
terminal facilitiesâ all of which the
Bartnett concern has already ob
tainedâ that might be offered for sale
to some of the ble transcontinental
railroad companies that have in view
direct connections with the port of
Kan Francisco. It is well known that
during his recent long visit to New
York City Attorney Bartnett was
closely watched by agents of the
Southern Pacific Company and other
railroads that have interests in the
West, with a view of learning, if pos
t,ib!e. Just what his financial relations
are.

of the Interests of the Western Pacific
with those of the Harriman lines may
be regarded as doubtful by many who

LONDON, April 15.â Only half the story of the Russian disaster at Port Arthur on Wednesday was; told in : ..the; dispatches that were given early publicity in St. ' Petersburg. Later bulletins, posted yesterday; announced
that the Russian torpedo-boat destroyer Bestrachni was cut off and sunk by the Japanese flotilla, forty-five officers raiiH) men going down with the vessel. To further. swell the list of disasters, it .was announced in St Petersburg
that the battleship Pobieda had struck a mine at the entrance to the harbor" and been badly damaged. The Russians insist that the Petropavlovsk was sunk and the Pobieda damaged. by Russian mines, which had been carried from
their station by a storm, and deny the Japanese claim that these vessels were torpedoed during a battle. In .'Great Britain public opinion seems disposed to /-accept the Tokici version. Emperor'Nicholas has appointed Admiral Skryd-

Black-rimmed obituary notices of
Makaroff appeared in all the news
papers. Up to late this' afternoon no
details had been published on the
losses, so- anxiety remained at its
height. Late last evening I telegraphed
to you that a report, said to come from
a high source, was to the effect that a
naval "battle had taken place, the Petro
pavlovsk "being torpedoed and other
ships damaged.
The cold, curt official dispatch seemed
to. give an absolute, denial to such an
idea, yet among the more intelligent
classes I find the same suggestion more
than ever to-day prevailing that there
was a great deal more behind the
scenes than announced and that the
truth has not been heard. Yet, appar
ently accepting the view that other
ships have been damaged, the Birjavaia
says there is still some of the fleet
left and the , triumph of, the Japanese
is 'only temporary, while, the Viedimostl

CYRIL'S INJURIES SEVERE.
The escape of Grand Duke Cyril and
Lieutenant von Kobe was nothing
short of miraculous. The force of the
explosion sent the Grand Duke Cyril
flying across the bridge and the base of
his skull j?truck an iron stanchion. For
tunately, he did not lose consciousness.
Believing that the ship was about to
sink, he clambered hastily down its
Kide and plunged boldly into the water.
He succeeded in reaching a piece of
wreckage, to which he clung. The
Cirand Duke was in water about
twenty minutes before he was picked
up by a torpedo-boat.
Lieutenant von Kcbe also was found
swimming and was picked up. Cap
tain Jakovlcff was hrown against a
stanchion with such force that he wa3
killed.
The remainder of the squadron im

boats and the torpedo-boats steamed as
quickly as possible to the rescue of the
survivors.

mine was responsible for the destruc

TOKIO, April 14.â A brief report from
Admiral Urtu of Wednesday's fighting
off Port Arthur reached the Navy De
partment this afternoon. It says Vice
Admiral Togo's fleet attacked Port Ar
thur in the morning and succeeded in
sinking a battleship of the-Petropav
lovsk class and one torrjedo-bo'at de
stroyer. The Japanese sustained no
losses. One Japanese was wounded.
The news was received with intense
satisfaction, but there was a note of
regret in the comment upon the death
of Admiral Makaroff, for the Russian
admiral commanded the respect of his

The Novoe Vremya to-day repro
duces a' lecture delivered by Admiral
Makaroff In 1894 on the subject of the
Victoria and Camperdown catastro
phe, in which he pointed out the In
herent weakness of battleships and
their liability to turn turtle, even
when their watertight compartments
The official bulletin this afternoon,
conveying the intelligence of the loss
of another torpedo-boat destroyer and
the accidental crippling of another bat
tleship, was almost as severe a blow
as the loss of the Petropavlovsk yes
terday and plunged the whole town
anew into grief.
The Russian word in the text of the
official dispatch describing the accident
to the Pobieda means either "mine"
or "torpedo," but the qualifying word
indicates something moving toward the
ship. This dispatch puts an end to
the idea prevailing here that there had
been an engagement following the dis
aster to the Petropavlovsk.
It Is considered remarkable here
that the Japanese did not take ad
vantage of this terrible accident to at
tack Port Arthur. Â¦ -
When the attention of this member
of the general staff was called to the
Japanese claim* that mines Â¦ had been
laid by their torpedo-boats, he remark
ed laconically:
*-I do not" believe It"
ADDS TO RUSSIAN GLOOM.
"The ship may have touched a mine
forward, under her Whltehead torpedo
magazine, resulting in a second explo
sion; or. if she touched the mine amid
ships, her boilers may have exploded.
Either hypothesis would account for
the appearance of fire, smoke or steam.
I consider it certain that the Petro
pavlovsk, as well as the Pobieda, struck
a mine laid to proteÂ«_: the entrance to
the channel. It is difficult to imagine
how the mines drifted, as they were
heavily weighted- The entrance to the
channel Is narrow, but It was known
to the commanders by the bearings.
It is possible the ships may have been
carried by a strong tide into the mine
fields."
The appearance of smoke or steam
and fire was explained by a member
of the general staff, who said:
There is a disposition to raise a con
troversy as to whether the explosion
occurred inside or outside the Petro
pavlovrk, similar to the controversy
which followed the destruction of the
United States battleship Maine In Ha
vana harbor. The fact that many of
the wounded, including Grand Duke
Cyril, were badly burned, seemed to
support the theory of an internal ex
plosion.
The first dispatch received from Rear
Admiral Grigorovltch, commandant at
Port Arthur, distinctly stated that the
ship struck a mine, but Rear Admiral
Prince Ouktomsky's telegram to-day
refers only to an explosion. 5
â¢Grand Duke Boris, who witnessed the
disaster from Golden Hill, In a tele
gram to his father. Grand Duke .Vladi
mir, describes how the ship lifted, at
the same time being enveloped in flame
and smoke, and then turned turtle and
sank in two and a half minutes. The
awful horror of the catastrophe can
mentally be reconstructed from the
brief description contained in this tele
gram.
Vassali Verestchagin, the Russian
painter, was Vice Admiral Makaroff's
guest on the Petropavlovsk. It is ru
mored that he was lost with the ship.
Nicholas Kravtchko, the well known
Russian literary man, who was acting
as correspondent for the Associated
Press at Port Arthur, went down with
the Petropavlovsk, it is believed. Tele
grams to him remain unanswered.

Â¦The exact number of Vice Admiral
MaJtarofTs staff on board the Petro
pavlovsk when she sank is unknown,
but it is thought by the Admiralty to
be probably fifteen or sixteen. The
exact number of the crew lost also is
unknown. The Petropavlovsk had a
complement of about 650. of which fif
ty-two were saved, at last accounts.

GERMANY NOT NEUTRAL.
Hcit Bebel Refers to Sale of Auxiliary
Cruisers to Russia.
BERLIN, April 14. â In the Reich
stag to-day Herr Bebel, the Socialist
leader, declared the Socialists did not
object to Chancellor von Bulow's
declaration of neutrality and the lo
calization, of the war in the Far East,
but Germany's neutrality was not
above doubt. He referred to the Ham
burg-American Steamship Company's
sale of the steamship Fuerst Bismarck
to a Russian company and asked
whether the Foreign Office permitted
the sale, as he assumed was the case,
since the directors of the company
were 'cautious men, who would not
conjure up a conflict with the German,
Government. !'"',".
The steamship was an auxiliary?
cruiser of the German navy at the
time of the outbreak of the war, hence
her sale was all the more astonishing.
Herr Bebel added that it was assert
ed also that the German steamship
Kaiser Friedrich had been sold to Rus
sia. Such sales, however, could ~onlyÂ«
accomplish Indirectly the reinforcement
of the Russian navy.
"We," said Herr Bebel, "must ener
getically protest against such a pro
ceeding. - The world is filled with tin
der material. One spark- can set the
world ablaze. I therefore ask the
Chancellor what he thinks of these
sales and the resulting damage to Ja
pan and the advantage to Russia?" â¢
lt Is stated to-day that General Alt
vater is dead. He is supposed to have
committed suicide. Meanwhile instruc
tions had been flashed to the Polish
frontier to have the seven batteries
sent with the utmost haste to the seat
of war. â¢' ' ; .
On Saturday last an urgent telegram
was received from Kuropatkin, asking
where the light artillery batteries were,
upon the good services of which he had
built high expectations in aiding him
to win the campaign.
According to the story, General Alt
vater was summoned to the presence
of the Emperor and asked whether the
guns had been sent as stated. The un
fortunate officer, after a painful scene,
acknowledged that he had disobeyed
orders. ::-.*. ti-
EYDTKUHNEN, April 14.â A well in
formed gentleman coming directly from
St. Petersburg and passing through
here to-day told me a very curious
and interesting piece of news which
was told to him by a highly placed
artillery officer in the Russian - capital
as being much talked of and causing
a lively sensation in official circles, j
. It appears that when matters began
to look serious, toward autumn of last
year, it was discovered that, while well
supplied in other respects, the Russian
army was particularly short on light
mounted artillery and it was neces
sary to supply the defect forthwith.
As it was known here that the French
army not long ago adopted a new light
artillery field gun, Russia's ally was
applied to and volunteered to supply
seven batteries. These were duly de
livered at St. Petersburg to General
Altvater, who, in the absence of Grand
Duke Michael, who was invalided at
Cannes, was acting commander in chief
of artillery. This officer, like nearly
everybody els% there, was convinced
that war with the Japanese was out
of the question, and, artillery of the
kind sent by the French being badly
needed by the army occupying the Pol
ish frontier, it was sent thither.
Having Disobeyed Orders.
Russian Officer Gives His Life for
SUICIDE FOLLOWS BLUNDER.
It is believed by naval and military
men here that Russia, cannot recover
from yesterday's disaster, in time to
effer successful resistance , to Japan's
landing programme in Manchuria. It
is thought that Admiral Togo will fol
low up the advantage which either
good fortune or good seamanship haa
given him by further offensive opera
tions. Meanwhile a j portion . of his
Heel, comprising more than forty ves
sels, will cover the debarkation of
large forces in Manchuria.
Big events are not expected in the
vicinity of the Yalu until the Man
churian campaign begins. It ... is re
garded as certain that the Japanese,
unless the Russians voluntarily withr
draw into the interior, will not attempt
to cross the Yalu in great force until
such a movement can be made to syn
chronize with operations -in the Rus
sian rear. The fact that the Japanese
are ostentatiously-, reporting the land
ing of war correspondents at Chemulpo
is deemed suggestive of the likelihood
that a blow will shortly fall elsewhere
than- in Northern Korea. It is well to
note that the^British military attache
and also a number. of war correspon
dents are not with the army in Korea,
but are remaining behind, apparently
in order to accompany the headquar
ters staff to Manchuria.
It has been asserted - from Japanese
sources here "that- the 'attack on the
Russian Port Arthur, fleet of yester
day morning was planned and put Into
effect in the following manner: -At
daylight the Japanese', torpedo-boata
made a demonstration before, the port

The first person to hear of Makaroff 's
"death was his' widow,' who, received a
private telegram. She was on her way
to 'St. Petersburg to '* see the admiral's
.brother, an officer of the guards, when
the Emperor's ' aide-de-camp' reached
her residence at Peterhof with the mes
sage, from his ' Majesty ' breaking the
news and condoling with her. The ad
miral's brother-, returned- with her to
Pfiterhof. She vras so prostrated with
grief that she took to ; her bed. It Is
reported by those who'. w'ent' to see the
widow that. they found the whole town
talking of nothing ".else" but; the loss of
iheir beloved : , Stepan Â¦ Osipovlch (the
patronymic of , Makaroff)., \The admir

When the service was finished the
Emperor personally raised the stricken,
widow and kissed her hand. Then for
several minutes he spoke % to her con
solingly, also shaking hands with her
daughter and son. ' -
The Dress is authoritatively informed
that the dispatches given out last night
were in the text as originally received
and represented the sum total of the
Emperor's advices. The Emperor him
self directed that every word should
be published. The meagerness of the
telegrams is attributed to the death of
Vice Admiral Makaroff. Not until 10
o'clock this morning had fr.esh news
reached the Winter- Palace, and then
in the , form of a "voluminous cipher
telegram, which was immediacy sent
to the Admiralty to be deciphered.
In the opinion of the Emperor's ad
visers the . Petropavlovsk disaster oc
curred yesterday morning at about 7
o'clock. It is presumed that Vice Ad
miral Makaroff had sailed out from
Port Arthur on the previous day to lo
cate the enemy, giving pursuit until
the Japanese reinforcements appeared
and. then putting back for the shelter
of the guns of Port Arthur. This ex- v
plains the second sentence in Rear Ad
miral Grigorovitch's telegram, "Our
squadron was under Golden Hill."
From private advices it is, learned
that Grand Duke Boris 'was standing
on Golden Hill watching his brother's
ship when the catastrophe occurred.
'When the rector prayed for "Stepan
and all the warriors who died for their

ST. PETERSBURG, April 14. â The
Emperor's choice of a successor to the
late Vice Admiral Makaroff as com
mander in chief of the Russian naval
forces in the Far East has fallen upon
Vice Admiral Skrydloff, whom he ap
pointed this evening, telegraphing h 4 m
to go' direct" from Sebastopol, where he
la in command of the Black Sea fleet,
to Port Arthur, and assume command
there. x [ ,\ ][
Next to Vice Admiral Makaroff, Vice
AUmlral Skrydloff Is the most popu
lar man of this generation in the Rus
sian navy. He is considered a very
able sailor and strategist, but the tools
at his disposal will be few in compari
son with those In the hands of the
enemy, and it is feared he will be un
able to accomplish much.
A requiem mass for the repose of the
souls of Admiral Makaroff and the
other offlcers and men of the Petro
pavlovsk was celebrated to-day in the
Admiralty Church here.
The scene was touching in the ex
treme. Outside 20,000 persons, among
whom were* many relatives c-f the sail
ors lost, stood with bared heads and
streaming eyes, while the service was
in progress. Inside the beautiful white
marble church, its walls hung with
militant tokens, were assembled the
Emperor and the imperial family, high
officers of the army and navy and the
entire diplqmatic corps, all in full uni
form, and many widows and families
of the offlcers drowned. The galleries
were crowded with Russian bluejack
ets. The widow of Vice Admiral Maka
roff entered on the arm of the Grand
Duke Constantine. followed by her son
and daughter, and took a place. beside
the Imperial party. Every one present
wore a band of crepe.
The Emperor, who wore the uniform
of a captain in the navy, entered last
and alone. The grief felt by him was
written on his face. The Empress was
not present-
Just' before the service began the
Dowager Empress embraced? Admiral
Makaroff 's widow, who sank on ' her
knees, almost at the feet of her Maj
esty, and remained there until the end
of the service. y
The St. Petersburg correspondent, of
the Echo de Paris says that it Is be
lieved that Viceroy Alexieff. who islo
temporarily command the Russian fleet
at Port Arthur, will hoist his flag on
the battleship PeresvieL
The correspondent says that the bat
tleships Sevastopol and Peresviet are in
good order; that the repairs to the bat
tleships Retvizan and Cesarevitch and
the cruiser Pallada are almost com
pleted, and that the cruisers Novik,
Askold, Diana and possibly the Bayan.
as well as the gunboats Bobr and
Otvashnl and about a score of torpedo
boat destroyers and torpedo boats, are
in good order. .
Minister of Marine Pelletan has sent
the following telegram to Vice Admiral
Avollan, chief of the Russian ad
miralty:
"We are greatly grieved by the ter
rible calamity of which we have
learned. The French navy sends to the
Russian navy profound feelings of
sympathy for the death of so many
brave men, and for the loss of the great
admiral, who leaves a glorious memory
in the history of the Russian navy and
in the science of naval warfare. VVe
tender our congratulations that the
Grand Duke Cyril escaped death."
Similar messages of sympathy are
being sent to Russian officials % by
numerous bodies throughout France.
President Loubet to-day telegraphed
to Emperor Nicholas his profound con
dolences on the disaster to the Petro
pavlovsk and the death of Vice Ad
miral Makaroff. This dispatch, togeth
er with those of Emperor William and
the King of Italy, sent to-day, is re
garded here as significant of the ac
ceptance of the European governments
that the sinking of the Petropavlovsk
was due to an accident, and did not oc
cur during a battle with the Japanese
ships. The officials say condolence over
the result of a battle might involve
questions of neutrality, whereas condo-
Jences .over, an accident do not involve
neutrality/. . . , . ., * ,
Prior to the sending of Loubets.tele
gram the . French embassy at St
Petersburg had received an official as
surance that the accident was due to
the Petropavlovsk striking a mine,
which had become loosened from its
moorings during the recent storm.
Some special dispatches received here
assert that the Japanese torpedoed the
Petropavlovsk, but the officials accept
the Russian version of the sinking of
the battleship. . o *
A dispatch to the Temps from St.
Petersburg says:
"The causes of the .catastrophe at
Port Arthur are limited to two hypoth
esesâa submerged Russian mine or an
explosion on board the Petropavlovsk.
All the victims are badly burned, and
the catastrophe was complete within
one minute and a half.
"The fleet remaining at Port Arthur
is reduced to a strictly defense basis.
- "The commander of the Cesarevitch
perished on the Petropavlovsk before
he had assumed command of the bat
tleship." I ,"â¢â¢_'': , ."." â
The gala performance of Rigolette
was given to-night by Sarah Bernhardt
and Raoul Gunsbourg In aid of Grand
Duchess Vladimir's hospital train. It
was an immense success, the receipts
exceeding $15,000.
"I learn that a firm opinion prevails
in naval circles, based on telegrams
from the surviving officers, that the
loss of the Petropavlovsk and the in
juries to the Pobieda were caused by
torpedoes launched by the Japanese
and by submarine vessels. Hitherto " it
has not been believed that the Jap
anese had any submarine boats, but it
is now admitted that such boats might
have been received with the cruisers
bought from Argentina and brought
out from Genoa by English crews. It
is difficult to verify this, but the ad
miralty is of the opinion that the
cruiser brought out two submarine
vessels."
PARIS, April 15.â The St. Petersburg
correspondent of the Echo de Paris,
under this rooming's date, sends the
following: -*",;'.
"Though it has yet to be determined
whether the floating mine was . Rus
sia's or Japan's, the probability is that
it was one set by the defenders which
the currents or the pressure of melt
ing ice had driven into the fairway.
The loss to the Russian fleet is consid
erable, but almost insignificant in com
parison with that occasic-ned by the
death of Admiral Makaroff, who. In hi3
brief command, had already' infused
new life into the forces he led."
A Vienna correspondent of a German
agency has interviewed the Japanese
and Chinese Ministers in that capital
and obtained from them a declaration
that all reports as to an understand
ing between their respective countries
for acting in concert against the Rus
sians are unfounded. The Chinese
forces on the frontier are merely in
observation. The Chinese Minister fur
ther stated that foreign intervention
between Russia and Japan was not
Improbable and that the hostilities
thereby might be brought to a close
sooner than is generally believed. All
that was required of Russia was that
she rencmnce all claims to Korea, and
of Japan that she recognize Russian
sovereignty in Manchuria. Â¦;Â¦%'â¢
A well known naval critic. Count
Redenglow, in this evening's Tageblatt
says:
Able experts are beginning to be of
the opinion that floating mines are an
unsatisfactory means of defense. The
present war. has shown on two occa
sions that they may be equally danger
ous to both belligerents.
BERLIN, April 14.â To-night It was
stated on good authority that the Czar
will leave for the seat of war, but
nothing Is known of any such Inten
tion at the German Foreign Office.
The catastrophe to the Fetropavlovsk
has created a tremendous sensation
here and full details are eagerly await
ed. The Lokal Anzefger's Paris cor
respondent sends the Herald dis
patch that the Petropavlovsk was tor
pedoed, but the other journals still
stick to the mine theory.

\\TiUe a controversy is being: waged as to whether Japan or Providence was responsible for the de
struction of the Petropavlovsk and the damaging of .the Pobieda, there can be no doubt as to the agency of
the thtrd disaster of Wednesday's series. This was the sinking or the Russian torpedo-boat ( destroyer Bes

officers and men aboard the Bestrachnl only five were saved. 'Â¦Â¦ ,
Some of the; naval officers in St. Petersburg are lncllnmg to the theory that the Japanese fleet is ac
companied by submarine vessels. .V-- V ;
Vice Admiral Skrydloff, who ranked next to Maknroft* in the confidence of the Russian Government
and people, has been chosen to, succeed the; late commander of the Port Arthur fleet. -
It* is reported that Admiral Togo, following the catastrophes to the Russian ships on Wednesday,
succeeded 'in effectually^ blocking the channel at Port Arthur by sinking merchant vessels; also that Port
"Arthur has been cut off 'on the land side by the destruction of a bridge on the Manchuria n Railroad.
From Berlin comes the assertion that the Russian Emperor will proceed at once to the seat of war.
Disasters are not coining singly to the Russian naval forces in tlie Far. Kast. Following the loss of
the battleship Petropavlovsk, the Pobieda, another magnificent tiRhtinz craft, struck a mine or was torpedoed

In front of the Palace \ Hotel a lone
hack opposed the. many automobiles
which had been pressed into service,
and though the driver had little call for
his services, owing to the fact that he
was barred from accepting calls from
the carriage company, he maintained
his vigil on top'of his vehicle through

At the* ferry some unpleasantness
and a great deal of Inconvenience to
the public was. caused by the lockout.
The Dolice would not accord the auto

STABLEMEN ! ALSO FIRM. â_
The Stable and Carriage Owners'
Association also held a meeting last
night and were equally, firm in their
determination hot to yield to the de
mands of the Hackmen's Union. The
stablemen declare that the "fight could
not have come in a time more propi
tious for them, they asserting that this
is the dull season for carriage work,
inasmuch as the families whiph are
the most regular patrons of . their ve
hicles are now hieing themselves to the
country. Many of the members of the
association will turn their horses out
to pasture pending a settlement of the
existing difficulties.
There were several humorous turns
the union and the decision to fight the
issue to a finish was unanimous.
Should both sides remain . firm in
their attitudes a situation not unlike
that which recently prevailed in Chi
cago during the strike of hack drivers,
when the dead were with] the greatest
difficulty conveyed to the cemeteries,
may confront San Francisco. ->.
.At the meeting of the hackmen It
was decided that , hacks will - be fur
nished for funerals, but in no case will
a union ntember mount a hearse or
handle any article belonging to the
undertakers; and. those hacks which
are to be provided for funerals are to
be those only which belong to union
members. The retaliatory action of
the hackmen bodes Inconvenience to
the public wjiere the burial of the dead
is concerned. -
The question of permitting members
of the union to return to work under
stated conditions was discussed for
some flme. It was finally decided that
such permission would not be granted
unless the employer in question should
concede all the terms of the hackmen's
schedule. A special. committee was ap
pointed to take charge of the fight and
represent the union in all matters at
issue, with the understanding that it is
powerless to grant or accept conces
sions without the consent of the union.
The members voted to advise ', the
public that the present issue is neither
a strike nor a boycott, but a lockout,
forced upon them by their employers
because of their demand for a better
wage. The demands of the union are
for $2 50 a day for all .members .regu
larly or steadily engaged or employed.
Ten hours in twelve to constitute a
day, and that they be compensated at
the rate of 25 cents an hour or any
fraction thereof for all overtime; ' that
no member of Hackmen's Union, Local
224, furnish his uniform or, whip at his
own expense: that all extra drivers
when engaged for one day shall receive
the sum of $3, a day's work to consti
tute ;the same as appears [ above and
the same conditions for overtime; that
all extra drivers receive $1 50 for driv
ing all inside funerals, and for all out
side funerals, including wait at train
or electric car, drivers shall receive $2;
that all extra drivers when engaged to
drive short hauls shall receive the sum
of $1 50, and that the service of the
driver is at the disposal of the employ
er, for, the space of five hours for. the
performance of the work herein named.
The wage schedule proposed by the union
would give an increase of 5 and 10 per cent
to about one-fourth of the United Railroads'
employes. There are about 1400 men now in
the 27V4-cent class and their wages would, of
course, remain as they are now.
The statement also deals with all
the other phases of the situation which
have been more or less before the pub
lic since the first differences over the
arbitration award threatened a breach
between the United Railroads and the
Carmen's Union. It is issued as a re
ply to the recent statement of Manager
Chapman.
A great deal ofc misapprehension exists in the
public mind regarding the wages the carmen
receive. It is commonly supposed that all
the men work ten hours a .flay and conse
quently receive $2 75. $2 65 or $2 50 a day, ac
cording to thHr rating as 27^, 2t>',4 or 25
cents-an-hour men. It Is trufi that' they would
receive the amounts specified If they worked
ten hours a day. but .the exigencies* of the
street railroad service do not make It practica
ble toy employ every man a llko number of
hours. ' At the present time platform men' on
the United Railroads work from two to ten
hours a day. consequently they earn from
53 cents to %2 75 a day. according to their rat-
Ing and the number of hours employed:,
The lower wage specified â 55 cents â Is earned
by what are termed "trippers," that Is. men
who operate a car for a limited number of
trips. There arc a number of men whose day's
earnings frequently amount to only 55 cents,
and others earr*. but $1 20 a day. . Aside from
the "trippers" the men work from eight to
ten hours a day.

"Trades unionism Is rapidly becoming a mat
ter of business, and that employer who fails
to give the same careful .attention Â¦Â¦Â¦ to the
question of his relation ! to .his labor or his
employes which he gives to the other factors
which enter Into the conduct of his business,
makes a mistake, which sooner or later he
will be obliged to correct. In this, as In other

TRENTON, N.J., April 14.â -After
snowing under the' followers of Wil
liam R. Hearst, the New Jersey,
Democratic State Convention this
afternoon" selected a delegation that
will favor Judge Parker for < the
Democratic Presidential nomination.
The delegation was not instructed, but
the Parker forces succeeded in putting
through " a unit rule resolution, and,
as they have a majority of delegates,
the vote of New Jersey will be cast for
the New York jurist.
When the convention adjourned
there were pending before It two reso
lutions, one indorsing former Presi
dent Cleveland and the other Indors
ing Parker. The majority sentiment
of the convention, however, was that
as long as the unit rule was to be en
forced no further action should be
taken. Rather than vote on either the
Parker or the Cleveland resolutions
the convention adjourned.
The sentiment of the State at pres
ent Is undoubtedly for Parker.
. It: was manifest early in the day
that the Hearst forces would not cut
much of a figure. The announcement
last night by Hearst's agents that a
contesting delegation would be sent to
St. Louis and that another convention
would be held to-day in Masonic. Hall
did not meet with the approval of the
Democrats who reside in New Jersey
and who were fighting for Hearst.
They are willing to fight to the limit
for Hearst, but they were not willing
to bolt their party for him and some
of them were hot this morning when
they read, of the plans of the Hearst
agents.
The Hearst men bolted their party's
action and held a "rump" convention
of their own and elected four dele
gates at large, but accepted the dis
trict delegates chosen by the regular
convention. ">

At the offices of the United Rail
roads it was stated that there was no
change in the situation so far as the
company was concerned, and that the
stand taken by that corporation was
unalterable. Reticence and optimism
pervaded the offices of the com
pany, where It was intimated that
an amicable settlement would un
! dovibtedly be the outcome of the sit
i uation. despite the fact that the cora
1 pany does not intend making conces
1 sions. To this view the officials of the
union, however, were not inclined.
The report of concessions to be made
by the union, which emanated from
the offices of the United Railroads,
was not confirmed by the carmen.
It Is understood, however, that the
conference to-day may deal with
That the controversy between the
United Railroads and the Carmen's
Union is nearing a crisis was evidenced
yesterday in a statement given out by
the latter concerning the justice of
the stand taken by the carmen, in
which, ad in former statements. It is
averred that the United Railroads Is
seeking to checkmate the union by in
sisting on concessions at variance with
the agreements of the arbitration
boards findings, and that the union
purposes to press its demands.
Previous to the Issuance of the
statement, which comprises some 8000
words and which reviews the street
car situation from the time of the
award to the present, there was a con
ference at the headQuarters of the Car
men's Union between President Cor
nelius and W. D. Mahon of Detroit,
president of the Amalgamated Associa
tion of Street and Electric Railway
Employes. The situation was reviewed
in detail, but it was not stated what
action. If any of a definite nature, waa
decided upon.
There is to be a conference this
morning at the offices of the United
Railroads between President Cornelius
and Secretary J. H. Bowling of the
Carmen's Union and the representa
tives of the United Railroads, at which
the union men will ask the company
to concede the demands affecting the
rights' of Individual members of the
union employed by the United Rail
roads, as promulgated by the Car
men's Union some time ago. The re
vival of this issue as one of the main
contentions of the carmen, and its em
phatic inclusion In the statement
given out yesterday as one of the lead
ing grievances, is regarded as signifl
' cant In view of the determined atti
tude of the company on the other con
cessions demanded by Its employes.
WILL. CONFER TO-DAY*. â¢
No restriction whatever Is placed upon the
company In selecting Its men. But, " says the
company, there Is an indirect restriction â the
section requires men to become members of
the union within, sixty days, and If the union
refuted in accept these men. or any of them.
It would, in effect, be exercising a veto power
on the company's selection. Strictly speaking,
that is technically true, but, as a matter of
fact, the raisins of such an objection. In view
of the exigencies and necessities of the street
csr service, is really begging the question.
Men do not act without motive, and no con
ceivable motive could exist that would induce
the street car men's union to refuse to admit
lo membership a "steady, sober and trust
worthy" man. such an Mr. Holland declares
It to bs the duty of his company to select to
operate It* cars. The reason for this is simple
and Is well known to Mr. Holland and Mr.
Chapman. In the street car service there are
two general classes of platform men â regulars
and extrac
The regular men. of course, have steady em
ployment and their number Is limited to the
precise requirements of the service. The, ex
tra men <in which class all new men >are
placed, graduating therefrom to regulars ac
cording to seniority of service) do not re
ceive steady employment, but. in order to In
sure having en hand a sufficient number of
men at all times to properly man ltsÂ» cars,
the company limits the number of extra men
tso as to guarantee to each of them a minimum
amount of work, which Is always sufficient
to Insure a man a living. These extra men
are aligned to work dally by the company's
officials. Neither the union nor Its officers
have or claim any voice either In the selection
of mÂ»n or in placing them at work.
The only difference between the union's de
mand regarding the payment of suspended men
for lost time In event of their reinstatement
and the regulation now In force is an addi
tion to the exUtlng section providing that men
who may bo reinstated by the board of arbi
tration provided for In the new agreement
shall be paid tor time lost during the period
of suspension. The present rule Is that men
reinstated by the company, when found by
the corporation's officials to be innocent/ of
charge* of violation of rules of Â¦ the company.'
shall be paid their usual wages for the time
lost through suspension. The union requests
that thÂ« same rule apply when men are rein
stated by the arbitration board. .
QUOTE ANTHRACITE DECISION.
In the course of the statement the
carmen quote from the decision of the
Anthracite Coal Commission as fol
lows:
"The claim of the worker that he has the
same right. to Join with his fellows In forming
an organization, through Â¦ which to bo: repre
sented, that the stockholder of the corporation
has to join othero in forming the corporation,'
and' to be i represented by Its. directors : and
other officers. â¢ seems to be thoroughly wÂ«(l
founded, not only in ethics but under, economic
considerations. Some employers say. to their
employes: *WÂ« do not object to your Joining
the union,' but we* will not recognize your
union nor deal with < It, as representing you.'
If the union Is to be rendered impotent;- and
its usefulnesses to be nullified by refusing .to
permit It to perform the functions for which it
REGARDING RESTRICTIONS.
After dealing with the question of
union recognition and the hostile atti
tude, as the union puts it, of Manager
Chapman to that body since the de
cision of Arbitrator Straus," the state
ment continues:
The major grievance of the union man Is the
fact that the non-union man is a constant and
grave menace to the life of the union Itself,
and, following as a matter of course, becomes
the instrument by which the employer may
take from the union man all that he has se
cured through his organization. Knowing this
to be true, and knowing that the policy being
pursued by the United Railroad" will, if carried
to itÂ« logical conclusion. Inevitably result In the
disruption of th*lr union â leaving their wages
and hours at the mercy of the corporation's
managers â the carmen again ask that the
I'nltrd Railroads give their organization bona
fide recognition â the recognition provided for
In sections 1 and 8 of the agreement presented
by '.hem. ' .
Manager Chapman and President Holland.
e*pÂ»clally the former, are opposed to the union
on what probably they are pleased to Imagine
"principle."' and they affect to believe that to
agree to the arbitration plan would be to take
a long step In the direction of establishing the
"union shop" system In the United Railroads
service.
These are a few of the reasons why the
union asks that an arbitration board be pro
vided for. in order that an unprejudiced and
disinterested party might pass upon the merits
of complaints of unjust discharge or dismissal.
The company. In refusing to accede to this
request. Insists that to grant It would mean a
surrender of Us Inherent right as an employer
to hire and discharge whom it pleased.
The union, again fortified by experience of
the last two years, contends that. In practice,
the arbitration system proposed would not de
prive the company of the right of hiring and
discharging whom it pleadedâ provided, the
company's officials acted In good faith with
the employes and were guided by the rudi
mentary principles of justice In passing on
cliorzes aralnxt the mpn.
WOULD NOT HURT COMPANY.
The essence of ths company's objection to
the arbitration proposition and the clausa re
quiring employes, after sixty days' service, to
Join the union is that compliance with these
clauses involves a surrender of the employer's
"right to manage his own business," and par
ticularly denies the employer the "right of
selection and dismissal."
As a matter of fact, the clauses embracing
these matters are, after all, the most Im
portant, both to the company and to the car
men, and among citizens generally there is
probably a greater degree of Interest centered
en the disposition of these sections than any
other feature of the entire controversy, con
sequently it is important that the. reasons for
the incorporation of these sections In the agree
ment submitted by the Carmen's Union be
fully understood, and the underlying motive
of the company's objections thoroughly an
alyzad.
< With respect to the arbitration proposltioo
submitted by the union, the situation Is this:
The custom at present Is for men who have
been suspended or discharged on charges that
are not justified by facts to report the matter
t,o the executive board or the president-business
agent of the union, who Investigate the case,
and. If satisfied that an Injustice has been
done the accused, the business agent brings
the care before the general manager of the
company and requests investigation of the
accused employe's defense and a reversal of
the order of discharge or suspension. In the
United Railroads service there are from ten
to twelve cases a week of this nature, ami
two years' experience has convinced the men
that the system at present in operation to
provide redress in cases of arbitrary and un
just dismissal or discharge is a failure, hence
the effort to establish a more certain methoti
of dealing out exact Justice to the employes.
Time after time employes have been suf
per.ded or summarily dismissed. Â«and the formal
charges made against them could have been
coccluslvely proven to be unfounded In truth
if tbe company's - officials would have con
sidered the evidence of the Innocence of the
accused brought forward. Again, .men who
were active in union afTalrs have been singled
out for severe discipline on what In many
lCFtances were the flimsiest of pretexts, and
efforts to obtain Justice from the company's
officials failed absolutely. During the last
year five members of the executive board of
the Carmen's Union were discharged on what
their fellow-employes believe to have beÂ«n
trumped-up cherges. To make. In open meet
ing of the Carmen's Union, charges of unta'.r
treatment against a division superintendent or
other official, to criticize the policy or rules
of the company in matters pertaining solely
to the conditions governing employment, has.
time and again, thanks to the operation of
the "Intelligence bureau" maintained by the
company, resulted in the ultimate discharge
of the man who had the temerity to speak
the truth as he saw It. latterly It has been
declared a capital offense for men to request
new employes to join the union, and. in one
Instance, twenty-two men were called before
a division superintendent and told that they
must stop "talking unionism" to new men or
suffer discharge.
Regarding the demand for the in
auguration of a system whereby em
ployes will "receive adequate protec
tion from dismissal on unjust
grounds," the statement says:
points other than those affecting the
individual rights of the men.
After referring to the proposal is
sued by the United Railroads, which
sets forth the agreement the company
desires should become operative after

Manager Chapman spent some time
last evening in] digesting -the address
given out by the Carmen's UniorC In
a statement in behalf of the United
Railroads, which was issued from the
offices of the company: at a late hour
last night, Manager. Chapman declares
the union to have Â¦'intentionally mis
represented the'- situation -In order to
mislead the public. He says:
that character of service: but the public does
not know of the \ constant >nagglng I to wtalcn
this company has been subjected.
This whole thing palls upon me. as it must
upon the, public. We P 'are^ tired of hearing,
"Give us all we ask and, you can have peace,
and "If you don't give us all Â¦ we ask. Â¦ then
you are trying* to disrupt our. union."
Thirty-seven â¢ days were - consumed In taking
testimony for the- arbitration proceedings.
Every possible detail was entered Into with
the most painstaking care by. both sides. Elab
orate investigations were made and recorded.
Witnesses ' were brought from distant cities,
and then, â¢ with -much pains, briefs were pre
pared and attorneys dispatched Â¦", to New York
to argue the questions lnvotved. , Three days
were consumed In argument, the, carmen's at
torney having the opening and closing. The
arbiters took the case under consideration for
some weeks. . and finally the award giving the
present scale was made public on November 3,
100.1 â about five months ago.
As we have said, the only reason stated In
the award for increasing the already nigh rat*
of wages paid by this company was the plain
ly expressed desire on the part of Mr. , Straus
to secure prolonged Industrial peace, . and In
harmony with that award we have offered to
continue ths award under the broadest and
moat liberal construction.

watched I wrote him twice afterward, bat
these letters were dictated by Burns after-he
had taken me before the Secretary of the In
tenor and I had niade my confession.; The first
Burn* letter was sent on November C, 1903. It
was unsigned and was as follows:

HARLAN WARNS- BENSON
In March. 1JÂ«O3, I wrote Benson that Special
Agent H. E. Steece and- Judce A. B. Pugh
had made a report, of- which I was trying to
get a copy. I said he ought to'- send me J5W.
This he did, and I received three envtlopes,
two of which contained $200 in currency each,
while the third had $100 In it. Â¦ All were sent
to "R. I. Smith." No 'letter accompanied
them. I tried to get a copy of the report from
Steece but he paid no attention to my letter.
Tne.fact that the Interior Department was
Investigating the land frauds was first brought
to my attention late In 1902. when I heard of
the letter of Colonel Zabriskle of-Tucson. Ariz.,
anti the Holzinger- report â¢- regarding J. H.
Schneider's, unsworn â¢ .Â¦ About -No
vember, 19&?, I wrote Benson that the report
had been submitted and told him what I had
learned regarding Holzinger's . assertion that
Schneider had made a . statement that Hyde
and Benson were getting- possession of State
school lands by fraudulent menns and were
using them for lieu land selections. - I also told
him that Walter K. Slack was reported to have
made a statement. '' ' '
McEnorney smiled incredulously and
kept up his fire of mild-spoken, merci
less questions until Heney came to the
rescue of the humiliated official..
"Mr. McEnerney,'! said the Govern
ment counsel, "this witness was called
to the stand by you, but permit me to
suggest that the constitution of the
United States prohibits the infliction of
cruel and unusual punishment."
McEnerney acknowledged the point,
and forthwith dropped his attack on
the witness. After, a few general ques
tions Harlan was ' turned over to the
prosecution fnr~cross-examination. In
answer to Heney's questions the fol
lowing testimony was given:
Did not Burns tell you to asx $1000 for the
stenographer's notes, because. If.- you named
only $500. Benson might - accept and thus de
feat the real purpose of your visit, which was
to draw Benson out?
I do not remember. s*
Did not J.- J. Barnes receive drafts from
Hyde Inclosed' In 6omÂ» of the "dear sir"
letterj?
I cannot say as to that. I recall that Ben
son seemed to know him and spoke of him as
"poor old Barnes." * -
ft. I. Smith waÂ« my son-in-law. He got the
first letter from Benson to me and opened It.
I told him that the money was sent me in
relation to matters In which I did not care to
be known, hence I had used his name and
address. â¢Â¦ .. Â¦'
*nd mopped his brow. But the agony
dt his long and humiliating ordeal, was
not yet over. ' In answer to further ques
tions by McEnerney. he said that this
attempt 'to trap: Benson by the sug
gestion of a purchasable stenographer
-was undertaken Jat Burns' suggestion.
The secret service man wanted to get
information from Benson as to other
persons in the department who had
been in his pay, and thought this plan
might lead him to disclose his hand.
"I didn't like the job," the witness
continued. "It was contrary to my
nature to try to sell a man something
I could not deliver." . - -

I took as* many as forty non-mineral affi

was - often : there. ; too. \ and * Fred 'â¢ English/ the
chief- clerk of the- local land office, came in
occasionally.. Â¦_'.' - Â¦ -:,
This ended the grilling; of Harlan.
McEnerney next called another Gov
ernment witness, Walter K. .Slack, the
San Francisco land attorney, who was
before the Federal Grand Jury at
Washington. . Heney did not cross
examine him. "Not a single new fact
was brought out, the witness mere
ly telling that he had been a
clerk In Fred A. Hyde's office dur
ing the years from 1899 and 1902,
describing the routine of the office
work, and. denying that he had knowl
edge of any crooked work in land mat
ters. Benson and Hyde had a Joint
account, he said, ' for the Oregon
school "lands, which they owned in
partnership. As' to their other oper
ations they contributed base lands In
equal shares when making applica
tions for lieu selections. The witness
could not remember that any forged
Instruments were used \ in obtaining
title to these school lands. , Dimond
had been In the office for several
months while Slack was there, but
the witness had not discussed office
matters with him. -
AFFIDAVIT FACTORY AGAIN.
Then. came Charles Augustus John
son, formerly office boy to Hyde.
Charles Augustus was another of the
San Franciscans who got a free trip,
to Washington at the expense . . of
Uncle SÂ£.m, in order that the . Grand
Jury of the District of Columbia might
have the benefit - of their : testimony.
He was called yesterday by McEner
ney and apparently had no hesitation
in telling all he knew. His story fol
lows: .
â¢ I am 18 years old and am now employed in
the Southern â¢ Pacific Company's train
dispatcher's office. I was Hyde's offlce-boy
for Hftcen months ending January. . 1902.
Among my Â¦ duties' I had to carry deeds, affi
davits and powers of attorneys. to the notaries.
Generally 'I did not read them. -.The notaries
employed were Thomas S. Burns. Henry'. P.
Tricou: Harry J.Lask. John Lyons afld Frank
i Ford. / , Â¦Â¦ , , .-./ ...Â¦: :..-' .--Â¦:â¢ â¢Â¦
.Going back to his* meeting with Ben
son in May, 1902, witness asserted that
Benson then tol4 him of an agent- in
Washington who was employed to. for
ward the Hyde-Benson, lieu. selections
and whom he wanted Harlan to meet.
This evidence is important because of
Valk's testimony that the defendant,
Henry P. Dimond, had come to Wash
ington shortly before the date named
with a car & of Introduction from Ben
son, saying Dimond was his agent and
"all right." Harlan's story was as fol
lows: Â¦ / .'. * â¢ .-._ . â¢ Â¦â¢. . :;Â¦
Benson said he had an agent- who had desk
room ' in the office of Brltton & Gray, the
Washington land attorneys, and that he. want
ed me to meet him. I declined, .saying . I narl.
no desire to deal with more than one t man.
Then he told- me that- this agent was then in
the bathroom adjoining and that if I would
step into the clothes closet he would let him
out. . I entered the closet and closed the door.
Irt a minute I heard some one come out of
the bathroom and go Into the hall. \
No. Benson did not tell me whether his
agent; was Dimond or not. He did not say.
whether the acent was man. ; woman or child.
TWO WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED
YESTERDAY AT THE' HEARING IN
THE LAND FRAUD CASES.
BUItGLARS VISIT SALOON'.â Conor Mur
phy, who, conducts a grocery and saloon at
020 Howard utreet. reported to the police yes
terday morning that durlns the night
the premises were entered and eight bottles of
whisky stolen. Entrance- was effected by w t
breaking; a show window. : " t :
As the box was needed for identifica
tion by the witnesses and all the ex
hibits in the Dunning case are locked
up in the vault in Judge Cook's court,
the Judge alone haying the combina
tion, a dispatch was sent to him by the
District Attorney at his ranch in Glen
Ellen asking him to telephone the com
bination to the clerk of his court so
that the box could be procured. The
Judge sent a reply that he would not
permit t^ exhibits to be withdrawn
till after sentence had been passed upon
the defendant on Saturday, when they
will be open for. inspection. Meantime
the preliminary examination may be
proceeded with.
But three witnesses were examined
yeEterday, and their evidence was the
same as given at the recent trial in
Judge Cook's court. They were Mrs.
Lizzie L. Kemp, who was a clerk in
the postofflce at Dover and saw the
package on Its arrival on the evening
of August 9. 1898: Harry C. Pennlng
ton. who called at the postoffice and
took the package from his grand
father's box. handed it to Mrs. Dun
ning while she was seated on the front
porch and ate some of the candy, and
Miss Josephine Bateman, who hap
.pened to pass the Pennlngton home
while Mrs. Dunning. Mrs. Deane and
the others were eating the candy. Miss
Bateman ate one of the caramels,
which made her very sick.
The cross-examination of the wit
nesses was long and tedious and bore
chiefly upon their memory of other
things that happened at that time.
Nothing new was elicited.
EXHIBITS LOCKED UP.
The proceedings in the preliminary
hearing on the charge of murdering
Mrs. Deane by sending a box of poi
soned candy to Mrs. Dunning to Dover,
Del., in August, 189S, were opened by
Attorney Clark's interposing six objec
tions to the hearing. They were in ef
fect that it was not shown by the com
plaint that any offense had been com
mitted against the State of California;
that the complaint did not state facts
sufficient to constitute a public offense;
that the court had no Jurisdiction to
examine the defendant; that the com
plaint was sworn to on information
and hellef ; that no crime known to- the
law of this State was charged, and that
the Justices' Court of this city and
county was neither a court of law nor
of fact to entitle it to pass on the case.
The objections were overruled. v
WITNESSES ARE EXAMINED.
As soon as the case was called Mrs.
Botkin pulled out her handkerchief and
leaning her left elbow on the table cov
ered thÂ° greater portion of her face
with the handkerchief. She remained
in that position throughout the pro
ceedings. Once or twice when the wit
nesses were describing the symptoms
that preceded the dying of Mrs. Dun
ning and her sister, Mrs. Ida Henrietta
Deane, the prisoner trembled and
buried her face in the handkerchief.
The nubile seems to have lost interest
in the case.
HIDES HER FEATURES.
The attorney of her choice, Reese
Clark, awaited his client's arrival, and
attorney and client at once entered
upon an animated conversation. . Her
sister, Mrs. UobartF, took a seat beside
her and Attorney Charles J. Heggerty
joined them and took part in the con
versation till the Judge, who had tem
porarily adjourned court, had taken
his seat o,n the bench, where he was
Joined by Police Judge Mogan.
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin has apparently
recovered from the shock that pros
trated her after hearing the verdict of
the jury in Judge Cook's court last
Thursday night. That verdict convict
ed her of the murder of Mrs. Elizabeth
Dunning and fixed the penalty at im
prisonment for life. When the prisoner,
entered Police Judge Conlan's court
yesterday morning, accompanied by
Deputy Sheriff Frank Johnston, she did
rnji lean upon him, and there was no
uncertaJnty in her step as she walked
to her chair.
Mr. West drew from her on cross
examination the admission that when
she took passage on the steamer she
was a strong, healthy woman, but that
after the assault she became the phy
sical wreck that she now is. She said
further that she and her. husband, A.
H. Ames, had entered suit. against the
steamship company to recover $25,000
damages for injuries growing out of
the assault.
Then Mr. West asked: "Did not
Bert Schlesinger, your attorney, advise
you that It is necessary to convict this
defendant in order to .win - your suit
against the steamship company?"
"No," sir," replied the witness. And
she added that nobody else h ad so ad
vised her. . .
Mrs. Ames, who appeared to be very
weak and delicate, testified in a
straightforward manner regarding the
allegations in the Indictment. She said
that at the time of the assault she wa3
collapsed "with seasickness and that
Davis caught her, by the throat and
threatened, to choke her should she
make any outcry.
MRS. AMES UNPROTECTED.
Laws was "night saloon man"
on the night of October 15. His testi
mony was that there was no steward
ess on board the Alliance and that it
was hi3 duty to attend upon the .male
and female passengers alike.' He de
scribed, Mrs. Ames as suffering from
seasickness and told how she had. her
three children, the oldest not quite five
years old at the time and the youngest
about 5 four months old. in her state
room. /He responded to the -bell call
several times during fhe evening to
help her to cold water. At- half. past
eleven at night Davis, who was a
waiter, was in the saloon with Laws
when the bell rang, again and Davis
volunteered to answer itj Upon his
return- from Mrs. Ames' stateroom, he
admitted to the witness that he had
assaulted Mrs. Ames. On the next
morning Mrs. Ames summoned Laws
and informed him that Davis had
grossly insulted her. - -
Laws testified also that Davis left
the ship at Eureka, and at that place
repeated his confession In a barroom.

But two witnesses were examined,
Howard W. Laws and Mrs. Emma
Ames, and the court adjourned until
10 o'clock this morning.
Thomas 'Davis was placed on .trial
yesterday before a jury in the United
States Circuit Court 5n a charge; of

Consideration of a new church build

receiving into the fold two bright
young Chinese comprised some of the
vork done yesterday at the annual
meeting of tho California presbytery of
the Cumberland Presbyterian church.
Rev. J. N. Crawford, the moderator,
and a large delegation met before 9
o'clock in the morning at Devisadero
Hall, and tho bufinrss of the meeting
began immediately after devotion.
Rev. W. J. Fisher, pastor of the First
Cumberland Church of. this city, in
(-â¢peaking of the new church which is to

the California presbytery for the prep
aration for the ministry-
TEUJ3 It EM ARK AlU^E STORY.
Their examination was interesting.
Chan Horn in demonrtratinsr his knowl
edge of the faith that he has embraced
told a story of persistence in banish
ing from his heart all belief in idolatry.
He told how he had defied the threats
of his family and the warnings of those
dear to him. and in spite of every ob-
Ftarle had determined to follow and ul
timately preach the gospel of Christ.
Chan Ht-rn had given up a lucrative
business and. in full knowledge of the
trouble and labor and meager pecu
niary reward that would come, to him
in the future, he persisted in studying
for the, Christian ministry, for in that
way alone ho saw his chance to re
form sore \X his countrymen in his
native land.
He related the horror of his rela
tives In this city when he returned
.to them minus his queue. They real
ized that he was lost to Confucius and
turned him from their door.
He? Pong has evinced the same de
termination to foliow the Gospel and
crave an upright account -f himself.
Kong hopes to benefit his countrymen
spiritually when It shall please the
presbytery to license him as a minister
under Us Jurisdiction.
An X-ray skiagraph showed that the
nail had caught in a bronchial tube
close to the heart and between that
organ and the spine. To reach the nail
from .the outside through the back It
would be necessary to cut the lung.
The record of previous cases ' where
this was done has shown failure in
each Instance. â¢.
A curved piece of steel was prepared
for insertion into' the windpipe to
reach the nail. By touching the piece
of steel to the magnet the steel also
became strongly magnetized. The wind
pipe was opened and the curved piece
of steel jwas carefully pushed down,
and the current was turned on.: In
stantly a distinct click could be heard
from the inside. - -With great care the
steel was withdrawn, and there, cling
ing to the lower end, was .the nail.

. BURNS HAD A SCHEME.
Before I left Benson asked me:" "Don't you
want lo sro to the bathroom?" *l'.nid t "yta,"
and on going there found four $50 gprtrcertifl
cates lying on the washstand. {. put these in
my pocket. Returning to the 1 other, room, I
told Benscn that I thought - he was being
watchrd and that I had seen a man In the
hotel lobby down stairs, n who looked -like
Burns, the treasury detective.
"Don't you think it may be dangerous ' for
you to come here?" Benson asked me. ,
"Oh. no," I answered; "I guÂ»ss It wasn't
Burns, but only some one who resembled him."
When 1 cot down to the lobby, where Burns
was waiting for me all the tlme.l went with
him to the Ebbitt House, where he Introduced
me to Chief J. E. Wilkle of the Secret Service.
We then counted â¢ the notes Benson had given
me and WUkie and I put our Initials on them.
"In reality you were not . dealing
with any stenographer when you made
this proposition to Benson, were you?",
McEnernoy asked\ Huavely. ' Â¦, - *
HARLAN VISITS BATHROOM.
By "pictures" I understood that he meant
$100 bills. The next afternoon. December IS,
I. eaw Benson at the Willani and he asked
me what 1 had been able to get out of ! '.he
stenographer since my call the day before.
I said the stenographer was not Inclined to
talk much, but that he had told me the
names of some persons whose statements be
fore the committee he bad taken down in
shorthand. These were J. J. Barnes, Herbert
Clarke. Duncan McNee. Miss Glover, Walter
K. Slack. Joost II. 8chnelder and othersâ
nearly all persons who had been connected
with Hyde or employed in his office. - Benson
then ' uald that as the stenographer's notes
related to Hyde more than to himself he
didn't see why he should pay for what might
have no value to him. He proposes to do
nothing about buying the copy, until after bis
return- to California. I urged- that he ought
to close the deal with the â¢' stenographer at
ore*, but he put the matter oft^and nothing
ever came of it.
Then McEnerney questioned Harlan
as to his last Interviews with Benson,
which the witness said . occurred on
December 17 and 18, 1903. These were
just after the visit of December 16,
which Special Examiner Valk testified
he paid to Benson by direction of Wil
liam J.' Burns, the secret service man,
who was then working up the case
against the alleged land grabbers and
who had already forced confessions
from both Harlan and Valk. The story
told by Harlan yesterday was In sub
stance as follows:
On December 17 .last, at the request cf
Burns. 1 called on Benson at his room. No. 'J13,
in the new Wlllard Hotel. I told him about
the Investigation of. the land frauds then in
progresu and suggested that I was acquainted
with the stenographer who was tailing- the
statements of the persons examined and that
this stenccrapher was anxious to make some
money. He wanted $1000. I told Benson, for
writing out the evidence In the Government'*
hand*, but would read his notes to Benson
for $500. - Benson did not make any final
reply to my proposition that day, but he
a>k<'<! particularly a.Â« to the confession of J.
J. Barnes, a land office clerk, who had charge
of the Â£tate school land -records In Division G.
He told me to call again the next day for a
luUer conversation; he was Just then leaving
Washington for a hurried trip to New YorU.
"How are you oft for pictures?" he asked
me. as 1 was quitting his room. I answered
that I was pretty short.
"So am I." he said, "but when I get back
from N"ew York to-morrow I shall be belter
supplied and when you call I will give you
two pictures.") r . Â¦ . Â¦'
PLAX TO TRAP BEXSOX.
I told him all about the plans of the de
partment for the creation of the San Francisco
Mountains reservation In Arizona â how the
Secretary of the Interior had agreed with the
railway company and many smaller owners
t-> consolidate a number of "mall reserves with
in* lntervenlnK territory Into one Immense
reservation. BensonXfald I was too elow,
ae |ie had already received much of the same
Information through hliÂ» attorney*, Brltton &
Cray of Washington, who were al*o attorneys
for some of the owners of the base lands that
wculd be included In the new reservation. But
he went downstairs and on coming back he
told me I rhould find something on the bed
as I went out. and I found an envelope con
taining a $50 note.
Woodford D. Harlan, formerly chief
of division P (forest reserves) In the
General Land Office, was recalled at
the opening of the day's session and
questioned by Garret W. McEnerney,
Hyde's attorney, as, to the details of
his alleged relations with John A. Ben
son. The witness declared that Ben
son had told him that the partnership
formerly existing between himself and
F. A. Hyde had been dissolved. Har
lan's interviews and correspondence
with Benson were recounted, together
with the advance information which
his official position had enabled him to
furnish the veteran "scripper" regard
ing the Interior Department's plans
for new forest reserves in California,
Oregon and Arizona. For these secrets
of the Land Office Benson had prom
ised to pay "a reasonable compensa
tion," and accordingly, from time to
time, currency was sent, as agreed, to
B. I. Smith at Tacoma Park, Washing
ton, â¢ D. C. Smith was the witness*
son-in-law, and turned the letters over
to him. Up to May, 1902, $450 had been
jeceived in this way; $500 was paid be
tween that date and December, 1903.
when* Benson's final payment of $200
was madeâ a total of $1150.
Regarding his interview with Ben
son at the time of the latter's visit to
Washington in May, 1902, Harlan said:
Harlan's testimony abounded in sen
sations, and they did not end when he
left the stand. After he had told in de
tail of his alleged dealings with Ben
son in the interest of fraudulent land"
operations, he was followed by Charles
Augustus Johnson, formerly employed
In Fred A. Hyde's office. The retired
office boy corroborated the startling
testimony of Mrs. Belle A. Curtis and
Miss Marion Doyle, former stenogra
phers in the office, as to the manufac
ture of affidavits, deeds and other legal
papers , by accommodating notaries
public, who are said to have kindly af
lixed their jurats and acknowledgments
without seeing the signers of. the in
struments. Johnson was one of the
messengers who carried the papers to
the notaries, and he told all about the
matter. His testimony, with that of the
two women named, is likely to cost the
notaries their offices.
SOLD OFFICIAL. -, SECRETS.
The spectators who thronged to the
great land fraud hearing yesterday, be
fore United States Commissioner Hea
cock .were presented with' a study in
human nature. Woodford D. Harlan, a
veteran official from the Interior De
partment at Washington, had con
fessed that for a few hundred dollars
he.. violated his oath of .'office and sold
Government secrets to men now under
indictment for using that information
in an alleged conspiracy to defraud
the- public* Garret McEnerney, attor
ney for -these defendants, who had
called Harlan to the stand, probed
deeper and deeper into this narrative
of dishonor until the aged witness, pro
fessedly seeking to make such repara
tion as he might, broke into tears and
for very shame turned to the Govern
ment side for protection from the re
lentless rain of questions. "Whether or
not the spectators believed, the story
Harlan was telling in his effort to save
himself from punishment, it was a pit
iable spectacle, and it provoked Fran
cis J. Heney, counsel for the prosecu
tion, to a unique bon mot. "It is un
constitutional." he said, ' "to inflict
cruel and unusual punishment, for
crime."

STOCKTON, April 14.â Ira Saunders,
a well-known and prominent farmer of
Roberts Island, and his wife and child
were held up to-night by a robber on
French Camp road two miles south of
this,city. . Saunders. is now in the hos

. Saunders and his wife came to the
city this evening" and . started for home
after, nightfall. They, had. driven v but ;a

out in the road and^ brandishing a pis
tol demanded . that the farmer get out
of the vehicle and hand over his money.

and was !,' going : through . his . pockets
when he noticed that his wife had 'also

also grabbed the robber's hat as" the

purpose of building a road from Chico
to Stirling,: paralleling the, road of the
Diamond Match Company, but the ink
on the incorporation papers had barely
dried before it was discovered that the
Southern Pacific Company had gobbled
up the Diamond Match Company's road
and then leased it to the latter con
cern. Â¦
Since then. Yard and Bartnett have
had frequent conferences In this city
and have seemingly been on the best
of. terms, a condition that did not exist
a few months before, when Bartnett's
surveyors were daily abusing Yard's en
terprise and .striving in every manner
to shut him qut of the territory north
of Sacramento. Lately surveyors of
the Southern Pacific Company, when
ever the weather would \ permit, have
been operating? in Nevada westward
toward Beckwith Pass and at points in
the Sacramento Valley in the neighbor
hood of the .route of the Yard and
Bartnett surveys. . '
The fact â¢ that Yard and Bartnett
were peacefully resting on their oar3
while the Southern Pacific Company,
was maneuvering over their routes has
frequently/of late. ' caused comment.
The fact that Bartnett's pay drafts
were being cashed in the bank at Win

the Southern Pacific Company's repre

strengthen the â¢ suspicion that Bart

Because of the necessity of repair

of the turrets of the Missouri. The

builds these turrets, for some time has
been working on: the problem of ; de
signing j a turret . that will prevent ; the
communication of .flame from the top
of the turret, where the gun -; crews
stand, to the handling room, where
the ammunition converges from the
magazine at the : foot of the Â¦ ammuni

solution has been reached. : As ex
plained by one of the senior naval con
structors, what is desired is some
means of : automatically opening and
closing the large hole in- the floor of
the turret through which the ammuni

It would be a comparatively easy
task for the Harriman syndicate to
build north from the main line of the
Central Pacific in Nevada, through
the Beckwith Pass and thence in a
southwesterly direction to Stirling
or even to Oroville.by way of which
the main line of the company would
be reached and traffic extended to this
city. While Attorney Bartnett and
H.H. Yard. decline to make known
their future plans, â the report from
Reno will greatly strengthen the per
vailing opinion among ' local financiers
that they are dealing .with the offi
cials of the Southern Pacific Company,
with a view of turning over their
rights of way and, surveys to that cor
poration.
Harriman long ago began to regard
the pass as the only solution for over
coming the heavy grade3 of the Sierras
other than constructing an expensive
tunnel through the mountains. Collis
P. Huntingdon admitted his mistake in
not going out of California by way of
the Beckwith Pass. Harriman realized
the need of getting control of a section
of the pass, and there is a growing sus

LETTER FROM PRESIDENT.
WASHINGTON. April 14.â Upon his
arrival at the Navy Department to
day Secretary Moody gave orders that
arrangements be made for the trans
portation of the bodies of all the offi
cers and men killed on the battleship
Missouri yesterday. If it is found there
is no fund available for this purpose
a request will be made on Congress for
a* special appropriation.
Senor Quesada, the Cuban Minister,

"The Board of Admiralty desires to
express its sympathy and condolence
on the occasion of the gun accident
on board the Missouri, and their great
regret over the loss of life of officers
and men."
The President has contributed the
sum of $100 and the Secretary of the
Navy a like sum as the neuclus of a
fund for the relief of the dependent
next of kin of the enlisted men who
lost their lives in the disaster on the
Missouri- The money has been placed
in the hands of Paymaster General
Harris, U. S. N., chief of the Bureau
of Supplies and Accounts, who has
been constituted the custodian of the
fund and who will disburse it under
the direction of the Bureau of Navi

TRANSPORTATION FOR DEAD.
PENSACOLA, Flo., April 14.â That
the newest battleship of the navy, the
Missouri, had a narrow escape from
being blown to pieces by the explosion
of a magazine,. and also beached, came
to light, to-day.
Captain William S. Cowles prevented
the latter when the vessel was within
850 yards of the beach by giving or
ders that the ship's course be changed.
Chief Gunner's Mate Monson saved the
ship and the lives of over 600 men by
Jumping into the open magazine, and
closing the door behind him. It is
stated, although not by officers of the
Missouri, that when the officers heard
the explosion in the turret and saw the
tire lapping through the top they real
ized that the magazine would next ex
plode and headed the ship for the
beach, intending to beacli her if pos
sible before the explosion. Captain
Cowles quickly stopped . the plan and
put the ship back to sea.
When the first explosion occurred in
the turret the men in the handling
room knew in an instant what had oc
curred. The big magazine door was
open and standing against it were four
charges of powder. Without a mo
ment's hesitation Gunner's Mate Mon
son shoved these aside and, jumping
into the magazine, pulled the door
closed after him.
The magazines were totally flooded
with" water and when the men opened
the door they found Monson barely
alive, the water having reached to hid
neck.
The damage to the taattleship is much
greater than was stated at first. In
addition to the large amount of am
munition ruined by the magazine being
flooded, which will amount to thou
sands of dollars, the after turret isÂ»
badly injured, the top being burned
away and all brasswork melted inside.
The hoist is a charred mass and the
mechanism of the guns is completely
ruined. The estimated damage caused
by the explosion will reach $50,000. The
total list of dead now numbers thirty
two, one man having expired last night
and two to-day. It is hardly probable
that other deaths will occur. O. B.
Mof, apprentice, second class; J. F.
Knight, seaman; J. L. Donnelly, or
dinary seaman, were : added to the
death list.
-'The funeral of seventeen of the sea
men occurred this afternoon and each
ship of the fleet was represented, while
thousands of persons from the city
were in attendance, every place of bus
iness being closed for the afternoon
and flags on all buildings placed at
half mast.
The bodies of the officers and eight
of the ship's men were shipped to their
former homes to-night, and the others
are being held to await advices from
relatives. The bodies interred this after
noon will be disinterred and shipped to
relatives and friends. ThÂ» Missouri
will not conclude her target practice,
but will go to New York to* be docked
as soon as the court of inquiry makes
its findings.

j 1118 Broadway, April 14.
Helpless and alone, awaiting the slow
approach of death by starvation, Mrs.
John, Carter, proprietor of a little res
taurant in Haywards, 'was found Tues
day evening by Deputy Sheriff Sim
monas lying on a cot in the rear room
of her establishment, where she had
lain- for four days without food. So
weak was the woman . from lack of
nourishment' that she was unable to
notify the neighbors of her plight. .
Mrs. Carter was suffering from ery
sipelas and had she been left without
aid but a few hours longer would cer
tainly have perished. - .
The attention of the officer was first
called to the case by Mrs. Peter Jack
son, who notified him that Mrs. Carter
had not been seen about the restaurant
for several days. Simmonds found the
restaurant front door locked and was
obliged to force his way into the place.
Mrs. Carterrwas in the rear room and
so weak 4 that she did not recognize
either Mrs. Johnson or the officer.
Dr. Alexander, was called and ad
vised that the woman be removed to
the County Infirmary. She was taken
there yesterday afternoon, but was in
such a critical condition that the doc
tors hold out little hope for her recov
ery. Mrs. Carter is nearly 50 years of
age and has lived in Haywards for ten
years. She was' deserted by her hus
band in 1892 and has two sons, who
lived with her in Haywards for some
time, but have since gone away.

OAKLAND, April 14.â The new bell
tower at Mills College was dedicated
to-day, and the fact that it is the only
one on the continent makes the event
.one of impressive interest. Hundreds
of people from near and far were pres
ent at the dedicatory services, at Lisser
Hall and at the tower.
â¢ The chime of bells which has been
given a final resting place in the tower
is of historic importance. The bells
were sent by a Cincinnati firm to the
World's Fair at Chicago, and being pur
chased by M. H. de Toung were brought
to California for the Midwinter Fair.
David Hewes, a brother of Mrs. Le
land Stanford, bought the bells and
presented them to Mills College, where
they have reposed for .several years,
earning from the students the nick
name "the silent ten."
But they are silent no longer, for
Mrs. F. M. Smith, at an expense of al
most $10,000, has just completed a most
artistic bell tower, which will be a last
ing monument, to her generosity. The
tower is of : old mission architecture
and is built of solid concrete. The door
came from the old â¢ mission at "Mon
terey. Being the gift of a woman and
dedicated to the higher education of
women, it was fitting that a woman
should furnish the architectural design,
a work most admirably done by Miss
Julia Morgan. . '
The greater part of the dedicatory
exercises took place in Lisser Hall, and
at the conclusion of Rev. C. R. Brown's
address the crowd formed Into proces
sion and, led by the students, wended
its way to El Campanil, as the bell
tower has been named. There the dedi
catory prayer was repeated -by Rev. E.
E. Baker; after which the chimes rang
out In patriotic tunes under the skillful
manipulation of Wallace A. Sabin. .
The programme for the afternoon was
as follows:
Organ prelude, Wallace A. v Sabin; in
vocation, Rev. Raymond' C. Brooks;
psalm one hundred â¢ and ' fifty; hymn,
"Joy to the World"; statement by Mrs.
C. T. Mills; address, "Belfry and Bells
â Their Story,- Meaning and Message,"
F. M. Damon of Honolulu; ode by Miss
Julia- Tolma'h Lee, read by Miss F. B.
de" Forest; | address, /Rev. Charles R.
Brown ; organ postlude, ; Miss Zueletta
Geery; dedicatory prayer at the Cam
panil, Rev. E. E. Baker, D. D.; chime
of bells, played by Wallace A. Sabin.
During the course of his remarks Dr.
Brown announced that the trustees of
Mills College had decided to raise the
endowment fund to :. $1,000,000 and that
already more than $42,000 of f the $100,000
which they intend to raise every year
has been subscribed. George W. Scott
gave the first $10,000 and Edward Cole
man the second: $10,000. The Mills
Alumnae Association gave . $21,800,
which, together with f- numerous small
sums ' of $10 Â¦ and $20, has started the
endowment fund well on its way. The
finance committee .which has this mat
ter, in charge includes George T. Haw
ley, F. M. Smith, Captain Charles Nel
son and A; J. Ralston." Mrs. '-.Mills' and
Professor Lisser have been appointed, a
committee ' on \ sub-committees, "J and
,Rev.' E. : E. Baker, Rev. R. C. Brooks
and Rev. C. R." Brown constitute a com
mittee on -endowment literature.
This afternoon a reception will be
held at the Franklin Grammar School
in the newly decorated hall, that is at
once the pride of the California Club,
led by Mrs. J. W. Orr, chairman of the
department of education, and of the
Board of Education. Here are four
bare walls transformed into a pleasing
meeting-roorti, with tinted walls, cur
tains, pictures and plaques of artistic
worth placed therein, thus opening up
a work of practical worth in cultivat
ing in children the sense of artistic
values. This work is in practical oper
ation in New York, Boston, Detroit and
other progressive cities, therefore is the
California Club, and Mrs. Orr in par
ticular, to be congratulated for lifting
San Francisco into the vanguard of
progression. Between the hours of 2
and 5 o'clock to-day the public is in
vited to visit the school, when the Cali
fornia Club will receive,, assisted by
Mr. Faulkner, principal of the school;
Mr." Langdon, Superintendent of
Schools., and members of the Board of
Education.
To-night the Entre Nous Club will
give its last cotillon of the season in
the ballroom at the Palace Hotel. A
delightful dance is anticipated, and It
Is whispered abroad that many stun
ning toilettes will be worn.
On the return of the happy pair from
their post-nuptial trip a reception will
be given at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Wayte in honor of the young folks. The
future home of Mr. and Mrs. Whitmore
will, of course, be in Oxnard, v where are
Mr. Whitmore's interests.
A large number of invitations were
issued to the church, but only relatives
and close friends were bidden to the
reception at the home of the bride, at
2529 Van Ness avenue.
Mr. Whitmore is a clever newspaper
man, conducting the paper at Oxnard.
He is well known on the Stanford
campus, from which university he took
his degree.
St. Luke's Church was the scene last
night of an exceptionally pretty wed
ding ceremony, when Miss May Eliza
beth Wayte, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Walter John Wayte, became the bride
of Charles Abbott Whitmore of Oxnard.
The bride, a chic little maid with nut
brown hair, looked charming in her
wedding robe of white chiffon cloth,
with a voluminous veil enveloping her
petite figure. She was attended by
Mrs. Brooks as matron of honor, who
also was smartly gowned in white
cloth.

He predicted greater things for the
city, and stated that he felt the united
action of the various associations would
in the future, as in the past, lead San
Francisco onward to the goal of great
er commercial supremacy than that
experienced at any time in the past.
Hon. M. J. Hynes, Public Adminis
trator, rendered several vocal selec
tions, after which Abe Ruef was called
upon to respond to the toast, "Benefits
of Organization." He made an able
address, saying that the California
Liquor Dealers' Association was or
ganized by men who expected the trade
and liquor traffic of San Francisco,
men who are willing to observe the
law. "There are those," he said, "who
would reform the world without first,
reforming themselves, who complain
against this organization, but I con
sider that the better line of citizens
understand that dealing in liquor calls
for no condemnation, but rather for
respect."
Sana Braunhart spoke for the Board
of Supervisors. The gathering . was
voted a pleasant affair by the 200
members and guests present.
The third annual banquet oU lh,e
California Liquor Dealers' AssocPUion
was held in the maple room p or the
Palace Hotel last evening. When: the
guests filed in, P. \r. Weniger took
his seat at the head of the table with
Mayor Schmitz to his left and Pres
ident Thomas H. Lindsay to his right.
After a selection from the orchestra.
Mr. Lindsay, the newly elected presi
dent of the association, responded to
the call for a toast.
He told of the efforts of the associa
tion to further good citizenship and ex
plained why liquor dealers, paying a
license of $260,000 a year, should be
treated with the same consideration as
men engaged in other lines of busi
ness. Mr. Lindsay was followed by
Frank W. Thompson, \\ho entertained
the assembled guests for fifteen min
utes with comic selections.
"The Lost Chord" deserved and re
ceived abundant applause. Chairman
Weniger then introduced . Mayor
Schmitz, who spoke of the efforts of
associations to further the interests of
San Francisco, and dwelt In particu
lar upon the work of the liquor deal
ers to build up the city. Mayor Schmitz
stated that he believed that the liquor
dealers of the city and county of San
Francisco were a body of men who had
the interests of the people at heart
and that their efforts were directed to
ward the advance of business enter
prise.

Concerning her speculating propensi
ties the detectives learned that once
Miss Heald lost $1500 during a period
of absence from home. Realizing that
this tendency might have overcome her
sister again. Mrs. Blancnard inquired
as to her relative's bank account and
found that no money had been drawn
since March 2. Among her checks was
one dated February 19. and reading,
"Pay to sister, Mrs. Blanchard, the
balance of my acco-unt." Miss Heald
had a balance of $564 in bank. She
had declared Wiat this should go to
her sister in the event anything should
happen- But Mrs. Blanchard had re
fused to accept that disposition.
So far as the police can learn, Miss
Heald departed without taking any
money with her. Moreover, the woman
left home in a light gingham dress
without overwrap.
The nature of her investments has
never been revealed to Mrs. Blanch
ard, who has been much mystified by
her sister's conduct. But this does not
tend to clear the peculiar color of ap
parent effort to shroud herself in
death's garb that has been Riven Miss
Heald's disappearance by the strange
letter sent to the anxious sister. De
tectives Quifrley and Kyte, after care
ful investigation, have satisfied them
selves that Miss Heald wrote the mes
sage which was signed "Mrs. William
Raymond," and purported to tell of
the drowning at the foot of B street
of a woman closely resembling Miss
Heald. The police have searched the
neighborhood of B street and the mud
Hats. They are positive that no per
son could have been drowned at the
locality at the time the letter indi
cates, as the tide was out. A gang of
section hands was working close by
the point and none of the men saw
any women thereabouts during the aft
ernoon.

yesterday denied the application of t,he

against it. The California Messenger
Service opposed the granting of the
permit on the ground that a rival
company would injure its business.

to the highest bidder. Several other
applications for similar permits have
been previously denied.

Mayor Schmitz will to-day again
send messages to the Board of Super

Mayor stated yesterday that he saw
no reason to change his former opinion
that the ordinances were intended to
harass and persecute Gray Brothers,
who had established a quarry on Thir
tieth street, near Castro.
The Mayor believes that his vetoes
will be sustained' by the votes of the
five Supervisors who stood by him in
the former vetoes.. As it requires four
teen votes to override the Mayor's veto

escorts a lady to a ball. it Is his duty,
if he Is a dancer, to dance the first
dance with her and see that she is
provided with partners when she de

for her he, should introduce her to the
floor manager or his assistants. He
should not dance with her frequently.

the lady he \ brought to the ball, en
gages to dance with another lady It is
the law of etiquette that he shall dance
with her. If in the meantime he has
not been able " to * secure . a partner for.
the lady he brought, that, would not
be an excuse to break off with the
lady he is to dance with.^ It may , be

to the ball, but he cannot afford to be

THE Russian loss at Port Arthur is' bad enough had
it been an incident of actual battle.- But-to the loss
is added the tragedy of accident. Makaroff was a
great naval commander in his knowledge of tactics' and
strategy, though Russia's lack, of experience in naval
warfare had left his powers untested. He was his coun
try's mainstay on the water and his death is equal to the
loss of a fleet.
The sad incident brings the Russian system into con
trast with ours. When the Spatjish war came Dewey,
Schley, Samson and Phillip were captains. Yet, when
fleets had to be fought, they were found entirely capable
of assuming any responsibility. If we were to have war
to-morrow our navy>Â«s full of men of subordinate rank
who can be depended onto fight any fleet in the world
The incidents attending the Makaroff tragedy are riot
reassuring to the friends of Russia. Ever since the \var
began there has been manifest an indisposition to try
conclusions dn equal terms with the Japanese navy and
a decided avoidance of risking battle against any odds at
all. Russia seems to flinch and wait until 1 she can get
her Baltic fleet into action and have a decided preponder
ance in fighting power. Makaroff had left the harbor to
fight. A Grand Duke was on the bridge and 'the ship'
carried more of the hope and pride of Russia than any hv
the fleet. But when the" admiral countedtHe ships of the
enemy and without offering battle started to steam back
to shelter then his 'ship was hoist fby^his ; own J mine and

THE NAVAL TRAGEDY.
We must recognize at the outset that Japan is a poor
country, like nearly all Oriental lands, though not quite
so poor as British India. With a population -equal r to
that of , Germany, Japan has less than a fourth of Ger
many's revenue; or to take her ; ally, . England, as a
basis of comparison, Japan, with a population half as
great again as England, has less than a fifth of the rev
enue of England. We may make the view even clearer
in this way:- The revenue of France is about twenty dol
lars per head; that" of Japan is about three dollars per.
head. The imports of England are about* sixty, dollars
per head; those- of the Netherlands, drawn from an im
mense East-Indian empire, . about a , -, hundred and fifty
dollars.a head; while those of Japan are only three dol
lars per head, about one-fiftieth the imports of Holland.
Japan is densely populated. Nearly t forty millions of
her population are settled at from 400â to "475 to the
square mile, nearly thirty millions approaching the latter
figure ; in density. This population is largely agricultural;
the average farm, being about two acres r.iri; extent and
haying rather the character of a garden tilled wholly by
hand.laboVthan.jof a farm in our. sense. This prevalence
ofvhand labor- accounts for the > extreme;! difficulty;; in
finding; horses for the .Japanese cavalry; the country
people' have no horses, ; they are too poor to own
them and have rio room r oh their, diminutive farms to" use
thern.^ Another, comparison: U Japan v has : only ~ eight
towns of a hundred thousand inhabitants and "over, as
against thirty-three for^Germ'ariy,; with .about the same' to

from a- defaulting employe were
obliged to prove not only the em

offense, how few convictions of these
defaulters there would be. â¢ â¢ â¢

"temptation" which receives any par

in the pulpit or elsewhere is that oc
casioned by one man offering spiritu

values the custom of "treating" has
been singled out as though it were the

actions or omissions by which we
cause our neighbors or employes to of

lecture on the duty of keeping reason
ably strict oversight on one^ em

business system which shall reduce the
opportunities of dishonesty to a mini

character of another a greater burden
than it can safely bear is as important
as any duty in the realm xif morals, and

Tom Maguire was so heartbroken
over' his defeat and loss that he left
San Francisco. He died some years ago
in New York. -
l j Maguire did not relish Ralston's in
terference with his business and in no
choice or complimentary language
said as much in front of a host of the
patrons of the theater. . :
The news was carried to the bank
er, who became wroth and in return
he expressed himself to the effect that
he would "close Maguire's shows."
Acting on" his word he sent for Law
rence Barrett and John. McCullough,
the two great actors, who were then
playing in this city, and to them he
revealed his 1 plans to build a theater
and lease it to the company headed
by them. Without losing any time
negotiations were made (with the own
er of a nest of old shanties then, on
Bush street and in a very short time
the California Theater was' built and
used, thus closing ud the opera-house,
as Ralston had said' he would.
' An incident occurred in the history
of San Francisco which caused the
building of the old California Theater
and. the abandonment of the opera
house known as the Maguire Theater,
which was located on the north side of
Washington street, diagonally opposite
Dunbar alley, between Montgomery and
Kearny streets. *
It was in 1S69, when Parepa Rosa
was singing in the opera-house, and
on one of her nights off she accepted
an Invitation from W. C. Ralston to
visit, his Belmont residence.
A. spaiikl^ngi six-horse _ tQa'm- with: a'
tally-ho 'rig was in readiness at the
Occidental Hotel, with Ralston on the
box, and a party of up : to-date bloods
waited on the fair prima donna when
the start was made for the world re
nowned country residence of the great
banker and princely entertainer. Pa
repa Rosa was so infatuated with the
glorious climate and high class enter
tainment accorded her that she failed
to be on time when she was billed to
sing. As an apology for her delay Ral
ston telegraphed tosMaguire to noti
fy the ticket holders of the affair and
to Inform them that an extra perform
ance would be given as a recompensjj,
also that he would make good the loss
to Maguire due to her non-appear
ance.
Ancient History.
The larger cities north of San Francisco are equally
discontented with the Census Bureau's statements. The
Portland Oregonian and the Portland Journal claim that
gross mistakes have been made. The Oregonian heads
an editorial with the caption, "Figures That Lie." The
Oregonian finds that the ratio of increase for the whole
country is applied without discrimination and ignoring
movements of population to every city, north, south, east
and west.. The Oregonian relies on the school census
to show that Portland has increased 10,000 per. annum
since the census of 1900, and says that the conclusion it
reaches by this method is corroborated by the number of
newly erected homes and also by a carefully prepared
city directory. While the Census Bureau credits Port
land with 98,655 population in 1903, the Oregonian esti
mates that 140,000 would be about the correct total. iThe
Portland Journal reasons that while the census enumera
tors allow Portland an increase of but 8299 in three years,
"during the same time, up to the beginning of the new
year,' there have been built- 3703 new homes and the
school census shows a larger number of children of
school age than in some pi the cities that are credited
with 150,000 population.".^, 'â¢
Seattle is also aggrieved. The Post-Intelligencer at
tacks the "singularly artificial" method employed by the
Census Bureau and says that while it might be fairly
applicable to the older settled .States, it leaves out, of
account all the phenomena attending large migrations to
new "countries. Seattle, according to the Post-Intelli
gencer's careful conclusions, has gained three years
fully fouiv times asimuch in population .as the Census
Bureau reports. The bureau attributes growth of only
J27ooo since the census of 1900. Postal /statistics show
an increase of more than 300 per cent in Seattle business'
since 1897. Buildings have been erected sufficient to
house 15.000 to 20,000 each year since the census.
.'San Francisco people are confident that .this city has
at least 420,000 population, as against t.ie Qensus Bureau
estimate of 355,919. The Spring Valley Water Company
last June figured the population at ? 440,ooo on the basis
of families supplied with water. That the)population has
riot increased much faster since 1900 than it did in the
period of ten preceding years is manifestly absurd.
San Francisco is not alone a. complainant in this mat
ter. The Los Angeles Herald carefully estimates the
growth of the City of Angels since the last census. The
most recent returns of the Census Bureau give Los-An
geles an increase of only 13,941. The Herald shows that
when the census of 1900 was taken the Federal enumera
tors found 102,479 dwellers in Los Angeles and there
were then 19,607 school children, in the city. On "March
9, 1004, there were 29,479 school children in the enroll
ment, a gain of more than 10,000. Now, on the basis of
the census of 1900 and of the school enumeration of that
year the. ratio of school children to population was one
pupil to every 5J4 of -population. Supposing that ratio
not to have been practically changed, the present en
rollment of school children is assumed by the Herald to
show that Los Angeles now has a population of 142,487,
a gain of 12,502 per annum, as against the 3487 gain
credited by the Census Bureau.
H Vf UCH Â¦ circumstantial evidence is adduced by the
/X/l large cities of the Pacific Coast in impeachment
Â¦* Â» V of the accuracy of the figures of the Census Bu
reau that have recently been published. There would
seem to be a large and mischievous kink in the bureau's
methods or manner of drawing conclusions concerning
population. San Francisco, being the leading city of the
coast, naturally resents the official statement, in view of
certain .easily ascertainable facts, that it added to its
population only 13,137 in three years, or 4379 per an
num from 1900 to 1903. That rate of growth does not
equal the average of the decade between 1890 and 1900.
The population now credited to San; Francisco by the
Census Bureau is but 355,919, as against 342,782 in 1900.,
KINKS IN CENSUS FIGURES.
In June, 18S4, Naval Constructor
Philip Hichborn, U. S. N., received
orders from the Navy Department to
proceed to Europe to make a tour of
the dockyards of England, France,
Germany, Italy and Russia for the
purpose of observing personally the
improvements in naval architecture,
particularly In the construction of
steel vessels for war. The trip lasted
about six months and netted much
confidential valuable information to
the department besides an elaborate
and interesting public report, of which
two", editions were issued. His obser
vations and conclusions were summar
ized and clearly set forth in language
etrongly apprehensive that, even at
that early day in tho development of
modern navies, simplicity was being
lost Bight of and that actual war alone
would demonstrate the real value of
the vessels then building. ( "Such a
war." the report concludes, -. "or one
such bat*le would prove, what ha*
long been the apprehension of intelli
gent officers, that the warship of our
day has become far too complicated
for the people who may be called upon
to" work her; and that a balanct of
advantage, unsuspected by many, rests
..ith that vessel which has compara
tive simplicity, even though it be con
comftant with a greater apparent ex
posure of life, a lower speed and re
duced powers of offense." Until now
there has been no naval war nor single
battle to establish the fighting values
of the many types or, war vessels built
during the last twenty years. The
Cnlno-Japanese war was without de
finite results in that direction, for nav
al* experts have failed to concur In the
lessons developed; the Spanish- Ameri
can war was barren in results except to
demonstrate the danger of woodwork
on ships. But the . Rueso- Japanese war
promises to give some valuable les-
Bons, the particulars of which are yet
too early to enumerate fon want of re
liable Information. It is, however, safe
to predict that many of the present
complicated contrivances will be dis
carded in future ships and that after
The cost of warships is steadily in
creasing in all navies*. Thus the battle
ships of the Royal Sovereign class 1n
the British 'navy, built in 1S91-2. cost
$335 per ton displacement, while the
King, Edward VII, now building, will
cost $445 per ton. In French battle
t-hips there is an increase from J450
in 1831 to $650 in 1303, which is the es
timated cost of the Patrie. In Russia
the advance has been from $365 to $500.
and Germany pays now $445 per ton.
against $325 twelve years ago. The cost
Â«Â»f battleships in the United States
navy has apparently decreased during
the same period, for, while the three
*--hlps of the Oregon class, averaged
SG20 a ton. the ships under construction
will not exceed $4S5 per ton. This ap
parent decrease is due chiefly to more
leasonable armor contracts and par
tially owing to the keen competition
of shipbuilders. It should be borne in
mind, however, in this connection that
while the average cost of the Oregon
class was about $6,200,000, the Louis
iana and Connecticut, although of fifty
per cent greater displacement, and
averaging $7,760,000 each, really indi
cates an advanced cost of ship for ship
to fulfill the requirements of the two
periods.
The cost of armored cruisers shows
even a greater increase. Thus the
British Australia class, built in x lS86
for about $300 a ton. has advanced lo
J110 in the Duke of Edinburgh class
now building. The Dupuy de Lome
class of 1830, at a cost of $270 per ton,
is now about $475 in the latest armored
cruiser, Renan, in the French navy.
Russia pa,id over $500 per ton for its
latest ship of that class against $335
twelve years ago, and Germany, pays
about $4S0 for its armored cruisers in
course of construction. Germany, like
the United States, v had no armored
cruisers as far back as twelve years
ago; the Brooklyn and New York, al
though classed as armored cruisers, do
not come up to present requirements,
hence the cost of these ships, which
averaged 5500 per ton, cannot fairly be
compared with the latest additions,
which will cost about $450 per ton dis
placement.
The German navy personnel for
3&04-5 provides for an increase of 21S0.
making a total of- S4.1S2. against S2.052
tor the present year and 30,017 in
11*02-3. Commissioning of two new
battleships, three cruisers and six tor-
I'cdo-boats necessitates this increase.
The British armored cruiser Donegal,
9800 tons, 22.000 horsepower and twen
ty-three knots speed, has proved a dis
appointment owing to her enormous
coal consumption. In a race, concluded
March 26, between two sections of the
cruiser squadron, from Bermuda to
Portsmouth, the Donegal was unable
to keep up with the Drake and Good
Hope. The average rpeed of the squad
ron was seventeen knots, at which the
Donegal was burning coal at a rate
that would empty her bunkers by the
time port was reached and the speed
had tn be reduced. There are ten ships
of this class, seven of which, including

whose love and loyalty to country
made possible the , victories of our arm

the young soldier picketing the danger

ments to the memories of its dead ones
and magnificent homes for its few sur
viving ones; but it has sadly. forgotten
its most self-sacrificing ones. .
We enroll the worthy veteran upon
the pension list. We have also pro
vided comfortable homes for him, with
in whose cozy shelter he may rest
fully pass his few remaining years in
peaceful plenty. Many such are na

ated and are maintaining many others.

grandest display of human beneficence

The various laws providing ' for their
establishment expressly, state that they
are not "almshouses." The comforts

the glorious halo of this splendid' ex

hanced by an added brilliancy.
The pitifulness of old age is pathetic;
but what is it when old age is wo

Its culmination when we view the old

comes a stain upon the manhood of
all those whose opulence became pos

gave to the' young soldier at the front
at the time when the destinies of the
nation hung trembling In the balance
and were righted only by thes bravery
of the man she cheered. To the wo
man who^ marries the soldier in his
latter years there Is nothing owing.
But to the" wife of the hero of 1861-65,
the one whose wedding ring bears the
imprint of the sixties, we owe much.
What area few paltry dollars to the
richest nation upon earth compared to
the value of a loyal woman?
Let it be that the old wife
at the old veteranâ the bride of the
sixties â finds comfort and rest beside
her comrade within the shelter of a
national home. We claim to be a Chrls

Now that Hearst is out of politics perhaps Bryan
would like to 'come into the ring again for a third trial
on the ground that he is the only man of his stripe that
has a fighting chance left.
Mr. Bryan had great power over audiences, but lie had
to work it by his bodily and vocal presence. He con
verted the convention of 1806 into a dervish conventicle,
but it was done with his vocal chprds, assisted materially
by. his dark brown eyes rolling in the finest frenzy. But
remove Bryan to the rear of the curtain and the spell
was broken. Not so, however, with this new phenom
ena of Hearsterics. The wizard does not need to be
present at all. He may be far away in his seat in Con
gress with his cardiac machinery throbbing with unself
ish devotion to the "common people" and red hot and
enraged against the plutocrats, but the mention of his
name does the business and knocks gravitation 'out of
business. \
He is indeed a lulu. Judge Parker is not in -it. Olney
is a rank outsider, and it is in vain that Gorman's, fol
lowers try to lift themselves off their feet by the scats of
their trousers. The Hearst show has the road. It is the
only greatest combined association of aggregations on
earth. While we write this and while if is read his spell
is sending people to keep company with Mahomet his
coffin and Santos*Dumont his fly machine.
Nothing like it has been seen since the. days of Lulu
Hurst, the Georgia wonder. She was a right little, tight
little lady, but the touch of her finger tip would knock
Sandow off his center of gravity. If she touched an um
brella raised and under full sail it went inside out with
broken ribs and there was a job for the "brellas to mend"
man. She would" look at a chair and break its leg and
one glance would break the neck of a bottle or the back
of a sofa. Though she spelled her name differently it
was Hearst in the pronunciation. Some bold and defiant
man married her and she passed off the stage. Is it
possible that her powers are incarnate in her phonetic
namesake? . . . - â¢
THE proceedings in the Democratic party prelimi
nary and antecedent to the Presidential nomination
are attended by certain physical' and psychological
phenomena of the most curious and interesting character.
These are set forth in tfie daily, semi-daily and some
times tri-daily, editions of Mr. Hearst's numerous news
papers. When we read that the mere mention- of Mr.
Hearst's name in Texas took an audience "off its feet"
it did not seem singular; for Texas is an unexpected and
sudden sort of place. But it spread - like trembling
among the Shakers. So we read that dajly and some
times many times a day this occurs. Even in staid and
matter of fact New England they go off their feet by
hundreds, and in Montana, the Dakotas, Iowa, Â¦ Illinois
and Ohio they suffer the same experience. Along. with
this they are "spell bound," "lose themselves with enthu
siasm," "go wild with excitement," "lose control of
themselves," and so on.
It is believed in the Orient that there are certain words
which have a physical power when uttered. " One " of
these is the good word "Abracadabra." If a stranger go
into a Turkish bazaar in Constantinople and say "Abra
cadabra/'^the people run away in a panic. Is it possible
that in Hearst we have the great American Abracadabra?
Never before has this lifting off their feet been done by
any candidate for the Presidency. Mr. Hearst's papers
never tell what becomes of them after they go up. They
are separated .from the ground, lifted off their feet and
are left in that condition. ;
This has not yet occurred 1 in California. All of our
people are still on foot. Perhaps this is because the
spell-working name is sent out from headquarters in this,
city in cold typewritten letters. These have been scat
tered "from Siskiyou to San Diego, from the Sierras to
the sea." They are supposed to be the composition of
Manager Tarpey. He is an orator of the energetic
school, whose efforts send the atmosphere to a drug
store for antiphlogistinc to heal its bruises. But his let
ters seem to lack efficacy. They are horns of plenty
filled with promises and kind words, but it is said that
some of their recipients return them saying, "we need
something down here more substantial than kind words."
What can they mean except that the magic "name
"Hearst" be uttered to lift them off their feet?
While whole audiences, . groups, ... committees and
quorums arc elsewhere flying into the air Californians
are denied this unique and . bunion-soothing experience.
Mr. Hearst should not deny to his people in his native
State the benefits of his magic. He should try it on
Barry and Leake for instance. They belong to a
wicked and perverse generation that demands a sign.
Why withhold it? If they could be shown off their feet,
dancing in the air and feeling up for the ground, it would
settle the business. But while they go around gnashing
in every other State in the Union the wonder-working
name is. if monotonously, still surely lifting people off
their feet. The American Abracadabra is everywhere
else suspending the law of gravity and introducing mag
ic into politics.
The battleship Virginia, launched at
Newport News on April 5, is the sixth
naval vessel by that name. The first
was a ship of twenty-eight guns, built
in Maryland in 1776 and captured two
years later by the British. The second
Virginia was a schooner, built at Nor
fclk in 1708 and sold in 1801. The third
was a ship of the line of eighty-four
guns, which was completing at the
Boston navy yard when the Civil War
broke out, and in consequence of which
her name was changed to Vermont.
She was stricken from the navy list
December 19, 190L The fourth Virginia
was originally a steam frigate named
the Merrimac, and was transformed
into a ram by the Confederates and
renamed. She was, however, popularly
known as the Merrimac, and her fliht
with the Monitor in March, 1862, was
an epoch in the world's history. The
fifth Virginia was built by the Confedr
erates at Richmond; she was a heavily
armored vessel, but rendered no ser
vice, and was burned to prevent her
falling Into the hands of the Union
forces. '; 'Â¦:'Â¦ '
The raising of the United- States
battleship Maine from the bottom of
Havana harbor has again been indefi
nitely postponed. A Chicago contractor
recently made an offer to the
Cuban Government to raise the
ship, but having failed to fur
nish guarantee and sign the con
tract within twenty days the offer Is
considered canceled. No less than six
offers have been made at different
times to raise the ship, but the condi
tions imposed upon would-be contract
ors have been of such a nature as to
cause withdrawal of offers. One of the
most important conditions is that pro
hibiting the use of explosives, it being
desired to raise the wreck intact from
any other damage than that sustained
when Eunk February 15, 1898.
The dispatch-boat Dolphin was
launched twenty years ago, on April 12,
1SS4, and was the first vessel of the
new navy to take the water. The cruis
ers Atlanta, Boston and Chicago, au
thorized by act of Congress of March
3, 1SS3, were not launched until Janu
ary, 1SS5. The contract for all four ves
sels was given to John Roach, whose
only serious competitors were the Har
lan & Hollings worth Company and Wil
liam Cramp & Sons Company. It was
not until December, 18S5, that the Dol
phin, after several unsuccessful trials,
finally made the speed trial, upon the
results of which the Navy Department
decided to accept the vessel at a re
duced price. A board composed of Com
modore G. C. Belknap, Commander
Robley D. Evans and Herman Winters,
a civilian engineer, reported the Dol
phin as deficient in horsepower and
speed and structurally weak. In order
to reinforce the Belknap report Com
mander R. W. Meade was assigned
captain of the Dolphin, and this naval
officer in his report, while differing
somewhat from Belknap and Evans,
characterized the Dolphin as a "ma
rine crazy-quilt."
The Dolphin was built at a cost of
JCST.TIK. and her cost in repairs, includ
ing removal of boilers,* has been $374,
000 up to July 1, 1903. Modern vessels of
war are costly to keep in a proper state
of efficiency, and the Dolphin's repair
cost is not excessive as compared with
other vessels since added to the navy.
The Dolphin has fulfilled the purpose
for which ehe was built â that of a dis
patch-boat, and as she is not a fighting
craft she has been largely utilized in
carrying the President, Secretary of
the Navy and Congressional commit
tees to watering places and navy yards
on The Atlantic coast. Its only special
duty in the navy line was to voyage
around the world, leaving New York in
January, 1S88, and returning September
27, 18S9, during which period the Vessel
steamed over 55,000 miles. No "struc
tural weakness" has ever manifested
itself In this alleged "marine crazy
quilt." The Roach heirs have been
awarded the money due on the canceled
contracts, and the Dolphin is still good
for twenty years more.

There, sprawled in - the fantastic
posture of sudden death, lay 'a frayed
and weather-beaten old cat. /
"S-s-she's dead," wag the only gasp
which could come from the agonized
lips of the old man for a minute. Then
he broke into a cry, half-querulous,
half-despairing. "Oh God! those days
all ' those days when I first cum here
to the poorhouse, and she wuz the only
friend I had. She took to me the very
day they brought me, and every day
arter, when I wuz tap-tappin' my way
aroun' gettin' ust to the corners, she
would cum up to me an* talk to me â
yes, talk." Old Bill broke Into another
senile fit of sobbing.' '
"Why, old Bill Buckley," laughed the
stableman in a* worthy effort to bright
en up the mourner, "I didn't know you
was mashed on thatâ that lady I have
to take away to-day."
"I wuzn't." Old Bill's trembling hand
began to search about his knees until
his fingers grasped the corner of an
old frayed shawl that lay there cover
ing something. "This wuz my friend,'.*
he said, with a voice stilled almost to a
whisper as he reverently pulled away
the shawl.
Back and forth, back and forth, with
dolorous movement, he swung his old
body in time to the crooning wall of
grief which arose, wavering, from hl3
lips. His sightless eyes were turned up
so that the tiny beam of sunlight
slanting down through the crack in the
barn glinted upon the tears that stood
in the "hollow sockets. The scraggy
white beard that sprung from .the
wrinkled throat leaped and quivered
with the shaking sobs that racked it
in quick spasms. His arms, folded
across his chest in mute sign of help
fulness, twitched with each sob, and
the gnarled fingers knit and unknit
themselves, in the frayed- cuffs which
trimmed the end of the , coat sleeves.
Grief was thereâ the grief of the aged.
"Why, what's doing, old Bill Buck
ley?" The cheery voice of the driver
sounded through the gloom of the barn
as he paused on his -way to water the
horses. He had to hitch them-present
ly to the long covered wagon, which
always leaves the "City and County"
at a walk.

and in the sea a grave. He was a brave man and it would
have been better for him and more satisfactory to his
country and to the naval pride of the world had he risked
battle and died in action.
Going again to the -contrast between navies and the
naval spirit it must not be "forgotten tliat-n early all the
leading commanders of the Japanese navy were trained
in the United -States and England. They had to learn
naval tactics and absorb the sea fighting spirit abroad,
for they had no nav^l school at home. It is evident that,
they resemble our navy officers in being willing to fight
against odds, trusting to skill in gunnery, discipline of
their men and capacity to handle and, fight their ships.;
If; all the fleets of Russia were mustered in the Yellow
Sea, far outnumbering those o*f Japan, it is sure that the
Japanese would fight the aggregation and perhaps win.

G. H. Umbsen & Co., the real estate
dealers, who are acting for the "Anna
Held Company for the selection of a
prc-per site, have been working for a
week with the various owners of the
most favorable sites in their endeavors
to secure a suitable location. Thus far
those presented have not been deemed
sufficiently central. Umbsen & Co.
were interviewed yesterday, and they
said that they believed that a satis
factory arrangement would be made
before May 1.
"Much depends," said Mr. Umbsen,
"on the locatic-n, as the details of the
building are matters that can be easily
adjusted by thei Anna Held Company;
as the tire-proof class of theater de
sired by the company is just in ac
cordance with the modern requirements
of our Board of Public Works."
The city, in truth, does need a first
class theater in the downtown section,
and it is thought that tnc business it
will attract will do much to. improve
the theater interests in the city.
Charles Hanlon, the attorney for the
Anna Held Company, is busily engaged
in preparing articles of incorporation
under the laws of the State for the
company and the charter will be is
sued in a few days.
It Is likely that plans for a million
dollar theater In this city will be drawn
up before many weeks. L. Ziegfeld
Jr., manager of Anna Held, thinks of
building such a showhouse here, and
he is to be assisted by Charles Hanlon,
the well known attorney, and G. H.
Umbsen of the real estate flrni of G. H.
Umbsen & Co. ' .-'
Ziegfeld has had his eye on San
Francisco as an ideal city for a grand
theater. He has studied out the ques
tidn and believes that this city would
easily support still another first class
amusement house. He conferred with
Umbsen and Hanlon and was encour
aged by them and told that the venture
would surely prove a success.
If the new playhouse is erected here
Anna Held will appear on its stage
every season, and none but the highest
grade talent will be permitted within
the inclos^re of the stage. No defi
nite plans have as yet been decided
upon, but it la understood that details
will be arranged and the. grand play
house be a realization before the gen
eral public is fully aware of the fact.
Plans for Structure Soon
to Be Made and Work May
Begin in a Short Time

NOTES OF THE TRACK.
A more evenly balanced field than
that which started in the fifth, a Fu
turity sprint, would be difficult to col
lect, and there was no favorite in the
betting. Lurene, Sir Preston and
Flaneur, each quoted at 4\k to 1, were
the favored ones. "Alice Carey, piloted
by Sherwood and 5 to 1, reached home
a length before Brennus. Rollick, a
13 to 1 chance, took the show. Lu
rene showed some early speed , and
then quit. â¢
"Big Bill Knapp had the mount on
Northwest, favorite for the closing
mile selling run, and finished second.
The first choice raced Anirad Into sub
jection, but when challenged the last
eighth by Sherwood, on George Berry,
she was not equal to the emergency
and lost by a head. Anirad was third.
For some reason " nobody figured
that Watkins Overton would repeat
his run of last Tuesday and he opened
up at 20 to 1. Later on the odds
â¢were cut to 8. McBrlde landed him
first at the wire, a length and a half
before The Fretter. Sam Greenfield,
on Isabellita, took the show, and with
a stronger rider up the mare could
have won. Montana Peeress, the fa
vorite, with Jed Lewis in the saddle,
made a poor showing.
~ EVENLY BALANCED FIELD.
Jed Lewis made a bungling mess of
it on Bill Short and Velna, played from
2>,_ to 1 down to 3 to 2, registered an
easy winner of the two-year-old dash.
Joe Jones piloted the first choice and,
drawing away from Bill Short on the
stretch turn, led San Jose out a couple
of lengths. Otis on Howard Vance had
his usual run of luck, getting home
when it was all over.
Jones also had the mount on St.
Winnifride, winner of the five and a
half furlong run following. The mare's
odds dropped from 2 to 11 to 10, and
she collared and beat Riesca<out with
ease. Algareta, a 30 to 1 chance back
ed to 12, ran a moderate third.
LEWIS' BUNGLING RIDE.
There was not much to recommend
the programme at Oakland track yes
terday and the crowd found it almost
as impregnable as the Japs find Port
Arthur. Royal White and Watkins
Overton were the highest salaried ar
tists in the long shot line. The favor
ites found representation at the wire
in Velna and St. Winnifride.
Of all the touted ones in the open
ing scramble OEcar Tolle was the only
one to get a piece of the money. The
winner turned up in Royal White, a 25
to 1 shot, ridden by Dugan, which
downed Ospar Tolle a head. The Lieu
tenant ran third. Crigli. the favorite,
finished fifth.

A rousing meeting of the Amateur
Athletic and Driving Association was
held last night in the Palace Hotel and
some new blood was # enlisted in the
cood cause cf building a great public
athletic field in Golden Gate Park.
President "W. B. Hinchman of the Pa
cific Athletic Association was on hand
to gather data so that he might
espouse the question at the regular
meeting of his order to-nizht. He of
fered some Bugpcstions as to the best
manner of reaching the schools and
colleges on the subject of subscriptions
end was empowered to go ahead with
puch arrangements as he deemed fit.
The Cycle Board of Trade was also
represented. For years the cyclists
have endeavored to have a properly
banked track built in the park, but
liave n**ver been able to swing the
proposition alone. They are working
in conjunction with the other sports
men and were given assurance that a
track, constructed on scientific lines,
would be built between the speed track
Â«nd the cinder path. A space of twen
ty feet in width has been left in the
surveyors' plan which will be exactly
suitable for this purpose.
It was the original intention to give
cut the names of subscribers 'to the
fund at the meeting, but it was deem
ed advisable to let this go over another
week as several holders of books were
i.ot present and sent only the lump
rum of their pledges. An addition to
the cash fund of nearly 52500 was made,
Vrincing the total of cash xÂ»n hand up
to ?T000. The amoont subscribed and
outstanding is fully $5000 and may bÂ«
n trifle more when all reports are re
ceived. The first of next week com
mittees, appointed by President Simp
eon, will visit prominent citizens of
public ppirit with a view to swelling
the fund greatly. It is hoped that the
rew workers will soon complete the en
tire 525.000 needed to make the plan
en assured success.

Late in the afternoon Joe King,
whose Irish setter Brian Boru was a
winner, created a .disturbance while
suffering from the elation following the
victory of his dog. The breach of pro
prieties was so marked that the offi
cials disqualified both owner and dog.
This moves the dogs placed below the
winner up one place each. The awards
made during the day follow:
Mrs. Cash Sloan sold her French bull
dog Nounou to Graham Babcock dur
ing the evening for $600.
John D. Spreckels Jr. showed Titus,
a puppy by champion Banjo, which
was full of quality. In another year,
when he fills out, he will be hard to
beat. \ Champion Banjo was in great
form and won in the open class.
The first of the specials were Judged
during the evening. Lester C won the
cup for the 'best St. Bernard in the
show. . J. H. Rosseter's Rocker was
pronounced the best greyhound. E.
Courtney Ford's pointer Boston won
the pointer trophy. J. M. Lucas' Ore
gon Jessie won the cup for the best of
opposite sex.
â¢ Mrs. Charles K. Harley's Ivel Damon
won everything in the bulldog class for
which he was eligible, beating The
Battler and Harry Lacy. , i
As was expected, the bull, terrier
competition was the warmest in the
show. Edward Attrldge sent Edgecote
Peer, by Bloomsbury Baron-Edgewood
Queen, into the ring and carried off the
honors in several classes.' Judge Morti
mer pronounced him the best dog he
has seen in years. He said there is
nothing in America that can lower his
colors. . ,
The list of awards in the fox terrier
class seemed like a roster of the dogs
owned by Charles K.Harley, master of
Wondee kennels. Whether in novice,
limit, open or winner class, Mr. Har
ley's kennel manager, Stanley Lamar,
seemed able to turn out a terrier which
would catch the eyes of Judge Morti
mer., His .string of show dogs is.pro
nounced the strongest in the world at
the present time. The terriers were all
a snappy, sporty lot and there always
seemed a chance' for a: fight while they
were having^their turn in the ring.
Thousands of spectators visited the
bench show of the San Francisco Ken
nel Club yesterday afternoon and even
ing at Mechanics' Pavilion. There was
an interested throng about the Judging
ring at all times and the facile manner
in which Judge Mortimer performed
his onerous duties proved a never-fail
ing source of delight.

NEW YORK, Aprft 14. â For the
first time in many years New Yorkers
to-day witnessed a real snowstorm in
mid-April. At one period it assumed
the proportions of a regular winter
storm and the low temperature and
biting wind which whirled the large
flakes made it most uncomfortable for
the thousands on their way to busi
ness In the city. The flakes melted as
soon as they struck the ground.

IN A SHOOTING AFFRAY
ST. PETERSBURG, April 14.â An an
archist named Kazaniff stopping at the
Hotel du Nord, on the Nevsky Pros
pect, concealed an Infernal machine in
his trunk. It prematurely exploded last
night. Kazaniff was blown to pieces,
the ceiling and windows of his room
were smashed, several persons were in
jured and fire broke .out In the hotel.
The flames were quickly extinguished.
The police found no evidence of a
plot. The man arrived at the hotel
yesterday morning with a trunk and
hand baggage. He went out In the aft
ernoon and returned at 5 o'clock, re
maining in his room thereafter. Amons
those injured In the explosion was a
naval cadet.
The police confiscated copies,of news
papers containing accounts or the ex
plosion and ordered accounts to be sup
pressed. It Is now stated that the room
in the Hotel du Nord was rented by
two persons, one of whom is missing.
A search of the ruins resulted in the
discovery of one of the victims' legs
with the hosiery still on It. and also
the lower part of a boot containing
toes.
Young Dunham decided to go also
and explain. The explanation was fol
lowed by several wordy rows as the
drive proceeded and the girl fre
quently had to intercede to stop hos
tilities. She was taken home and a
watch was set upon her, the door of
her room being locked at night.
After a few nights of Imprisonment
the girl slipped out and found her
lover waiting. A telephone message
to Rathdrum had arranged for a li
cense and other details and after a
fast drive the couple were married.
The bride Is less than 18 years of age.
Miss Jarret has a stepmother, with
whom she did not get on well, so the
girl has been working in a hotel at
Couer d'Alene. There she met young
Dunham. A few days ago Miss Jarret
was induced to visit the ranch of Dun
ham's brother-in-law while awaiting
a change of employment. Father Jar
ret came to the town and heard of the
visit. Promptly he drove to the ranch,
secured his daughter and her belong
ings and started home.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Cochran attacked ex-President
Cleveland for forcing his financial
policies on the country. He said these
policies were at variance with those
of the rnajority of voters and' that
Cleveland's arbitrary way of doing
things was a menace to constitutional
government. Cleveland, he said, was
a man "whose friendship means de
struction; whose touch means paraly
sis, and whose support means dishon
or." and who had been exiled, "never
siguin to reinstate himself in the con
fidence of his countrymen." Now that
the country was returning to patriot
ism and sanity, he (Cochran) would
commend to those in charge of the
booms of certain men seeking the
Democratic nomination to bear in
mind that one of the most circuitous
routes possible or imaginable will be
a certificate of good character from
Cleveland, "late Republican President
of the United States."
In some remarks on the protective
tariff. Baker of New York character
ized Joseph Chamberlain as "a traitor
to the cause of free trade." and said
that he had been overwhelmingly re
pudiated by the people of England
because of his tariff views. He then
turned his attention to President
P.oosevelt, and said the country dur
ing: the coming campaign was going
to know who paid for the twenty-five
special trains in which he traveled
and for the food, wines and cigars
consumed. The country, he said, also
would aÂ«k if the President could ac
cept these courtesies and still do his
duty toward bills affecting the great
railroad interests of the United
States.
Van Duser of Nevada defended the
Miners' Union of the West, and de
clared against what he said was the
usurpation of the military power.
These unions, he said, in reply to
Hogg of Colorado, neither directly nor
indirectly had aided or abetted in
murder or arson.
The deficiency bill was laid aside
p.nd the conference report on the In
dian appropriation bill was agreed to.
At 5:10 o'clock the House adjourned
until to-morrow.
"it is everywhere apparent that . we
are prosperous." But. running like a
discord through the hum of industry,
he said, there had been and is an un
dertone of discontent, which breaks out
in strikes, violence and mutual re
crimination between labor and capital,
to their injury and to the injury of
the whole population. Unprecedented
prosperity, he asserted, had forced em
ployers into active competition for la
bor to keco their plants running, and
labor, keenly alive to its opportunity,
had been pushing for a larger share
of the prciit it helps to make. The
millennium had not arrived, and there
fore the situation was presented of
union against union, boycott against
boycott and injunction against injunc
tion, while outside the lines of organ
ized labor and capital was the great
body of American consumers, vitally
interested in all that affected them, and
who. In the long run, paid the bills. -
Hamilton said it was not true that
trusts were fostered by protection, ex
cept in the sense that protection makes
good time?. The anti-trust and inter
state commerce laws both bore the
names of Republican Senators.' He
closed by saying that organized capi
tal and organized labor owe and must
render obedience to the law.
Cochran of Missouri, in a speech on
the usurpation by the executive of the
legislative power, criticized the prac
tice of a, small coterie of members and
Senators going to the White House
and conferring with the President at
his bidding on matters of legislation.
He said it had become nn uncondemn
ed custom and that "when the lead
era do this the destruction of this
body. afÂ» a representative and delib
erative body, is complete." He took
issue with Bourke Cockran regarding
the disposition of the Speaker to re
assert the dignity of the House and
inquired "What evidence have we of
that?"

I.ABOH QUKST1OX.
Hamilton of Michigan, in speaking
of the labor situation, said the ques
tions that trouble us were above politi
cal issues, but cannot t>e separated
from them. He said there was some
thing about the Republican parly that
sends things above par, whereas the
opposition sends them below par. From
the offices of stock jobbers to the
heights rrf political economy, he said.
WASHINGTON, April 14.â The House
to-day passed the Philippine bill, fol
lowing which there was an extended
debate over a resolution to permit Col
onel Thomas \V. Symons of the Engi
neer Corps, U. S. A., to serve tm the
advisory board of consulting engineers
in connection with internal improve
ments in the State of New York. After
several fiery speeches had been made
in opposition it was adopted by an
overwhelming vote. The general de
licicncy bill was taken up. and Hamil
ton of Michigan discussed capital and
labor, while Cochran of Missouri criti
cized the "usurpation of the legisla
tive power by the executive," and said
that ex-President Cleveland had given
the most notable instance of such
usurpation in forcing his financial poli
cies on the people. Cleveland, he de
clared, was a man whose friendship
meant destruction, whose touch meant
paralysis and whose support meant dis
honor. He declared Cleveland had been

PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S. readings are like

is so electrifying the world * to-day. HE IS
NO IMITATOR. His work is upon original
lines; PURE THOUGHT. CLEAR VISION.
He TELLS YOU WHAT - YOU DESIRE TO
KNOW, AND WORKS IN THE OPEN
LIGHT. AND IS AS CONSPICUOUS , FOR
ITS WONDERFUL OCCULT ANALYSIS AS
IT IS FOR ITS ORIGINAL EXPRESSION
AND VIVID TRUTHFULNESS.' Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦-
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading, for $1. A test Is
of little value when the mind Is troubledâ
you need more substantial aid and advice.
This is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
. gives you when you call on Â¦ him for a flrst-
class clairvoyant reading. He . asks you no
questions, but tells you. what: you wish to
know. . .- Â¦ ..-Â¦.-Â¦Â¦
Ho does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you., find the causa of trouble and
suggest the remedy. Â¦ .

This invention has for its object the production of a novel lamp, particularly desirable for use as a
night lamp. Lamps for this purpose need not produce a laree flame; in fact, a comparatively small flame is
more desirable, but it is also desirable that the lamp be capable of burning for a long period without refilling
and without attention and without emitting any odor. These results are positively obtained. Directions

Young HIn, a billposter, was arrested
by Sergeant Christianson and posse for
posting reward signs on telegraph
poles. v;.^;?
The Alaska Commercial and other
packing and fishing companies have
been losers to the of several
thousand dollars by the escaping of 150
Chinamen engaged to go to Alaska for
the fishing season. Each of the escaped
men was paid from $50 to $250 advance
money to engage him for the season.
Chin Jim of the Chinese Educational
Society, who does most of the advance
business for the Alaska companies,
yesterday posted signs bearing offers of
reward aggregating $3000. Chin Jim
has engaged several hundred Chinamen
to go to Alaska for the coming season.
Two or three days ago he began to
collect his men, and discovered that
most of them had decamped with the
advance money. Agents -for several of
the other companies doing fishing and
packing business in the far north have
made the same complaint.
A' special meeting of the Six Compa
nies, was held last night to determine
what course to pursue to capture the
absconding men. Last night a squad
of a dozen Chinese went in search of
the missing men, and* incidentally of
rewards. They caught one of the men
at the corner of Turk and Taylor

until he makes good the amount paid
to him by the agents.
The rewards are approximately $20
for each man taken into custody. The
wholesale skipping out of contract la
borers is an annual happening in Chi
natown. The number of Chinamen that
have decamped this year is larger than
ever before. The local police have not
been notified, the Chinese choosing to
capture their own men and thus get
the rewards themselves.
"WASHINGTON, April .14. â Senator
Dietrich of Nebraska has been declared
by a x special committee of Congress to
be guilty of any violation of the
statutes of the United States or of
any corrupt or unworthy conduct re
lating: either to the appointment of
Jacob Fisher as Postmaster at Hast
ings, Nebr.. or the leasing of the build
ing in that city to the United States
for a postofflce.
The committee which investigated the
charges against Senator Dietrich was
composed of Senators Hoar, Platt of
Connecticut, Spooner, Cockrell and Pet
tus. Three members of the committee
are Republican and two are Democrats.
The report was unanimous. .
The report reviews the testimony at
length, and the conclusion is reached
that the charges cannot be sustained.
The committee, with reference to the
lease of the building at Hastings, finds
that it was effected while Dietrich was
Governor of Nebraska - and before he
became a Senator; that it extended for
ten years, and that the law governing
in such matters was not violated. The
report says the committee admitted
only such evidence against Senator
Dietrich as would have been competent
in a court of justice, but also a great
deal of hearsay testimony, being all
which was brought to the attention of
the committee as a possible clew for
further, information.
This course, the report says, was
taken with the consent of Senator
Dietrich, and it is stated that the com
mittee "did not determine how-far this
proceeding would have been justified
for any reason without such consent,
even if it had carefully refrained from
attaching any Weight to it In its final
decision, but it in fact did not in the
least, tend to shake or affect the con
clusions it had reached."

I have come to this city. In an unofficial ca
pacity, " representing private . citizens that want
civil .service slaws. Great progress has been
made -in our cause, and. while we are 'greatly
encouraged/ 1 1 feel that there Is as much to be
done In the future as there has been done In
the past. . "' ' Â¦ -^BKJgBJgE&ggiSBPtea^
Organized public sentiment Is responsible for
the great 6tridea in civil service government.
Since the year. 188;; s the civil service law; has
been the constant subject of attack by Congress.
We . have f therefore - to congratulate | ourselves
on holding our' ground as \ we have In the dif
ferent States and cities. - ; '
I am a stanch admirer t Roosevelt and be
lieve the country owes to him the fact that
the law Is supreme, and. whether he deals
with friend or fee, strong or weak, he is
Just to the extreme.
But as for civil service. It was commenced
only â¢ twenty years ago. and already It Is es
tablished in 125,000 places. In a few years
more it will cover every place in the Govern
ment service. Â¦ y. '
Elliott H. Goodwin' was the next
speaker. In part he said :
ROOSEVEI/T 1IOXEST.
I ani afraid I have been misunderstood on
the subject of | labor organization. A trades
union Is a voluntary organization and I readily
see where It has many advantages. I , realize
the great profits' In shorter hours and the re
striction of woman and child labor. Â¦ That the
condition of labor governs the condition of the
country there Is no doubt. .
I am also croud to say that not a single
man of all that were Indicted received his po
sition through a competitive examination.
According to the rules of the civil service, a
man is not appointed to office without having
pasted* a> conuietltlve examination. Hereto
fore men that were qualified to pass examina
tions were afraid to take them, for they knew
that" If they did pass someone else with more
political pull than they would be elected.
In. the postofflee service letter carriers and
other minor officials have been unable to ever
attain the position of postmaster. They were
allowed to advance just so far and no farther.
Postmasters were elected that were totally ig
norant of the ' postal service. A man cannot
make a good postmaster. until he has been a
carrier. â¢
Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen: I am glad of this
opportunity to talk to you of the cause we
represent, and am glad to see that San Fran
cisco in a city that is proud of its nation. I
can aswure you that the nation Is proud of ban
Francisco.
There Is no city that has greater opportunl-.
tleÂ«Â» or a morn favorable . outloook than San
Francisco. It is the greatest commercial me
tropolis on the Pacific Coast, but as time rolls
along -it will become even greater than It Is
to-day. For this reason the people should be
careful of a good administration and realize
their responsibility for the government ( that
exiuts at nny time.
Throughout the entire United States people
were surprised and shocked to hear of .the re
cent postofflce corruption, but I am proud to
say that at the head of the nation there was
fi. man that was honorable and just enough to
punish the guilty and to allow none to escape.

President Rogers of the San Fran
cisco Civil Service Commission made a
strong address, dealing with the great
Improvement in San Francisco politics,
due to the election of officials through
civil service rules and the great de
crease in position obtained by political
pulls. Â¦>
Alford Cooley was next introduced by
Supervisor Brandenstein. Cooley was
heartly applauded. In part he said:
- Arthur McArthur, leader of organ
ized labor, next spoke. He compared
the present administration with some
of those of the past, very favorably to
the present. He said: "One needs only
to enter the doors of the^City Hall to
smell the change. The methods and
men are cleaner than they ever have
been before." After welcoming the
visitors he concluded.
Edward Coffee of the Municipal
Service Employes' Association was the
next to speak. In part he said:
"I have the honor of representing a
body of mechanical and clerical erri7
ployes, appointed under civil service
rules, namely, after competitive ex
aminations. The object of this'asso
ciation is to promote good feeling and
harmonious relations with the heads of
departments. To protect ourselves as
we can within our right. The 260 mem
bers of our association extend a hearty
welcome to Mr. Cooley and Mr. Good-
CITY IS CLEAX.
Alford W. Cooley and Elliott H.
Goodwin, member of the United States
Civil Service Commission and secretary
of the Civil Service Reform League, re
spectively, were tendered an informal
greeting* on the part of tne city and
county of San Francisco In the Super
visors' chamber last evening.
H. U. Brandenstein' was elected to
the chair and presided over the meet
ing:. He first introduced John W. Me-
Naught, who made a brief but eloquent
address, manifesting hiB cordial greet
ings to the visitors irom the East.
A resolution was read to the effect
that Cooley and Goodwin were heartily
welcomed by the people of San Fran
cisco, not pnly because of their un
doubted ability and willingness to con
tribute to the development and im
provement of the civil service system,
but more particularly because they are
representatives of the American people
and the United States Government.
The resolution , was as follows:
1 Resolved. That the city and county of San
Francisco extend to Alford W. Cooley a mem
ber 01 the United : States Civil Service Com
mission, and Elliott H. Goodwin, secretary of
the Civil. Service League, a deep and sincere
welcome. I
. PLEDGED TO REFORM.
This city has pledged Itself by Us charter
to the principles of civil service reform. -By
that same instrument It ha* determined I or
all time its recognition of the absolute justice
an<i reason of those principles. . It understands
that the moral and the commercial welfare of
the community are vitally and Immediately
connected with the intelligent and honest ad
ministration of Its governmental affairs. It
accepts as- established the rule that the basis
of all successful government is Its adminis
tration by competent men. It holds all the**
doctrines axiomatic and is alive to the neces
sity for their permanent establishment in
actual practice to make Its government ef
fective. 1 .Â¦
It welcomes the visit of these distinguished
gentlemen that It may learn from them where
in our civil service system may be perfected.
This city is an essential and an Immediate
part of the Union. The progress and welfare
of San Francisco seriously concern the Gov
ernment of the United States. It is the aim
or' this municipality, therefore, to bring Itself
Into close touch with the Federal Government,
Vt encourage actively and vigorously conditions
that will stimulate the Intimacy of San Fran
cisco and Washington, that the Federal Gov
ernment shall understand that It I* in a large
measure the guardian of our commercial In
terests. San Francisco greets Washington and
attests its attachment and loyalty to the com
mon covernment. of us all.

CHICAGO, April 14. â Snow in many sections
of the Northwest caused apprehension among
wheat traders concerning spring seeding. A
decided decrease in acreage was considered pos
sible. The opening was somewhat erratic,
July being 1 ,4Â©%c lower to %G?Ue higher at
87<^S7ftc. Commission houses had large buy-
Ing orders on the small receipts, both at Chi
cago and In the Northwest. In view of the
bullish character of crop news offerings were
quite small and In consequence the market
became firm. There was good buying, by the.
Southwest and the market at Kansas City
and St. Louis was strong. Crop damage bul
letins were Â¦ in abundance from all over the
winter wheat country. Â¦ A member of a Chi
cago commission house now examining con
ditions in Kansas telegraphed that west of a
north and south line drawn through Hutchin
son Kans., winter wheat of Oklahoma and
Kansas w-as hopelessly lost. With such news
to encourage buying prices readily advanced,
July rallying to SSftc. Later In the day an
estimated Increase In shipments from Argen
tina caused sufficient selling to carry prices
down Rbout half a cent from the "high point.
Nevertheless the market showed no signs of
weakness, the close being firm,,. with July at
87^Â©87%c. May ranged between 03%c and
04'.fcc and closed at 03%c.
On account of small local receipts the corn
market had a strong start and the initial firm
ness was well maintained throughout the day.
July opened Vi@%c higher at 50%@50Â»Jc.' sold
between SOftc and 51%c and closed at 50%c.
May closed at 53 ftc. after ranging between
C2-ic and 53*4 c. Lo^U_ receipts were forty
nine cars.
Oats ruled firm on reports of delayed seed
ing and on small local receipts. . 'After open-
Ing unchanged to Vic higher at 37%(f|3734c
July sold between 37%Â®37ftc and CSc, and
clored atÂ»37%Â©37^4c .
- Moderate receipts of hogs, with steady prices
at the yards, caused a firm tone Â¦ in provisions
early In thÂ« session. There was a fair de
mand for all products and offerings were IUn!Â»
Leter there was some pressure to sell, .which
-resulted In a weaker tone. Absence of outside,
support was a bear factor. The market closed
steady, with July pork unchanged at $12 SO. 1
July lard closed up a phade at $0 80. Ribs
were down 2ftc at $0 57ft.

NEW ORLEANS. April 14.â The immense
spot demand that developed in the open cot
ton market to-day played the game into the
hands of the bulls after the bears seemed
fully assured of being able to put prices still
lower. Early in the afternoon rumors of im
mense spot sales were spread about. These
were later confirmed by -the official spot re
port. Total spot sales were 17,r>00 bales. This
equals the entire amount of trading dono dur
ing the whole of last week. Spot quotations
were unchanged. The sensation of. the day
was found in the immense epot transactions
by W. P. Brown & Co. They bought SÂ»000
bales of spot. Thl* was easily the largest
single spot transaction ever made on the Cct
ton Exchange here. The amount of money
Involved in it was approximately $750,000, as
the cotton was the high grade.

ESTHER 31 UN DELL'S PUPILS
PLAY AT SOROSIS CLUB
Â¦ An unpleasant little, mixup that was
not carded on' they program me took
place at the dog show at Mechanics'
Pavilion yesterday afternoon. Joseph
King, : former Supervisor, and dog
fancier, succeeded in making himself
obnoxious, and before he finally beat a
retreat from the -building he drew a
guri on William Kittle, one of the di
rectors of the KenneJ Club, and then
landed with his mighty right on the
jaw of the doorkeeper so hard that the
latter went down and out."
All the trouble occurred over King's
handsome Irish setter, Brian Boru,
which was awarded several prizes by
the judges yesterday. According to re
ports, King became so elated over his
good fortune that he invaded several
of the gilded palaces where the cheer
ing beverage may be had and before
long his spirits had; risen high and he
imagined many things.
He returned to the Pavilion and.
walking up to the bench where his dog
was Quartered," took the animal ,and
was in the act. of , walking" out of the
place with him when Kittle politely in
formed him that it 'was against the
rules of the Kennel Club to remove a
dog without a special permit.'
. King refused to listen to Kittle and
said he would do as he liked with the
animal. . A heated discussion - followed
and finally King made an. attempt to
strike Kittle with his fist. King finally
drew a revolver from his pocket and
threatened to shoot Kittle-
King then proceeded to take his dog
from the place. He got as far as the
door when he was intercepted by the
doorkeeper and another row followed.
This one was of. short duration, how
ever, for King j struck : the doorkeeper
a blow in the face, sending him sprawl
ing on the floor.
King left the Pavilion with his dog.
The officers of the Kennel Club imme
diately held a meeting and decided to
disqualify both King and his dog, so
the prizes .which the animal won will
not be awarded. The matter will be re
ported to the American Kennel Club in
New York and that body will likely
sustain the action taken by the local
organization, so that Mr. King will
hereafter find it a difficult matter to
break into a dog show, more difficult,
in fact, than making, an exit from one.
The convention held by the party represented
by Asher and Hasklns being the first held
after the adoption of said primary law. we
are therefore of the opinion that Jurisdiction is
conferred upon the Board of Election Commis
sicr.ers to determine which of these two peti
tions is entitled to be placed upon the official
ballot. "-.' ~

question, and the argument advanced that
party usase lias Riven the right to the pe
tition signed by Anderson and Kelly, by rea
eon of Congressional recognition, has no appli
cation berr. since the adoption of the primary
law in 1U01.
Commissioner Devoto outlined the
findings of the Election Commissioners
as follows:
In this case we are of the opinion that only
one of these petition? can be rccojrnlzed. The
RUKKCstion by Colonel Eddy that the Beard of
Election Commissioners could recognize both
parties and order both parties to be placed upon
the official ballot cannot for a moment be.
countenanced, as such d^ision would cer

Prior to his arrest for vagrancy night
before last" at Third and Townsend
streets John McCarthy, had ,been run in
no less than five times from the same
place and on the same charge.
"You are guilty again, John,"; said
Judge Mogan, "but your sentence is
deferred until to-morrow, because I
cannot at once decide' what you are
entitled to. Pray, why do you concen
trate your vagrancy at "Third; and
Townsend streets : when there is much
urban territory that you might dis

For distributing milk that contained
more water than the law allows A.
Furer^was arrested by Food Inspector
Misli and arraigned before Judge Mo
gan. The defendant denied that the
milk seized by the officer was defective
In either strength or purity, and asked
for. a continuance until he could pro
duce expert testimony to prove his
plea. ' >
"I'll continue the case until Satur
day," said the court, "but I don't know
of any better expert " testimony than
that of the Health Department ana
lysts who examined the milk In ques
tion." -
Then Clerk Grey whispered to the
bench that perhaps Mr. Furer intended
to introduce as experts some of the
babes of his customers, but the "bench
scornfully flouted the idea.
1 Patrolmen Small and Clancy were
â¢ also in plain clothes when they drop
! ped into the little grocery kept by
I Mrs. Mary Jane Barrett, widow, at 311
Seventh street, and induced her to sell
to them a drink of whisky, although
she was not licensed to dispense spir
ituous liquors. In her defense before
< Judge Cabaniss the woman said that
i the late Chief of Police Sullivan had
tallowed her to sell drinks because he
i knew of her widowhood and her five
i young children and realized that she
had a hard struggle to make a living
for them. The Judge did not relish
the duty 'that compelled him to fine
Mrs. Barrett ten dollars, nor were the
two policemen in love with their task
of prosecuting the woman.
Patrolman Jenkins wps in plain at
tire when he dropped several nickels
into the slot of a machine that graces
the counter of P. H. Posner's cigar
store, on Hayes street, and then ar
rested Mr. Posner because the device
was unlicensed. Judge Mogan opined
that it was not necessary to invest
nickels to ascertain whether the ma
chine was licensed or not, and then
dismissed Mr. Posner after that gentle
man had promised to immediately
clothe it with legal protection against
predatory policemen.
Judge Fritz roundly reprimanded the
defendants and then dismissed them
after they had promised to be good. â¢
Various reliable witnesses informed
Judge Fritz that Comedians Kolb and
Dill never held more excited debate
nor fractured the English language
more ruthlessly than did Adolph Con
rad and Andrew Grottman during sev
eral evenings this week on the 200
block of Union street. Though much
of their dialect was unintelligible, said
these same witnesses, enough of it was
understood to shock the religious
sense of- neighbors and drive them
within doors when they desired to re
main basking on their front stoops. â¢
The Conrads and the Grottmans
dwell directly opposite each other, and
despite the fact that both families are
of Teutonic birth and breeding* they
entertain an intense mutual dislike. So
long as they remained in their respec
tive domiciles the neighborhood was
not afflicted with their enmity, but
when the hot weather came and outer
balconies and stairways befeame de
sirable lounging places a storm of vi
tuperation broke and raged with the
result hereinbefore stated. As Mr. Con
rad and Mr. Grottman sat in the midst
of their respective families they hurled
epithets across the street that fairly
ultramarined the intervening atmos
phere, and to quell the blasphemous
tirades a horrified policeman arrested
the authors.
The green-eyed monster also pos
sessed Julia Alloy, a comely little ex-
Parisienne, when she accused Peter
Pastrino, also formerly of the boule
vards, of absconding with cash and
jewels belonging to her. She unblush
ingly informed Judge Cabaniss that
the property in question did not be
long to her, but was a portion of
Peter's stock in trade, he being a
huckster of gewgaws. Then the court
wrested from her an admission that
she had the man arrested and brought
back from Los Angeles simply because
she had reason to believe that a coun
try woman of hers was trying to alien
ate his affections. The Judge hinted
at perjury, but Julia ingenuously de
clared that when she swore to the
complaint she really believed she was
telling the truth.
"They do most things better in
France." wearily sighed his Honor as
he entered an order of dismissal.
Julia and Peter went forth arm in
arm.
So severely, affected with jealousy is
the brain of Charles Gale that a frac
ture of the skull failed to have any
eliminative â¢' effect whatever. . He
escaped from the Receiving Hospital,
where he was under treatment for
the ailment mentioned, and proceeded
to the Fourth-street bakery, in which
the object of his distorted adoration,
Miss Clara Goodman, is employed as
clerk, and there threatened to take her
life if she did not abstain from be
stowing smiles upon one Herbert Wilt.
The young woman was so badly scared
by her adorer's appearance and de
meanor that she pledged herself to
reserve all blandishments for .him
alone, and thus mollified he returned
to his cot in the hospital.
That was the story told to Judge
Mogan, before whom the aforesaid
Herbert Wilt was yesterday arraigned
for administering the blow that
knocked down the aforementioned
Charles Gale, whose skull was frac
tured by its impact with* the sidewalk.
The Judge thereupon continued the
case ' till to-day, when Gale may be
able to attend court.
Wilt and Miss Goodman were walk
ing'along Mission street last Saturday
evening, when Gale accosted the girl
and upbraided her in language that
was anything but chaste. She denied
the willful flirtations that he accused
her of, and he slapped her face. Then
her escort promptly knocked him
down and was arrested for battery.
At the hospital it is reported that
though the injury to Gale's skull is
not necessarily fatal, it has not en
hanced his clearness of mind any more
than it has subdued what seems to be
a hopeless passion.
Ah Sam's left optic was knocked out
of commission by a straight punch
from ' Charles Kirchner's ! right fist
while the twain were fellow .passen
gers on the ferry-boat Berkeley night
before last, and when Ah Sam appeared
in Judge Mo-gan's court yesterday
morning to prosecute a battery charge
against his assailant the damaged or
gan was deeply discolored and much
swollen.
"Why did he hit you?" inquired the
Judge, and "He fightee my eye" was
the only enlightenment that Ah Sam
could furnish.
The defendant said that Ah Sam and
a compatriot were about to attack him,
when he prematurely. struck out in de
fense, and that" he1r,eally did not know
why they were going to "do him up."
Decision reserved till. to-day...

R. H. Souden, a chauffeur, took Harry
McDonald aboard his auto and gave
him a free spin through the park and
along the beach, and Harry showed
his appreciation uf the treat by pur
chasing sundry drinks for R. H. Sou
den. While thfey were imbibing in a
boulevard saloon .Harry slipped out,
hoarded the machine, grasped the lever,
turned on the power and whirled away
until the vehicle broke down. Along
came one of the owners of the crip
pled chug-chug, recc-gnized it, asked
Harrv where he got it and was can
didly informed that it had been stolen.
Grand larceny was the charge booked
against Harry.
"I said I stole the auto because I
wanted to shield Souden," was Harry's
plea before Judge Cabaniss. "I knew
he was not allowed to take fellows
riding for nothing, and I was afraid
he would lose his job if I told the
truth"
"You're telling it now, I hope," said
the Judge. â¢
"Indeed I am," said Harry.
"Continued till next Saturday," said
the Judge.
Judge Mogan took under advisement
the battery case of James Liapis, fruit
dealer at 254 Fourth stre.et, against
F.'.-R. Varni, employe of a commission
house at Front and Washington streets.
Some boys drove away .a horse and
wagon that were standing near Varni's
place, of employment, and Varni ac
cused Liapis of stea.'ing the team and
emphasized the accusation by punch
ing his face. The contending parties
are of flery Latin temperament and
their vehemence while testifying made
the welkin ring and impelled Bailiff
Hickey to rap for order.
â¢ ". Â¦ â¢ , . â¢
Then the expressman demanded for his
services the sum of $1 50, which Mr.
Wasercork pronounced extortionate
and declined . to pay, . and an , ensuing
heated argument between the express
man and Mr. Wasejcork was abruptly
interrupted by Robert Peters striking
Mr.'.Wasercork on the face. Arrest for
battery. ...
-"Why did you butt in with your bat
tery?" Judge Cabaniss asked Robert
Peters. . : ;-. ' "
"I didn't." was the reply of Robert
Peters. "This man Wasercork struck
me because I started to .return the fur
niture to the wagon after he had re
fused to pay. the expressman." .
"Butters-in usually get the worst of
it," the Judge remarked, "and the evi
dence here shows conclusively that you
butted in. . I'll ' sentence you to-mor
row." '.-'I _-;.

EXPERIENCE
In the Treatment of Humours
with More Than Magical
Effect with
CUTICURA REMEDIES.
A Remarkable Testimonial from
a Most Intelligent and
Trustworthy Lady.
Â«â¢ A tnmor came on my neck and In a
<!a7 or two It as large as half an
or&oge. I was very mncb alarmed for
fear it malignant. My friends
tried to peraoade me to consult my
physician ; but dreading that he would
insist on twins the knife, I would not
consent to go. Instead, I got Catlcura
I Besolvent and Cnticnra Ointment. I
; took the former according to dlrec*
\ tlons, and spread a, thick layer of the
'Â¦ Ointment on tho swelling. On renew*
â¢ icÂ£ it I would bathe my ceck in very
' warm water and Cut'.cura Soap. In a
few days the Cuticura Ointment had
t drawn the swelling to a head, when it
{broke. Every morning it was opened
f a large 6terilized neeOle, squeezed
tand bathed, and fresh Ointment put
I on. Pbs and blood, and a yellow,
vcbe^iT. tnmoron* matter came ont. In
f nbont" three or Jonr weeks' time this
! treatment completely eliminated the
tnmor. The soreness that had ex-
tended down into my chest was all
pone, and my neck now seems to r-a
per 'ret! j well
â¢' About flre or six years ago ray pIr-
t*r bad a similar experience, used the
Cuticura Remedies with magical effect.
