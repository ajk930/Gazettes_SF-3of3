R. N.'Bulla of Los Angeles has had
aspirations for some time to be elected

some attention, but he withdrew from
the contest - with the understanding
that at the August convention he would
be named as Presidential elector. The
inllcations are the selection of the en

The committee, on resolutions has
been overwhelmed with work, and to
relieve it of its burden a sub-committee

H. H. Asquith summed up for the
opposition and what was something
of a storm in a teacup ended with a
vote of 251 to 306, defeating Black's
motion.
Then Chamberlain reiterated that
he did not wish to raise the fiscal ques
tion In the House. He said he sup
ported the Government and would
continue to do so. He hoped that the
Premier would take his own time to
carry out his policy.
Balfour said his , Sheffield speech
still represented the advice he would
give to the country if asked to-morrow
to give an election address. With a
touch of passion the Premier, amid
loud Ministerial cheers, repudiated
Lord Hugh Cecil's charge of cowardice
against Chamberlain, saying that Lord
Hugh was "the man to be accused of
lack of courage."
ACCUSATION OF COWARDICE.
At last there was comparative quiet
and then Lord Hugh Cecil, with much
heat and amid a great uproar, ac
cused Chamberlain of cowardice la
dodging the Issue by refusing to meet
his opponents In the House on the
campaign .which he had preached
throughout the country.
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach threw a
bombshell into the free food camp by
announcing that he would not sup
port Black's motion.
Twenty-one Unionist free traders
voted against the Government, but
more than double that number would
have done so but for Balfour's skillful
intervention between Chamberlain and
his opponents.
The net result of the debate, which
crowded the House of Commons to a
greater extent than it has been In this
session, Is that all parties stand as
they were. Sir Michael Hicks-Beach
and his Immediate following prac
tically saved the day by refusing to
vote with "Winston Churchill. Lord
George Hamilton, Lord Hugh. Cecil
and other more ardent Unionist free
traders- against Balfour.
In the course of debate Lord Hugh
Cecil, in scathing satire, denounced
the policy of his cousin, the Premier.
Chamberlain interrupted him . and
then a storm of Interruptions and
cries of "order" rose from the Radical
and Liberal branches. Chamberlain
sat down and twice the speakers ap
pealed to the members to give the
former Colonial Secretary a hearing.
PARTY STATUS UNCHANGED.
The Premier adhered to his policy
as outlined In his recent Sheffield
speech.
LONDON, May 18. â By a majority
of 55 Premier Balfour to-night suc
cessfully defeated an attempt to upset
the Government upon the fiscal ques
tion. An interesting debate, charac
terized by some heated exchanges,
took place, resulting ir> the Premier's
reiterated determination to shelve the
question of fiscal reform until the
next Parliament. In this decision Jo
seph Chamberlain publicly concurred.
The motion upon which the ques
tion came up was made by Alexander
W. Black, memb.er_ from Banffshire.
Scotland, and an advanced Liberal,
welcoming the Ministerial declarations
that "protective taxation of food
would be burdensome to the people
and injurious to the empire." In pur
pose the motion was intended to cen
sure Chamberlain and the latter'3
amendment to it would have split up
the Unionist party and possibly would
have : in the defeat of the
Government.
Balfour's own amendment to shelv<Â»
the question left a middle course open
to the members of the Unionist party
and, although the amendment was not
put, the House accomplished the de
feat of Black's Indirect censure on the
ground that It was not now necessary
to discuss the fiscal Question.

been 146 men.
The official reDort of the landing of
the- second Japanese army has been re

"The army arrived at the pre
arranged place on May 5, and, under
cover of the navy, began landing at 8
o'clock in the morning. None of the

MENTO, May 18.â Harmony reigns in
the Republican camp. The orchestra In
the assembly chamber renders sweet and
alluring music before and after prayer.
Fair singers with. inspiring voices sing
the national hymn and the liberty-lov
ing, law-abiding and peace-promoting
Republicans Join in the singing. â¢ It is
so different from the Santa Cruz con
vention, where Jaw bury Jones /raved
and Hutchinson Imagined vain things;
where even the musicians of the Angel
Island band were not permitted to ride
in the Hearst band wagon. The dele
gates and spectators to-day were'en
thusiastic to a high degree. Whenever
the name of Theodore Roosevelt was
mentioned a mighty round of applause
was the response * of " the ' audience.
Judge A. G. Burnett, who was chosen
chairman, added to his laurels, as ; a
polished speaker and also won cora-

of the committees on organization! cre

Many of the eminent party leaders
are on the ground and freely partici
pate in the harmony. Â¦ Black Hayes and
Johnny Mackenzie breathe the same
kind of air and A. Ruef makes no
reference whatever to â¢ Judge McKin

The harmony, is so all absorbing that
the Alameda delegation can find noth

to defer the selection of district dele

The committee on temporal economy
this afternoon decided to recommend
to the General Conference of the Meth
odist Episcopal Church, now in session
here, that the size of future G#ieral
Conferences be reduced from a basis of
2 delegates to every 45 members of an
nual conferences to a basis of 2 for
every 60 members. This would reduce
the size of General Conferences to 550
members, instead /of 750 members, on
the basis of the present church mem
bership.

eral impatience to hear the tellers' an
nouncement. Hearty applause greeted
the appearance of the tellers on the
floor and this quickly subsided to ab
solute quiet when their report was
handed to Presiding Bishop Merrill for
announcement. A storm of applause
vrh4h the first words of the report,
showing Dr. Berry elected by a vote
of 531 â 44- more than the number neces
sary to a choice â fell from the Bishop's
lips. After the reading of the entire

ber, a second ballot was ordered and
at once proceeded with. Upon retire
ment of the tellers the conference ad

Gut Fong, the Chinese woman who
was stabbed by a highbinder Tuesday
night as she was returning to her home
at 19 Baker alley from a theater, died
from the effects of her wounds at sun
rise yesterday morning. The police
have succeeded in learning the identity
of her assailant and Detective George
McMahc/n expects to have him behind
prison bars before he finds a chance
to leave the city.
The murder of the woman was a
most brutal one. According to infor
mation received. Duck Gon, a notori
ous character in the heathen district,
wielded an ugly-looking dagger white
two of hi3 accomplices held the victim.
Gut Fong was stabbed many times
and as soon as she was released ran a
few steps and fell in a pool of her own
blood. Death came a few hours later.
The woman was the proprietress of a
bagnio in the alley and her husband is
at present In China. For some tims
past tribute has been levied upon her
by highbinders, but when the extortion
became too severe she refused to meei
with the demands of the blackmailers
any further. When this decision be
came known her life was threatened
and taken.

TACOMA, Wash., May 18.â Dr. A. E.
Disbrow of Crelghton, Neb., has been
arrested at Sioux City, charged with
defrauding J. H. Hanna of Bellingham
out of $7000 by selling him a "whisky
cure" formula. â¢ The purchaser claims
the cure was simply morphia, which
buoyed up the alcoholic-soaked spirits
of the inebriate long enough to make
him willing to part with his money.
Hanna bought a third interest in DIs
brow's proposed company for $3000, and
later bought another partner's interest
for $4000, thus sinking $7000. This
transaction occurred nearly two years
ago. Last year Disbrow defeated an
attempt to extradite him from NeV
braska on technical grounds. He Is

corpus.

Fixty-six votes, stated to the confer

Hughes of Kansas City and forty
eight for Rev. William Bird.
'MUCH INTEREST DISPLAYED.
It was practically a foregone con
clusion that Dr. J. F. Berry would be
named as one of the eight Bishops to
be elected, and it was no surprise to
the delegates when it was announced
that he had been elected by a decisive
inajorltiy on the first ballot. Dr. Bar
ry received an ovation when the fig-
Tires were announced, the entire as
sembly rising and applauding him as
he was escorted to a sea.t among the
Bishops on the platform.
There were scofes of complimentary
votes, ranging from one to ten, in
many cases, and from that up to twen

Atlanta, 242.
These were the leaders in the voting,
the others ranging from the numbers
given down to one vote. Inasmuch as
eight names appeared upon each ballot,
the work of counting the vote was as
difficult as counting the precinct vote at
almoFt any election. The ballots were
not counted until i> o'clock this after
noon. Long before the counting was
completed it was known that only one
election had resulted and the delegates
took another ballot. It was unani
mously acneed that the tellers should
count this second ballot to-night and
announce the result to the conferencs
to-morrov.\
. The' first ballot taken for Bishop
by the conference resulted in the
election of only one aspirant, Rev;
Joseph F. Berry, editor of the Epworth
Herald. In accordance with- the rec
ommendations of the- committee on
episcopacy, Â¦ the delegates were in
structed to vote for eight candidates.
This let the bars down and the-'dele
gates were free to vole for whom they
pleased. The result was that more
than 100 persons were voted for. It re
quired 487 votes to elect and Dr. Berry
was ihe only one who received that
number. His vote was 531.

f^ome pf them, however, sent their
congratulations to Drs. McDowell and
Spellmeyer and thus the result becamo
known. What the vote was will not
be announced until the general confer

official announcement made by the

PORTLAND, Ore., May 18.â Under
moFt mystifying circumstances Mrs.
Ge'orge H.' Hall and her ten-months
old, baby boy suddenly, disappeared in
Portland upon the afternoon of Wed
nesday, May 4. Day and night since
that time the husband, George H.
Hall, an attorney at St. Helens, has
searched for the missing woman and
their child. Chief Hunt and his police
force, along with private detectives,
are also working upon th^ case, but
no clew has been found, and to-day
the mystery is as deep as before the
search began.
The suicide theory has been discuss
ed by the husband, but he dreads to
think, that his wife would have com
mitted self-destruction along with her
baby and does not believe this solu
tion possible.
"I am nearly like a crazy man," said
Hall to-day, as he left the police sta
tion after asking whether any trace
had been found of the missing woman.
"If I do not find her* soon I shall surely
po mad. I have been hunting her day
and night since a week ago Sunday.
She had no occasion to leave her home,
as everything was comfortable for her
and we never had any trouble."
The last that was seen of the woman
was at 2:30 o'clock, when she arrived
from Oregon City upon the afternoon
of May 4. She came in with her moth
er. Mrs. H. C. Carmack. When the
woman, with her baby, left the car
at First and Taylor streets she start
ed for the wharf, where she intended
to board the steamer Mascot and leave
for St. Helens. She told her mother
that she was going straight home. She
said her husband was to meet her here
in Portland and they would go home
together.

The second scene occurs in the
Tower of London. . The Rev. Henry
Garriett visits Fawkes in disguise and
administers him the consolations of

Fawkes is tortured upon the rack In
the hope that he will implicate the
priest, but to no avail. Cecil then
forges documents and orders Father
Garnett to be executed. The execu

yard of St. Paul's, London, is the
theme of the great fifth act and pro
duces a wonderful climax to the play.
The third act represents the cellar
beneath the House of Lords, where
Guy Fawkes is preparing to light the

SANTA CLARA, May 18.â The pres
entation of the great religious drama,
"Henry Garnett, Priest and Martyr."
written byfaev. D. J. Kavanaugh, S. J.,
a member of the faculty of Santa Clara
College, is awaited with deep interest.
Martin V. Merle, who so -successfully
directed the production of the Passion
Play, is Btlll a student at the college,
and is nightly engaged in rehearsing
the cast of 100 persons who are to take
part in the new play. The. proceeds of
the production are to be devoted to
the McKinnon Memorial Fund, and it
is confidently expected that a large
sum will be realized. The Southern
Pacific Company will run special trains
to and from San Francisco on the
evening of May 26, when the drama will
be produced in the auditorium of Santa
Clara College.
"Henry Garnett" Is the result of
years of patient labor on the part of
Father Kavanaugh, and is the first
dramatic production of his gifted pen.
Father Kavanaugh has already shown
considerable literary talent, and his
friends predict that his dramatic work
will prove a great success. The drama
is based on a historical occurrenceâ
the famous English gunpowder plot â
and tends to establish the Innocence of
Father Garnett from any complicity
in the crime. The text follows close
along the lines of history and in many
places the actual word3 of the conspir
ators in the plot are quoted. The first
act opens in an English inn, with a
number of pursuivants (priest hunters)
seated at gaming tables. Father Gar
nett, disguised as a traveler, enters the
room, but is soon suspected by the
pursuivants, who leave to make ar
rangements to effect his capture.
English soldier's are summoned and
while they are breaking down the
front doors of the inn Father Garnett
makes his escape.
The second act shows a secluded
spot on the River Thames. The con
spirators assemble to draw up plans
for the carrying out of their plot.
Percy, a supposed conspirator, but In
reality an asent of Prime Minister
Cecil, joins the band and listens to
the details. It is here that Catesby,
the leader of the conspirators, wish
ing to strengthen . the spirits of his
confederates, tells the lie that Father
Garnett has approved *the . plan and
thus gives out the only evidence upon
which the Jesuit is afterward con
demned to death.

James W. Maguire, for years in the
San Francisco Custom-house, is here
as special examiner of the United
States Government and has charge of
the appraisement of all World's Fair
exhibits. He "and his assistants are

In hardwoods the Philippines are
pre-eminent. A display Is made by
these new United States possessions
that will be one of the marvels of the
exposition when it is thrown op.en to
the public on May 28. Many varieties
of -wood as hard as rock are shown in
the display, which is rapidly being put
in place in the large nipa-thatched
buildings erected by the natives. The
hard slabs, upon many of which ex
pert American polishers are still at
work, look at a little distance like
stone. Some specimens were lost
through their dropping overboard and
sinking during the effort to load them
on the vessel that brought them to
San Francisco. Among the specimens
that people will marvel at and that
will arouse the cupidity of the always
absorbing syndicate are a slab of
cedar 36 feet long and C feet wide and
a slab of molave 10 by 10 feet square
and 2'4 inches thick. The latter slab
was 5 inches thick and it took two
Chinese in the Philippines a week to
saw it into halves.
The redwood burl is the most prom
inent of the woods used in the ex
hibit. There are many Californians,
even, who do not know Just what this
burl is. It is an immense knot that
grows near the foot of many redwoods,
some of them so large that boards
several feet across can be cut from
them. The redwood burl is very hard,
beautifully colored and susceptible of
a polish that dazzles the eye. No two
are alike in the grain. The colorings
are very warm and rich. Cut twenty
thicknesses' to an inch, the polished
burl makes a decorative veneer or
panel that cannot be excelled. It is
finding its way more and more into
the interior decorations of homes be

in this country and in Europe, and the
object of the display here is to still
further familiarize the world with Its
beauties and lead to the utilization of
the great Quantity of burls now. lying

done his work.
There is nothing more beautiful in
all the Forestry building than this
California display. Besides the glow
ing burls there are many other sorts
of polished woods that shine like A

gallery. Redwood doors and casings
are also shown.

BURLS ARE INTERESTING.
ST. LOUIS, May 18.â The World's
Fair city is now and has been for
some time furnishing a brand of
weather that thoroughly pleases even
the Californians. The days are as
balmy as the pleasant ones of the
California winter and the people from
the Golden State are beginning to feel
at home. St. Louis Is redeeming her
self in the. matter of weather and
making up for the unpleasant variety
she supplied before the opening of the
fair. Whenever the elements behave
badly here the "very unusual" of the
St. Louisans sounds like an echo
from Californiaâ where the occasional
hailstorm or cloudburst brings those
same words of apology to the stranger.
It does seem, though, as If it's "very
unusual" much oftener here.
California's forestry display is one
of the handsome exhibits of the fair.
W. H. Mills is chief of this depart
ment. He ia not here, but the mate
rial for the display was collected un
der his direction by Thomas Hatch, the
"wizard of the woods," whose work in
this line is well known in San Fran
cisco through displays made by him
at fairs there. To Hatch the trees
talk almost. There is a language for
him in -the rustle of their leaves and
the crackling of the twigs. No X-ray
is needed by him to tell what is in
their trunks. "What the bark shows
the wood must bear," he savs. The
old woodsman gazes into the very
hearts of these, his children, and knows
what the saw will bring j to light.
Among the curious figures 'on pieces
in his collection are the "Dutchman
and his pipe," "the human foot" and
the "face of Melba." He is going to
write a book on wood lore some day
and tell all the family secrets of the
trees. >
Pearce is going to invite all the St.
Louis youths who have an ambition to
be President to bring their hatchets
around and take the Initial degree.
Ex-Queen Lilluokalani is attracting
some attention at the fair. On the first
day of her arrival her dark skin creat
ed consternation among the guests at
the Inside Inn, where she is stopping.
When, with her party, she took a seat
in the dining-room the Southerners
who saw her rose in indignation. "The
Hawaiian Queen," whispered the wait
ers hurriedly, and the guests resumed
their seats.
And the representative from Saline
left Pearce sitting dazed on his cherry
stump while he went oVer to his own
exhibit and superintended the erection
of a derrick to be used in elevating the
ear to be used as the apex of Missouri's
corn column.
Hall wandered across the border into
California the other day, and after
gettingT)y Brown's web ran up against
Pearce of Alameda, who called his at
tention to a cherry tree stump two- feet
in diameter taken from the Meek place
at Hay wards. ..
"What did they cut the tree down
for?" asked the .Misspurian. \ .
"It wasn't having a satisfactory
growth," replied Pearce. "They have
to pull those small ones out and put in
healthy trees."
"Wonderful," said Hall. , "Something
remarkable how "things, will grow in a
fertile sol!. Reminds me of our corn.
The only difference with us is that we
don't want it to do its best. There's a
law now against planting any within
a hundred yards of a river because if it
falls down it impedes steamboat traffic.
Some lumber mill men were out here
from California last year and they
tried to gather up a few hundred thou
sand square miles of our standing corn,
thinking it was a sugar pine ' forest.
We never dare to feed it whole to hogs
because they choke on the kernels. I'll
come over and talk to you later about
your newest methods for curbing vege
table growth that is so great as to be
come a nuisance."
JOKERS IX COMP12TITIO;*.
Missouri and California are becoming
quite chummy. The space of the
mother State of the fair and that of
California adjoin and such a condition
of familiarity has resulted that they
exchange tack hammers and swap
hasheeshes about fertility of soil ; and
wonders of products. Matt W. Hall,
who is superintending the Installation
of the Missouri exhibit. Is a six-footer
of genial disposition, who seems to af
filiate naturally with the Golden State
boomers. He says he is going to make
Mlssourians of them and they declare
they are going to make him a Califor
nian. Mr. Hall is the legislative father
of the exposition. He has served for
years in the State Legislature, from
Saline County, where he is a large
farmer, and has introduced all the ex
position bills, including the one au
thorizing St Louis to bond itself for
$5,000,000.
Dr. Waters, dean of the Missouri
State Agricultural College and Com
missioner for Missouri, is also rapidly
becoming a Californian.
George P. Linden, who was In charge
of the Argentine Republic display at
the Chicago Fair, and for the last ten
years has been connected with the
Philadelphia Commarcial Museum, is
curator of the Philippine exhibit, hav
ing been sent by the Government to
the islands sixteen months ago to
gather' the material. He Is familiar
with every one of the almost innumer
able articles brought over, though it
looks as if one mind couldn't grasp
them all.
rlety and distracting In name. The
Government practically goes through
the process of paying a duty to itself.
A World's Fair Is a great bonded
warehouse. Foreign goods are ap
praised and display Is allowed, out
duty is charged on everything, sold.
There is some work for the customs
men to do. Mr. Maguire was chosen
for his arduous post from applicants
among the brightest men in the ser
vice all over the country and natur
ally feels complimented.
Edmund A. Felder, who was con
nected with the Midwinter Fair in
San Francisco, is executive officer of
the Philippine exposition board. He
has an office in the main building on
the grounds and directs all the work
of Installation. His home is now in
Philadelphia, but he remembers
pleasantly the Midwinter Fair and the
old days in San Francisco.

Nome. Within two years Nome- has
dug about a hundred miles of ditches

opens an immense field for hydraulic
mining when it is considered that Cali

dirt which runs but 6 cents per cubic

at Nome is such that twice as much
gravel can be handled with the same
amount of water. Dr. â¢ Whitehead

STOCKTON, May 18. â Dr. T. W.
Stone, a well known physician, yes
terday swore to a complaint charging
his wife, Mattie Stone, with insanity.
Dr. Stone states that nig wife has been
suffering from dementia for the past
eight years and that two years ago he
sent her back to Her relatives in Red
Oak, Ohio, in the hope that she, would
recover. He believed that she was in
Ohio until Monday afternoon, when
he was startled upon walking into his
office to find Mrs. Stone seated in a
chair, waiting for him. She made the
trip of several thousand miles back
to this State and could not explain
how she got here, 'except that "her
enemies brought .her."
Upon inquiry Dr. Stone learned that
she had been brought to this city by
a man and woman. At the Southern
Pacific depot they turned her over to
a hackman, with instructions to take
her to Dr. Stone's ' office. The man
and woman have disappeared and Dr.
Stone is at a loss to explain the mys
tery.' 'Â¦ ;Â¦';'â¢''
Several weeks ago, so Dr. Stone
states, he received word that his de
mented wife was getting no better.
He sent back instructions to put her
in ah asylum in Ohio, but the Ohio
institutions would not accept her upon
the ground that she was a resident of
California. Mrs. Stone was taken to
the detention hospital.
Kays She Has Been Demented for
Years nnd Has Her Sent to
Detention Hospital.

Again the artful art, the â¢ cunning

Mr. Mansfield's repertoire is "Old Hel- j

But as clearly, brilliantly as the actor
paints the romance and idealism of

he incredibly stamp out the loathsome I

CHEFU. May 18. â A fleet of junks

banker is too realistic â they would
have stoned him at the Central.
After the death scene, however, now
historic, the audience dared another
sermon on the beflttlngness of sum
moning a dead man to the front to ex
press their appreciation. And the
actor? It was Baron Chevrial that
died, but it was Mansfield himself, in
person, who came a moment later to
smile his thanks for the greeting. You
can't catch the Mansfield art napping!
Even more remarkable, perhaps, than
the contrast between the youth of
Prince Karl and the ignoble age of the
Baron Chevrial, as Mansfield sees them,
is his differentiation of the senility of
the Russian tyrant and of the Paris
ian roue. Both are sharpened by the
exercise of irresponsible power, but
one is medievalism, the other incar
nate modernity. This and all other
phases of the character are infallibly
suggested.
Touch on touch, sensitive, firm, Gal
lically light, the portrait grows with a
cool creeplness into a picture of the
profounds of corruptions. The physi
cal decay is painfully pictured, with
absolutely convincing effect. Its cul
mination in the death scene, where,
with a certain courage, the Baron
holds high festival in. spite of his ill
ness, gives the portrait still a most
potent thrill. But It Is throughout su
perb, compelling, art at its highest
power.

acceptable. Miss Conquest has the

LIAOYANG, May 18.â The northern
wing of the Japanese army, moving
from Fenwangcheng, has occupied
Haiyangtsen, forty-five miles north
east of Fengwangcheng.
A division of guards which was.mov

NEW YORK. May 18.â A large pro
portion of the male population of New
market, N. J.. awoke to-day svith heads
several sizes" too large for their hats
as a result of a great and gorgeous
banquet given by "Mayor Bill" Smith
in commemoration of the final settle
ment whereby he, his half brother,
Abraham Nelson, and other relatives
get a considerable part of the Charles
L. Fair millions. Mrs. Caroline D. Fair
was Smith's full sister.
Yesterday everybody in central New
Jersey was asking: "How much did
they get?" "Bill" Smith, filled with
the milk of human kindness and sun
dry bottles of champagne, \ the most
popular man in that part of the State
and who looks forward to a nomina
tion for Congress one of these days,
confided to his friends that the certi
fied check he received at what Is be
lieved to be his aged mother's death
bed was for $585,000. It was also as
serted that Abraham Nelson received
a like amount.
Neither weuld tell the exact amount,
but if their statement is accurate, the
settlement of the Fair estate by Mrs.
Oelrichs and Mrs. W. K. Vanderbilt Jr.
far exceeds the $1,500,000 estimate orig
inally made. It was said that the set

also went down.
The thirteen Russians claim to have
received their information from the
commanding officer at Dalny, who
showed them, they assert, a telegram
from Port Arthur stating that the
bombardment commenced at 1 o'clock
Monday afternoon and that two hours
later the Shikishlma struck the mine
and was soon at the bottom. During
the confusion that followed, according
to the story told, the Asama also struck
on a mine and was taken in tow but
was settling so fast that it was found
necessary to abandon her.
A number of Russian torpedo boats
went out, but the Japanese " received
reinforcements and the Russians re
tired.
To-day's arrivals say that the en
trance to Port Arthur was blocked, but
one of the sunken steamers was re

it is still dangerous and the Russian
fleet has been ordered to "remain in

The dispatch was gratifying to the
authorities, not only for the news it
contained, but because its receipt
established the fact that while the
telegraph line is severed a system of
communication by means of Chinese
runners has been instituted. In order
to deliver the Liaoyang dispatches en
trusted to him the runner had to pass
through the Japanese lines already
thrown around the narrow neck of
the peninsula, just above Port Ar
thur, for the purpose of cutting off all
communication between General
The Admiralty to-day received an
official dispatch from Rear Admiral
Wittsoeft, believed to have been dated
from Port Arthur. May 14. reporting
that there had been no fighting afloat
since the telegraph line was cut, the
Japanese ships not having attacked.
Everything was well with the Russian
squadron.
The same letters ascribe the rever
ence of the Russians for the overcoat
of the late Vice Admiral Makaroff
when it was taken from the water.
On its approach they bared their
heads, made the sign of the cross and
prayed for the repose of the admiral's
soul.
The Admiralty is now convinced by
mail reports received from Port Ar
thur that Vice Admiral Togo used sub
marine boats in his operations. A let
ter from Lieutenant General Stoessel
says he was standing on Golden Hill
when the Russian battleship Petropav
lovsk went down and he saw a sub
marine boat torpedo the battleship.
Lieutenant Schreiber claims he dis
tinctly saw the periscope of a subma
rine boat and could trace the course Of
the vessel. Officers of the Russian
battleship Pobieda testified that a sub
marine boat discharged a torpedo
against their ship and they fired at the
submarine boat, hoping to sink it, but
failed.
Kuropatkin's decision to withdraw
from Liaoyang can only mean, accord
ing to experts, that there will continue
to be affairs of outposts unless another
General Zassulitch should develop. The
controlling strategic point at Haicheng
will not be held, as believed, Kuropat
kin deciding it to be unwise to isolate
more tr<5ops who would, not being as
well supplied as those at Port Arthur,
find it difficult to subsist until relief
arrives.
TOGO USES SUBMARINE BOAT.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 18.âCon
firming the intimations that it is Gen
eral Kuropatkln's purpose to avoid a
decisive combat with the Japanese at
the present stage of the war, the state
ment was made by the General Staff
to-day that tht c ommander in chief
is making preparations to fall back on
Mukden and then on Harbin.
While the superior numbers of the
enemy compel a retirement, it does not
follow that General Kuropatkin will not
strike a stinging blow, should a strat
egical mistake be made which will en
able him to throw a strong army upon
one of the advancing columns of his
antagonists. The most exposed portion
of General Kuroki's command is that
which moved directly northward, evi
dently with the intention of gaining the
road to Mukden, down which it will
march as soon as the other columns are
within supporting distance. Unless
raution. heretofore the conspicuous
feature of the Japanese campaign, is
observed, this column, it is believed
here, will fall the victim of its temerity,
as General Kuropatkin is known to be
holding it especially under close sur
veillance.
Tchanzalin Pass and they evacuated
Sellutchen, proceeding toward Feng
wangcheng. The Japanese are con
structing field works in the vicinity of
Fengwangcheng.
"Japanese detachments which form
erly occupied the village of Itkout
chindza,-twelve miles northwest of Tu
kushan, have departed and Takushan
also has been evacuated. Small Jap
anese patrols appear from time to time
in the vicinity of Suzan."
SHOT INSTEAD OF HANGED.
Both prisoners were executed on
April 21 between the new and old
towns of Harbin in the presence of a
large crowd. They were shot instead
of hanged, upon order of General Ku
rcpatkin. A strong guard was thrown
about the spot to hold back the pub
lic at a distance of 400 yards. No pho
tographs <vere allowed to be taken.
The younger prisoner refused to al
low the bandaging of his eyes. When
told it was necessary, according to
Russian law, he asked that an excep
tion be made in his favor. The elder
Japanese, a staff officer, wept and
fainted, but finally allowed himself to
be blindfolded calmly. One of the
men was a Cathalic and made his final
confession to a Russian priest, there
being no representative of the Catholic
priesthood in Harbin.
One of the reasons for the desperate
effort of the Russians to get to Port
Arthur what is officially called an
"ammunition train," has been revealed
by information which leaked out to
day. There was little need, it appears,
for more ammunition, great quantities
being stored in the fortress, but Gen
eral Stoessel is exceedingly anxious to
be provided with balloons. The high
est point of the fortress is the Eagle's
Nest, from which much of the sur
rounding country can be seen, but bal
loons will facilitate observation. Be
fore the war the Russian authorities
loaded on a vessel a complete balloon
equipment for Manchuria, but it was
captured by the Japanese, who will
use it in their operations against Port
Arthur. Recognizing the need of pro
viding General Stoessel with all the
requisite with which to
conduct the defense of Port Arthur,
General Kuropatkin is believed to
have sent balloons on the "ammuni
tion train." The Russian balloons are
stationary.
"If the Japanese try to drift bal
loons over Port Arthur and drop ex
plosives on the fortress," an officer
said to-day, "the world will hear of
the first battle in the air."
Details have been received here from
Harbin regarding the execution on
April 21 of the two Japanese officers,
Yukoka and Oki, for attempting to
dynamite bridges and destroy tele
graph communication on the Eastern
Chinese Railroad. The prisoners ad
mitted they were part of a detail num
bering 100 men whose purpose it was
to destroy the railroad at various
points. When told that they must
have been extremely brave people,
they replied:
"Not at all. We were only carrying
out our duty and the order of the Mi
kado."

Decision Against Ticket Brokers.
ST. LOUIS, May 18. â Judge Amos
Thayer in the United States Circuit
Court to-day handed down a decision
granting injunctions against the sale
of non-transferrable tickets by ticket
brokers engaged In business In St.
Louis. This is the most pronounced
defeat the ticket brokers have yet re
ceived in their fight to sustain them
selves against the attacks of railroads
centering in St. Louis.
I am astounded that I am to be relieved of

You can all see this by the fine drill the

then report to Washington. I shall appeal to
Secretary Taft, and personally I Â«h411 ask
him to keep mo in command of my battalion.
The reason for the Government or
dering him to return to the Philippines
were never made public, but it was
rumored that he had been lax in keep
ing accounts of certain moneys alloted
to him to defray the expenses of get
ting the 'battalion ready to come to
this country. There was no charge in
any way brought against Carrington
or any suggestion entertained that
there was any misappropriation of
funds. It was reported that he had
simply failfed to return a detailed
statement with vouchers attached to
In speaking of the orders from Wash
ington, Major Carrington said:
IS ASTOUNDED AT ORDERS.
A few days before the battalion was
to start East, telegraphic orders came
from Washington relieving Major Car
rington of his command and ordering
him to report to the commanding- of
ficer in the Philippines. This caused
no end of astonishment in army circles
here, and while the matter was being
discussed, a second order came, coun
termanding the first one, and ordering
Carrington to proceed to St. Louis and
there give up his command and report
to th-e War Department at Washington.
Major Carrington was greatly upset at
these proceedings, and from his usual
jovial manner he suddenly became
morose and downcast.
On April 9 General MacArthur or
dered an inspection and review of the
scouts. A great crowd of spectators
were present and on all sides it was
noticed that Major Carrington ap
peared to be laboring under a state of
great excitement. His manner was so
much at variance with his usual de
meanor that it was noted by the com
manding general.
Major Carrington was congratulated
on all sides both by army officers of
high rank and also by citizens who
went to the post to enjoy and applaud
the remarkable w<gk of the llrtle
brown men who had been drilled un
der his tuition.
CAUUINGTON IS PRAISED.
For several years he was stationed
in the Philippines, and about a year
ago the Government ordered him to
organize a battalion of Filipinos and
bring them over to St. Louis to take
part In the Louisiana Purchase Expo
sition proceedings. Major Carrington,
with his battalion of 413 Filipinos, land
ed here on March 14. Immediately
after their arrival they commenced
giving a series of afternoon drills and
band concerts at the Presidio. Their
snappy action and the expertness with
which they went through the different
maneuvers, and especially their work
in the Butts manual of arms exercise,
won for them great applause daily.
The report published in the Army
and Navy Journal which reached here
yesterday, announcing, the fact that
Major Frank de L. Carrlngton had dis
appeared, has caused a big sensation
at army headquarters at the Presidio.
In the article no reason was assigned
for Carrington's action. It simply
stated that General Bates, in command
of the Division of the Northwest, with
headquarters at St. Louis, had advised
the War Department at Washington
that Carrington was missing.
Major Carrington is well known on
this coast and his visit here last month,
when ho was in command of the pro
vincial battalion of Philippine Scouts
and their splendid band, brought him
into much prominence berore the pub
lic.

In the convention oratory to-morrow
on the occasion of presenting ' the
names of Governor George C. Pardee,
John D. Spreckels, J. W. McKinley and
George A. Knight for delegates at
large, such able speakers as John F.
Davis of Amador, Frank 'H. Short of
Fresno, Thomas Selvage and Judge
Hunter, of Humboldt, will be heard.
Postmaster Arthur G. Fisk arrived
here on to-night's train and spent sev
eral hours trying to tap the under cur
rent of sentiment in the convention.
As there was none to tap, he was
forced to agree with the general opin
ion that this Is one of the smoothest
conventions of modern times.
Henry Ach alao arrived on the late
train. He expressed regret that he
had missed George A. Knight's speech,
but otherwise was satisfied with con
ditions as he found them. E. Myron
Wolf came to town from San Fran
cisco too late to do much lobbying, if
lobbying had been necessary, so he
contented himself by recounting â¢ tales
of bitter political battles that have
long been history. .
It is agreed here to-night by poli
ticians, Democrats as well as Republi
cans, that the action of the Santa Cruz
convention will add 5000 to the Repub
lican majority in California.
Among the heartily welcomed Repub
lican leaders in Sacramento is Duncan
E. McKinlay, prospective nominee of
the Republican party for Congress in
the Second District. He is receiving
an exceptionally warm greeting from
the working men of Sacramento.
It is predjeted that Roosevelt's ma
jority in th'e second district will ap
proximate five thousand and McKinley
will not be far behind the head of the
ticket.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, May 18.â Secretary of State
Curry to-day expressed his regret that
he was unable to attend the Democrat
ic State Convention and watch the
fight. Curry likes a good political bat
tle and he said that from what he
gathered from the newspapers, the
contest must have been a rouser.
Chairman Burnett won commenda
tion to-day for the manner in which he
expedited the work of the convention.
It was remarked, however, that if he
wants to keep his reputation for speed
he should be careful never to take up
the gavel to lead a bunch of Helleger
ants such as assembled last Monday in
Santa Cruz.
Governor George C. Pardee came up
from the city way on the 7:30 train.
He repaired at once to the executive
mansion and took no active part In
the interchange of political gossip that
kept the delegates busy.
The situation in the Democratic camp
as demonstrated in the convention at
Santa Cruz was discussed with much
amusement by the Republicans to-day.
Notwithstanding the result of the vote
on instruction resolution, it is the opin
ion of Republican leaders that the Mc-
Nab-Lane organization is the dominant
power in the State Democracy. They
are of the opinion that a political issue
was not at stake but merely one of
sentiment.

The delegates at large to the na
tional convention will be instructed to
vote for Theodore Roosevelt for can
didate for President of the United
States.
National issues will be fully consider
ed in concise form and State matters
will not be touched upon except in a
general indorsement of the Republican
administration of State affairs. Na
tional irrigation will be thoroughly en
dorsed, as will also the isthmian canal
and matters pertaining thereto. The
administration of national affairs under
the direction of Theodore Roosevelt
will be indorsed in emphatic terms.
National affairs will be treated with
solely. It was considered entirely out
of place for this convention to go into
State matters as it is assembled for
national purposes alone.
The convention of August will have
State matters strictly within its prov
ince, hence the committee did not deem
It proper to go into such questions
which are of State but not of neces
sity national importance.
In that particular the customary eu
logies of Congressional representatives
will be* left for further consideration in
the morning. There is apparently an
effort being made to temper the report
in that regard, as some are of the opin
ion that to too highly commend Â¦ the
California delegation in Congress might
be construed as favoring Senator Bard.
Resolutions were offered the com
mittee upon all such questions usual
ly considered by a political conven
tion. Taking the position that only
general matters of national import
ance should be considered, the greater
bulk of the resolutions were laid on
the table and the few whicflrwere ac
cepted were boiled down to the es
sence of the subject. â¢ ' '

which was delegated the work of

Major Carrington has been in trouble
in San Francisco before. Shortly after
the outbreak of the wax with Spain
the major, then a captain, who was
regarded highly at Washington as a
tactician and disciplinarian, was as
signed to duty in San Francisco aa
mustering officer for the volunteer
commands and to him devolved the
duty of whipping the First California
Volunteer regiment into shape for
service duty. He was well received
by the club men of this city and par
ticularly by William Greer Harrison,
who was recognized as his sponsor.
After his duties had been completed
Major Carrington suddenly came into
unexpected notoriety T>y reason of
many personal obligations which he
had failed to meet. The fact of his
embarrassment became known through
a letter addressed by William Greer
Harrison to a number of the major's
friends, asking them to unite In a quiet
movement toward settling the bills of
the army officer. This was. finally ac
complished. The affair created much
comment among the club men and for
a time practically ostracized Carring
ton from social life in. this city.
To-morrow night the grand ball will
be held at Armory Hall, and on Friday
nlght'all will attend the grand open
air banquet, at which plates will be
laid for 600.
show to the Government how the mon
ey had been expended. To clear up
the affair the Government ordered him
back to Manila, where it Is rumored
he was to appear before a court mar
tial and explain the situation.
Whether this has anything to do
with Major Carrington's disappearance
is not known. Officers here can throw
no light upon the subject.
IX TROUBLE BEFORE.
To-night the Knights are dividing
their time between the grand concert
at Armory Hall, given' in their honor,
and participated in by a chorus of 100
voices, and the grand banquet and
initiation of the Knights of Korossan,
held at the Metropole Hotel In Kern,
where some fifty candidates are being
inducted into the mysteries of the Ori
ent and are indulging in the luxuries
of camel's milk and Zem Zem.
The Knights spent the whole of to
day seeing the sights in the Kern
River oil fields, where a basket picnic
was given and attended by about 700
people. No session of the Grand Lodge
was held.
At the meeting of the Knights of
the Uniform Rank, C. F. McGlashan
of Truckee waa re-elected brigadier
general for a third term of four yearo.
On Friday a meeting place for next
year will be chosen. San Francisco is
being urged from the ground of
economy and convenience, but San
Luis Obispo, which made a strong
fight for the convention last year, is
again in the filed with strong support
and will make a hard fight to capture
the meeting. Healdsburg is the third
candidate for the honor. Its claims
are being urged upon the ground that
the next meeting should go to the
north, as the central and southern
parts of the State have already had
their share.
H. J. Place of San Diego is a candi
date for the office of grand trustee.
There is talk of H. S. Dumble. chan
cellor commander of' Kern Lodge No.
7G of Bakersfield, for the position of
grand master at arms. For grand
keeper of records and seal, Herman
Schnaffer of San Francisco will be
chosÂ»en without opposition. There is lit
tle prospect of any contest over the
other offices.
BAKERSFIELD. May 18. â To-mor
row the Grand Lodge of Knights of
Pythias will begin the work of the
session in earnest and the election of
officers for the ensuing year will be
the principal event of the day.
The chief interest centers in the
election for the office of grand pre
late, for which position several prom
inent candidates have announced
themselves. Dr. H. C. Bagly of. San
ta Maria, who was a candidate for the
office last year, is again in the field
with strong backing.
Two candidates from the south, who
v.ill each have friends among the dele
gates from the other side of the Te
hachapi as well as some from other
parts, are Colonel James C. Scarbor
ough of Los Angeles and Walter B.
Wagner of San Bernardino. A fourth
candidate who is being prominently
mentioned is Honorable M. L. Short
of Hanford, Superior Judge of Kings
County. Precedent is favorable to him
from the fact, with few exceptions,
that candidates for this office have
been chosen from the legal profession
and often for wearers of the Judicial
ermine.

. It was ordered on motion of G. R.
Lukens that all resolutions be referred
without reading or debate to the com
mittee on resolutions. The convention
then took a recess for a half hour.
When the delegates were again called
to order Judge Burnett announced the
following committees:
COMMITTEES APPOINTED.
On motion of Frank H. Short a
committee on credentials, three at
large and three from each Congres
sional district, was authorized and on
motion of John F. Davis a committee
of similar proportions on resolutions
â¢waa ordered. A like committee on
permanent organization and order of
business was next created.
We will meet with a united front our op
ponents with their chosen battle cry, "Roose
velt must bo beaten." and upon our banners,
under which shall march to a great victory
the majority of the patriotic citizens of this
land, shall be Inscribed as our ortflame In let
ters of living light: "For the welfare of the
people and the greatness of the nation Roose
velt must and Â«hall be elected."
The cr f at heart of the American people
knows that the President is not only a man
of unmillied honor, a patriot tried and true.
his mind aflame with a consuming desire to
do rreat and noble things, to make any sac
rifices of ease and comfort, and of life itself
if necessary, for the welfare of the people;
to vindicate himself, under God, as worthy
of the confidence of noble men and women,
but also that the Government could not be
Intrusted to Â«afer hands. Neither capital nor
labor has any just ground to fear the ad
ministration of this patriotic and fearless lead
er, because he will treat them both with abeo
lute fairness and an unselfish desire to do
right. Aa Â»n American citizen, I consider
it the greateet honor to have the privilege
of contributing In any degree to the triumphant
election to the Presldenoy of Theodore Roose
velt, the able statesman and valiant Christian
gentleman.
PATRIOT TRIED AXD TRUE.
The acknowledged leader now In the great
work of extending and rtn<lerlnÂ«r secure the

carrying out the purpose of the fathers in the
establishment of the republic and of making
this nation a beacon light to the struggling
sons of liberty everywhere. Is one who seemed
destined from boyhood to perform a great
part in the larger affairs of the world. From
early manhood Imi>ortar.t trusts have been
committed to h!<< hands. With what honesty,
ability and Eirgular devotion to duty he has
met the requirements of every position, every
schoolboy knows. In civil and military life
he has kept continually before him the hlph
est ideals. Ills public rid private character
fill us with pride and challenge the admira
tion of honorable imn In every land. His
strong, manly personality, his high sense of
rieht and duty, his masterful grarp of great
public questions, his unflinching courage in thÂ»
face of trials and difficulties. his genuine
Americanism, his unfailing confidence In his
countrymen and his love of republican insti
tutions have characterized him from the be
ginning of his r.ublic career.
His administration has beÂ»n a marked euc
cess. a* we had a right to expect. Under his
guidance we have gone forward with leaps
and bounds until we occupy a commanding
position in the councils of the nations and
our friendship is sought by all the leading
powers of the earths. And ytt, when Pres
ident Roosevelt wae called under f-uch tragic
circumstances to the high office which he has
filled no creditably, it must be admitted that
even amonjr his friends there was 3om* appre
hension that his rtroiy? self-reliance, his im
patience of restraint, his abounding vitality
and his love for the strenuous life mljrht lead
to some disturbance of business interests and
Involve us in complications with foreign
powers. The apprehension was considerably
allayrd by his assurance to carry out the
policy of his distinguished predecessor. The
rplendid character of the members of his
cabinet afforded an additional assurance; but,
after all, he has surprised and delighted many
people by displaying in addition to thft great
qualities which we know him to possess, a
calmness and cor servattem and equipoise of
temperament that have shown him to be one
of the aatest as well as one of the strongest
men that ever occupied the Presidential chair.
GREAT DEVOTIOX TO DUTV.
We abate nothing of our admiration for the
ability, honor and patriotism of thousands of
our political opponents and pay willing tribute
to the value of their services in promoting
the highest welfare of the nation; yet we de
clare that no other political organisation thpn
the one we represent, since the world beKan.
has so thoroughly demonstrated its rapacity to
administer In the highest degree of efficiency
the affairs of a gr*at government, and has fo
c.-.mpletely Justified its existence and estab
lished its claim to the support and confidence
of every man who loves liberty, who rt-jolces
In the triumph of justice and who believe*
that every American citizen should have an
equal opportunity to make the most of life.
For a worthy leader of the miphty host en
rolled under the banner of Republicanism the
choice has already been made â not by scheming
politicians, net by virtue of artful contrivance
or factitious 1 circumstanceâ but as the honest
expression of popular appreclatlcn of com
manding ability and exalted worth; and the
national convention will perform the pleasing
duty of ratifying that choice In the unanimous
nomination of Theodore Roosevelt for Presi
dent of the United States.
Our party for forty years has represented
the constructive, progressive force In this
country. It has been a party of affirmation
and action. The Democratic has been a party
of negation and opposition. Our well-meaning

announced in different phraseology and cham
pioned under opposing leadership. The spirit
of these platforms, however, will be very dlf
ftr'nt. One will be radiant with exultation
and optimism; the dominant note of the
other will fill the mind with gloomy forebod

only platform that the Chicago convention
needs to submit is an epitome of what has
been done under Republican administrations
for the welfare of the people and the glory of
the republic, and a sincere promise to pursue
the samn patriotic course in the future, with
whatever changes In administrative detail

that his duties were simple and agree

ferred to Theodore Roosevelt as a

of the chief executive of California as
a man of unquestioned integrity,
vhose administration was reflecting

references to these Republicans of na

Bpplause.
One of the most interesting speeches
of the day was delivered by Frank H.
Fhort of Fresno in seconding the nom
ination of Judge Eurnett, and the
speaker won many rounds of applause
from delegates and spectators. Re
ferring to San Francisco Short said:
PKALSKS SAN FRANCISCO.
I have expressed mr admiration for the
t^autiful city of Los Angeles, but I wish to
â¢ay a few words about San Francisco. No
City in the world occupies a more command-
Ing position than Kan Francisco. I wish I
could adequately express tUe Importance of
Â¦what is to be done and done now. It stand*
fcs the foremost city on the western confines
of the Anglo-Saxon race. All of the fer
tility and resource* of the Pacific Slope are
et its command. With all of the Occident

In til of that vast stretch of land reaching
.lrom the Antic to the Antarctic cold, and
Ironting the world's most majestic sea, I tell
that queenly .city that Kits by the Golden Gatt
there is no rival and there can never be. As
CaJHoraian*. we ought to be impressed with
the Importsn?* of the policies that t-hall be
applied to ttÂ» present and its future. It
r.eeds rtroni men â intelligent, patriotic men.
We need to understand and to remember that
r.o man i* too large or too able to represent
th:* coast and that city. We need and must
have our largest men and most capable men
r^j.rtsent her. â¢ Such men are more needed
than ever before. They are not only useful
to the Htate and her people, but equally useful
to *-verj- legitimate Interest In the State. All
of the principles' and policies of the party arc
in harmony w.th and in furtherance of Eaa

matter of pride and patriotism and of inter
est as well, to unite to bring that city per-"
â¢ xnanent!y under the banner of the party to
Â¦u; .Â¦ !i the rightly belor.es.
Short's allusions to the late Demo
cratlc convention at Santa Cruz,
where there was so "much ado about
liothlng," created merriment. He obÂ»
served <hat the storm-tossed Demo
crats could not even preserve harmony
in doing nothing. He remarked that
the Republicans were not always right,
for that was something beyond human
achievement, but the fact was obvious
that the Democrats were eternally and
everlastingly wrong 1 .
W. S. Wood of San Francisco then
moved that Judge Burnett be elected
by acclamation. The motion pre
vailed and Mr. Cutter appointed E. F.
Woodward, M. L. Ward, F. P. Tuttle
and Frank H. Short as a committee to
escort Judge Burnett to the chair.
Judge Burnett in acknowledging the
honor conferred on him spoke in part
as follows:
PARTIES PATRIOTIC COURSE.
We are standing on the threshold of a cam.
jvaign of very great interest to the American
].eople. We might go further and eay that
it will attract the attention and affect the
welfare of the whole civilized world. Cut while
the approaching election Is of tremendous im
portance, and while we are entirely convinced
that the hirhert interest* of the nation demand
that the KÂ«-publlcan party be continued in
power and that our great leader be elected
President of the United States, yet, of course,
no intelligent man believes and no bonen man
would assert that the foundations of the Gov
ernment are in danger or the Institutions of
liberty imperiled. There are too many honest,
intelligent, llberty-lovinif. God-fearing, law
respecting and patriotic citizens in both the
political parties to tolerate any policy that
would Jeopardize our national Integrity or
break down the bulwarks of our constitutional
rights. We may also rest assured that no
man will be elected as chief executive of
thle mighty republic whose ability or charac
ter is unworthy of the traditions of that great
office, honored and rendered almost sacred by
the Incumbency of Washington. Jefferson, Lin
coln. Grant. McKinley and Roosevelt.
la accordance with custom, each of the ap
proaching national conventions will promul
gate a declaration- of principles indicating
what they conceive to be the wisest policy for
the Government to pursue. There will probably
be very little difference between these plat,
forms, as far as the positive announcement of
political or economic doctrine is concerned.
The logic of events haa demonstrated so eon
rlusively the wisdom of the Republican posi
tion upon the vital principles that ought to
prevail in the admin 1st ration of affair* that
our Democratic friends, though somewhat
Â¦weary *Â»d footsore in their efforts to keep up
with the procession, will find themselves fight-
Every law of nature, he said, would
have to be abandoned to change thes<Â»
conditions. California is an empire by
itself. The Republicanism of the coun
try protects the beauties of California.
"This convention seems to have but
one purpose," he concluded. "There
are no bickerings and Theodore Roose
velt will be nominated. California is
asked to respond to the call of duty anti
she will respond. To-morrow's delib
eration will be marked with the can
dor and justice that always marks Re
publican conventions."
An adjournment was then taken un
til to-morrow morning at 9:30 o'clock.
George A. Knight was then called
upon by the delegates to entertain the
convention. He said he was greatly
Impressed with the address of the vet
eran of 1836, who had spoken before
him. Turning to political issues, he
said: "We will nominate Roosevelt
and elect him." Knight next paid a
tribute to California's wonderful beau
ty and he said he had found nothing
in all the European countries to equal
her attractions. He compared her
natural resources and wealth with
those of foreign countries and carried
his comparisons down to the political
conditions which uphold all these
beauties.

SPRINGFIELD, 111., May 18. â The
Republican State Convention spent
another day in fruitless balloting, and,
although the leaders have been in con
ference since daylight, there is not
the least indication of a break in the
deadlock anywhere along the line.
Sherman's followers to-day continued
to vote for Deneen, but the Cook
County candidate developed no addi
tional strength. Yates' followers 're
mained firm and cemented their agree
ment to stand by the Governor to the
end.

} MADISON. Wis., May 18.â A con
j tinuous Parliamentary wrangle.. >"d
by the best orators of the Baensch
! faction against the efforts of the La
| Follette supporters to Â¦ seat the con
tested delegations to the Republican
State Convention to-day resulted in a
| bolt of the Raensch delegates and the
I refusal of the Cook men to recognize
I the convention as legal. The point in
question was on the power of the State
Central Committee against the power
of the convention to determine the
roll of the convention. No compromise
was offered, except that the Baensch
men demanded the return of the evi
dence before the State Central Com-
I mittee to the convention body for
final action. The proposition was re
fused.
After the bolt an adjournment was
taken until to-morrow.
As a consummation of the bitter
strife engendered, two conventions will
nominate State tickets in Madison to
morrow. The courts will be called upon
to decide which set is entitled to legal
recognition. The convention which was
bolted by the Baenach delegation and
denounced as illegal by the Cook fac
tion will name a State ticket headed
by Governor La Follette. The conven
tion will contain 578 delegates. The
convention of anti-third termers, to
meet at the Fuller Opera-house, will
have 555 delegates, who claim to have
Â¦ been legally elected.
The plan as outlined to-night by the
bolting faction will be the nomination
of former Congressman Samuel A.
Cook for Governor.

MELBOURNE, Victoria. May 18.â In
the Commonwealth House of Repre
sentatives Premier "Watson of the new
(labor) Cabinet to-day outlined its gen
eral policy.
The Government proposes to relntro
duce the arbitration bill, retaining its
general principles, but making the
state employes amenable thereto, this
being the point on which the late Gov
ernment was wrecked. The arbitration
court will consist of a Judge only, with
special technical assessors when desir
ed by either side. The appearance of
counsel before the court is prohibited
without the consent of both sides,
thereby limiting expenses.
It was proposed, the Premier contin
ued, to appoint a single High Commis
sioner in London, representing all Au
stralia, which would gradually remove
the necessity for representatives of the
different States of the Commonwealth.
The other proposed legislation in
cluded old age pensions, state control
of the tobacco trade and a banking bill
providing for all Australia, the Cana
dian provision to compel banks to hold
4 per cent of their reserve in Govern
ment notes.
Among the arrivals to-day were Mrs.
Mary Dunn of Chicago of the city de

SINGLE JUDGE TO ACT
There was an attempt to secure a
plank in the platform in accordance
with McKinley's last speech at Buf
falo, but It failed. Senator Dick, who
wrote the platform, said:
"We stand pat on the tariff as well
as other policies and do not want the
Iowa idea."
The only other contest was that of
the colored men as to who should rep
resent them as an alternate at large.
The convention was controlled by
Herrlck, Dick and Cox, who were dis
posed to have harmony, while some of
their followers wanted factional lines
drawn even on the senior Ohio Sena
tor as a delegate at large. The Ohio
delegation to the Chicago convention
was not instructed, but it is pledged
by the resolutions of the past two con
ventions to President Roosevelt.

DES MOINES. May 18.â Iowa's
long flght between "stand-pat" Repub
licans and Liberals on the Issue of
tariff revision and reciprocity ended in
a complete victory for the former In
to-day's State convention for select
ing delegates to the national conven
tion. Of twenty-six delegates chosen
twenty are "stand-patters" and only
six are Liberals. The resolutions
adopted contain no sentiment what
ever In favor of tariff revision, but de
clare that the protective principle
"found its high fulfillment" In the
Dingley law. As to reciprocity, the
platform declares that It is "unwise to
seek markets abroad by sacrificing
some parts of the markets at home."
The convention was unanimous In
naming its delegates and a-doptlng its
platform, but the committee on reso
lutions disagreed in the recommenda
tions. A minority of four, headed by
ex-Congressman Perkins, a possible
candidate for Governor, stood for a
liberal plank, declaring for a reci
procity that would increase foreign
markets -without harming American
industry and suggesting that the Re
publican party can be depended on to
revise the tariff whenever necessary.
This minority refused to accede to the
platform of the majority as to the
tariff and so reported to the conven
tion.
The delegates at large named were
Senators Allison and Dolliver, J. W.
Blythe and Governor Cummins.

| ill MAKESTHERE are few exceptions to the encouraging reports that are sent from the agricultural
counties in the central part of the State. Climatic difficulties have beset the coast and in
terior districts, but, as a rule, the soil has responded quickly to favorable changes, and
nothing can nozv happen tliat would materially affect conditions. Frost lias, in some sections,
nipped the fruit; at other places the vineyards have suffered. Peacftes seem to have been chief ly
damaged. But the injury from cold this season is hardly above the minimum. Generally speak

Injured and almost a total loss; The

er of April and May turned the tide in
favor cf large yields, and at present
farmers are preparing for the harvest,
~nd are cutting hay. The season was
most favorable for summer following,
plowing and sowing, and added greatly
to' the acreage for cereals.

COLUSA, May 18.â The season thus 1
far In Colusa County has been a very
favorable one for grain crops of all
kinds, and from the present indications
the yield will be large. The acreage
planted to wheat and barley is greater
than for several years. From some
cause the fruit crop will not be as
heavy as was at first expected.
Peaches and apricots will not go over
half the average yield. The prune
crop will be almost up to the average.
Ail kinds of berries are yielding a very
heavy crop and of extra quality.
COLUSA GRAIN WILL

BUT FRUIT IS LIGHT
WILLOWS, May 18.â Glenn County
farmers are now in the thick of the
hay harvest, which will be very large.
Owing to the satisfactory prices of hay
last year, there will be at least 6000
tones baled this year. Barley on the
gravelly land is ripening fast and ten
days more of warm weather will make
it fit for the harvester. The acreage to
barley in this county is very large this
year, some of the ranches being almost
wholly given over to this crop. Our
farmers have learned that raising
brewing barley pays better than wheat.
While the acreage to wheat and barley
is about the same as last season, the
yield will not be as good, the cc-ntinued
wet weather having drowned out and
turned to cheat a great acreage along
the Sacramento River. Foothill lands
take the lead in crops this year.
P'ruits of all kinds will be about an
average crop. Apricots will be light in
localities, having been slightly injured
by frost. Peaches and prunes will
make a heavy crop, and almonds, in
which Glenn County excels, will make
an exceptionally heavy crop on the
plains, the foothill crop being a little
inferior. Berries are backwr.rd and in
ferior in quality. Both cereal and fruit
crops will be about the same as last
year.

GRASS VALLEY, May IS. â Nevada
County will have the largest fruit and
grain crop in her history. It was
feared that sharp hailstones following
the warm weather would beat the
blossoms off the trees, but this proved
groundless, and it is estimated that
the pear crop alone will be one and
a half times as Jarge as last year.
Oats are showing up well.
NEVADA CITY, May 18.-Aside
from pears and peaches the fruit crop
in Nevada County promises to be good
this year. The unusual cold spell and
storms in April, together with a couple
of frosty nights, have played havoc
with the pear crop in particular. In
the sections where the Bartlett pears
usually produce heavily, such as Chi
cago Park, there will be a scarcity and
it is estimated that it will be mSi-fa
less than last year. There are in
stances in some orchards where scarce
ly any pears will be secured.
Judging from reports of the orchard
ists, there will be a falling off in
peaches also, due to the same cause
as the pear failure, but the bountiful
crop of prunes, apples and plums will
more than make up for the other
losses.
In the lower portion of the 'county
the general crop prospects are bright
and the farmers are looking forward
to a prosperous season. A few show
ers at this time would greatly Improve
the even favorable conditions.

REDDING. May 18. â The crop con
ditions of Shasta County never looked
better than they do at present. Farm
ors are jubilant over the outlook, fruit
growers are congratulating themselves
over the promising conditions and the
people generally foel elated about the
way things look. The cereal crop will
b* unusually large. Grain, oats and
alfalfa is looking fine and the present
showrs will greatly benefit the crop.
Haying In the gTain centers would
have begun yesterday had it not been
for the rain. Now it will be delayed a
few days, but the delay will be dollars
:o the farmer?. The crop this year
will be a third greater than that of
last year. Fruits of all kinds are
looking well. The slight frosts did
Eittle damagp this year. The only
damage that has been reported so far
is to thÂ«? early strawberries from the
â¢Happy Valley district. A severe hail
storm in April ruined the first crop.
Peaches, pears, apples, grapes and all
like fruits will yield largely in Shasta
this season. Not only do the fruit and
Â«-^real crops give promise of great in
â¢â¢reasp, but the lumber and mineral
output will be far ahead of any pre
vious year. Sawmills that last season

In tht* orchards the prospects are

of an excellent quality. Berries and
cherries are coming into market read
ily now and larger shipments are made
daily. The fruit canneries are prepar

will be worked to a full capacity. The

AUBURN, Cal., May 18.â The pros
pects for an average fruit crop in most
of the orchards around Auburn are
anything but promising at the present
time. Interviews with prominent or
chardists in this vicinity indicate that
the heavy spring rains have done
considerable damage and that lor
many fruits half a crop is the best
that may be expected. Exceptions,
however, may be made to Bartlett
pears and the Knight's Early cherry
crop. Both these crops will be quite
as heavy as usual. Cherries are now
selling at the Newcastle fruit houses
for one dollar r>er box. But peach,
plum, prune and apricot trees all
suffered heavily from the late rains
which destroyed the pollen and kept
the fruit from maturing. In the
higher altitudes apples bid fair to yield
at least an average crop. Strawberries,
of fine quality, are already on the mar
ket, and a very abundant crop is pfoni
ised.
The above conditions would be dis
couraging but for the fact that a
short fruit crop means big prices. This
is invariably the fact. An immense
fruit yield may mean fairly good prices
or it may mean a red -ink memoran
dum on the shipping receiptâ that is,
nothing realized from fruit, , and a
freight bill to pay. All in all, Placer's
orchardists have no reason to feel
discouraged.
NEWCASTLE, May 18.â The Call in
its issue of the 7th inst. gave a very
full report of the conditions then exist
ing at Newcastle, the great Sierra
Nevada foothill fruit center. Later
conditions seem to be even worse than
those first reported.
The output will not exceed and per
haps not be equal to one-half of last
year's, which was a light crop, or, in
other words, twenty-flve per cent of a
full crop is all that can be expected.
Cannery men are now in the field
sizing ud the situation, and they re
port, with but few exceptions, short
crops of peaches throughout the State.
Many here say the canning of peaches
will be less than ten per cent of a crop.
Plums will, turn out jupon the whole
about one-half of last year's crop.
Apricots are considered practically a
total failure.
The usual spring dropping has cut th<Â»
bulk of the Bartlett fcear yield down
somewhat, b'ut a good crop, not less
than fifty per cent in excess of last
year's yield, seems to be assured.
Prunes will be slightly in excess of last
season. Apples and quinces are up to
last year's total. Grapes look fine and
may exceed last year twenty per cent.
Oranges and olives are . probably
twenty-five per cent in excess of last
year's crop.

RECORD-BREAKING OUTPUT

Â¥~* RUIT and cereal crops in the northern counties have suffered somczvhat on account of
J^ the hfaz'x floods, which inundated a tremendous acreage of the best producing territory.
Far the most part the recovery 'from the adverse conditions has been prompt. Balmy
zeeather during the past month has given new life to the seed, and unless something unfore
seen occurs before reaping time the output of grain will be far above the average. Fruit has
not fared so ivell. and reports from several of the important centers are far from encouraging.
It is expected, kozvever, that the yield will be swelled to a fair average .
FLOODS RETARD GROWTH OF CROPS.
WATSONVILLE. May IS.â The apri
cot crop will not be as large as last
year, but the fruit will be free from
the roughness of skin so objectionable
at that time.
Cherries promised well a few weeks
ago, but the rain knocked the pollen
from the blooms to such an extent that
the crop will be lighter than last year.
Strawberries are going out of the val
ley at the rate of 500 to 600 chests a
day, with the certainty that this
amount will be increased In the next
two weeks. The acreage Is about the
same as last year, with yield slightly
better.

VISALIA, May 18.â General crop con
ditions in Tulare County are much bet
ter than last year. The work of thin
ning the fruit will cause a considerable
expense. The late rains were worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars to
ranchers of this region. As compared
with last year the peach crop will be
double. The pear crop is a failure, but
it is never counted on for commercial
purposes. There will be a fair crop of
apricots. The prune crop will reach the
limit of fullness. In the timber belt
th.^re is a splendid grain crop, averag
ing 90 per cent. On the plains the grain
is light. Probably it will be impossible
to harvest the crops completely unless
a supply of workmen exceeds the avail
able number in previous years. Ranch
ers are in high spirits.
TULARE WILL H'AVE
A BOUNTEOUS YIELD

MODESTO, May 18.â As the present
crop season advances the prospects for
good crops of grains and fruits grows
more and more flattering, and this will
go on record as one of the greatest
crop years in the history of the county.
The temperature has been uniformly
cool and the air moist. The average
crop for this county in the days when
Stanislaus was almost entirely devoted
to grain raising was placed at llO.lKH)
tons. This year several thousand acres
have been withdrawn from grain cul
ture and placed under irrigation, but
the grain yield will be in the neighbor
hood of 105,000 tons, making a crop,
acreage considered, of about 95 per cent
or more of an average crop. This ton
nage will be divided as follows: Wheat,
85,000 tons; barley, 15,000 tons; oats,
5000 tons. On the east side of the San
Joaquin RiveV the grain crop will be
heavier than an average, while on the
west side, awing to the difference In
precipitation, the crop will be some
thing like 10 per cent short.
Prospects for fruit are also good. The
grape crop will be 25 per cent more
than that of 1903, and a larger acreage
will be in bearing. The acreage in
vines last year was in the neighbor
hood of 2400 acres, and this has been
increased by 500 acres in the last year.
Apricots will give a yield of 10 per
cent above that of last year, and
peaches in the Oakdale district will
yield from 10 to 15 per cent in* advance
of last year's crop. Almonds will give
a good crop this year, despite the fact
that there were light frosts.
WESTLET, May 18. â Grain is this
vicinity will yield on an average about
half a crop. Wheat sowed in Novem
i ber sprouted with the rain and died on
GRAIN AND FRUIT IN
FINE CONDITION IN
STANISLAUS COUNTY
The season is at least two weeks late
and no shipping has been' done yet.
The almond crop is good and grapes
promise well. On the whole, fruit mcr
will have more than an average crop.
WOODLAND, May 18.â The wheat
and barley crop of Tolo County this
season is not likely to be more than
half of a full crop. This shortage is
due to the extraordinary amount of
rain that fell during the month of
April. The rainfall for the season was
above the average, but if it had been
well distributed there would have been
enormous crops, both of fruits and
cereals. A great deal of wheat and
barley were drowned out by flood
water and the area was greatly re
duced, especially in the districts subject
to overflow. There will also be a small
er crop of hay than usual, due solely to
a reduced acreage. Many varieties of
fruit will be short; because the rainfall
was the heaviest just at a time when
many of" the trees were putting out
their bloom. The almond crop will be
almost a failure. The apricot crop will
be shorter than usual. The peach, pear
and prune crop will be fair and the
yield of grapes promises to be good.
WINTERS. May 18.â Crop conditions
here are not up to standard, though the
yield will be a fair average. The wheat
crop is spotted, some fields showing up
unusually well and others being hardly
fair. Barley promises better than
wheat. The hay harvest is in full sow
ing and the yield will be large, quality
good and acreage a full average. ;
Fruit conditions are somewhat pecu
liar. Prunes will make an extra large
yield; peaches an average; pears small,
and apricots about a one-fourth crop.
YOLO COUNTY WILL ' \
SUFFER AS RESULT
OF UNUSUAL RAIN
UKIAH, May 18. â Mendocino County
has had from fifty to more than one
hundred Inches of rain the present sea
son, extending through the month of
April, with a higher temperature than
usual. Planting of annual crops and
cultivation of hops and orchards was
retarded by rain to a later period than
usual, but the delay Is amply com
pensated bv the 1 abundance of moist
ure and the favorable temperature.
Grass on the stock ranges is 100 per
cent or more better than last year.
Sheep and cattle are in fine canditlon.
Grain and hay crops In the valleys will
be much larger than last season. Hops
will no doubt yield better than last
year. They are growing very rapidly.
Reports from the fruit sections indi
cate at least a full crop. Little Lake
Valley, which produces large quantities
of potatoes, had over eighty inches of
rain and planting was rather later
than usual on that account, but th*
tubers will make a rapid growth from
now on. The hay crop, which Is an
important one in this county, will be
twice as large as yielded last year.
On the whole, the general outlook for
this season's crops is far better than
at this date last year. New people are
coming into this county looking for
homes, considerable building Is going
on, everybody Is busy and prospects
are promising.
PROSPERITY SMILES
ON THE PEOPLE OF
MENDOCINO COUNTY
Fruit prospects were never better.
The last thirty days have been singu
larly free from frosts. The vineyards
look exceedingly well. The vines are
very healthy and thus far free from
any serious insect pest. Garden truck
is plentiful. The onion raisers and big
spud farmers are looking forward to a
big crop and, big prices. The flooding
jDf the islands will diminish the quan
tity, but not to the extent that many
anticipated after the flood.
The only menace now are the winds.
There has been plenty of moisture and
all that has held the crops back was
the cold spring. Under a week of
growing weather a more Intelligent
prospect might be determined.
STOCKTON. Mav 18.â Major J. D.
Peters, one of the best Informed grain
dealers of this section declares in ref
erence to the grain crop that "We
have arrived at that stage of the crop
when we must do a- great deal of
guessing and thinking." The West
Side country shows some splendid sum
mer fallow in places and this has
been greatly helped by the late rains;
but as a general thing the crop pros
pects on the other side of the San
Joaquin River are not as bright as
they might be.
In San Joaquin County proper the
outlook is hardly as good as it was
thirty days ago, and this is hardly ex
plainable, since there has been abun
dant moisture. It must be a result of
the chilling the gl&ind got during the
long cold siege. However, the island
crops are well .forward and if the
present growing weather continues the
grain prospects for this county may
jump from a fair average to a big
old-fashioned yield.
SAN JOAQUIN GRAIN
SERIOUSLY AFFECTED
BY CHILLY WEATHER
SACRAMENTO, May 18. â The grain
crop in this section promised up to
the past few days to exceed the great
yield of last year, but the north winds,
now prevalent, have damaged the
growing grain somewhat and altered
the situation. However, it is believed
the crops will be very satisfactory.
The floods along the river lands have
greatly injured the vegetable crop.
Shipments from this city have always
been very large, but commission mer
chants assert that where last year fif
teen to twenty-flve carloads of vege
tables were sent out of Sacramento
each day, there will now be only from
twelve to thirteen cars. In the
vicinity of ' Sacramento in the river
section the hop crop will be reduced
because of the floods, though in the
highlands it will be fully up to the
standard of last year. As to deciduous
fruits, while at the opening of the
year Indications pointed to a decided
increase over last year's unprecedented
record, the opposite is now the case,
and it is declared by George Katzen
stein, manager of the Earl Fruit Com
pany, that it is doubtful if this year's
green fruit shipments do not fall short
of last year's shipments by 500 or
more carloads. The Sacramento River
section, the largest fruit producing
region of its area in the State, will
show a marked falling off in pitted
tree fruits, such as cherries, apricots,
peaches, plums and prunes.
GALT. May 18. â A comprehensive
summary of crop conditions in the Gait
district is not as roseate at this date as
was promised early In the spring
months. Our grain crops, wheat, bar
ley and oats, will be fully up to last
season's yield. The poor condition of
peaches, apricots and almonds in the
district is very noticeable and the cher
ry crop is light. Grapes never looked
better and are advancing rapidly, with
indications of a large crop. Haying is
progressing rapidly, but the yield is far
below what the farmers looked for.
Citrus fruits are in bloom and orange
trees are unusually heavy laden with
healthy blossoms. The early potato
crop will be generally light, owing, in
a great extent, to the inundation of
our river districts during February and
March. The strawberry crop is enor
mous and heavy shipments are being
made daily from the Florin district.
Other berries look very encouraging
and the industry promises to be a pro
fitable one this season. In Sacramento*
County green feed is abundant and of
good quality.
Practically the Pajara Valley is out
of the market on hay and grain. Last
year only a few carloads were sent out,
and there will be fewer this year.
Sugar beets were light last year.
This year the acreage will be far mor?
than doubled, but still will be much
below that of former campaigns.
From present indications the apple
crop of the Pajaro Valley this season
will be much lighter than, that of las:
year.
Not more than an average crop of
peaches, pears and plums can be ex
pected from present prospects.

as a whole the berry crop, including
raspberries, promises an Improvement

account of the long dry spell in Decem
ber and January. Grain that was
sowed in December will yield a crop
of about twelve sacks per acre. Grain
sowed late in November will probably
make hay. Barley is looking: excellent
and will yield heavy. Some barley is
now standing four and a half feet
high and heads well filled. Fruit and
vegetables are not raised here for mar
ket. Thousands of sheep are feeding
on the hill pastures, which supply
plenty of feed.

NAPA, May 18. â Although there were
no ravages in the fruit orchards this
year by spring frosts, the late spring
rains are accountable ror the falling
off of the cherry, apricot and peach
crops. The season's cherry crop falls
far behind that of last year, when
cherries were particularly good. Be
sides being about two weeks late, the
crop will bejlight. This Is also true of
apricots and peaches, indications point
ing to a short crop a trifle late. The
prospects are good for a large crop of
pears. The yield of prunes will be
about the same as last year. Although

SAN DIEGO, May 18.â Despite the
fact that this county has had less
moisture than in any of the recent dry
years, the present prospects are that
there will be no total failure of any
crop, though both hay and grain in
some sections will come very near it.
Grain shows remarkably well on the
high lands, but in the valleys it is
showing the effects of the lack of mois
ture. This is also true of hay. Though
but little more than half the acreage
was put into hay, there are a great
many fields into which the stock has
already been turned, since they would
not yield enough hay to pay for the
cutting. That which is left to cut is
very light Where it has been possible
to Irrigate there has been just the
opposite result and seven cuttings of
alfalfa at two and a half tons per acre
have been reported.
Deciduous fruit trees are overcrowd
ed with blossoms in Irrigated orchards

bility of bearing several years ago.

The potato crop, which heretofore
was of little importance, promises to
be very large, as land which had not
been used at all last season has been
set out to potatoes, which are growing
rapidly.
CjDLTON. May 18.â Crops in general
in this vicinity will not be ready for
harvest as early as last season and
while it was generally expected that
the hay and grain crop would be very
much larger than at any time in the
last five years, the lack of late rains
will make the crop about the same in
quantity as last season's. The apricot
crop is smaller than usual, but peaches
and other ' deciduous fruits are very
much larger.
The orange and lemon crop. which is
first in Importance in this vicinity, ia
much larger and of far better quality
than last year. A great portion of thÂ«
crop Is still on the trees, owing to poo*
markets in the East. The summer crop
of lemons will be very much laÂ«er
than last season and the setting of new
fruit, which Is just out of the blossom,
promises to be the largest in the history
of this section.

VACAVILLE. May 18.â The present
outlook for the fruit crop is not as
gratifying as that of last year, owing
to the large amount of rain, north
winds and the destroying propensities
of insects that have played havoc with
the trees and fruit.
Cherries are slow this year as com
pared with last year, and a great many
have been blown off the trees by the
north winds and frost bitten by the
variable weather. Many of them are
burned to a dark color and they are
of no use. The cherry crop is fair and
hopes are entertained that the present
warm weather will mat:e a better
showing. The first box or cherries left
here on April-30 and sold for $20 in
New York. ; ."-
RAIN AND NORTH
WINDS PLAY HAVOC
WITH SOLANO TREES
Wlille the lack of rain has affected
to a great degree all other lines of
farm products, the hay and grain sec
tion have Buffered most. Where the
grain fields of the Simi. the Canejo and
the OJai valleys have in former years
yielded from 200.000 to f.00.000 sacks, the
output for this season will not be more
than 50,000 to 60.000 sacks. Much of the
grain will be cut for hay owing to the
demand for the latter, but even the
hay crop will be short and the yield will
only satisfy home demands.
VENTURA. May 18.â Prospects for
crops in Ventura County for this sea
son are only fair. The rainfai. for the
reason to date has varied from 7 to 11
inches in the different sections, while
last year the total was more than 16
inches. In the past few ytars much
attention has b<^n paid to irrigation,
with the result that thousands of acres
will this year produce fair â¢â¢:opp. where
.there would other" "Â«e be a total fail
ure. This y<*ar there is more develop
ment than ever and besides a number
uf extensive irrigation enterprises
there are many private systems put in.
â¢ The apricot crop is one of the largest
of the country at the present time and
gives promise of falling but little short
of U-Et year and the quality is excel
lent. Walnuts have set well and the
yield for the year will bo greater than
that of 1903. The honey crop, one of the
most important of the country. Is a
total failure on account of the deficien
cy in rainfall. The lima bean crop,
Ventura's largest and usually most
profitable production, will be only one
half the usual yield. This is due large
ly to the small rainfall. Where the
land is irrigated the crop will be as
large as ever. Planting is going on at
present.
The sugar beet farmers are disheart
ened. The big Oxnard factory will not
have more than a half season's run
2nd the production of beet sugar will
be correspondingly small.
VENTURA COUNTY'S
APRICOT CROP IS UP
TO THE AVERAGE
Taken all together the crop of 19C4
will exceed that of 1903 in all lines ex
cept apples.
HOLLISTER. May IS.â San Benito
County's prospects for an abundant
yield of the various kinds of crops are
very bright. Competent judges, who
have made a careful examination, state
that the yield of hay will exceed that
of last year, which was about 30.000
tons.
Grain in nearly every section shows a
much better growth than at the same
period last year and promises, unless
unforseen weather conditions arise, to
far excell the yield of 1303. In the San
Juan and Hollister valleys record crops
will be grown on several farms, while
from the southern sections of the
county a good harvest will be gathered.
Fruit of all kinds, except apples, ia
doing well. Apples will be a short crop,
but as the yield of last year was very
large, a small crop was expected this
fall. Pears are doing well. Prunes are
about an average, some orchards hav
ing an abundance, while others are re
ported as having a light crop.
Apricots, except Moorparks, have set
well, and the yield will be greater than
that of last year, while peaches prom
ise the largest crop ever grown here.
Small fruits and nuts will be above an
average.
SAN BENITO GIVES
A GOOD ACCOUNT OF
GRAIN AND FRUIT
Hops are making splendid growth,
but it is too early for them to blossom
and a prediction cannot be made as to
yield.
Grapes never looked better, and from
all indications at the present time will
produce an abundant harvest. The
vines appear thrifty and their condition
is such as to warrant splendid results
at harvest time. Hay and grain prom
ise well, but ' will be later than usual
this year, because of the excessive rain
fall this season. The excess amounted
to more than fifteen inches as compared
with the record of last year.
SONOMA, May 18.â The outlook in
Sonoma Valley for a good fruit crop
this year Is very favorable. The pears
will excel last year's crop in both
quantity and quality. Apricots will be
scarce, but as they are not grown here
in any great quantities the market will
not be affected. Prunes will be plenti
ful, but there will be a scarcity of
apples, owing to last year's overabun
dant crop. Peaches will be scarce.
SANTA ROSA, May IS.â From re
liable sources information is to the
effect that fruit crops In Sonoma Coun
ty will be light all along the line. As
a matter of fact, the crop will be "spot
ted" â light in some districts and a fair
yield in others, while in still other
sections good crops will be harvested.
Around Santa Rosa the prune crop
will run from one-third to one-half an
average crop, while in Healdsburg some
of the best orchards will hardly yield
a tenth of a crop. Peaches are light
in all sections, but the quality will be
good. Pears are the only crop which
promises above the average, indications
at the present time showing an im
mense crop of that fruit. Plums will
be a fair crop throughout the county,
and berries promise quite well, though
it Is rather early for a prediction on
that crop. Growers of berries incline to
the belief that the crop -will be smaller
than last year, but that the berries will
be of large size in consequence.
Cherries are "spotted" over the entire
county. It is estimated that the crop
will go slightly over half the usual yield
in cherries. In Geyservllle, where the
largest cherry orchards are to be found
In this county, the crop promises fairly
well.
SONOMA COUNTY'S
ORCHARDISTS LOOK
FOR HIGHER YIELD
The walnut crop promises to be up to
the average, while the apricots will
be the heaviest crop in many years.
Other tree fruits promise well, while
small fruits will be an important part
cf th*> farmers' dependence in many
places, as there is plenty of water for
irrigation purposes, and this branch of
industry will be made t:? most of to
make up for partial failure in grain
and hay crops.
In anything but Kubmoist lands the
sugar beet crop â i 11 not be worth har
vesting, but some 3000 acres will be
grown on corn and celery land In the
district near Smeltzer, the product of
which will serve to make a short run
for the Los Alamltos s â ar factory.

honey crop will be practically nil, al
though some beeim have moved their

local maftcet.
SANTA ANA, May 18.â With less
than seven Inches of rain for the sea
son, the outlook for grain enough for
seed is more than doubtful, but there
will be considerable hay harvested in
nearly every portion of the county.
Much of this tvill be so short that it
will have to be gathered by some sort
of appliance as it falls from the mower,
but the quality will be excellent and
will repay the extra labor demanded.
More celery was planted this year than
last, but murh of it was unfit for mar
ket and was therefore left in the fields.
Nearly 1600 cars were sent forward,
however, and the prices received were
the bert ever recorded.

SAN LUIS OBISPO, May 18.âAl
though the rains were late, making the
season fully three weeks behind, the
prospects are most excellent through
out this county for a bountiful yield of
both grain and fruit. The acreage In
grain is not unusually large. Grain is
mostly headed and stands very rank.
Haying is commencing' In some parts of
the county. The acreage in beans and
The outlook for a grain crop is good,
though the warm weather and north
wind of last week had a deteriorating
effect. The estimate is for a crop in
excess of last year. Wheat is the prin
cipal grain crop of this section. Cooler
weather at present is beneficial to
growing grain. Hay cutting has com
menced and a full crop will be har
vested. Grass is plentiful on the stock
ranges and cattle and sheep are doing
well and will soon be ready for ship
ment to market. Dairy interests have
suffered some from the lateness of the
season. Many dairy cows have been
turned out on the ranges, the dairymen
not deeming it wise to continue milking
when prices are so low. '
PASO ROBLES, May 18.â The fruit
crop in this section will be larger than
for several years, if no further con
ditions develop to injure young fruit,
which is not likely this late In the sea
son. Grapes and prunes will be un
usually heavy. The pear blight has
been reported from some orchards, but
this variety of fruit is not a staple
crop here.
Â» _
FRUIT CROP WILL
YIELD HEAVY IN SAN
LUIS OBISPO COUNTY
Small acreage planted to fruit, but
will have full and big crops on this
small acreage.
The range feed for sheep is light.
Sheep are moving north. Cattle feed is
plentiful.
This season is considered a good one,
exceeding that of last year 15 per cent.
The best Indication of pood crops in
this country is the fact that the snow
fall in the mountains is heavier this
year than for many previous years,
and this will afford water for irrigation
purposes during the summer.
FIREBAUGH, May 18.â Considering
the amount of rainfall crops in this sec
tion are in first-class condlton. Alfalfa
will have full crops on new and old
fields. Grain, wheat and barley is in
fine shape and will give full crops. A
small portion of grain was burned by
the hot winds, but were, revived by the
late rains.
FRESNO, May 18.â The prospects are
bright for a heavy mitput of deciduous
fruits in this section or the valley.
Peaches and apricots are thin in spots
in the sections north of here, due to
the lack of enough rain for that soil.
In other places these fruits will be
above the crops of last year. Pears
are plentiful, but blight is beginning to
appear in spots. Almonds will be above
the average crop.
Raisin grapes are abundant and in
dications are that there will be a much
larger crop than last year, unless the
heat causes a dropping off of the ber
ries. Wheat and barley appear to be in
good condition, and the cix-ps will be on
a par with last year. The first crop
of alfalfa was light because of the lack
of early rains.
GENERAL OUTLOOK -
IS GOOD FOR CROPS
IN FRESNO COUNTY
The fruit growing district between
Elmhurst and Haywards has been bad
ly blighted. The owner of an apricot
orchard near Haywards, who garnered
800 tons of the fruit from his orchard
last year, asserts that he will not pick
ten tons fro-m the same trees this sea
son. There will be but rew cherries in
this district. The failure of the cherry
and apricot crops in the northern sec
tion of the county Is attributed to
continuous late rains and cold weather.
Near Niles .and, in Murray Township
fruits and grains are in a better condi
tion. Vineyards are locking well, but
it is somewhat early to Judsre of what
the yield will be. Hay is now being
cut in the Livermore Valley and the
crop is very heavy. There will be a
good yield of grain in that section and
an average fruit crop,.
HAYWARDS, May IS. â The crops in
this valley are good. The late grain
especially gives promise c-f a fine yield.
The hay crop never looked better, the
volunteer being particularly heavy.
The stand of chevalier In this valley,
especially around Mount Eden, looks
exceptionally fine.
OAKLAND, May 18.â It is the gen
eral conclusion of those who have in
spected crop conditions in this county
that the fruit yield will t>e but one
eighth of the average annual produc
tion and that as a result there will be
a loss to the labor market of $20,000,
which would ordinarily have been ex
pended in gathering the orchard crops.
There is plenty of water for irrigation
purposes and therefore the dry season
will not seriously affect such fruit
crops as are raised by irrigation, Irtit
those crops probably will not be ;ip to
the mark of last year's record. A larpc
citrus crop has been harvested thi3
year and inasmuch as most of the .arge
landowners are interested in crops of
that kind, this section will not be se
riously hampered from a financial
standpoint because of the certain fail
ure of the grain crop and the shortage
which is expected with reference "to
apricots and other such fruits.
LANCASTER. May 18. â Conditions
of grain in Antelope Valley as com
pared with last year are not as good.
There will be about one-third differ
ence in the crop on account of the
small amount of rain in the eastern
part of the valley. The outlook for
the fruit crop is very good. There
vUl be a heavy yield of all kinds of
fruit and nut*, such as apples, pears.
Peaches and almonds.
LOS ANGELES. May 18.â Present in
dications are that the deciduous fruit
crop in the vicinity of Los Angeles will
be below the average and that the grain
crop will be practically a failure. AI
thought the seasonal rainfall was not
greatly below the total for last year, the
uiins came so late that the winter was
one of the dryest in the history of this
section. In many of the gTain districts
sowing was done very late and in dry
ground and when the winter rains
finally came they were so late that in
most places they caused the grain to
sprout too late to hope that it vould
mature and owners of large acreage
will be satisfied if they secure .in aver
egre hay crop from fields which last
year raised tons upon tons of grain.
That there will be a shortage of the
hay crop is certain, but it : s believed
that it will net be so severe as that
of three years ago, when the prices cf
feed were almost prohibitive.
may not be quite as high as usual, this
fruit bids fair to be of exceptional size
and quality.
The grape crop for 1904 will more
than make up the deficiency in other
fruit3. This product is Napa County'3
most famous one, and this year will be
a memorable one in the grape and win*
industry In the valley. A very large
yield of grapes is promised and vine
yardista are Jubilant.
On the whole it may be said that
the fruit season will be a good one in
Napa Valley.
CALISTOGA, May IS.â The present
outlook for a good crop of grapes and
fruits of all kinds was never better,
with the exception of prunes, which
last season yielded a heavy crop. In
some orchards there appear to be no
prunes, to speak of, while in others an
average yield is anticipated. The grape
vines are in excellent condition and
will produce a good crop if nothing un
foreseen happens. The hay and grain
outlook ia very promising and a good
crop will be harvested from each, the
late rains having done an immense
amount of good to both. The season's
work in both orchard and vineyard waj
somewhat delayed by the wet condition
of the soil, but everything is now in
first-class shape. Taken all in all.
Napa Valley, and particularly Calis
toga and vicinity, presents a prosperous
appearance, and the farmers have
every indication of harvesting crops
which will compare most favorably
with those of former years.
Pasturage suffered from lack of mois
ture even more than hay and grain
and stock is showing the effects al
ready. Many cattle have been driven
to the Imperial country, where there is
plenty of feed. There the crops of all
kinds will be '"simply immense."
lemons, but the market is not at pres
ent very encouraging to the shipper and
many of those picked are being stored
here for better prices.
Deciduous fruits are setting well and
pive promise of good yields of all save
apricots. Small fruits are coming in
very fast. Strawberries are yielding
well and other berries have set for a
fine crop. The vineyards of the Cajon
Valley are in good condition, most of
them receiving all the water that is
necessary for their growth. The yield
there will be up to the average, if not
above.
ly up to that of last year. Between
70.000 and 75,000 acres of grain have
been planted this year, an increase of
10 per cent over last season, but the
grain is not as grood as last year â
probably a two-thirds yield. Bean
planting commenced this week and the
acreage is about 33 1-3 per cent less
than last year, which is due to the
great amount of beets that is being put
in. an increase of 20 per cent over last
year The beets, of which over 10,000
acres are under irrigation, will yield
about the same number of tons to the
acre as last year's crop. Sugar mak
ins: will commence about the middle of
July and last through the ye..r.
I.OMPOC. May 18.â The prospects for
crops and fruit in this district are: For
beans, favorable, many acres goins in
to contract bears for seed men; for
mustard, poor, the shortage of the
rainfall threatening a lack of matu
rity in the seed; for l>eets and potatoes,
excellent on irrigated land, of which
there is much In this district. Parley,
oats, hay and all kinds of grain pro
ducts promise Â«n average yield. The
grazing lands are in first-class condi
tion and promise to remain so for the
coming year. The fruit prospects are
fair. Peaches and cherries look favor
able and apr'cots give proVnise of an
abundant crop. The walnuts give pood
indications nf there being an exception
ally large crop.
Moorpark apricots will be a light
crop, but the other varieties will be a
good average yield. The peach crop is
light generally, especially the clings.
A good crop of Bartlett pears is prom-"
ised, but the later pears will not be
quite so good. There will be a lighter
yield of cherries than last year. The
white will be about two-thirds of the
crop of last year and the blacks about
half as many. A couple of small cher
ry shipments have been made, but they
will not commence to go East in great
quantity before the 23th of May. Last
year 115 cars were shipped East from
this valley, but this year it is estimated
that not over 100 cars of cherries will
go. The sugar prune trees are heav
ily loaded with fruit this year, and
unless the fruit is thinned the trees
will break. This prune is jiot grown in
sufficient quantity to be recognized
commercially.
The hay and grain fields are looking
fine and will produce large crops. Vine
yards are all looking well. There has
been an increase in the area devoted to
raising garden seeds this year and the
late spring rains have been especially
helpful to these crops. On the cattle
ranges in the foothills there is plenty
of feed, due to the heavy rains.
GILROY, May 18.â The prospects for
crops In the southern Santa Clara Val
ley were never brighter than the pres
ent season. The late rains aided the
grain and the yield will be above the
average. Haying is in progress and
some big yields are reported. Fruit
prospectb are very favorable. In some
orchards Moorpark apricots are a short
crop, but prunes and peaches are much

will be light, the grape crop good and the hay Jiarvest unusually heavy. Solaiw reports a fair
yield of cherries, but other crops in that county will hardly be up to the average.
COUNTIES of the southland are rejoicing this year over a large yield of citrus fruits. Los
Angeles and San Bernardino orange and lemon groves liave yielded handsomely, but in
the former county the grain crop is light. This is true of San Diego also, the grain
showing poorly, while the fruit gives fair promise. Orange County has a record apricot crop,

all the attention of our people from the compliment
paid to California by selecting it as the place for
holding two important religious conferences. The great
Methodist church is with 11$ in. its general, or inter

Coast Conference of the Unitarian Church is in session

wide apart, but it is with pleasure that a philosopher sees
practical unity in their religious purpose.

Our Supreme Court has again accomplished the im
possible in logic. It has reached a conclusion without
major or minor premise to drive it to reason's inevitable
haven. It has decided that an ex-County Clerk has no
right to the office he held, but the learned Justices do
not tell us anything of the living issue involved in the
controversy over tenure. The County Clerk may be
elected for two years or for four years. Some day some

BRUNH1LDEâ A. S.. City. What is
meant by "one of the Brunhilde type"
is one of the character of Brunhilde.
a sketch of which appeared in this de
partment a few days since. None of the
histories of that woman describe her
complexion, color of hair, etc. There is
a character known as Brunhild in the
Niebelung lied. This Is the Queen of
Issland, who made a vow that none
should win her who could not surpass
her In three trials of skill and strength
â first, hurling a spear; second, throw
ing a stone, and, third, jumping. Gun
ther. King of Burgundy, undertook the
three contests, and- by the aid of Seis
fried succeeded in winning the martial
Queen. First, hurling a spear that three
men could not lift: the Queen hurled
it toward Gunther, but Seigfrled. in
his invisible cloak, reversed the direc
tion, causing it to strike the Queen.
Next throwing a stone so large that
twelve brawny men were employed to
carry it; Brunhild lifted It on high,
flung it twelve fathoms and jumped be
yond it. Seigfried helped his friend to
throw it farther and leap beyond It.
\fter marriage Brunhild became so ob
streperous that the King again applied
to Seigfried. who succeeded in depriv
ing the Queen, of her rins and girdle,
and she became a very submissive wife.
SEATTLE is astonished,* very disagreeably, judging
by the tone of articles recently appearing in Seattle
daily papers. During something like five years the
people of Seattle have believed that they actually saw, so
says the Seattle Times, the beginning of a canal to be
used by ships in passing from Elliott Bay to Lake'Wash
ington. Now the City Engineer of Seattle has reported
that a private company that has been supposedly engaged
in this beneficial project has really done nothing except
to sluice away several city blocks of Beacon Hill, facing
the bay, for the purpose of filling tide Jands for profit.
s While this has been going on, according to the same
authority, seven of the Seattle city streets have been
washed out to a depth of from 50 to 100 feet. Property
holders are confronted at one point with a fifty-foot
hole extending two and one-half blocks north and south
and four and one-half blocks east and. west. Those who
purchased their lands on the city's accepted plats are
shut off from the city proper as if a stone wall with only
one opening had been constructed about them. When
the work of filling in tide lands shall have been completed
the city will be confronted with a great hole. "Damage
suits," saye the Times, "arc being piled up so high that
the corporation counsel is unable to see over them."
This disappointment has no relation to the canal for
ships that the Government is to construct, although it
has delayed the Government and has caused the Seattle
Chamber of Commerce to expend some money and suf
fer much anxiety. The Government canal is, a different
proposition, but the ingenious private excavators who
have caused so much havoc in city streets have contrib
uted to retarding the Government.
The curious phase of the matter is, according to the
Times, that there has been a hidden hand in the City
Council that has prevented injunction proceedings and
is still potent. At some future day it will be necessary
for the city to provide bridges to cross the chasms that
have already been excavated and court judgments are
liable to represent other large outlays of coin.

At the great Methodist conference, which has been
in distinguished session at Los Angeles, five Bishops
were retired on the score, of age. They have finished
their splendid work for their church and for humanity.
They pass from the storm and stress of active life to the
calm and peace of respected retirement. Surely no man
can ask a better reward for a life well spent than the
sincere acknowledgment that his great and good work
has been accomplished.
As a boy he spent his spare hours
out of school, and even his vacation
times, in hunting snakes in the neigh
borhood of New York, not to destroy
them, but to see them in their native
haunts and to collect them. Then
when his family had moved from the
city to the country, and it had been
discovered that a purpose from which
It had been endeavored to dissuade
him was one seriously formed, a room
was fitted up for him in the new
house, with suitable glass cases in
which snakes could be comfortably
and Bafelv installed. These cases he
had filled with snakes in two weeks.
Interested always in natural history
in general, Mr. Ditmars was employed
between 16 and 22 as an assistant in'
the Insect department of the American
Museum of Natural History, being
there engaged in mounting butterflies
and beetles: but his pet specialty was
snakes, and he still continued constant
ly his studies of this form of reptile
life and his Journeyings into the coun
try in search of snakes. He came to
know all those in the city who have
to do with snakes; snake dealers, snake
charmers and fruit importers who, im
porting fruit from tropical countries,
sometimes re :eive snakes. From one
and another of these sources he was
occasionally able to acquire a desirable
snake to add to those he had himself
collected, until finally he came to have
a private collection cf 300 living snakes,
occupying, with the enlarged facilities
required for the. safe ana comfortable
keeping of so many, the whole top floor
of his house. And his home had now
come to be a rendezvous of artists
seeking living snakes to draw from, of
snake enthusiasts, and of all those hav
ing a technical knowledge of and mak
ing a study of snakes. The number
of these last was comparatively .few,
this branch of herpetology having as
yet but e. limited following.
The New York Sun tells of a man
who has a peculiar penchant for every
kind of snake that crawls. At an age
when most boys are interested in tops
and marbles only, Raymond L. Dit
mars, now curator of reptiles in the
New York Zoological Park, was inter
ested in snakes, not from mere idle
curiosity, but with a renuine interest
In serpents which prompted him to
wok them out and observe and study
them.

Egypt is threatened with a plague of
locusts, and the Government has called
out the array of forced laborers to
combat the pest.- Owing to the young
locusts' habit of never turning back
or aside when once started in a cer
tain direction. It Is possible, by dig
ging trenches, sometimes miles In
length, to entrap the Invading hosts
and destroy them. That's of course,
must be done before the locusts take

can stop their ravages and they swÂ«ep
everything before them.

Spain, the famed Escorial. called by
the Spaniards the eighth wonder of the j
world, has taken on something cf its
former grandeur. Situated nearly j
lour thousand feet above sea level, on :
the bleak, wind-swept slope of the j
Sierra Guadarama. this vast build- i
ing. palace, church, monastery and j
mausoleum combined, is certainly one j
cf the most impressive in Europe. At j
raoh corner of the parallelogram, which j
it forms, stands a tower 200 feet high !
and above the church la tne center of |
the pile rises a magnificent cupola, its j
summit ZY1 feet above the lloor. The ,
building contains 1111 windows, forty- j
one altars, eighty-nine fountains and j
C000 feet of frescoed paintings. The ;
<or.struction of it took twenty-one !

Erected over three hundred years !
:?Â£<â¢ when Spain, a.t the zenith of her
power. dominated the civilization of
lh<? world, it constitutes an enduring
monument to the nation's fallen gran
dour and the memory of its builderâ
that "moroje monk and misanthropic
tyrant" as Thfophile Gautier calls him
. â lung Philip II, whom no historian has
yet undertaken to whitewash. It was
for the dual purpose of commemorat
ing his victory over the French at St.
Quentin. on St. Lawrence's day, i
August 10. 1557, and providing a burial
place for himsrif and his descendants,
that Philip started an army of laborers
at work on the rugged slope of the i
Sierra Guadarama. The first stone
was laid in 1563, the architect being
Todelo. After his death four years
later his pupil. Herrera. carried on the
work to completion. There is still
shown to tourists the lofty seat, hewn
cut of the granite b<jwlder, where the
grim monarch used to sit and watch
the Escorial grow. Legend states
that the form of the structure, chosen
by his direction, was intended to
typify the gridiron on which his patron
saint, St. Lawrence, was martyred.
Excavated deep in the earth, under
the church, is the Pantheon, where re
pose the bones of Spain's royal dead.
' That portion of it reserved for the
Kings and Queens is an octagonal
chamber with twenty-six splendid
urns, all of a size, arranged around the
.walls, blazoned with the names of those
whose dust they contain. Rare bronzes
and marble statuary gleam ghostlike
m in the dim light. Despite its gliding I
* and grandeur, the dominant impres
sion the place creates is one of angQst
simplicity, which instinctively causes
the visitor to sink his voice to a whis
per. And here Spain, th'at drove Isa
bella into exile and would not permit
her to return while living,' gives her
sepulchre among her ancestors, near

decorated from time to time by dc

Lacking his austere simplicity of taste,
most of the changes they wrought
have served only to mar the symmetry
and harmony of the original design.

Lovers of goobers are face to fae#
with a peanut famine. A writer in
the Chicago Chronicle says that the
South has furnished the peanut supply,
but adds: "The spirit of latter-day
commercialism has seized upon the
South and threatens to sever the bond
through which that section has con
tributed so greatly to the gustatory
delight of the nation. It appears that
cotton and goobers thrive best in the
same kind of soil, and the high pricÂ«
of cotton has caused Southern planters
to devote almost their entire acreage to
that staple. As the demand for cotton
is increasing more rapidly even than
the demand for peanuts, it is most
probable that they will continue to dis
criminate in favor of the former staple
despite its fluctuating value, and
against the latter, notwithstanding the
fact that the price always remains the
same, five cents a bag. the country
over. The effect that failure to cul
tivate the peanut will have upon the
social relations of the masses, espe
cially the juvenile element, can only
be surmised, and any surmise will be
fraught with dark forebodings. Neces
sarily the decline of the peanut will
have a tendency to restrict the pleas
ures of recreation, foreshadowing as It
does the doom of the gallery god and
the degeneration of the circus into a
hollow mockery."

THE recent appointment of a member ot the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce upon the advisory
board of the California Promotion Committee is j
an emphatic commentary upon the spirit of co-opera- j
tion that prevails among the commercial bodies of Cali- Â¦
fornia. jThis action was the result of the broad scope
for State development that has formed the basis of the
committee's work, culminating with the April excur
sion of the committee through the south.
The merchants of Los Angeles have become impressed
with the sincerity of the committee in its broad and
far-reaching endeavors. A committee of the Los An
geles Chamber of Commerce, after an investigation, re
ported: "Your comjnittee is satisfied that the work of
the California Promotion Committee is most commend
able and productive of great good toward the develop
ment of the resources and the upbuilding of the whole
State, and certainly merits the encouragement of the
Los Angeles Chamber^ of Commerce."
The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce is the rep
resentative body of California south of the, Tehachapi.
Its work has been directed not alone to Los Angeles,
but to the entire southern part of the State. It is pleas
ing, indeed, that this progressive organization should
enter so readily into the great movement for united
effort in the development of the State. It should be a
matter of congratulation to the merchants of San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles that not only these two cities
but all parts of the State will work shoulder to shoulder
in forwarding their mutual interests.
There is now more enthusiasm in development work in
California than in any other State. If the energy exerted
in promoting various localities be applied to a common
end California will not only advertise her resources in
a manner commensurate with her richness, but she will
devote herself in a remarkable degree to State improve
ment. The greatest incentive to patriotic work of this
kind, which the people of some of California's fertile but
little known interior communities can have, is the assur
ance that they will receive the support and co-operation
of the larger cities. The greatest discouragement they
could have would be a spirit of ungenerous rivalry on the
part of the more powerful communities. The movement
for co-operation is, therefore, thoroughly beneficent and
undeniably practical. Under its influence every commu
nity in California will be stimulated to make known its
advantages and its needs, and good results may be
counted on as foregone conclusions.

The platform conforms to the personal ideal to which
the convention bowed in submission. It indorses social
ism in its broadest feature. It demands government
ownership and operation of railroads, and, as the greater
includes the less, this indorsement runs to public owner
ship of all means of production. The platform makes no
reference to the sound money issue. The old position
on the tariff is distinctly abandoned. The income tax is
thrown overboard. A protective tariff is distinctly in
dorsed with a slight modification in which reduction of
rate is demanded on all American manufactures that are
sold abroad for less than at home. The Republican
party is denounced for not passing a river and harbor
bill at the first session of the present Congress, when
the convention should have known that only one river
and harbor bill is passed by each Congress, and not one
at each session. This bit of hypocrisy was indulged in
for the purpose of accusing the Republican party of de
siring to impair water transportation in the interest of
railroads. So, we suppose that when Mr. Cleveland ve
toed the river and harbor bill it was in the interest of.
railroads!
One exceedingly significant feature of the convention
will occur to the Democrats who were not there. Cleve
land was not mentioned, nor was Bryan, nor any of the
party worthies who were identified with the party re
vival which began with the election in 1874 of the first
Democratic House of Representatives after the Civil
War. Tilden, Seymour, Thurman, Cleveland, Bryan and
all were coldly snubbed, and the convention jumped
clear from Jefferson to Hearst. Between 1800 and 1904 it
had no leader whose personality deserved mention or
honorable ascription. Jefferson and Hearst were put
upon the same pedestal, and the party had no history
between the two- In the presence of these two pieces
of party statuary "immediate restitution of the Democ
racy to power* was demanded, with Hearst for Presi
dent!
Paraphrasing Lincoln, we admit that men who like
that kind of a man for President will like that kind of a
man. Still, as a believer that in a republic there must be
parties, and .that the better tlieir leaders the more de
serving they are of public confidence, we feel that the
Democracy of California could have chosen more wisely
and presented a higher ideal. But water runs no higher,
than its fountain, and ideals are no higher nor purer
than their source, and if the Democracy of this State
wishes to be judged by the ideal man, garlanded and
garnished by its convention, that is- its affair- entirely.
The high-minded Republicans of the State will con
tinue to cherish the great memory of Senator White as
an honor to the State which he served. They will re
member gratefully his vindication of the Republican
Supreme Court against the vicious aspersions of Mr.
Hearst, and they will not accept the judgment of the
Democratic Convention upon Mr. Lane that he was un
fit to have receivedÂ»his party's nomination for Gover
nor, for Republicans felt his steel in combat as the
weapon of an able and high-minded foeman. The Dem
ocratic party, as far as the convention represented it, re
pudiated everything in its history and everybody in its
leadership in order to occupy a position from which it
could laud Mr. Hearst. The State thought better of it
than it seems to have deserved.
The charges of treachery to the late Senator White,
and to numerous candidates of his party here, went un
answered, and the party has indorsed those treacheries
and put upon them the seal of its approval. This can
only mean that the Democracy of California decides that
White was unfit for Senator, Lane for Governor, Farns
worth for Justice of the Supreme Court, and all the
others whose political rights and personal ambitions
Hearst smote unto death deserved what they got. That
matter being decided once for all, the party in this State
selects Mr. Hearst as its ideal, and his personal record
and political conduct as models to be flattered by imita
tion. That being its deliberate choice the organization
knows where it stands, and so do the people.
The opponents of Hearst gave out certain reasons
why they did not follow up the advantage gained in the
primaries in San Francisco. They were implored by the
Democratic office-holders here not to excite Mr. Hearst
to make reprisals through his newspaper. They feared
that their political future would share the evil effects of
the treachery of Hearst under which Lane and his com
panions in misfortune went down, never to rise. That
was accepted as a valid reason for the work of the San
Francisco' delegates, whose votes made the indorsement
possible. As the party indorsed this view by indorsing
Mr. Hearst, others have no fault to find. The Democ
racy of the State seems to have known its man, and he
seems to have known the party. This mutual recogni
tion is in the presence of the whole State, and whether
the spectacle is edifying depends upon the point of
view. Mr. Hearst represents what the Democratic Con
vention wanted; the future must prove or disprove that
it was what the party wanted.
IN the Democratic State Convention McNab and Lane
first won their fight and then lost "it. The reasons
were given in the current talk of the convention, in
which the lavish use of money was assigned as the mo
tive which changed a Hearst minority of twenty-two into
a Hearst majority of nineteen. We assume that all rea
sonable men will admit that if Mr. Hearst deserved the
indorsement of his party in California it should have
been given ungrudgingly and unanimously. If he did
not deserve it it should not have been given at all.
It was In 1871. when money was
plenty, a 25-cent piece being the
smallest coin in circulation, that the
campaign in which Governor Halght
and Newton Booth were running for
the gubernatorial seat resulted in an
amusing incident arising from the
election. Sam Hall, who kept a sa
loon, was a strong Haight man. while
Sam Brannan was equally as strong
for the Republican nominee. Booth.
While discussing the merits of their
men in Hall's saloon one night a wa
ger was made between Hall and Bran
nan with a $500 forfeit that the loser
of the bet should trundle the winner
In a wheelbarrow from .Washington to
California street and back.
When the final day came. Booth be
ing the winner in the election, it was

Creeds and rituals are good, and to many are essen
tials in the. right guidance of life, The devoted spirits
who sustain them are the soldiers in a moral warfare
which is as endless as the weakness and willfulness of
human nature. But the men-at-arms in that warfare
are by no means all the devotees of creed and forms.
Yet they are valiant in the strife. The Unitarians feel
their part in deciding the great issues of life, and they do
they duty in clearness and cleanness of spirit. Their
conference here is on ground where they have earned
the right to be, and San Francisco greets them gladly
and hails their coming as a gratifying event in a year
in which public bodies concerned in the good of man
have chosen California as the meeting place of thousands
who will come as strangers and go away as friends.

DIVINITY SCHOOL ASSURED.
A Unitarian divinity school for the
Pacific States, Mr. Stone said, is at last
assured. The Rev. Earl Wilbur of
Meadville, Pa., has accepted the posi
tion of dean and will begin the work of
organization June 1.
The divinity school will be domiciled
in the building of the Oakland Unita
rian Church.
The money for this project has been
provided, said the speaker, by Mr. and
Mrs. Francis Cutting of Oakland and
the Hon. and Mrs. Horace Davis of San

"Progress In Washington and Ore

The Rev. F. 12 Hosmer of Berkeley,
one of the prominent hymn writers of
the Unitarian fellowship, opened the
afternoon session with an address on
Channing's "Baltimore Sermon."
The sermon was delivered in 1819 at
the ordination of Jared Sparks to the
ministry of the Unitarian 'Church in
Baltimore, and in it, for the first time,
the beliefs of Unitarians as to the na
ture of God, the humanity of Jesus and
the dignity of human nature were first
clearly distinguished from the beliefs
of orthodox Christians.
This Channing sermon, said the Rev.
Mr. Hosmer, is one of three epoch
marking sermons in the history of the
Unitarian movement in America, the
two others being Emerson's "Divinity
School "Address," delivered In 1838, and
Theodore Parker's sermon entitled
"The Transient and the Permanent in
Christianity."
The Surulay-school Conference was
addressed by Mrs. C. E. Grunsky, the

spoke of "The Islands"; Horace Davis,
whose subject was "Japan," and Presi

J. Cullen, a saloon-keeper. Last year
Hayman was mixed up in a scandal

Later Hayman was arrested for pass

paid it and there was no prosecution.
Hnvrnnn Again In Trouble.
i MERCED, May 18.â The indications
are that Merced County will have
about the same grain crop, in the ag
gregate, as last year, when there was
a fair yield. Wheat may be a little
less, barley doubtless more and rye
very short. The acreage and yield of
the latter cereal (once an important
crop in this county) diminishes every
year. Recent hot weather has made the
prospects less bright than they were
three weeks ago.
On the west side the rainfall has been
light and grain is short, but alfalfa
growing, under irrigation, and dairying
Is now the leading 'industry in that
section. The hay crop, aside from al
falfa, is light. Reports in regard to
fruit are somewhat conflicting.
CEREALS WILL GIVE
'AN AVERAGE YIELD
IN MERCED COUNTY
HANFORD, May 18. â The present
conditions and outlook for the agri
cultural crops for this year in this
county are at present very flattering.
The late frost of last month did very
little damage to the fruit, although
some of the grapes were slightly
nipped, but in many places the apricot
crop is said to be over twice as heavy
as it was last year and the crop of
peaches also gives promise of being
fine, perhaps not much more in quan
tity than last year, but better in qual
ity. , The management of the Lucerne
vineyard stated that one of the hail
storms in April did a great deal of
damage to the grape crop there, but
this storm only struck a strip of
country and elsewhere no damage was
done. The prune crop varies in dif
ferent parts of the county, but it is
generally very good, while last year
this class of fruit did not produce much
here. Some damage was also done the
prunes by the hail.
As to the hay crop everything looks
flattering, the first cutting having been
taken care of to a great extent, and
in many cases the alfalfa is again al
most ready to cut.
In the line of grain there is a splen
did story to tell. The Tulare Lake
bottom has literally been transformed
into a wheat field this year, there hav
ing been about 30,000. acres of wheat
and barley sown, and it is said that
it is looking fine and gives promise of
yielding even greater production than
last year. Last season there were hun
dreds of acres of the grain In that
section of country that yielded over
twenty-five sacks per acre and some
went as high as thirty-five sacks.
There is some report that smut has
got into the grain, but there Is noth
ing authentic as to what extent.

Dr. A. C. Kellogg of the Phelan

MacNider's father is said to be pres

Owing to the cost of bringing wit

charge was made petty larceny. Dr.
Kellogg said that MacNider had also
borrowed 515 from him. They had

Hans G. Kuhl is a stockbroker. He
looks prosperous, but according to his
own statements, made in Judge Heb-'

months past been living on borrowed
money, and has not even money
enough to defray the costs of the Buit
for maintenance brought against him
by his wife, Helen Kuhl. He stated,
however, that Mrs. Kuhl had a small
fortune of her own and that she was
fully able to defray the costs of the
BuiL This fact the lady indignantly
denied, so Judge Hebbard ordered the
matter off calendar until such time as
the parties came to an understanding,
holding that the case could not be
tried until the costs had been paid.
The Kuhls have been in court many
times. Twice has Kuhl tried to secure
a divorce on the ground of cruelty,
but on each occasion has failed to
prove that his wife was cruel to him.
Xow Mrs. Kuhl is having her day in
court, having filed the cult for main

Kuhl's second suit for divorce.
Judge Hebbard granted Anna C. Cun

"Progress of the Unitarian Church
in the Pacific States, With a Study of
Opportunities" was the subject of an
address by the Rev. George W. Stone,
field secretary for the Pacific States,
This concession will not be readily ma<ij
tnd the oj.K>n shop may not be considered an
op<-n question. A stand may be made upon it.
The hope of peace and good will is in wise
Uadership Â«n<t that again rests with the in
telligence and character of the membership.
In any organization the first test is the wise
and Just uee of the power gained through as
Â¦delation. â¢
I,ike all great questions the labor problem
is one of morals.
For itf> complete settlement it will wait till
all men are manly in the highest sense; till
Justice, sympathy, unselfishness an<! good will
are grounded in individual character.
I believe that in the Ions run the unions
will be stronger when, while adhering to the
scale, they do not make membership oblig
atory tipon all with whom they will consent
to work.
UNIONS WILL IMPKOVE.
Labor conditions and labor union
organizations and the status of the
employer came up in an interesting
form at the second day's session of the
Pacific Coast Conference of the Unita
rian and other Christian churches yes
terday.
Th- conference, which is being held
at the Second Unitarian Church,
Twentieth and Capp streets, was
largely attended and was presided
over by Charles A. Murdock.
The present day industrial problem
was evolved from an address on
"Channjng and Social Reform," by
Mr. Murdock. who reviewed the po
sition of employer and employe. Mr.
Murdock said in part:
n.ti: Qtxnr.tTtd labor ha* made, is making
and will continue to make mistakes does not
n.Jitate against Its rights and should not de
prive it of toleration and reasonable for
bearance.
There are three Trays of looking- at the
trades union. The overzealous member sees
In It hiÂ» cnly hojje and he will follow ii, right
or wrong.
The narrow-minded business man sees In It [
only a menace to society and fcÂ« opposes it,
rijrht ct wrong. The Just and dftcernlnjr clt
iztn sees it mixed of good and evil, with
Kreat power lor either, and will sympathize '
vith its purpose and methods when they are
gond and resist them when they are bad.
Reasonable concessions will be wanted; un
reasonable demands will be denied when they
are vufficiently unreasonable to demand re-
Ei&tance. - Â¦
Forbearance will be shown till It ceases to
be a virtue and then- a firm stand will be
taken.
That methods of enforcing the will of or
sanizt-d labor are unpleasant and even un- '
Ju?t will not Justify retaliation In kind, but
violence when It becomes lawless must bÂ«
rrrreiifred with' the whole power of society
and the a-tate.
LAW MUST GOVERN*.
All efforts at righting wrongs or advancing
conditions must be made within the law.
Vested rights must be respected and American
citizenship mukt ba always superior to class
organization.
Trades unions are meeting a crisis In their
history. Their remarkable growth and their
overbearing disregard of the rights of others
In enforcing what th*y consider th*ir own
have resulted In counter organisation on a
larger scale they have heretofore encountered.
ThÂ«-re is In this both hep*- and danger.
If an orpanizatlon of those whose interests
1 culler by too rajnd or too great changes does
not decenerate in"i> an opposition to labor
crganiiations and their legitimate ends and
methods, but contents itself with opposing
abuse of power and holding the unions to
obedience to the law and peaceful and hon
orable methods . of procedure, all will be well
and preparation for war will insure peace and
promote justice.
The crucial question to-<Jay is whether or
gaÂ«.ized labor can survive the "open shop."
Society seems to have settled into a firm
conclusion that the trades unions may use
their power within the law, to increase wages,
shorten hour* and generally improve condi
tion.*, but thnt they shall mt deny the right
of labor to their fellowmen who do not be
long to unions.
A great burst of applause here in
terrupted the speaker and when the
expression of approval of the assem
blage subsided Mr. Murdock contin
ued:
Unquestionably they will be greatly weak
ened by the o!*n shop, but when they are
thrown upon moral nuafion they will gain
Â«son:e elements of strength. Their member
ship must be fu^tained by its attraction, and
if It is to hold the beet men it muft be juat
and fair. Wror.g and injustice are always a
source of weakness. \Vh:Ie they often promote
immediate FuctesÂ« they finally bring deteriora
tion and disaster.

Franke's wife informed Deputy

strangely recently, ar.d that he left
home at 9 o'clock Tuesday morning
without Informing her as to his destin

a bottle which contained carbolic acid,
and a collapsible alluminum cup, from
which Franke had drunk the poison.
Franke had an imaginary grievance
against Mrs. Stanton, wno conducted
a competing bakery across the street
from his store at Mo. 5419 Mission

plained to the police that he had
threatened to burn Mrs. Stanton's
bakery, and a police detective had an
interview with Franke with regard to
the matter.

SALINAS CITY, May 18.â Reports
from various parts of Monterey County
insure fair crops. TheNvarm weather
of several weeks ago, while it did a
great deal of harm, has been In a
measure overcome by the fine growing
'weather of the last three weeks.
In the southern part of the county,
around San Miguel, San Lucas, Brad
ley and San Ardo, the Indications are
for a good year. Although in that sec
tion tbe rainfall has not been up to the
average, all reports are that the grain
is rapidly heading and propects are
good. In the hills of the southern part
of the county the cattle and sheep men
tell of plenty of feed.
The region around Soledad and King
City will not give average crops this
year. The rainfall has been below the
average and the hot weather of April,
combined with the north winds, has
hurt the prospects badly. In the Â£iock
wood and Jolon country tbe prospects
are fine for a large grain crop.
In the northern part of Monterey
County the crops will be up to the av
erage, although the rainfall has been
but ten inches for the season, compared
with twelve of last year. There will
not be as large a beet acreage as usual,
but much more acreage of potatoes and
grain. From Gonzales and Chaular up
the valley the prospects are line for a
good year and with fair prjees for farm
products Monterey County will gen
erally enjoy prosperity.
SOLEDAD, May 18. â Short crops is
the result of the climatic conditions
affecting the immediate vicinity of this
place. The cause cannot be removed,
as it is impossible to change the phys
iography of this part of Monterey
County, bearing as it does the stamp
of nature. A gradual'change has tak v
en place on the west side of the Sa
linas River since 1895, when the first
pumping plant was erected on the
lands of the ex-mission of Soledad
(1710 acres). At present the Salva
tion Army colony's 520 acres; Spreekr
els ranch No. 2, 1176 acres, and lands
belonging to other parties are mostly
under irrigation. Last year's products
from the above lands, in addition to
alfalfa raised for dairy purposes, were
approximately 2000 boxes of decid
uous fruits, 7500 tons of sugar beets,
22,510 bags of Burbank potatoes and
a few hundred bags of beans. There
will be this season an increase in the
potato crqp of from 3000 to 5000
bags. The wonderful contrast pre
sented between the aspect and produc
tiveness of, the irrigated and unirri
gated land is marked. On the east
side of the Salinas River there are
dry and short crops, but the west" side
is productive.

Gibson told on the stand of the vari
ous conversations he had had with
Soeder during the defendant's incar
ceration. General Salomon insisted on
the exact language of these conversa
tions during the "sweating process,"
but Gibson said he could not remem
ber it. 'â¢>., 'i '
Theodore Kytka, the handwriting ex
pert, was called to testify as to
whether or not Soeder drew the chart
on the margin of a newspaper that was
submitted the previous day during the
direct examination of Cooper. Kytka
had not proceeded far before General
Salomon announced that the defense
was willing to admit that Soeder drew
the chart, a fact exclusively announced
In The Call of yesterday. An order for
some clothing at the Flatley home was
also Introduced and admitted by the
defendant to have been written by him.
Kytka's services were no longer need
ed. The only piece of writing intro
duced that has been disputed by the
defense is on the scraps of paper
picked up by a reporter at 4800 Mission
street and alleged by Kytka to be in
the handwriting of Soeder.
Rather unexpectedly, the prosecution
announced the close of its case ot 3:50
in the afternoon. At the request of
counsel for the defense a postpone
ment was taken until 10 o'clock this
morning, as no witnesses were on hand.
"I'll blow this prosecution to pieces,"
said General Salomon after the ad
journment. "My defense will be short,
but It will utterly destroy any claim
that Leon Soeder murdered Joseph
Blaise." .
Other witnesses called during the day
were Captain of Detectives Martin,
who told of his Interviews with SoÂ«der
after the arrest; James Bowie, a cook,
who met Soeder after his return from
Germany, and told of a conversation
that had no bearing on the charge
against the defendant; and Miss Annie
Brown, habitue of a dive on Pacific
street, who says she called on the Val
lerta girls in an effort to induce them
to go to the County Jail to visit Soe
der. The Brown woman was a visitor
to Cooper at the. jail, and the alleged
trip to the Spanish restaurant was said
to have been made at his request.
FORGETS THE LANGUAGE.
court was given him after General
Salomon, chief counsel for the defense,
had made an attempt to Impeach his
testimony. The Judge ruled that a
broad cross-examination was out of
order under the agreement at the pre
vious adjournment. Salomon succeed
ed In showing that Cooper was now
a trusty at the County Jail and was
allowed the freedom of the corridors
from early morning until late at night.
In response to questions as : to
whether he had told two prisoners at
the County Jail,' named Murphy and
Fallon, that Soeder had never made
a confession to him, he answered tttat
he might have done so, but it was In
order to deceive them regarding the
facts.
Incidentally, some of the information
regarding the Soeder case which was
published exclusively In The Call short
ly after the murder, and which was
strenuously denied by the police, was
brought out during the testimony of
Detective Tom Gibson in the afternoon.
He testified that the woman at the
clothes-cleaning establishment, where
Soeder sent his gray suit of clothes on
the morning of the discovery of Blaise's
body, positively identified a photograph
of Joseph Nieblas, landlord of the
house where Soeder and Blaise roomed
just prior to the murder, as the man
who brought the clothing to the estab
lishment. Cooper has testified that Boe
der told him Nieblas had agreed to kill
Blaise, but "got cold feet." The alleged
connection of Nieblas with the crime
was also published exclusively In The
Call, but the police failed to investigate
fully circumstances that might have
proved a conspiracy to take the life of
Blaise.

Cooper was the first witness in the

Cooper grew white at first, and then
the blood surged back to his face. For
more than two minutes he studied the
seams on his shoes, quivering like an
aspen. Then he looked toward District
Attorney Byington, and the latter nod
ded to him. Still he refused to answer
until Byington put the question:
"Have you any change to make In
your testimony?"
"Nothing," he replied, faintly.
WITNESS nESTTATES.
"Yes."
"The court has no desire or Inten
tion of intimating in any way, either
that your testimony is true or that it
is false, but that you may have the
opportunity of correcting the game if
any of it has been untrue. I I inform
you that under the laws of tills State
any person who by willful perjury
procures the conviction and execution
of any innocent person is punishable
by death.
"With the knowledge of the penalty
attached in sftch cases, have you any
changes or corrections to make in your
testimony?" -
There was another sensation in the
Soeder case yesterday. For the first
time in the history of the Superior
courts a Judge admonished a witness
that perjury leading' to the execution
of a prisoner would constitute a cap
ital offense.
Judge Cook gave the warning, to
John Cooper, who has testified that
Leon Soeder, in the Broadway jail,
confessed in detail that he had mur
dered Joseph Blaise.
It was -evident from Judge â¢ Cook's
manner "and speech that he was . In
credulous of the strange story that
Cooper told regarding Soeder*s alleged
confession of the murder of his broth
er-in-law. Among the Jury there were
indications of a similar disbelief of
Cooper's weird tale. - Trained attor
neys in the courtroom pronounced it
preposterous. Judge Cook's instruc
tion was as follows:
"Cooper, you understand that the
defendant In tills case Is charged with
the" crime of murder?"
"Yes," answered the witness.
"You also understand that the pun
ishment for mnrder in the first degree
may be death.?"

A very different kind of female
complainant in a somewhat similar
case was Mrs. Julia Roach of 31%

band, John F., before Judge Mogan
for battery. She appeared fragile and
careworn, while he looked fit to fight
Jeffries.
"I don't mind being beaten when
I'm well," said the little woman, "but

old and the other five are hot old

"I was only fooling," the big fellow
muttered, shamefacedly. Â¦

of how her" husband, diminutive and
mild mannered, had beaten her. "The
worst of it was," she said in deep con
tralto, "he hadn't been drinking when
he slapped my face."
"Mary's a time you punched my
face," faltered the little man, with a
voice that would qualify him for en
listment in a boy choir.
"Oh, we won't consider that now,"

Is not a "Boys' Nickel Library" hero.
Having reason to suspect that his
mother had been informed of his tru
ancy, Paul dreaded a meeting with his
father, and decided to run away and
become a pirate or a bandit of .some
kind and make an immense fortune,
equipped with which he would return
home and purchase his parents' for
giveness. 'Til go you runnin' away,"
he proposed to Willie Cook, his chum
and senior by one year, but as the
evening was chilly and Willie hadn't
"played hookey," the proposal was
declined. Then Paul decided to become
a lone desperado, and with this deter
mination he sat down upon a bench
in front of Fred Held's meat market at
1303 Buchanan street, to map out a
plan of campaign. While engaged in
self-argument as to whether it would
be wisest to inaugurate his career of
outlawry by plundering a bank or bur
glarizing a candy store he fell asleep.
Then came the great adventure.
It was about 11 o'clock p. m., Paul
says, when he was awakened by a
noise and saw a man "monkeying"
with the lock on the door of the meat
market. He recognized the man as
one Dennis Gallagher, also known aB
"Happy Hooligan." and at once came
glorious realization that he was wit
vjiessing a real sure-enough burglary.
Holding his breath lest it might alarm
the marauder and spoil the episode,
Paul saw the lock vield to the key,
the door swing open, the man enter
the store, the cash register approached
and rifled, the burglar's exit and dis
appearance in the darkness. All- of
these things Paul saw with his own
eyes. The next thing he saw with the
same optics was the door standing
open. Then he saw that the recent
visitor had carelessly left a bunch of
keys and some slips of paper lying
upon a chopping block inside. A per
son older in years and possessed of
more discretion would probably have
summoned the police. But Paul was
sleepy, so he entered the store, pock
eted the keys and the slips of paper,
climbed into an ice box and resumed
his slumber. Soon afterward he was
again awakened by a noise and when
he sat up in the refrigerator and
peeped out he saw Special Officer Har
vey exploring the premises. The boy
made his presence known, explained
it as hereinbefore narrated and was es
corted to his home, where daddy was
so interested by his story that the in
tended whipping never took : place.
In the" court of Judge Mogan yester
day Paul was a voluble witness against
Gallagher and Willie Cook- and Johnny
Eager also testified. The case was
continued till to-day.
. â¢ â¢
Judge Mogan expressed regret that
he could not convict Joe Brandi for
perjury. "For I have no doubt," said
he, "that you have committed perjury,
and that the acquittal of this man San
to Moscow is a miscarriage of Justice
caused by your false swearing."
Brandi complained that he- had been
stabbed in the neck by Moscow, and he
showed a deep knife wound to'substan
tiate his complaint, but subsequently
declared that he had merely been
struck with Moscow's fist and that no
knife was used by the latter. The men
are Italian scavengers.
"Uhl, remember him," said Bailiff
Hickey, addressing the prisoner and al
luding to the bench." Clerk Grey heard
the remark and chuckled so loudly that
the Judge asked to be admitted to the
joke.
1 "Best thing Hickey has got off in a
year," giggled the clerk; "he told Uhl
that he'll remember you."
His Honor's smile was strictly per
functory.
For stealing seventy pounds of pig
iron John Flynn was given four months
by Judge Mogan. William Uhl, who
6tole a cashbox containing trinkets
from Peter Dahl of 857 Howard street,
was sentenced to three months by the
same tribune.

William A. Small is held to answer in
the Superior Court the charge of grand
larceny. Judge Fritz pronounced him
guilty of embezzling some diamonds
from Mrs. Sinkey and fleeing to New
Orleans, where he was arrested. His
bail is $2000.

"Well, deal gently with a landlubber
Police Chief or Judge if you should ever
get him in your clutches. One good
turn deserves another. Reciprocity is
the life of officialism. Back to the bil
lows."
Charles Connolly, master at arms
aboard the transport Sherman, was
among the plain drunks dismissed with
a reprimand by Judge Mogan.
"Isn't a master at arms on shipboard
equal In rank to a Chief of Police on
shore?" queried the Judge.
"Yes, sir," was the answer.
. . .
John Radstone had a pistol muzzle at
his right ear and was about to pull the
trigger when Special Officer George
Farrell stayed his hand. "Whisky, I
guess," was Mr. Radstone's answer to
Judge Mogan's query anent his reason
for attempting self-destruction.
It was at 3:30 o'clock Tuesday after
noon and in a grocery at Third and
Mission streets that Radstone first
tried to take his life. He fired at his
head and missed, and then he went to
the sidewalk, where a second bullet
flew wide. As he had the revolver
pressed closely to his ear to make a
sure thing of the third shot Officer
Farrell leaped from a passing street
car and thwarted his purpose.
The man refuses to tell who he is or
where he came from. His clothing is
good and his age about 30 years. He
will be sentenced to-day for disturbing
the peace.

were proceeding up the stairway Mr.
Prank yelled to the ticket-taker, "Don't
let 'em con ye. kid." Other ladies and
gentlemen were similarly subjected to
uncalled-for criticism from Mr. Prank.
"You may think \VÂ§ funny," said
Judge Mogan to Mr. Prank, "to inject
discord into Harmony Hall, but that
prank is likely to be costly to you, Mr.
Prank. Come around to-morrow and
I'll tell you the rest."

BERKELEY, May 18.â It has never
been given to any class to go forth
â¢from a university under auspices so
kindly as those that hovered about the
class of '04 of the University of Califor
â¢cla. There was a sermon by the men
and a prayer from the lips of nature
ar.d a benediction from out of the
mother's heart. It carried inspiration
.to every eon and daughter of the uni
\-ersity.
Nature stalked across the campus in
h. new spring mantle this morning and
waited patiently for the commence
ment hour. She soared over the Greek
Theater and shed light and warmth
upon the tiers of the classic pile. The
day was perfect.
President Wheeler's address to the
graduates was a spring running waters
of hope ajid truth. It was only a tale
cf things the world knows well and of
the Etuff that other commencement ad
dresses have been made of, but It was
good to hear. It Inspired new resolu
tions in every breast.
The addresses of Governor Pardee
and five distinguished graduates, rep
resenting as many colleges of the uni
versity, were no less interesting. These
speakers raised their voices in the pres
ence of 5000 people. There was a great
crowd in front of them and back of
them, upon the stage, faculties and
graduates in full academic regalia.
The academic procession, marshaled
by Professor Frank Soule, formed on
the campus an hour before the exer
cises'began. It was subdivided by col
leges and the long line, with its 700 men
and v.-omen In cap and gown, stretched
out like an army. The faculties, with
President Wheeler and Governor Par
<5eÂ« and the aJumnl brought up the
rear until the. order of march was re
versed and then they marched through
the double line of students to the thea
ter.
EXERCISES BEGIN.
The commencement exercises began
with the Invocation by the" Rev. Carrol
llelvin Davis of the class of '79. The

â¢Glee Club was followed by the intro
duction of Herbert McLean Evans as
the first commencement speaker. Mr.

Is at length to realize the improve

citizens have so long labored for. Th**
new Board of Trustees has taken hoU
of the work with a zeal that promises
the best results In very short order.
At the meeting last night the City En
gineer was instructed to prepare with
out an Instant's delay specifications for
the repaving of the principal streets
In the most approved bitumen method.
They are Second. Third and Baldwin
avenues and B street, the principal
trade mart. They also passed reso
lutions which call for the laying of
five-foot sidewalks throughout the en
tire section of the city lying west ot
the Southern Pacific Railroad, known
as the "Western Addition, and embrac
ing the greater part of the settled
area, both business and residential.
On many of these streets or portions
of them substantial walks are already
laid, but they are now to be made uni
form and universal. . A penalty or
dinance also was adopted by the board
requiring all houses to be renumbere-i
on the decimal system of 100 numbers
to the block. The Street Superintend
ent was directed to require all hedg-33
to be kept trimmed and all overhang
ing branches to be removed. In va
rious other ways the city is to be Im
proved and beautified under the al
most unlimited authority of the Vroo
man street law. The board is thor
oughly In earnest and will permit of
no delay in the inauguration and com

prospect of a tourist hotel the future
of San Mateo is very alluring.

The main commencement address,
on the subject, "Higher Education and
Progress," was delivered by Dr. "O. L.
Elliott, the university registrar. His
speech dwelt mainly on the powers,
opportunities and influence of educa
tion in the world^ In a scholarly elab
oration of the thought that "in the
fresh page of childhood Is the hope of
the world," he showed how nations
are coming more and more to depend
on their youth and how the education
of. the youth is the great factor in na
tional development.
Dr. ' Jordan addressed -. a parting
word to the graduates after their, di
plomas were conferred. He spoke on
"The College Man in American Life,"
with all his characteristic force. " His
speech was brief, but -exceptionally
strong and full of meaning. In part
it was as follows:
This diploma of the university is now In
your hands at last. It grants you all the
powers and privileges which any diploma ever

tifies - that you are youth of promise, college
men and women, ready for life â the life which
each of you is best fitted to live.

Hall this morning. In addition to the
regular graduates of the 1904 class
twenty-five students were recipients of
advanced degrees.
The ceremonies attending the. grad

10:30 o'clock the candidates filed into
the hall and marched down the center
aisle between rows of admiring friends
and relatives. All the young ladles
were garbed in flowing black gowns
and scholars' caps, a becoming and
dignified costume for the occasion.
Bringing up the rear of the procession
were the aspirants for advanced de
grees, both ladies and men wearing
gowns with hoods, designating tholr
special departments of study. The
graduates , were seated immediately in
front of the rostrum and at the close
of the exercises, stepped upon the
stage" one at a time to receive their di
plomas from Registrar Elliott. Ap
plause, varying In intensity " with dif

A- college education means much more than
intellectual awakening, much more than mental
discipline. It means the capacity for team
work in the higher affairs of life. It means
the ability to act together. It " means tne
generalship of - sympathy, the power to know
men and to assign to each the work he can
do best and most loyally. It is this trait
of college men. the social trait, the moral
trait of loyal solidarity, which most appeals
to the world. It Is this which gives the ad
vantage to the college-bred men aa compared
with other men who may have- equal native
ability, equal skill, or equh-alent experience.

by George Asa Harker of the medical

self briefly to the problems that a stu

saying in part:
â¢ The medical student realizes that his under
graduate work is the leant part of hln medical
study and that he is necessarily limited dur
ing, his course to work which in many direc

sented to him certain phases of different
studies, each having mere particular signifi

of medicine, in that as he advances the stu

snd exercise*, not to mention those happy
lazy hours when she and her. best friends
talk and build their castles Jn Spain. And
so she lives healthy, happy, keenly interested
in all about her.
This typÂ» Is the one to which the true col
lege woman should and does conform. All
recognize this fact. Â¦ and each college In its
own way tries to accomplish these results.
The mental and physical development com*
of necessity. The conscientious ntudent feels
that she rr.uet complete her hours and do her
gymnasium work. Then. too. there Is basket
ball. tennK rowing. All are offered In such
tanglbl- and evident forms that one cannot
avoid them. But the side that often needs
the greatest development cannot be brought
under the courses of study and Is overlooked
by the girl herself. There must be tÂ«jme
thlng to rhange the raw girl Into a refined
woman. This *oc!al side of a girl's charac
ter Is at such a stage of development when
she comes to college that college life may
make or mar it. And so this muÂ«>t of neees-
Flty be the chief formative power, at least
for the girl away from home. For the ac
complishment of this very definite result the
Conditions of the Eastern . wnnvin'p college
seem more auspicious than those that now
obtain â¢ in this university. The students make
their homes in either a dormitory or cottages
with the teachers. They work' together have
their good times together, become a' unit.
Then the personal influence is felt correcting
imperfections, giving refinement and ease of
manner.' *
TYPE FOR WOMEN*.
But true to thÂ» Greek standard, "nothing
too much.*' she has taken also her share of
fun. her share of the work in outslds activi
ties. This iÂ» the all around college woman.
Her education Is mental, physical, social. She
comes, to the college to develop a well rounded
character, not to be phenomenal in one re
ypect, insignificant In another.
Of the many women students, one finds that
the same ceneral type* are everywhere. There
Is the clrl who makes college one long task.
She has no time tor anything but work, and
iÂ«jfcs inlo college and comes out again the
same . eirl, except that fche know* more of
Latin roots than fhe did before. She has no
greater knowledge of people, nor appreciation
of life. In direct contract to her Is the girl
who does r.othinc, the college butterfly. Her
Plight is even more deplorable.
The third type 1? the Ideal one. First of all
i>he- is a student. To her college has a serious
meaning, for its is the preparation for her
future work, whether it be home-making or
a rTofession. So she does her work, even if
she is working her way. or has (.tht-r duties
outside. These may affect the amount of
work she dees, but not the quality. She may
not be a brilliant student, but* she is far
above the average. So w must reccgnlze the
student side as the strongest.

Max Thelen addressed himself to the
subject of "Practical Leadership," in
which he pointed out the obligation of
the students of the university and the
service they might render their, alma
mater by honest leadership and initia
tive. He said in part: ,
College trains men to be leaders. At the
same time it trains these leaders to use their
power for the good of society. When college
inests college and tram meets team the athlete
struggles not for himself, but for the student
body which- la behind him. He who leads
for the sake, of his fellow-students will In
after life lead for the sake of his fellowmen.
This is the kind of leadership which the world
demands. It is the kind for which the college'
man should train, himself. It is the kind for
the development of 'which the' university fur
nishe* abundant opportunity.
Great have been. the services of .universities
In the creation of scholars. No less necessary
and useful are mtn who can apply their trained
thought to the realm , of practice. He who
make<i a labor-saving Invention, who leads
men toward good' government, who makes their
lives more useful and .happy, has not Jived
in vain.
Tue world needs practical college men
men who lead â¢ in- order that they may serve.
May many such go. forth from this university!
Upon Governor Pardee devolved the
duty of presenting to the officers' of '.the
cadet regiment their commissions. Be
fore this formality ,he delivered a brief
address, calling upon the. graduates to
uphold the honor of the university
always.
President Wheeler announced the
award to Calvin O. Esterly of the Conte
Fellowship and to Max Thelen of the
university, medals for scholarship. He
then delivered the following: address,
preliminary. to, the formality of deliver
ing the degree*, saying In part:
Members of the : graduating classes of : all
I'rojudlce . and Ignorance of the simplest
facts cf bacteriology and physiology are large
ly responsible for disease, and even in his
und' rgraduate clinical work the etudent finds
himself facing not alone the problem of heal
ing, but that of educating.
It Is here that he begins to see the new
meaning of his medical . work. He finds that
his peculiar study nnd training have given
him a value in the community beyond the
mere technical performance of bis duties as a
physician.
There must nlro be a willingness to keep
In touch with the development of laboratory
methods, many of which have become Indis
pensable to tlie modern workfr In medicine.'
And because financial success Is possible
without thÂ«4ie factors the individual can easily
drift into habits of Inaccuracy and indolence.
The moral- to -be drawn is twofold: The
necessity of training the senses and the will
ingness to use them.
TWOFOLD MORAL.

The largest number of alumni of
the university that have ever come to
Berkeley for commencement gathered
this afternoon at Hearst Hall to take
luncheon ind talk over the affairs of
the university. This was the twenty
tifth anniversary of the class of '79.
and that class was given the place of
honor. Governor George C. Pardee
answered the toast to '79, and spoke
of himself as "the youngest graduate
of the younpest class." The prominent
members of the class who attended the
reunion were O. K. Knapp and Dr. C.
M. David, the latter of whom had
come from St. Louis to attend. Clin
ton Day 5f the class of "63 and one
of the pioneer graduates was one of
the guests.
Edward Booth, '77, the vice presi
dent of the Associated Alumni, acted
as tnastmaster, and responses were
made by Dr. David, Governor Pardee.
Judge J. R. Aiken. J. E. Roadhouse
and Professor Moses. Professor Moses
spoke of the good old days and re
ferred with regret to the "Florodora
days" that have come upon the col
lege. The pretty girl graduates who
acted as waitresses showed their dis
approval of this statement by setting
up a vigorous murmur. Every one
thought the tilt between Professor
Moses and the girls was a good ' joke,
and so the incident passed.

Manager Harris may make one or
two changes in his team when it re
turns from the north on Tuesday, but
will do nothing, without . consulting
Captain Irwin. Los Angeles will prob
ably let one man go when Toman re
covers' and Seattle will flght it out "to
the end with'the same line-up. 'â¢*.*
Oakland Is crippled by the tem
porary loss of Lohman'a services, but
Jimmy Byrnes makes a more accept
able change catcher than did Boet
tlger. Lohman will' probably bench
young Streib and alternate Moskiman
and Graham in the outfield now that
he is again in front. v
With the baseball game of yesterday
the entire complexion of the Pacific
Coast League pennant race was alter
ed, Oakland going into first place and
Seattle Jumping from fourth to sec
ond position, while Tacoma dropped
two holes and Los Angeles one.' This
afternoon may see another complete
switch, as a game won or lost by any,
of the four leaders will cause another
eruption in the percentage table. For
well-balanced teams and closeness of
the contestants the race has never
been equaled or even approached in
the West. Portland is the only team
with no . chance to win the flag for
the first half of the playing season.
San Francisco is not distanced by any
means and with a couple of good
weeks against Portland may pull up
on even terms with the leaders or at
least within striking distance for the
run home.

DELMAR SELECTIONS.
The proprietors were equal to the oc
casion and had the results of the races
telegraphed them from the East by
private agencies. The change* meant a
delay in the news of about fifteen min
utes. Joseph Harvey,- who is the head
of the largest poolroom in Sausallt<->.
stated last evening that he had failed
to learn anything definite from the
Representatives of the telegraph com
pany relative to the future stand of
the company, but he added that he and
others Identified with the poolrooms
were hopeful of entering into some ar
rangement with the Western IJnion for
a resumption of the special service.
Failing in this plan it is the intention
of the poolroom men to employ agents
at all the race tracks and have them
telegraph the race results to the rooms
on this coast. An association of pool
room men throughout the country, the
main purpose of which would be the
securing of a quick service by wir*
from the tracks to the different con
cerns, was also suggested by several of
the gamblers as a possible outcome of
the action of the telegraph company.
So far none of the local poolrooms
have closed, and their proprietors, the
majority of whom run cigar stores,
claim the withdrawal of the telegraph
service will not affect their business,
for the major portion of them depend
entirely on the results of the races aa
published the following day and pay
off at the oriccs at which the horses
were quoted on going to the post.

Racing To-Day at Latonia.
Commissioners were started from
Chicago to the racetracks yesterday in
anticipation of the step taken by the
telegraph company In discontinuing
racetrack information so far as book
makers, saloons and sporting head
quarters are concerned. These commis
sioners were delegated to arrange for a
special private service to go into imme
diate effect. The big rooms were open
as usual to-day and expect to do busi
ness on a larger scale to-morrow. The?
gamblers expect the enforced elimina
tion of competition from saloon-keep
ers, cigar dealers, barbers, billiard
halls and similar gathering places will
provide a harvest for them,.
Believe Action of Western Union Will
Improve Their Business in Cliicajo.
CHICAGO, May IS.â The gamblers re
ceived another "body blow" to-day
when the Western Union Telegraph
.Company withdrew its racetrack ser
vice forthwith. By some chance the or
der became known to tne big men of
the fraternity two days ago. In conse
quence preparations had been made to
meet it. Instead of being a fatal
blow the order proved a source of re
joicing to the members of the so-called
"trust" in that it put the small fry out
of business, leaving a clear field to the
bookmakers with large capital and
other powerful resources.

When Canole enters the ring he will
have as one of his advisers the veteran
Martin Murphy. His manager, Jim
Connelly, will select the other two men
to-day who will be in Canole's corner.
Joe Angell and Jack Burke have served
Canole as sparring partners and have
profited by his cleverness.
Canole Is down to weight at h's camp
at Croll's Gardens In Alameda and
hereafter he will do nothing but light
work. He and his trainers are satis
fied with his condition and should the
clever Canole go- down to defeat before
Battling Nelson it will not be because
of poor form.
Canole has eliminated boxing from
his dally programme and most of his
exercising Is done on the road. He
went out for a four-mile spin in the
morning yesterday and during the aft
ernoon repeated the performance.
Nelson did his last boxing yesterday,
as he will take no chance of Injuring
his hands on the eve of bo important
a battle. His manager, Teddy Murphy,
wants to bet $400 against 5500 on Nel
son. He thinks these are the proper
odds in view of Canole's showing with
Britt.
They are unlike in the matter of
fighting, for they adopt an altogether
different style. Canole is clever, with
wonderful epeed and a great "left hand.
He uses a vast -amount of foot work
in his contests. Nelson is a' rugged
fighter, who Is willing at all times to
take a punch, to give one and in the
matter of assimilating punishment It
is said he has Kid Broad outclassed.
He is an aggressive fighter and his
ruehing-in tactics have made him an
idol around the Middle West, where he
Is best known. Nelson Is game and is
possessed of a good punch in each
hand, but he relies more on his decided
aggressiveness to wear his opponent
down. With opponents showing two
distinct styles of attack It is usually
the case that the best sort of a fight
results. The aggressive fighter keeps
the clever one on the jump and forces
him to put into action all the clever
ness he possesses to avoid his oppon
ent's rushes.
Martin Canole, the clever Massachu
setts lightweight, will engage Battling
Nelson in a contest at Woodward's
Pavilion to-morrow night that Is to be
governed by the straight Queensberry
rule system of milling. It is carded to
go twenty rounds. The men are evenly
matched as regards ring records and
past fights and in the matter of weight,
but Canole is a shade the taller of the
pair and he has a little the best of it
in the matter of reach. Both are
youngsters of perhaps twenty-three
years and both have been milling
something like four or five years.
Neither has ever been knocked out.
PETALUMA, May IS.â The weather
turned line to-day for the races at
Kenilworth Park and the track was
fast. H. Stevens' geldlns John Boggs
won the first event handily. S. J.
Jones* Misty's Pride won the second
easily, as did Priestllke the* third race.
M. A. Stephenson's mare Homage ran
a good race In the fourth number,
going from last place at start to first
at the wire. She was 15 to 1 in the bet
ting. The fifth and srxtn races were
closely contested. Nullah took the
fifth, well ridden by George Bullman,
the brother of Jockey John Bullman.
Harry Stover's Illowaho took the sixth,
heading the field at the stretch turn
and leading to the wire. The news of
the pool-room trouble was received
with rejoicing by the Jockey Club As
sociation and by the bookies. Prepa
rations are being made to accommodate
the greater attendance expected at thÂ«
track. There has been some talk of
extending the meet. Summary:

There were two hours of turbulency
yest&tlay afternoon at Recreation â¢
I'ark. From almost the start to the
close Morley's men kept the tempera
ture of Umpire Jeunness at fever heat, J
and at one period an assault was made j
upon him that narrowly missed bring
ing down his curtain for the balance
uf the day.
Jud Smith was again leading man
in the time of embroilment, and. with
Flood, was relegated to inactivity in
the sixth, a squad of policemen being
needlessly summoned to the field to en
loice the ruling of the court.
. It was Smith who nearly brushed
BVBjr the sunlight from the muchly
criticized vision of the badgered ref
eree. Ganley had traveled to second
en a slnzlc and steal, and daringly es
sayed to score on an infield play.
Smith claimed that Ganley cut out
pome of the distance and did not touch
the third corner. The form of putting
out the runner was gone through, but
Jeunness allowed the run to score, as
lie had been watching the play else
where. The customary controversy
followed, ivith Flood as chief debater,
and while the umpire was walking
toward the plate from first base Smith
put all the force at his command in
throwing the ball at Jeunness. The j
mitsslle whizzed by the face of the I
umpire. The order of retirement then j
west into effect.
Cravath was another sufferer. He
was inclined to be sarcastically lo
quacious, and as a result will find his
I ay envelope 110 shy at the end of the
month.
It is but fair to eay for Jeunness that
had the 6ame decisions been made by
O'Connell or McDonald they would
have been accepted without such vig
orous protests. There seemed to be a
disposition on both Eides to take ad
vantape of the newness of Jeunness
and of his uncertain tenure of office.
As for the game itself, it was main
ly a right for supremacy between Pitch
ers Newton and Schmidt, with both
men doing strike-out work. In the
third Newton fanned out the side.
The solitary run of the champions
â¢vvas made In the third on Spies' pass,
steal and "Wheeler's single and a wild
l>itch.
Oakland scored one in the first on
Ganiey's walk, double steal and New
ton's bad throw to first. In the sixth
Oanley singled, stole second and went
home when Kruger hit down to Flood.
There was another disturbance in
the eighth. Ganley and Kruger singled
and each advance on a steal. Spies
threw do'.vn to third to catch Ganley
napping, but the ball rolled away and
Wheeler held Gnnley, preventing him
from running. Jeunness permitted th^
runner to came home, and more talk
was indulged in. The decision was
clearly a just one. A double by Dev
ereaux brought in Kruger. The score:

STAXDIXO OF THE CLUES
The New York Telephone Company,
which is also accused of "aiding and
abetting" the services to poolrooms,
advised" Police Commissioner McAdoo
to-day that It would at once remove
the telephone wires from the East
Forty-second-street house, which was
raided yesterday. This is said to have
been the headquarters or "central" of
a chain of poolrooms. Further, the
company promised to see that both
wires and instruments are taken out
of the subsidiary places^ â poolrooms
which received accounts of the racing
from this "central."
The effect of this order Is far-reach
ing and will result in the discontinu
ance of what has been called the racing
department of the Western Union Com
pany. This department has collected
and distributed racing news from the
various tracks In the country to sub
scribers. Hereafter the company will
transmit only, such messages concern-
Ing races as are regularly filed with It
for transmission.
For the present Western Union of
fices, as has been the habit In the past,
will be maintained at race tracks for
the transmission of press dispatches
and private messages, but these offices
may be discontinued later.
The executive committee of the West
ern Union had a brief meeting to-day,
at which were present Chauncey M.
Depew, Morris K. Jessup, Russell Sage.
Samuel Sloan and Jacob H. Schlff.
President Clowry reported his action
and the executive committee approved
it. ,
"President and General Manager."
NEW YORK. May 18.â Following his
action In discontinuing to all sub
scribers in this city a report of the
racing at various tracks In this coun
try. Colonel Robert C. Clowry notified
the general superintendents of the com
pany at New York, Chicago, Atlanta
and San Francisco that to-day the col
lection and distribution by the Western
Union Telegraph Company of horse
race reports would be discontinued
forthwith. The text of the notice to
the superintendents reads aa follows:
"It has been decided to discontinue
forthwith the collection and distribu
tion by this company of horse-race re
ports. You will please act accordingly.

Rob Roy waa the first to win for
Knapp. Under Hildebrand's vigorous
riding this son of Sir Walter landed.
There were many spectators who
thought Carmack, who rode Marjo
ram, took things too easy and did not
realize he was losing until too late.
Thanks to George Odom's superior
strength over the average jockey,
Akela, his mount in the fourth event,
won that also for Knapp. The horse,
a poor beginner and slow to get his
enormous stride into full swing, left
the post last. He was compelled to
run around his field and then came on
down the incline in close pursuit of
the swerving Keynote, which, for a
wonder, had made the running. After
Akela came Fort Plain and Stonewall,
and these three made the hottest fin
ish of the day, Akela winning by a
small marffin.
In the last race Gold Dome exhibit
ed far more life than in his previous
effort and the rail birds were prepared
to see him run well. He was beaten
only by the Oneck stable's Phaon, a
strapping son of Fonso, upon wfhlch
Burns had the mount. Summary:

CHICAGO, May 18. â Despite a poor
card, a good sized crowd witnessed the
races at Worth track this afternoon.
Five of the races on the card were
selling affairs. Floral King, at even
money, was . made favorite in the
fourth race, the feature event of the
day, and barely got the verdict by a
nose from Big Ben, the 5 to 1 third
choice. It was a desperate finish and
Big Ben would have won in another
stride. Beau Ormonde, second choice
at 8 to 5, was third, five lengths back.

IX THE CHAMPION* STAKE
At a joint meeting of the tourna
ment committees of the California
and Golden Gate Tennis clubs held
last night at the former's clubrooms
arrangements were made for holding
the annual San Francisco champion
ship tournament. The most important
question to decide was as to whether
the champion should stand out and
meet the tournament winner 1 In the
challenge round or whether he should
piny through the tournament. The
former plan was adopted. Last year
the champion played through the
tourney, but at that time there was
no challenge cup. The winner of the
tournament will play Drummond Mac-
Gavin for the championship.
The entry list will close on the 2"tli
lnst. at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Al
ready thirty-three players have en
tered, but it is probable more than
twice that number will be in the com
petition. Three players have entered
from San Rafael, thirteen from the
Park and the remainder from the
California Club.
Tennis Tournament Plans.
The San Francisco Police Department
reports that it has no knov.iedge of the
crime confessed by Randolph Preston
in Seattle.
The eleventh annual celebration of
the Butchers' Board of Trade of San
Francisco and Alamcda counties was
held at Shell Mound Park and at the
Oakland racetrack yesterday. Fully
12,000 people joined in the festivities of
the day and the entertainment af
forded was of a high order. From the
lirr.e the first trains and street cars
commenced to bring picnickers to trie
. grounds jollity reigned, and the games
and races attracted much interest. The
horse racing v.as exciting; and devel
oped serious as well as comical phases.
A decision in cne of the events nearly
resulted in a riot on the part of a
v.rathy mob that assembled around
the stand of the judges.
The various committees who had the
â¢affair In charge provided every com
fort and pleasure for the visitors, and
even the smallest details were ar- ;
Â¦ranged to perfection. Cordial hos- ;
pitality and sociability prevailed ex
cept during the races. Dancing in the
pavilion was Indulged in by those who
cared for it, and the crowd ambled ,
from the park to the racetrack, visit
ing the attractions at each place.
There were twenty-two events held
:n Shell Mound Park, the winners of
'which received suitable prizes. These
events comprised running races for
men and women, races for boys and
girls, races for fat men. races for mem
bers, races for members' wives and
races for cash boys. Some contestants
Â«raHced the greased pole, caught greasy
jiigs and entered the races for bald
headed men. Others tried three-legged
races, egg and spoon races and strived
for honors in a Fack race. Amateurs
sang coon songs for prizes, danced the
buck-arid-wlr.g dance and vied for the
distinction of the best cakewalker.
MANY RACING EVENTS.
ThÂ«Â» programme cf races at the Oak
>nd racetrack was a lengthy one.
There bting entries in eighteen races.
Variety, however, dissipated any mo
notony which might come during the
srven hours the horses occupied atten
tion. There was an assortment of
â¢ vents that would put a county fair to
blnsh.
Mules of many descriptions, and
steers, were on the programme. Cart,
vaquero, running, trotting and pacing
races were decided by a committee of
judges consisting of J. W. Phillips,
James Hall, E. C. Rodolph. F. Reyn
olds and I. Selig. The bookmakers
v. ho went over to clean up a fortune
â¢.net with disappointment, though they
were careful with their money and
â¢ >dds. Tips seemed to be out on most
of the winners and no great surprises
were sprung.
At one stage of the game it appeared
as if the judges' stand would be taken
by storm, and excitement ran high. A
decision that brought dissatisfaction
caused all the patrolmen who were on
;he ground to assemble in a squad and
prepare to resist an attack on the
judges, tthieh seemed imminent. *
The race which caused the trouble
was the fifteenth. Six horses went to
the post. It was a five-eighths of a mile
'lazh. and when Starter W. Fieldwick
dropped the flag Gladys Belle led by
over thirty yards. On the home stretch
Efforts on the part of authorities to
determine the identity of the man And
the circumstances surrounding his
death have thus far proved futile.
The corpse was found in the "lead"
of the fish trap. It was nude, with the
exception of an undershirt. The fea
tures were unrecognizable. The skull
was crushed, as if with a heavy club or
stone, and the appearance of the throat
indicated that before tne skull had
been crushed the victim had been
strangled.
Mute evidence of the effort of the
murderer to hide his crime was fur
nished by a rope which had been tied
around the waist of the man and from
â¢which the weight had worked loose,
permitting the body to rise to the sur
face of the water. It is believed the
murdered man was a soldier from one
of the two nearby forts.
ASTORIA, Ore., May 18.â A murder
mystery which probably never will be
solved, came to light to-night at Chi
nook, Wash., a small town near this
city. B. Sutherland, owner of a fish
trap, discovered the body of a man in
his fishing gear and examination by
a justice's jury disclosed the fact that
a brutal murder had been committed,
the victim being weighted and thrown
into the river.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, May 18. â A young man
giving his name as Randolph Preston
and his home as San Francisco Tvas
picked up by the police thl3 morning.
At headquarters Preston broke down
completely and said that he had been
haunted for two weeks by the phan
tom of his crime. Then he told how
he had embezzled a considerable sum
of money. His explanation on the
point as to the person or persons from
which he took the money was not clear,
so the police have telegraphed to San
Francisco for further particulars.
Preston said that he had not eaten a
bit of food for a week and when taken
to a cell he fell into the sleep of ex
haustion. He looks worn out.

BERKELEY. May 18. â School Di
rector W. K. Weir suggested at the
meeting of the Board of Education
last night that a separate election for
school bonds to the amount of $125,
000 be held, instead of waiting for
bonds to be voted upon the same time
that the bonding proposition for
the whole city is submitted to a vote.
His ground for the suggestion is that
the School Board n conduct a much
cheaper election and quicker, too. The
board referred the suggestion to a
special committee that will report at
the next meeting.

/The first service Mr. Hume saw on
the firing line was in El Dorado County
shortly after he came to California.
The people of that county elected
"Jim" Hume Sheriff and in that ca
pacity it was his duty to convict or
dislodge all the criminals that infested
the wiles of that country in those
days. He made himself the terror of
the lawless element of El Dorado and
upon his record alone he was appointed
warden of Carson prison. This was
now 1870, twenty years after he had
become a Californian.
Mr. Hume's service as an officer be
gan with hi.s settling in California in
1850. His success as a hunter of law
breakers was established from the be
ginning. His knowledge of the prac
tices of criminals was wonderful, and
pvery jrreat crime in California came
under his observation as an officer of
tho law.
James Bunyan Hume, for many
years head of the detective bureau of
Wells, Fargo & Co. and the man
whose success in hunting down crim
inals made him famous, died at noon
yesterday at the home he had known
for many years at 3017 Wheeler street,
Berkeley. Mr. Hume had been failing
for a long time and his gradually weak
ened condition prevented his taking
an active part in the affairs of the con
cern for which he had devoted a large
part of his life. As a reward for his
faithfulness, however, he was retained
to the end in his position as chief of
Wells. Fargo's detective service.
Mr. Hume's most distinguished cap
ture was of the famous "Black Bart,"
the fellow who alone held up stage
after stage of Wells-Fargo throughout
the State. It was a long chase, but
"Black Bart" was finally run down
with the aid of a simple little laundry
mark. Such desperadoes as Sonntag
and Evans, .the Dalton brothers and
others have been successfully appre
hended through his advice and activity.
The last case of any consequence upon
which he worked was that of the ab
sconder Snook, who killed a detective
in Michigan last November. Snook is
now serving a sentence of fifteen years
in Michigan.
New York was the birthplace of Mr.
Hume and he was born there seventy
seven years ago. He leaves a wife,
Mrs. Lida AT. Hume, who lately re
signed the presidency of the Ebell Club
of#Oakland to wait upon her husband;
and a son, Samuel J. Hume, a student
at^the University of California. No ar
rangements have yet been made for
the funeral.
The hum-drum life at Carson was
too much for Hume, however, and at
the end of two years he accepted an
offer to enter the service of Wells,
Fargo* & Co. In twenty-two years he
has faced ' many hard problems and
solved most of them. His career was
one of adventures and triumphs. Some
of the most notorious criminals have
fallen into his traps. He dealt with all
sorts of desperate characters, but lived
through it all and died a peaceful
death.
BERKELEY, May 18. â The debat
ers of the Berkeley High School car
ried off the plum last night after a
discussion on the rostrum with the
debaters of the Oakland High School.
This is the first time in five years that
Berkeley has carried off victory and
there is much rejoicing. The question
under discussion was, "Resolved, that
the United States should abandon its
protective tariff policy." Oakland had
the affirmative, which was presented
by, Alson Kilgore, Miss Amelia Brazil
and Clifton Brooks. The negative was
defended by Francis White, Samuel
Batdorf and Arthur Bolton. There
was a large crowd to cheer the com
petitors and when Berkeley was an
nounced the winner a great roar went
up. Â¦ Samuel Batdorf carried off the
individual honors for the night. The
judges were R. H. Chamberlain, H. A.
Overstreet and M. C. Flaherty.

OAKLAND. May 18. â The Mer

to the board of directors last night:
To the Merchants' Kxchange of Oakland :
| Your cotr.mittee appointed to investigate the
appeal of Mind men and women to the public
against boycott report as follows:
We conferred with the executive committee
and ether members of the Central I^abor Coun
} ill with regard to the matter. Tho members
I of the Labor Council present emphatically de
nied that any boycott, direct or Indirect, ex
istrd. and stated that union labor In Alameda
County was thoroughly In sympathy with the
Adult Blind Home of Alameda County. They
a!s<> stated that any merchant who refuses to
buy the blind men's brooms on the ground
that they were boycotted by union labor was
stating that which was untrue, as no such
action had ever been taken by any labor union.
The Ontra! Labor Council suggested that
like committees from the Labor Council, the
Broommakers' Union and the Merchants' Ex
change be appointed to solve the problem of
the blind men's home.
Your committee therefore ask for further
time, as we believe this misunderstanding can
be cleared up in the near future by mutual
consultation and mutual consideration.

This world Into which you are entering
MÂ«mt at first glance to tolerate a good deal
o' fake and tinsel, but it is a wise old torld
after all. and its deep foundations are laws
just. Irrefrarable and eternal. ThÂ« men and
women It wants for Its service and the on?9
it will crown with Its awards are trtoaÂ» who
work patiently with head and hand, who know
duty, who love the truth, who keep contracts
and who stay put.
And now the common mother of you nil
stands ready to give you her blessing and
bid you farewell. Your work calls and It I*
time you were off. Go then, and know as you
-o that whatever befalls you of good or ill.
befalls the home that nurtured you and stir*
a heart that loves you. Go. having with you
each that one life: go, and sell it dear.
This world of human lives Into which you
enter may seem to be a fixed and definite
thing determined from outside yourself, but
that is not so. It is wh3t you make Ir.
The life of will is a life of work. Effective
living comes of doing, of shaping, of creating,
of building. T-et us get to our work. Th^re
Is no use waiting for big things to do. We
do not even know for sure what the big things
are. The widow who brought her two mltiÂ»H
to the treasury gave more than them all. If
there are any "big" things they aro probably
tl:ose that lie next our door, namely, OUR
DUTY.
Effective living is largely a matter of will.
Seme of you are qulcker-witted than others:
some are blessed with a superior memory;
Â»<>mp excel in gifts of reasoning â power to
hold the line of continuous thought: somÂ» are
better looking than others; your monthly al
lowances from home are not all the game.
According to many considerations such as these
you have seemed during your college days to
differ from each other, and according to them
you have been In the habit more or less con
sciously of classifying yourselves Into grades.
Ten years from now you win be thoroughly
rttlassified. Twenty-five years hence that
classification will have crystallzed into perma
nent form and be practically unalterable. And
many who are first shall be last. In this new
grading which life will give the 'determining
element will be personal strength of will.
What each one of you is to be in life will
depend chiefly on what you will to be.
It is no evidence of strength of character
to be in general against things. On the con
trary, it usually indicates a lack of creative
energy coupled with envy toward those who do
possess it. The best way to oppose a bad
thing is to nominate a good thing for its place.
Negation is poor business at the best, but
pre-eminently for human beings trained as you
have been, to lead, to enlighten, to upbuild.
My advice to you Is: Get into the world's
work with good cheer and tug and pull and
help. Keep the traces taut and save the
breeching for emergencies.
If you cannot say anything good of a fel
low-man In general keep silent. People arÂ«;
mostly good, especially if you treat them as
such. Every human being as a composite,
sometimes a crude conglomerate, of all kinds
of goodnesses and badnesses. It will make life
Infinitely mere sunny for you and more useful
If you address yourself to the goodnesse3 rather
than to the badnesses.
You have one life to use; how can you make
it count for the most and best? That is the
question which must be with you to-day; and
if it is not. It is time it "were. 1 cannot
provide an answer in the form of a standard
recipe. If 1 could it would be of no use.
Every man must make his own and every man
must find within himself the will to apply it.
But I think I know some of the Ingredients
of th* recipe, and these I will not withhold
from you. They are mostly simple, every-day.
household materials, common as water and
salt, and the tale of them must be plain and
unembellished.
LJFE PROBLE.MS.
As my time Is brief, and especially as this
common factor counts for Infinitely more than
all the factors of differentiation put together.
I shall use this supreme moment to ppeali of
nothing but the common tactor: One life
apiece.
the colleges of the University of California:
You have come to this day by many paths.
Hundreds of different teachers have taught
you. You have followed various courses of
study, variously framed out of the most vari
ous subjects of human querying and research.
The educational theories according to which,
these different courses are guaranteed to dif

BERKELEY'S COMMENCEMENT.
Dr. Whitfield was an English physi
cian who had traveled extensively, and
it was while visiting Monrovia in
Southern California that he met, wooed
and won Miss Atwood. Hla family re
sides in England and was looking for
ward with pleasure to the arrival home
of the son and his American wife.
Miss Atwood attended the funeral of
her betrothed at Los Angeles, and Is
still stopping: in the southern metro
polis.
All preparations had been made for
the marriage, which was to have been
celebrated at the home of the bride.
The wedding guests had been bidden,
but the Grim Reaper claimed the
groom, and iiow, she who was to be
come a wife, is disconsolate. The fam
ily of Miss Atwood will take the be
reaved girl East, trusting that the
change of scene and travel will cause
her to brood less over the sorrow that
has befallen her.
Death has culminated a romantic en
gagement and prevented the wedding of
Miss Alice Atwood of 587 Merrimao
street, this city, and Dr. Whltfleld, the
groom prospective, who passed away a
few days ago in Los Angeles after a
brief illness. Â¦

STOCKTON, May 18.â The long
shoremen did not report for work this
morning and consequently the lockout
ordered by the employers is effective.
The union to-day sent a communica
tion to the Millers' and Warehouse
men's Association stating that the
longshoremen would not recede from
their stand against handling any mate
rial hauled by the Stockton Transfer
Company. The flour packers in the lo
cal mills struck this morning because
the longshoremen had been locked out.
The Millers' and Warehousemen's As
sociation has now declared for the open
shop and to-morrow morning non
union help will be put in the places of
the longshoremen.
It is reported to-night that the team
sters and several of the water front
unions held a meeting Tuesday night
and decided to go on strike Thursday
morning.
Epeclal Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
1118 Broadway. May 18-
Letters written in confidence to a
woman friend were resurrected to-day
In the hearing of the Rieiiarda divorce
case and their contents tended to ke^p
Mrs. Florence Richard, the plaintiff in
the case, expiainins and sidestepping, j
They were letters written by her to |
â¢ Miss Arrie Fennins of 227 Sanchez j
street, Fan Francisco, and attorneys j
for the husband are makins the most
Ot them.
Th- first one of these letters refers to
a. Mr. Cotton, yardmastcr in the em
ploy of the Southern Pa<.iflc Company, j
who lived at the same boarding-house |
with the plaiEtil and whom Richards â¢
believes supplanted him in his wife's i
affections. An extract read as follows: .
"Now, about the boys in the house.
A Mr. Cotton; he's a peach; eyes like !
Harry's, rosy cheeks, is yardniasier; j
but, oh, so devoted to his mother I j
can't catch him or make an impression j
on him, though I rather fancy him. j
Thf-n Mr. O'Neil; he's easy. Mr. Dias !
is a confirmed bachelor; he's mine. I j
pep he fancies me. 1 am like his sister, |
you know, and we are all to go to the j
theater some night. Then there is \
young Mr. Aldrich, but he's too good j
and simple, and Mr. McBride, only 21,
and Mr. De Witt, only 21."
In the next letter matters had pro
gressed somewhat and Cotton had j
found time to share a little of the at
lontion devoted to his mother with the :
writer, and she says:
"Now, when you come over don't say {
a word about my going with Mr. Cot
ton â he was going to a meeting or
MDmething and was to call after me to
escort me home, but no one knew here,
j?o mum is the word. 1 have good news j
from hubby, who is in New York now."
The intimacy had ripened somewhat
In the next and on April 18, 1901, she
wrote her friend as follows:
"1 am so anxious to see you, and as I I
hat* to go alone, will ca.ll on you with
a friend Friday evening of this week.
1 forgot to say Mr. Cotton will accom- j
IÂ»any me over â am afraid to be out
after dark, you know. Lovingly,
"FLORENCE." '
Judge Ogden took a hand in the
cross-examination at this point and
wanted to know where she had accom
panied Cotton other than to her
friend's home. She said possibly to a
meeting, but sho maintained the flirta
tion was a harmless one and her writ
ing very thoughtless.
The witness was on the stand when
court adjourned and the examination
v.ill be continued in the morning.
A baby left on a doorstep six years
ago Is the subject of a legal tangle of
much concern to Its foster parents.
The child has learned to look upon
David and Lillie Hyman as its parents
and they supposed they had adopted
the infant until a claim was made re
cently by a woman who alleges she
is the child's mother. Of this fact
there is no proof at hand, but her ap
pearance caused the Hymans to look
up the court records, and it was dis
covered that the final court order had
not been filed and there was nothing
to show the child was tneirs, but proof
of the child's parentage will be a diffi
cult problem, as it has grown and
changed since it was found on the
doorstep.
Hyman says the order of adoption
was signed by Judge Ogden, but there
is no record, and the adoption proceed
ings are incomplete. The little girl
was left on the steps of the Hyman
home one night in March, 1897. After
caring for the infant for some time
the couple began legal proceedings
looking to its adoption. According to
their statement the question was prop
erly settled. Within the last few
weeks, however, two letters have been
received, signed by a woman who says
she is the mother of the child and that
she wants it. Hyman has employed
Attorney Tom Bradley to try to
straighten out the court record and
confirm his claim.

REDDIXG. May IS. â Through an
understanding of. the Assessors of
Northern California and the State
Board of Equalization there la to be a
uniform increase in valuations placed
on timber lands In Northern California
counties. There will also be a larj?e
increase in the acreage taxed. The
two combined will make a material in
crease in the tax rolls of the counties
affected. In Sh^asta County Assessor
Collins will assess some timber land
at $8 50, and none will be assessed at
less than $5 an acre. The rate will
be based on the remoteness of the land
from the railroad. Last year timber
land in Shasta County was assessed at
$3 20 an acre.

LOS ANGELES, May 18. â The con
vention of the Brotherhood of Loco
motive Engineers continued in execu
tive session to-day and adjourned
without having made public any of
the proceedings of the day. It Is un
derstood that the attention of the dele
gates is still occupied in the receiving
of resolutions from the various divi
sions and in referring them to the
proper committees. The number of
these memorials is greatly In excess of
those received at previous conventions
of the brotherhood and is requiring a
great deal of time in their considera
tion.
Although several days will elapse
before the convention will reach the
work of electing grand officers, there
is much talk of the probable candi
dates. The present grand chief engi
neer, W. S. Stone, is a candidate for
re-election. Other candidates for the
position will be J. F. Wills of Pitts
burg and M. H. Shay of Youngstown,
Ohio. It is denied that J. C. Currie,
present grand assistant engineer, will
be a candidate for the office of grand
chief, notwithstanding that he has
been frequently mentioned for the of
fice.
When the elections shall have been
disposed of the various committees will
report upon the great mass of business
assigned to them. One of the im
portant reports will bear upon the mat
ter of disbursements of funds of the
order for aid, charity and pensions.
It Is estimated that as much as $40,000
will be appropriated by the present
convention for these objects.
"The area which can be irrigated by
the proposed Government works is
estimated at about 2,000,000 acres.
These lands are not only unusually
fertile, but on account of the climate
will produce crops during practically
the entire year. The climate and
physical characteristics of the river
and the features upon which Irriga
tion will depend partake largely of
the nature of the Nile in Egypt, in
volving much the same problems and
returning much the same products."
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, May 18. â The Secre
tary of the Interior to-day announced
the withdrawal of a large body of land
in Colorado for the purpose of build
ing a ereat national reservoir at what
is known as the Kremmling' site in
the canyon of the Grand River, the
largest tributary of the Colorado.
Government engineers finding it im
possible to provide storage in the
lower reaches of the Colorado for ex
tensive systems of irrigation. It was
planned to have investigated the val
leys of the principal tributaries and
they } decided upon Kremmling as the
most valuable site available. An of
llcial of the Geological Survey, speak
ing of the effect of the action of Sec
retary Hitchcock, said:
"The knowledge that a vast stor
age reservoir is to be constructed at
the headwaters of the Colorado should
relieve much of the apprehension that
now exists in the lower valley regard
ing the proposed diversion of this
stream upon the lands above Yunxa.
It also will simplify In a large meas
ure many vexing questions which
might arise between Mexico and this
country over a division of the water.
The California Development Company
has undertaken works below Yuma
that ultimately might employ about
all the normal flow of the stream.
During the spring the flow of the river
is more than double all ita require
ments and probably equal to the de
mands of the irrigation plans of the
Government and the private enter
prises besides. If abundance can be
stored this spring to be used in time
fit need much of the difficulty can be
overcome.

COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL
CHICAGO. May 18. â The famished condition
of elevator bins caused an advance of > ( c In
May wheat. While the gain was regarded as
significant, trading in the May delivery was
extremely small. The July option closed about
where It did the day before. Corn Is up %c;
oats acd provision* show little change.
Early Influences In the wheat situation wore
conflicting and the popular belief was that saiee
would weaken after two days of pronounced
strength by a failure of Liverpool cables to
show a rejection of yesterday's advance. The
opening bids, nevertheless, showed an unex
pected demand from the milling centers as
well as a renewed buytng tendency by foreigm
interests and initial stiles of July were at
SÂ»%Â©ST%c %e lower to %c higher. Small
contract stocks appeared to be kept wen- ia
mind by speculators, and the demand from
the Northwest was taken to indicate an
awakening to the heavy Inroads upon the
milling supplies. A report soon denied that
i the . acreage of spring wheat was small by

Justice of the Peace Lawson gave
judgment yesterday in favor of. Frank
Mello, a lodging-house keeper, who
sued Hildebrandt. Posner & Co. for
$192. The testimony showed that ever
since 1S95 Mello has been paying the
water bills of the four tenants of the
defendant firm, including his own. It
appears that all the service pipes led
into Mello's meter and he was thu3
mulcted out of much coin. | Lawson
decided that the allegations of fraud
were not sustained and the condition
was the result of the mutual mistake
of the litigants. He found that ihÂ«Â«
amount involved, which had been .paid'
by Mello, was $1 89 for ninety months,
or $170 10. He therefore divided the
amount and directed the defendant to
pay Mello $85 05.

their share of next year's budget. The
amount that will be asked is $828,920,

BRINGS SUIT FOR DA3IAGES
Files Complaint That S. P. Neilson
Threw Him Downstairs and In

Suit was filed yesterday in the Jus
tices' Court by Samuel Valenzuela, a
minor, by his guardian, Loui3a Mo
rano, against Soren P. Neilson for
$299 damage*. Valenzula is 18 years
of age and was employed as a process
server by various attorneys.
Valenzuela alleges in Tiis complaint
that on April 4 last Neilson "Willfully,
wrongfully, maliciously and without
just cause or provocation and without
consent of plaintiff so to do and with
great force and violence grasped,
struck, choked, beat, kicked and
bruised plaintiff and hurled, pushed
and threw plaintiff down a flight of
stairs, whereby plaintiff was greatly
and grievously injured, bruised and
maimed and made sick, sore and
lame." Valenzuela claims that he was
damaged in the sum of $1000, but re
mits all but $299.
Valenzuela made an affidavit that
he is a pauper, so Judge Van Nostrand
remitted the preliminary fees in the
suit.

The first banquet of the advertising

purpose of the banquet was to form a
permanent organization. A commit
tee of seven was selected to prepare the
by-laws and constitution and forrrt an
outline of procedure for the succeeding
banquets.
The following were present at the
banuet: E. 11. Swasey, G. C. Barnhart,
J. Eppinger, A. G. Carter and O. R.
Tyson of Barnhart & Swasey, adver
tising agents; F. J. Cooper of the Coop

cific Coast representative of the Re
view of Reviews; W. Ray of Whitaker
& Ray, publishers; R. P. Jennings and
Hamilton Wright of the California
Promotion Committee; Z., E. Sexton,
manager of the Sunset Advertising
Agency.
R. C. Ayres was chosen toastmaster
and handled the situation creditably,
introducing the speakers of the evening
tactfully and entertaingly.
A GKJSAT SUBJECT.
After coffee and cigars the toast
master said: "Gentlemen, we are here
to-night in the interests of a great sub
jectâa subject involving yearly in the
United States the vast expenditure of
J650,000,000. Few people realize that
advertising has grown so great. The
annual wheat crop in the United States
is but $320,000,000, the cotton crop $483,
000,000, the gold production $210,000,000,
the lumber production $567,000,000. Ad
.vertising involves more money than
any of these great industries.
"Advertising is woven in one way or
another into every business under tho
sun. Its dynamic force can hardly be
measured. It builds business, develops
commerce and makes nations. It is
the greatest subject of the day in the
commercial world."
The first toast was responded to by
C. H. House of the Call, on the sub
ject, "The Benefits to Be Derived From
Organization."
S. M. Barrus was the next speaker.
His subject was "Club Organization."
Having been an active member of a
similar organization in Denver he made
many valuable suggestions.
J. D. Barnhill responded to the toast,
"What the East Expects From Califor
nia." Coming recently from New York
and being closely in touch with the
ideas of Eastern publishers, his re
marks were listened to with intense
interest.
Replying to the toast of Mr. Barn
hill, E. M. Swasey told "What Califor
nia Can Give the East." His speech
was the feature of the evening. His
familiarity with the State's condition
and products enabled him to ably and
exhaustively treat his subject.
NEED OF ADVEHTISING.
He said in part
"California to-day is one of the
world's attractions. No other State
has been spoken of in such glowing
words, yet there remains more ad
vertising to be done than has ever
been done, for with our millions of
acres yet untenanted we can easily
take care of a population of millions,
whereas we now have only thousands.
"Jingles, doggerels ,-wid cartoons
would not be required to bolster up
the merit of California canned goods.
Plain statements, tersely told and
placed in the right media would start
the sale of these goods and their own
merit would keep it up. Yet who is
advertising California canned goods
in the East?
P. J. Cooper gave a technical talk on
"Agency Work in ; Developing Adver
tising."
"You can find the popular adver
tised brands of beer In every cafe,
bar and grill in America. But tell
me one brand of California wine that
is sold in 10 per cent of the places in
which it should be the leader through
out the United States. There is no
question about the quality of good
California wines, but our wine in
dustry needs a campaign of advertis
ing.
"The same may be said of our
splendid olive oil, our excellent rai
sins and our delicious prunes. The
first big advertising oC a California
product must be done properly. Let
us have one big success and we will
have no difficulty in securing many
others."
R. P. Jennings told the assemblage
of the work being done by the Cali
fornia Promotion Committee. He
stated that his committee would
readily give all possible assistance to
the advertising mens' 'organization in
promoting the publicity of California.
Tb.Â» Supervisors* Street Committee
held a special meeting yesterday to
consider the application of the Pre
sidio and Ferries Railway Company for
a new franchise from the ferries along
Union street to tbe Presidio Reserva
tion.
George W. Newhall, president of the
company, stated that the application
already filed called for an electric road,
but that subsequent developments had
caused the suggestion of a modification
In the petition. NtwhaJl said:
The petition is now In t!ie hands of the
City Eortoeer. but j. repurt tlierecn ha* been
4e:*yed. When we fii<?d the i>etKion wÂ« in
vtcata to build an electric road, on the ar
tnirw&co oi cur that tuch motive
power could b* u*cd on the steep lulls c.uns
tbÂ« route outlined.
We loivre tact bt-en informed that tn!s jj.an
may Jiot be feasible and it would be more
advisable to build a first-class modi m cable
road at a lets cost for construction and opera
tion WÂ« therefore defire to file a supple
mentary petition to that effect, l-'hould we
Aeclfie to build an electric cystc-m Â»e should
V.k* to hav* the privilege of I'lacins po.es
Crom Pierce ttreet westerly at least.
The committee expressed itself as
against allowing poles to be erected.
but agreed to consider the proposition
of a cable line with the tentative un
derstanding that grooved rails should
be used In its construction and that
sa all-night service be provided.
It was also agreed to incorporate in
the franchise, if granted to the com
pany as the highest bidder, that the
city have the privilege of taking over
lhÂ« road after a period of years, after
paying the actual cost of construction
together with the value of the fran
chise and interest thereon.
The Board of Public Works decided
yesterday that when the time comes
for the awarding of a franchise for
the Geary street road it will rec
ommend to the Board of Supervisors
that the terminus of the road be on
the westerly side of Kearny street and
that It be nof. permitted to cross Kear
ny street to its present terminus at
the turn-table. The board agreed that
it would not consent to the franchise
unless the condition described was in
corporated therein. â¢
The board took the ground that, ow
ing to the congested traffic at the point
named, the lives of pedestrians are se
riously menaced by the cars crossing
Keainy street and that the danger can
be averted by making the cars stop on
the west side of the street.
The board also agreed to recommend
that a fine convenience station be built
under the spate now occupied by the
turn-table and will at once prepare
plans for the same.
STREET CLEANING BIDS.
The board opened bids for sweeping
and sprinkling the public streets. For
district No. 1 there were two bids, one
from J. G. Harney at 90 cents per
1000 square yards for sweeping and
19K cents per 1000 lineal feet for sprink
ling. The City Street Improvement
Company bid 92 cents and 17 cents for
the same.
In district No. 2 the bids for clean
ing were from Alva B. Clute', 26?; cents
per 1000 square yards: J. G. Harney,
2S*i cents; Joseph F. Lahaney, 29%
cents, and the City Street Improvement
Company the same.
The same firms bid vesterday 24^
cents, 2:S'i cents, 24 cents and 21%
cents and Frank Sheerin bid 23% cents
and Felix McHugh 24 cents for clean
ing district No. 3. For district No. 4
J. G." Hearney bid 37i,i cents; Frank
Sheerin 36% cents, and the City Street
Improvement Company 36 cents. The
contracts will be awarded next
Wednesday.
XEW CITY ENGINEER.
The board by resolution formally ap
pointed Commissioner Thomas P.
Woodward to be City Engineer, the ap
pointment taking effect to-morrow.
Woodward refused to vote and was
elected by the votes of Commissioners
Schmitz and Casey. Woodward's suc
cessor as Commissioner has not as yet
been chosen by Mayor Schmitz.
The board approved the map of the
Reis Tract showing land deeded by F.
Rels for Bessie Avenue.
Property owners petitioned that a
nine-foot cement sidewalk be laid on
Point Lobos avenue between William
son and Wood streets.
Superintendent J. C. Wilder of the
Southern Pacific Company notified the
board that trains would in future not
blockade the crossing at Sixth and
Townsend streets.
Deputy Donovan reported that there
was no reason to grant the request of
the Health Board that the sewer on
Sixteenth. Texas and Carolina streets
be opened to repair a break as no break
existed.
Deputy Donovan reported that the
cost of inspection for nine months end
ing April 1, 1904, of street opening and
restoration by corporations laying
mains, was $2250. Of this amount
$1113.00 is due from the San Francisco
Gas Company, $9Q1.k?> from Spring Val
ley Water Works, $139.45 from Inde
pendent Gas Company, and $66.88 from
Pacific Gas Company.
WOULD WIDEN' AVENUE
The Spring Valley Water Company
petitioned the board to postpone action
on the bids for improving Nineteenth
avenue frcm Trocadcro culvert to Ocean
avenue. The company is preparing
a proposition to be made to the city,
which by somewhat changing the route
of the proposed Nineteenth avenue ex
tension will result in its widening from
70 to 100 feet and largely improve the
connection of the future sewer system
of the Lakeview and Ingleside districts
with the Pacific Ocean.
City Architect Shoa reported that the
steam plants in the City Hall and Hall
of Justice can be converted into oil
burning plants at a cost of $1600 and
$850 respectively.
Tho Bureau of Engineering filed sur
veys showing obstructions on Beacon,
Wayland and University streets and
denning tho westerly boundary line of
the city's property on Sixteenth street
between Harrison and Folsom.
REPORTS OX PROTEST.
The Bureau of Engineering filed a
report on the protest of the Sutro
estate against granting permission to
the United Railroads to electrize the
California-street stea/n road on the
ground that it passes through property
belonging to the estate, and it Is in
tended to construct a single track road
instead of a double track as provided
in an agreement. The report states
that under the franchise the portions
of the road crossing private property
are to cross with the consent of the
owners, and it is optional with the
owners whether a single or double
track shall be built, as any such agree
ment has not been incorporated in the
franchise
Protests were filed by Abner Doble
Company. M: Meyerfeld Jr. and Mrs.
F. F. Schloss against putting a sewer
In Seventh street between Hubbell and
South.
The cost of paving: Broadway be
tween Front and Davis was reported
