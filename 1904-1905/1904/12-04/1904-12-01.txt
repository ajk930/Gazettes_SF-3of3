NEW YORK. Nov. 30.â There ap- j
pears ;o be little doubt to-ni?nt that
Mrs. Leroy S. Chadwick has arranged
to settle the claim of Herbert B. New
ton of Brookline, Mass., and that the
entire affair will be hushed up by the
rich and powerful personages inter-
Final details of the arrangement for
a settlement were agreed upon at a
conlerence held this afternoon between
Mrs. Chadwick, Edmund W. Powers,
one of hÂ»-r attorneys, and George E.
Ryall, rr-presercting Newton. . It is ex-
I>ected that by to-morrow, or Friday at
least, substantial paymt-nt will have
been mad* to Newton large enouyh to
dispose of the action h-? has brought. â¢"
At the game time Mrs. Chadwick will
make a statement in which phe will
answer in detail the questions -which
have been recently raised regardiug
hrrselt, so her attorneys Fay, and will
thfn return to Cleveland to give her
attention to straightening out her diffi
culties there. <â -.-;
As an evidence of the extent of Mrs.
Oiadwick's resources, it was learned
to-night that she has engaged a private
car in which she will make the trip to
Cleveland and. later, to the South. A
physician has been engaged to accom
pany her.
CARNEGIE AGAIN DENIES.
Both her own attorney and the New
Tork representative of Newton said to
day that there was no doubt that she
would be able to meet all of her obliga
tions, thoushno information was given
as to the nature of her resources.
Regarding this phase of the case,
Mrs. Chadwick denied that Andrew
Carnegie has had any connection with
her affairs and requested Philip Car
penter, one of her attorneys, to say for
her that there was no truth in the
statement that Carnegie had given her
a note for $300,000.
"Mrs. Chad wick says Carnegie never
has had any connection with her af
fairs," eald Carpenter.
Carnegie added to his statement of
Tuesday that if his name was found
signed to any note for $300,000 the sig
cature was not genuine.
This use of Carnegie's name in con
nection with Mrs. Chadwick's affair is
only one of the many mysterious cir
cumstances in the strange case. The
statement regarding the $500,000 note to
which the name of Andrew Carnegie
was signed was first given publicity
by George E. Ryall, one of Newton's at
torneys, who said that his client had
told him that he had seen such a
paper. RyaJl said that It was his un
derstanding that the note in question '
â¢was in the possession of the Oberlln
Bank, which was forced to close its
doors because of having made loans to
Mrs. Chadwick amounting to $240,000.

attorneys declined' to make any state

to-day. "This sum .includes the claim â¢
for a large amount that Mrs. Chadwick
says is illegal and is in the. line of
blackmail. In several Interviews she

AMOUNT OF THE CLAIMS.
Edward W. - Powers of counsel for,
Mrs. Chadwick said to : day that.inany
of the claims against Mrs.' Chadwick
would never be recognized in court.
"Just how many -claims there are, I
do not know," said Pow.ers. ' â¢
"Will the claims aggregate $1,000,
000?" was asked.
Powers paus.ed for a considerable
time before replying, and then said:
"Well, approximately, you can put-
It at that sum. For all I know there
may be claims for 52,000.000 against her,
but all legal claims will be met, as she'
Is an honest woman."
"Has she enough money to meet the'
claims of $1,000,000?"
"Yes. more than enough," was the
reply.
"How about the intimation â¢ that
some persons are trying to blackmail
Mrs. Chadwick?" was asked.
"As far as I know there is nothing in
the blackmailing line, but there are
some persons who are presenting
claims against Mrs. Chadwick who
have no legal right to do. so."
Powers eald he was not ready to
rive <jut a list of the creditors or to
reveal their names. He. said "that he
was not in a position to state, whether
my one had indorsed notes for Mrs.
Chadwick. t^M â¢ â 
"It was the, greatest kind of an out

CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30.â All of the se
crets of the Mormon endowment-house
ceremony are to be revealed when the
hearing in the case of Senator Reed
Smoot is resumed by the Senate Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections a
week from next Monday. The opposi
tion to Senator. Smoot will attempt to
show in these revelations that the Mor
mon people in , this : ceremony l renounce
allegiance to the United States. In ad
dition the robes of the ceremony will' be
exhibited to the committee, and as far
as possible there will be a reproduction
of the scenes in the endowment-house.
One form of oath taken is said to be
this: : Â£Y ; v
"I ,will avenge the blood- of prophets
who "are killed, in the nation and will
teach this to the remotest generation."
During the Drevious hearings all of
the Mormon witnesses, including the
apostles, refused to reveal the endow
ment-house secrets, insisting that they
were bound by a secret oath. They were
not pressed further, but were simply
requested to state whether or not there
had been any change in the oath and
ceremony since the foundation of the
churchl- They said there 'ha'd not.
Now the opposition will produce wit-'
nesses -who have been Mormons, but
who. .have renounced the church. Three
of these witnesses have been found who
have been through' the endowment,
"one as late as. 1898, and they will reveal
all of the. secrets. Special stress will be
laid at- the coming hearing's on the po
litical power .of the church, and Sen

line! ;;' â  ' '
"The. result of the recent national

CHICAGO, Nov: 30.â Many .railroads
are: planning .to 'use 'electric instead of
pteam power -for. their light suburban
trains, but the Great Northern' and the
Northern Pacific want to substitute,
electric motors' for their heaviest
freight engines.
An expert from one of the largest
electric manufacturing concerns has
spent several weeks Invest! sating: the
question of electric traction on the
Northern Pacific and Great Northern
roads in the. Rocky Mountains. He re
ports that the water-power In the Cas
cades is sufficient to supply electricity
for motors to take the place of steam
engines on the mountain divisions and
that the cost of electric power will be
much less than the cost of the coal
used in the locomotives.
The coal consumption of both roads
through the mountains Is very heavy.
The Northern Pacific is fortunate in
having its own coal fields on both sides
of the Cascade range. Its coal costs
the." company |1 36 a ton. .The North
ern Pacific has shipped a great deal of
its- coal to San Francisco for the
Southern Pacific, but this market has
been curtailed by the introduction of
oijrburning engines on the Southern
Pacific.
The Great Northern is not so fortu
nate in its coaJ supply in the moun
tains. It buys a great deal of coal
from the Northern Pacific and uses
about 250.000 tons of coal from the Illi
nois mines annually. This coal costs
considerably more than that brought
through the lakes,- but it suppplies
northbound tonnage for the Burlington.
Lvast year .the Northern Pacific and
Great Northern roads used more than
3,000,000 tons of coal, and the average
cost' was- in excess of $2 a ton. This
expense would be greatly reduced if
the trains could be moved by electric
ity, produced by mountain waterfalls.

..ale of This Government
WASHINGTON." Nov. .JO. â Russia Is
unwilling to join the powers In a sec
ond peace conference at The Hague
until her war with! Japan is ended.
The Russian- reply to Secretary - Hay's
circular note to the powers of Oc
tober 23 last, inviting: them in the
name of the President to reassemble
in conference at The Hague "to com
plete the postponed work of the first
conference," was delivered verbally
to Secretary Hay to-day by Coant
Cassini, the Russian Embassador.
The Embassador was requested by
his Government to say that Russia
heartily accepted in principle" the in
vitation to a second conference at
The Hague and readily associated
herself with the American Govern
ment to complete the mission of the
first assembly convened under the
leadership of the . Russian Emperor.
The Embassador was further request
ed to say that, while the Russian
Government very sincerely cherished
these views, it did not consider the
moment opportune for the convening:
of such a conference, and it there
fore must withhold its formal ac
ceptance of the Vvitation until the
â¢war in the Far East was at an end.
Although different in form, the
Russian reply does not differ in effect
from those- of Groat Britain. France
and the other ' European powers.
While Russia is the first power speci
fically to suggest a postponement un
til the close of the war, all the pow
ers, in expressing their approval of the
proposition, .reserved for further
pour, parlours the time when the
conference should be' held.
It can be stated that this Govern
ment is well pleased with the recep
tion the note received. In his note
Secretary Hay purposely omitted sug
gesting a date for the assembling of
the conference, realizing that certain
powers might hesitate to take up for
final definition such complicated
questions as the rights of neutrals at
a time when a great war* was. in
progress. For the present it is prob
able the American Government will'
rest on its oars.

Will Represent America on the Xorth
Sea Commission.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30.â Rear Ad
miral Charles H. Davis has been of
fered and has accepted the appointment
on the Dogger bank court of inquiry.
Count Cassini of the Russian embassy
and Sir Mortimer Durand, the British
Embassador, who were at the State De

selection.
Rear Admiral Davis was promoted to
the grade of rear admiral on August

was engaged in blockading duty off the
coast of Cuba. For a number of years
he was superintendent of the naval ob
servatory at Washington.
Admiral Davis speaks French fluent
ly, and this, with his knowledge' of in
ternational 'and maritime law, com
mended him" to Secretary Morton, on
whose â  recommendation the. selection
was made. He is- a brother-in-law of

CALL BUREAU. WORLD'S FAIR
GROUNDS, ST. LOUIS, -Nov. -\ 30.â
When the Louisiana Purchase Exposi-
tion, the greatest 'of all world's fairs,
closes at midnight to-morrow, ' i8,750,
000 persons will have passed through
the turnstiles in the seven months it
has been opened to the public, more
than $50,000,000 will have been expended
in the construction and maintenance
of the great show and about the same
amount will have been spent by the
.public within the exposition grounds.
Of the total admissions, about five
millions have been free, leaving four
tern millions paid admissions, from
which the exposition derived about
$6,000,000. According to the best In
formation obtainable the receipts from
the concessions have just about â¢equaled
the receipts from admissions. This
would give the exposition a total rev
enue of $12,000,000, to which may be
added $1,000,000 more for receipts from
all other sources. This gives the ex
position a grand total of $13,000,000 in
receipts.
During the period before the opening,
the world's fair company received $5,
000,000 from the Government, $5,000,000
from the city and $5,000,000 from in
dividual stockholders. ,In addition the
exposition obtained .a loan of $4,600,000
from the Government, which was re
paid out of the receipts after the fair
openpd. The receipts from all sources
up to the day of the opening amounted
to about $20,000,000. This sum, which
was all expended, added to the cost of
maintenance' during the exposition
period and to the total sums expended
by tfte States and foreign governments
and the United States Government,
bring the total cost of the exposition,
exclusive of , the cost to exhibitors of
preparing, transporting and maintain
ing 'their exhibits, up to about $50,
000,000.
Having repaid the Government loan
and settled all outstanding bills pay
able, it Is believed there should be,
after salvage, a balance of at least $1,
000,000 to be divided among the stock
holders. â¢ '

ADMITS SHIRE
IN THE FRAUD
Former Deputy County Clerk
Gives Damaging Testimony
in Oregon Land Cases
PORTLAND, -Or., Nov. ' 30.â That-
George A. Howe is a myth manipulated I
by the alleged conspirator, Horace G.|
McKinley, to bring about the \dlsp6si- |
| tibn of the" seven quarter-sections in j
j township 11 south, range 7 east, by ap- J
i plication for the right of lieu selec-
Ltlon. thus placing them in the hands
of alleged conspirators, and that j
Horace G. McKinley made the request i
for an abstract of title to the qeorge j
Howe lands and that George Howe was 1
unknown and did not request it, was |
the trend of the evidence on the part |
of the Government during the fraud j
tijial to-day.
Early in the session the prosecu
tion's continued efforts to show by the |
testimony of the Government officials ;
that George A. Howe does not represent j
j a corporal reality precipitated a legal j
battle. The defense assumed the posi
tion that the evidence offered by the
Government to prove the non-exist
ence of Howe is not competent and that j
it cannot be proven by the mere testi- j
mony of witnesses that such a man is ;
not known and cannot be found. The j
prosecution contended that It could be i
so proved, that this* Is the only way to i
prove it and make impossible the whole
sale perpetration of fraud and crime j
and that such < evidence Is competent '.
sufficiently to establish the fact for all
legal purposes that such a person does
not exist in flesh and blOod. ;â¢â :.
Judge Bellinger did not pass finally
upon the merits of the contention, but
said enough to warrant the Conclusion
that the evidence is competent and ad
missible. â¢
Judge Bellinger said he would look
into the question further before ruling
definitely regarding the admission of
such evidence. â 
GAVE FALSE CERTIFICATES.
R. W. Montague, Deputy County
Clerk of Linn County under W. S.
Hammer from July. 1900, to July., 1902,
testified that he was authorized to
â¢ sign Hammer's name, to final proofs
and homestead filings.
Montague identified the handwriting
on the Government exhibits and stated
that he supposed the seal on each was
that of Linn County. â¢ He also stated
that he had known McKinley. Puter;
Dan W. Tarpley,- Mrs. Emma L. Wat
son and Miss Ware for various periods
of time. ""He then told of the filing of
the proofs and said:
' "Those who appeared befo're me
were George A. Graham, Thomas Wil
klns, George A. Pettis, Zenas K. Wat
son, Nellie Backus and Alexander D.
Brown. ( Those who did riot appear
were Mattie S. Lowell, William Mc-
Laughlin, Christie E. Langham, John
F. Foster, James A. Taylor. Albert A.
Austin and John Wakeneld."
The silence In -*he ; courtroom as the
words connecting Horace G. McKinley
'with seven of the. overt acts were ut
tered was Intense.
;Montasue then admitted that his
certificate on the papers that all of
those persons appeared before him
was not true and thus directly con
nected himself with the alleged con
spiracy.
WAS IX THE DEAL.
Further questioning by the District
Attorney brought out the .statement
that â¢; in each of ; the cases where ; the
papers were sentjto the land office with

and Friendship of Nations
ROME. Nov. 30.â King Victdr Em
manuel reopened . Parliament 'to-day.
P*rom his seat in the Senate at the
Plaza Madama the King" read; the
speech from the throne, .expressing lib
eral and peaceful principles, which werÂ«
enthusiastically applauded.
The hall of- the Senate -was crowded
and there, was an especially brilliant
gathering in the diplomatic tribune,
where the United States was represent
ed by Embassador. and Mrs. Myer. -The
whole assembly stood and applauded
for several minutes when the King and
Queen entered. In his speech the King
said in part:,
"When for the first time I spoke be
fore Parliament I affirmed my strong
belief in liberty. My experience since
then has confirmed my belief and has
persuaded me that only with liberty
can the ponderous problems now stand
ing before all the peoples of the world,
raised by the new aspirations and new
attitudes of the social forces, be solved.
My Government will continue to follow
the policy of granting ample liberty
within the limits of the law."
The King then announced the intro
duction" of " bills having the object of
progressively elevating the condition of
the Working classes, facilitating an
equitable and peaceful solution of the
conflicts between capital and labor,
substituting co-operation among all
classes . for . struggles and "replacing
strikes, which means' victory only for
the strongest by arbitration, which
means victory for justice."
. The King then referred to the con
clusion of commercial treaties with
Germany, Switzerland and Austria-
Hungary, and remarked: \ .'â¢
"Italy has been 'the first to demon
strate that the'- protectionist current
dominating the world does not prevent
commercial; agreements" when govern
ments are. guided by sentiments of
equity and solidarity." â¢
He insisted on the necessity for main
taining the balance of the budget and
the strength of the army and navy, and
said In conclusion: ' ' â¢
"The economic condition of Italy is
making evident progress, as demon
strated by the high quotations of state
bonds, which. have reached figures nev
er before attained, the disappearance
of exchange on gold, the large amount
of capital coming in, the increase in the
deposits in the savings banks, the
growing commercial activity, the devel
opments the industries and the unlim
ited credit enjoyed by the treasury of
the state. This happy condition has
.been reached, chiefly through peace, as
sured by solid alliances and sincere
â¢friendships 'and emphasized by the af
fectionate demonstrations which oc
curred at the time of the visits- to Rome
of the German Emperor, the Ktng of
England and ttie President of France.
"Arbitration treaties have been con
cluded with France. Great Britain and
Switzerland, while negotiations with
the United States and other countries
are well advanced. Thus Italy contin
ues her mission of peace."
."At the time the filings were made," j
replied Montague, _ "It was said that if i
they could buy the lands cheap and
sell them for more that I should have !
a share in the profits." . j
Another sensation was the testimony!
of Miss Mida McCoy, who connected C. ;
A. Hardin, attorney for Marie Ware,
with the changing of the name in the
George A. Howe abstract. Miss McCoy
is the stenographer in the office of the
Linn County Abstract Company. She
testified ' that McKinley furnished ab
stracts for the Graham Thompson and
George A. Howe claims. Miss McCoy
said that the Howe abstract was or- i
dered and delivered to McKinley. At
the time of delivery it had the name
of McKinley as having been the one
who ordered it. A short time after
Hardin came In and had the name of
McKinley changed to that of Howe.
COMPARES HANDWRITINGS.
John P. Marshall was the last .wit
ness of the day. He was formerly
cashier of the Ainsworth National
Bank of this city and is a handwriting
expert. By the aid of enlarged photo- |
graphs of the signatures taken from;
the. bonds filed with -the court as a
standard, the witness compared the
signatures of S. A. D. Puter, Frank H.
Wolgamot, Marie Ware. D. W. Tripley.
Horace G. McKinley and Emma ..L.
Watson, found In the original instru
ments, as well as the testimony of the
documents. According to Marshall, the
sli-natures of Joseph Wilson,' In the
Wilkins case, had been written by Hor
ace G. McKinley. In the George A.
Graham case and the George Pettis
case, the signatures of Graham and
Pettis were, according to the witness,
made by some one with the handwrit
ing of Miss McCoy as a standard. This
was true In the signature of Edward
Rees in the Foster case. The George
A. Howe signature was, in Marshall's
opinion, of similar character to the
writing of Horace G. McKinley and the
prosecution claims it will adduce fur
ther proof that It was forged by Mc-
Kinley. The Emma Porter and Emma
Watson "signatures, so Marshall said,
were beyond a doubt; written by the
same hand.

on his way to Oberliri from New York
and that he had with him securities
great enough to cover the loan which
was made through the Oberlin Bank to

Beckwith now openly refers to the
loss in its entirety as a $300,000 loan.
This, .he now says, covers in a general
way the loans made through the bank
and by him personally. He said to
night:
"People have wondered why a woman
having all the property that she has
and with so large an Income should
continue to be asking for loans. Mrs.
Chadwick has not had the handling of
her own assets for some time. While
there is not exactly a guardian. It al
most borders on that. She is in a posi
tion where she cannot touch one dol
lar of her income or principal. It Is
so tied up that she is absolutely help
less. This man who looks after her
finances is in sole control.
"I have seen three chests full of
jewels owned by Mrs. Chadwick. There
were diamonds worth a king's ran
som. She would hold them in her hand
and fondle them.

"It has been suggested that she was

ily with whom she lived. Well. I guess
that is true. I don't think that Mrs.

or whence she ' came prior to four or
five years ago. I cannot tell how she
discovered it."
"But how could a woman knowing
so little about herself accumulate the
vast fortune that she says she has?"
was asked.
"Have I not told you enough already
so that you can see how she might
have come into the possession of much
that she has? Are you still wondering
how she secured all the securities that
she has? I can add nothing to what I
have told you. This did'not come from
her, but I think I know what I am talk-
Ing about."

YERKES MAKES. REPORT
Two Million Dollar Increase
in Receipts in His . De
partment During Year
WASHINGTON, Nov. 80.â The an
nual report of Commissioner Terkes
of the Internal. Revenue Bureau shows
that for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1904, the receipts of the bureau wera
$232,904,004. an lncrase of $2,183,079
over the ' collections for the year pre
ceding % ' . V-"
The Commissioner calls attention to
the fact that the Government relieves
the distillers and wihemafcers from th.Â»
tax of $1 10 per gallon on the ' grape
brandy used to fortify sweet wines and
in addition pays all the expenses inci
dent to the gauging and use of such
spirits. In view of this latter fact the
Commissioner recommends that a mod
erate tax. If not the full- tax. be Im
posed upon wine spirits or grajÂ«e
brandy produced and used for fortifica
tion. The present cost to the Govern
ment of supervising the use of grapa
brandy for this purpose is estimated at
from $25,000 to $30,000 a year. â¢Â»; V
The report says that if a tax of only
25 cents per gallon was assessed as
against the brandy withdrawn and
used for fortification purposes the
actual cost of the wine would not be
increased more than 5 cents per gal
lon and would have produced to the
Government during the fiscal year 1303
a revenue of JJ.042.F91. â â  ';.
The Commissioner submits for con

ADVgRTISEMENTa.
"THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It. I* In
Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier In nature,
but few realize its value when taken
Into the human system for the same
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it la not a
drug at all. but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present
in the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them out of the system. â 
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating on-
ions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion: it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably tha
best charcoal and the most for the
money is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozen-
ges; they are composed of the finest
powdered Willow charcoal and other
harmless antiseptics In tablet form,
or rather In the form of large, pleas-
ant tasting lozenges, the charcoal be-
ing mixed with honey.
The dally use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it Is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use. but, on the contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I advise
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all pa-
tients suffering from gas In stomach
and bowels and to clear the complex-
Ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver 13
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them; they cost but 25 cents a box at
drug stores and although In some
sense a .patent preparation; yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal
in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in
any of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

The trestle ajnong the onlookers
broke ort openly yesterday. Mrs.
ElisabrtJi C Phillips made complaint
that she Â«ras being subjected to dis
courtesies in the courtroom by the
"society crowd." Mrs. Phillips ta the
bencSciary of &Hss Dolbeer's testa
r.rn: to ;hf amoaat of SI 0.000. She
testified In behalf of the contestant,
bciag <lissstis^ed with the amount of
her becuest.
Jadge Coffey has directed that seats
be reserved ior tlie women who come
to the trial. Sirs. Phillips says the
Â»baI3I!T diligently looks after Hie wants
of the friends of the proponents, but
ignore* her. Yesterday, she fnxther
complains, some of the "society"
women tr'^d to prevent her from
taking a seat she found vacant. She
savs they placed a eatchei on It. Â«
A few days ago Attorney Pillsbury
made objection to the presence of
Mrs. Phillips because her cough was
annoying. The court has thus far
taken no action.
The complications that Judge Cof
fey has to dtÂ»al with are multiplying-
Yesterday morning a gallant young
law clerk undertook to open a window
fa as to provide fresh air for the
"society corner."
"I don't want any ex-ofnelo attaches
Pm stick form; con-
mce and economy in
it is the best and cheap-
est shavingr soap.
Sold aU over the world.
A Garden of Choicest Roses FREE to Any Adiess in United States. Airess II Offieefor Particufars
here," came the stern command from
the bench.
The court has a bailiff at' beck and
nod, end no one understands better
than the Judge himself how to pro
vide the best ventilation for the great
est number. Fresh air for some may
mean deathly colds for others, and
the Judge regulates windows and
doors accordingly.
The testimony of thr day was chiefly
that of intimate friends of Bertha Dol
beer, v,-ho all agreed that she never dis
played a single indication of insanity.
The witnesses were principally men
who had met her in society.
The cross-examination of Mrs. Lolita
Selfridge was finished with a few
questions immediately after court con
vened In the morning.
Benjamin M. Joseph, manager of the
art department of the White House,
bad known Miss Dolbeer, he testified,
as a patron at the store for many
years. The witness said she used keen
business judgment in trading at the
store. He met her in Paris later, see
ing her in a carriage with Miss Mary
Josselyn at the fete of "the battle of
flowers." He merely spoke to her as
she passed, and she appeared to be per
fectly rational.
WALTER S. MARTIN TESTIFIES.
Walter S. Martin testified that he first
met Miss Dolbeer in March, 1899, being
introduced to her by his brother, Peter
Martin. The witness came in contact
with her frequently after that at social
gatherings. The last time he saw her
was on April 4 of the present year,
when he conversed with her In the Co-:
lumbia Theater about renting her house
while she was away.
"She was perfectly rational and a
conservative character," was the opin
ion of the witness.
Milton S. Latham was the next wit
ness. He said he knew Bertha Dolbeer
well and frequently visited her home.
Previous to the death of her father the
witness called on her several times
every week, but after that but once or
twice a month. He saw the testatrix a
number of times Just before her de
parture last April for Europe, and was
at the ferry with the party that was
there to bid her good-by. There was
then nothing strange or unusual In her
manner, he said, nor any Indication
whatever of melancholia-
John Zeile had also participated In
numerous social diversions that Miss
Doibeer attended. He described auto
mobile trips and drives they had taken
together. An intimate acquaintance
ship was shown, and when asked his
opinion the witness said that Miss Dol
beer was undoubtedly rational and of
sound mind. Zeile described a dinner
party given by the testatrix a short
| time before she started for Europe, and
j she was very cheerful that evening. She :
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, , DECEMBER M;/ 1904;
was also in happy frame of mind the
day the departed, the witness going tc
the ferry to s.'iy good-by t'< her.
Mi* I)ena Ilasmussen. who was em
ployed iy Miss Iiolbeer for household
work, testified that at n<> time was
there any sign <>f melancholia in the
testatrix. The witness said her em
â¢ ployer wa? of very even temper, never
became excited and seemed to look on
the bright side of life. Misa Dolbeer
â¢went out a great deal, finding keen en
jcyment in social diversions. She en
tered into gayety so much that the
I course of "rest cure" was necessary
: before starting: on the trip to Europe.
According to the witness there could be
no question as to the sanity of Miss
Dolbeer.
The deposition of Miss Ethel Hager,
j takrn before ehe left for the East a few
i weeks ago. was read to the jury. She
j was at Del Monte with Miss Dolbeer
i and her father in 1902, and on one oc
! casion the testatrix told the witness
Â¦' that Miss Warren had been "brother,
sister and mother" to her.
"I regard Miss Warren as my nearest
[ of kin and feel most fortunate in hav
! ing her with me as a companion," was
| one of Miss Dolbeer's declarations.
Miss Hager told of several social af
fairs Miss Dolbeer attended and of
other occasions they were together.
, When asked her opinion deponent said
I she never detected any symptom of in
i sanity in the testatrix and was certain
' she was of sound mind.
The trial will be resumed this morn-
CANNOT LOCATE . MISSING
CONSIGNMENT OF MONEY
Fifteen Thousand Dollars Disappears
Mysteriously From Wells, Fargo
>. & Co.'s Office.
The forwarding money department of
Wells, Fargo & Co.'s Express is report
ed to be out $15,000. Where the money
has gone to or how it came to disap
pear is a mystery to all concerned in
that office. The package and contents
weighs 67 pounds, and this "\ ould seem
to preclude any possibility ,' that the
money had been stolen from the office.
The officials do not think a robbery has
been committed, but are of the belief
that it has been shipped out of town by
mistake
Money that is being' shipped away is
done up in bags, and these are In turn
put Into boxes, which are locked. The
agent at this point retains, one key and
the agent at the objective point has the
other. It will therefore be impossible
for the officials to unravel the mystery
until all the boxes shipped out yester
day have reached their destinations.
Telegrams have been sent by the com
pany to all their agents "at places to
which money was shipped. .

I telephone message was received at a Chineee
j gambilns house at 5 St. Louis ai-Jey. informtnf I
that place that a Police Commissioner and the j
sergeant were about to visit . the gambling
places and to close up quick.
Also at 0?25 a similar. roeMag* was" received
at a Chinese gambling placÂ« at 102 Waverly
place.- - ;- - - - - Â«
At 9:26 Chin Ktm. You. who. 1 am told, is
president of the Gair.blers" AssÂ»ociatlon. tele
phoned to the gambling place at 820 Washing
ton street that a Police Commissioner was
coming through Chinatown with the sergeant,
and to close up quick. Similar, messages were
Ff-nt to other gambling houses.
Sergeant Ellis met nie at Powell and Clay
streets at 9:30. We wÂ«.lked down Clay street
to Waverly place and proceeded north. We
walked down Waverly place an,l found some
of the Iron lattice doors locked with a pad
lock, others wer* closed but not locked. About
all of the Iron lattice doors were closed, which.
Is not customary at that hour of the night
or at any other of the frequent times I have
been through Chinatown In the evening.
We went into t?ome five or six camblinc
places on Waverly place and found but one
or two persons sitting or moving around, mak;
injr a pretense of closing up.
We went to two or- three places on Wash
ington street with the same result. -. The Â»ldtf
walks on Washington street were also being
crowded with Chinese.
We 'went to some Rambling places on St.
Louis alley and found the same state of facts.
There was no gambling being carried on In
Chinatown at that lime.
I then walked with the sergeant â  to Jackson
street, down Jackson street to Kearny and
then left him, and at 10 o'clock I received
the above reports as to the time messages
were received in the gambling places.
Desiring to confirm my belief that the con
ditions In Chinatown on the evening of the
25>th of November were not normal I went to
Chinatown' on the 29th at 9 p.' m. In a clospd
coupe in company with Officer Mlnehan and
LÂ». G. Carpenter. When we arrived In front
of 820 Washington street Mr. Carpenter and
myself hastily entered and found about one
hundred Chinese busily engaged in either play
lntc or as spectators at the game of fantan. j
Officer Mlnehan entered a few minutes later
and Sergeant Ellis about five .minutes, later.
We succeeded in arresting about eighty-five
Inmates, acquired a quantity of evidence and
$C62 95 in money. â¢
This was one of the places I visited the
night before and found no one there. On
the contrary those who had evidently been
there a few minutes previous appeared to be
temporarily on the street and sidewalks in*
front thereof. !
I had been informed norae two* weeks pre
vious that for months past no gambling was
being carried on except when the police were
restrained by an Injunction or at least up to
the hour of 11 p. m.. but the fact as it ap
pears to roe is that the only time gambling Is
not carried on is when there is no opportunity
of knowing that a Police Commissioner la
about to make a visit.
The above matters are presented for such
action as you / may desire to take. Very
respectfully yours. H. W. HUTTON.
This report was temporarily filed and
the discussion on the newspaper article I
again taken ud. Chief "Wlttman said
'that he had no knowledge of money be
ing, paid for protection In Chinatown,
but If such were the case he courted
Investigation. "I ask for a full investi
gation," he said. "When a man has a
clear conscience he fears no one, and I
am that way. "I will come out with fly
ing colors."
Commissioner Drinkhouse said:
In reference to an article appearing In â  an
evening paper regarding protection of Chinese
gamblers by this department, I wish . to say
that, bo far -as It refers to me. It Is like many
other articles in that paper â an outrageous,
bare-faced He. I am and always have been
against tolerating this open gambling, and
always will be against It: ; and I want it dis
tinctly understood that I am ready on the
first aresentatlon of any croof of corrupt
knowledge or corrupt : conduct in this connec
tion on the part of any. member. of this de
partment, high or low, ,- to vote for his Imme
diate dismissal.
Commissioner Reagan was equally
bitter' in his denunciation" of what he
termed "a base and slanderous lie." He
also expressed a perfect willingness to
be; investigated,; and said he 'would; do
dll in his power to punish any guilty,
parties.
On behalf of Mayor -Sen mi tz. the fol
lowing resolution was presented and
unanimously adopted:
Whereas. It has frequently been rumored
and alleged' that a corruption fund Is paid to
certain officials â¢ of â¢â ' this â  department for thÂ«
protection of. gamblers : In - Chinatown; and
whereas, repeated; effort- on the part of mem
bers of this commission and of the Mayor of
the city- has resulted only In discovering that
funds have been collected In Chinatown osten
sibly for the purposes stated, but it has with
the greatest effort and expense been found Im
possible to .â¢ ascertain < whether Â¦ these moneys
are paid by the Chinese ..who collect the same
to'.' any official or .other ; person for Â¦ any pur
pose: and whereas.' not only ah'ould the..whole
sale gambling in Chinatown be suppressed, but
any 'person or official offering or guaranteeing
protection . or . accepting moneys for that; pur
pose . b.Â» punished ... to â¢ the full â¢ extent Â¦Â¦': of the
lnw;'tJieteforÂ«- '..': â¢Â¦'â¢:-Â¦-,â¢â¢;".â¢ '.â¢:- :: -' -Â¦' 'Â¦-Â¦..'." '
. . Resolved. First, that the Chief of Police be
Â¦ and he is hereby directed to detail at once for
service in Chinatown twenty-five officers and as
many more as may be needed, to suppress the .
gambling referred to, such police officers to re
.main on' duty until every gambling house In
Chinatown shall be finally closed.-. â¢â¢-.::>::;
Second, that a reward of $500 be offered ten
competent evidence of the payment or delivery
by the Chinese who collect the funds referred
to, -or by any other person, to any official of
the Police Department, or to any other, person

.The matter of the reward occasioned
a little discussion, as funds are low, but

pay the money out of his . own pocket.

entered. in the record. ' The. proprietor

that thev leave the premises
Policeman Annear was summoned
and succeeded in gettlngithem into the

Buckley spied Schuur bounding up the
stairs with a revolver in his hand.
Brandishing the weapon the irate man
told them to get out. at the same. time
advancing on a run and aiming the pis
tol at Mrs. Buckley, who was nearest.
The woman screamed to her husband
and Hilton to run. She and Hilton got
out of a rear window and after climb

rescued by neighbors. Buckley was not
so fortunate. He saw nothing but im

Royal Museum at Glzeh. consisting of
a varied assortment of antiquities,
such as scarabs, representations of the
sacred animals and gods, emblematic

piSOXER APPEARS
FOR ARRAIGNMENT
1$ Given Until Xext Monday
to Enter Plea to Informa
tion Accusing Him of the
Murder of His Mother
Special Dtoatrh to The Call.
AUBURN. Nov. 30. â It was rumor
ed late to-night tliat Adolph Weber
had confessed to the authorities that
he had murdered his father, mother,
sister and brother. Under Sl^riff May
denies the story and It I* given but
little credence by those who are work-
Ing on the case. May says, however,
that he believes It will not be nr.iuy
dsys before the prisoner freaks down
and tells the story of the terrible
crime.
Weber uraa arraigned in the Superior
Court to-day on the specific charge ol
having murdered his mother.
Judge Prewett noticed that the in
formation named the defendant as
A<3o!ph Julius Weber and said that
If the prisoner made no statement to
the contrary he would be tried under
that name. Weber acknowledged it
to be his true name.
Ben P. Tabor, counsel for the de
fendant, is absent from the. city and
S. J. Pullen requested the court to
postpone further proceedings until
next Monday.
Judge Pfewett then announced that
next Monday at 10 a. m. would be
fixed as* the time for Weber to plead.
District Attorney Robinson then
addressed the court, saying that he
desired George W. Hamilton to assist
him at the trial and asked that Ham
ilton's name be entered as one of the
prosecuting* attorneys.
The court made the desired order.
Hamilton is the son of the late Gen
eral Jo Hamilton, who was one of tire
best known criminal attorneys in the
State and is considered very bright,
especially in- criminal cases. The se
lection of Hamilton ends the rumor
that L. L. Chamberlain, a prominent
Auburn attorney, would 'be employed
to assist the District Attorney.
Weber appeared more flushed and
feverish to-day than he did when first
arrested and no longer assumes a cool,
nonchalant manner. His Confinement
Is evidently beginning to tell on him
and his expression is more thoughtful
and worried. He still maintains, when
questioned by the officers, that he
cares, little about the robbery charge.
"The murder charge is the only one
worrying: me,"' is his frequent remark.
To the . query of an officer this
evening as to whether he ever thought
seriously of the matter he replied:
"You people seem to think because
I am not crying that I have not done
any thinking. Well, I have j done a
great deal, and I have planned out
my future as far as It Is possible for
me to do so. When I get out of this
I Intend to cast my fortunes else
where. I believe In controlling one's"
will power so that he may compel
himself to think of those things which
seem brightest to him."
The Grand Jury took up the other
murder charges to-day and examined
the following witnesses: Dr. Rooney,
Mrs. Pnowden, May Clark, A. D. Fel
lows. Clarence Gear, Ben Dependener,
John Monaghan and Chris Henny.
About four years ago a Chinese was
found murdered Just over the hill
from the Weber place. His head was
nearly cut off. The evident motive of
the crime waÂ« robbery. No particular
suspicion attached to any one at the
time, but during the last few days
some persons have revived the story
and profess to think Weber may have
killed the Chinese. As Weber was
only about 16 yeara old at the time
the theory does not find many sup
porters In this community, although
Â«ome think that if Weber murdered
his own family he was . capable of
committing the deed of four years
ago.

fending a Man on Whose
Guilt He Is to Pass
SENSATION IX COUNT
Judge Sternly Rebukes Jhe
Offender and Promptly
Orders Discharge of Jury
Special Dispatch to The Ci!L
SAN JOSE. Nov. 30.â Charges of ;
misconduct of Juror Ix>ois Cavallaro l
with the attorneys for the defense and
the subsequent dismissal of the Jury in
the Nolberto Coronado murder case
created a eer.satl.in to-day in Judge
Tuttle's court. The case had been on
trial for the past ten days and Nolberto
was on the stand in his own behalf.
When the case was called this morn
lnÂ«r District Attorney Carapbell pre
sented an affidavit made by C. Olsen.
alleging improper conduct on the part
of Cavallaro and which also referred
indirectly to Attorneys W. A. Bowden
and Bertram A. Herrington. Campbell
then made a motion that the court dis
charge the, jury. :Â» â¢'!:;::>':;'
The affidavits of Olscn' recited a
number of instances where Cavallaro
and an attorney for the defense drank
together in the Parlor saloon, and it is
also set forth that another juror was
present at some of the . gatherings.
O!sen on another occasion had hea'rd
one of the attorneys for the defense
say to Cavallaro, ."You urderstand,
don't you?" : : ;
District Attorney Campbrll stated to
the court that the acts of the juror
were suspicious, and he believed that
.experience had fully proven that it is
a semi-miracle, and practically 'un
known, that a juror should consort
with either side .of a cause during a
trial and join ' with his fellows, in a
verdict for the adverse side at the* end
of it. On the contrary, the District At.
torney continued, a Juror gnerally votes
as he drinks, with -his friends. â¢
JURY IS DISMISSED. ' \j
Attorneys Bowden and Herrington
did not reply to the statement, of the
District Attorney. They asked for cop
ies of the affidavit.
Judge Tuttle stated that he was' not
prepared to pass on the matter at once,
but would look into it, and he ad
journed court until 1 o'clock this after
noon. .
Attorneys Bowden and Herrington
presented affidavits this^afternoon de
nying that anything .vrong had oc
curred" In their relations with Juror
Cavallaro. An affidavit was also pre
sented by Cavallaro making the same
denials and stated that he. had only
met the attorneys In a social way, as
he had been in the habit of doing for
years, and that at no time had he and
the attorneys for the defense discussed
the Coronado case. I â 
Judge' Tuttle then took up the motion
for a dismissal. He said that he was
surprised that attorneys .should so far
forget themselves and the Bpirit of
their oath of office and conduct them
selves In a manner that must of neces
sity arouse suspicion. But for % a juror
to act In such a manner was an insult
to tbe court after the admonitions
given and a menace to the measure of
usefulness of. a Juror. "For a long
time," continued Judge Tuttle, "I may
say for years, rumors have been float-
Ing about this community that Jurors
have been tampered with and the
course of justice in our courts thereby
defiled. The familiarity of certain at
torneys of this with jurors
in the way of treating to cigars, drinks
and even to dinners, as well as holding
apparently confidential conversations
while causes were in actual trial, have
been pointed to and commented upon
until the Jury system, : s it exists in this
county, is becoming a byword and re
proach to Justice and common honesty.
It Is high time that radical steps be
taken that this system, so powerful for
good when unsullied, may not' become
In this community a stench in the nos
trils of its people and a damnable
farce."
JUDGE SCORES ATTORNEY.
Judge Tuttle then asked Coronado If
he would consent to a dismissal of the
jury- Coronado said he would not;
that he had been in Jail three years
and wanted to be tried by the jury se-
lected.
The court then made an order that
the Jury? be dismissed without verdict.
An exception to the order was taken by
the attorneys for the defense.
Attorneys Bowden and Herrington
stated thla afternoon that Coronado
could not be tried again, as he had
once been In Jeopardy. They declare
that Judge Carroll Cook of San Fran
cisco refused to dismiss the Jury in the
Botkin case when charges were made
against it for the reason that It would
mean the dismissal of the defendant.
They propose to at on-e take steps to
secure Coronado's release, and unless
It Is granted by the courts here the
matter will be taken to the Supreme
Court.
Coronado Is charged with the murder
Coronado Is charged with the murder
of Frank Narona at Guadalupe In 1901.
This was his* third trial. The first one
resulted In a. disagreement and at the
second he received a life sentence, but
the Supreme Court . set the verdict
aside because the complaint failed to
state that Coronado had killed a hu
man being.

FOR BLACKBURN
Head Watchman of Chinese
Bureau Strikes a Guard
While Latter Is on Duty
BRAWL OX 3IAIL DOCK
J. -.Quintan, Whose Jaw Stops
Blow, Will Prefer Charges
Against Superior Officer
Mason S. Blackburn, head watchman
of the Chinese Bureau at this port, ad
dressed - one of his subordinates as a
"; .liar" . yesterday afternoon and
then tried to -knock him out by smiting
him. on the jaw. As a result Guard J.
Quinlan, at whom the epithet was
hurjed and w*hose jaw stoped the blow,
will prefer charges against his superior
officer. The encounter took place at one
of the gangways leading from the liner
Korea to the Pacific Mall wharf, and if
a few Chinese did not escape while their
custodians brawled, it was not because
the Chinese Bureau's hired eyes were
upon them.
During the last stay In port of the
liner. Coptic Chinese Bureau Guard A.
L, DJlley, . so the story goes, found his
brother watchman, Guard Quinlan,
colled up in an out-of-the-way corner
of the Coptic sound asleep. Dllley, too
busy watching Chinese to arouse Quin
lan, Is said to have conducted Black
burn to where Quinlan lay asleep.
Blackburn reported Quinlan for sleep-
Ing at his post and the guard received
a reprimand. Since then relations be
tween Quinlan and Dilley have been
strained. Dilley, It is said, denied to
Quinlan all responsibility for bringing
Blackburn- to the scene of Quinlan's
stolen siesta and arranged yesterday
to repeat the denial In the presence of
Blackburn.
Quinlan was on duty at one of the
Korea's gank planks. Dilley and Black
burn joined him at his post. What fol
low'ed Is told by bystanders, among
whom were dock clerks, customs offi
cers and. guards -of the Chinese Bureau.
A few words, audible only to the "trio,
*ere spoken. Blackburn.- stepped
toward Quinlan. called him a liar and
struck him a heavy blow on the Jaw.
.. "He's an old man, don't hit .him,"
counseled the men, who grabbed Quin
lan. Blackburn retired in disorder and
the work of keeping uninvited Chinese
out of (the country was resumed.
BUTCHER FINDS
BURIED COIN
Uncovers Nearly $10Q0 - in
Gold in a Corral in Bear
of His Slaughter-House
REDDING, Nov. 30.â William Men
zel, a butcher of this city, found rich
diggings in the yard of his slaughter
house, three miles from Redding, on
Monday. He raked up $1000 In coin, the
most of which was in gold. All of the
money was coined "more than thirty
years ago. It is believed that In early
days some miner cached the treasure
and died without revealing his secret.
In course of. time, the slaughter-house
was built on the ground and the cache
was Inclosed In the corral. The hogs
then, 'according to this theory, rooted
up the buried treasure at some time
when their rich find was unobserved
and scattered the coins over Ihe small
space of ground under an average
depth of four inches of dirt. The re
cent rains uncovered $30 In gold coins.
When they were found' it was believed
that the money had been dropped by
two marauders who had been shot at
the previous night by a slaughter-house
employe. But on Sunday Menzel found
a $20 piece sticking edgewise in the
ground. It, like the other coins found,
was of old mintage. That" fact set the
butcher to thinking. Monday morning
he' went to the corral bright and early
armed with a rake. At the first haul
of the rake a number of $20 pieces were
uncovered. Within a few hours the
lucky butcher had secured $1000. Among
the coins are six two and a half dollar
pieces and ?6 50 In *;lver that was so
badly tarnished that it was hardly rec
ognizable.

Reckless Nickel-in-the-Slot Gamblers
of Palo Alto Win Victory in
Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court yesterday de
livered a telling blow to the reform
movement in Palo Alto. The slot
machine business . may henceforth
flourish in the pretty college town.
An expensive campaign started for
the purpose of eradicating the gam
bling evil has come to naught. The
State's highest tribunal has decreed,
nevertheless, that the reformers need
not be compelled themselves to send
stray nickels after more
Joseph Frltts charged one Levin
with operating a machjne in which
one might "place a nickel, turn a
crank and secure. a chance of getting
a much larger sum of money from said
machine." Justice of the Peace
Charles refused to issue a warrant and
the complainant asked for a writ of
mandate. The Supreme Court says:
"In this case there is nothing to
show that operating the machine in
which a person by placing a nickel
therein 'pecures a chance of getting
a much larger sum of money from
said maehine upon turning said
crank' injured plaintiff in any manner
different from the general public. He
is not compelled to_put a nickel In
the machine and turn a crank, but if
he should do so, according to the
complaint, he 'secures a chance of
getting a much larger sum of money
from the machine.' "
Neither complaint, answer or de
cision explains what sort of a machine
It Is that gives a player a chance to
make. so big. a sum of money.

JURY NOT ABLE
TO FIX BLAME
Doctors Questioned About
Finding of a Sponge in
the Wound of a Patient
SURGEONS 3IYSTIFIED
Verdict That Ah Sing Died
Because of Foreign Sub
stance Poisoning System
Several doctors were among the wit
nesses called before the Coroner's jury
in the; case of Ah Slcs. a Chinese shoe
maker, who died on November 13 in the
Oty and County Hospital of septic
peritonitis, caused by the presence of a
piece of Bponge left in the abdominal
cavity of the unfortunate Chinese by
some one of the physicians who operat
ed on him on two occasions.
Ah Sing was suffering from dropsy
and cirrhosis of the liver, and acting
under the advice of friends he went to
the City and County Hospital for treat
ment. There Dr. W. C. Praett "tapped"
his abdomen with a trochax, but in
advertently cut a large artery In doing
so/ In order to prevent the patient
from bleeding to death an incision was
made in the abdomen and the artery
was tied. Several days later it was de
cided to perform an operation for
cirrhosis of the liver. This was per
formed by Dr. A. W. Morton, assisted
by Dr. F. R. Hart, In the presence of
students, to whom Dr. Morton at the
time delivered J a discourse as to the .
proper manner of using the gauxe
sponge.
After death Ah Sing's body had been
taken to the Morgue. Dr. Curry per
formed an autopsy and found a piece
of gauze almost the size of a man';*
hand lying against the right kidney In
the location of the second operation, thÂ«
first by . Dr. Pruett having been per
formed on the left side of the abdomen.
Dr. Morton denied on the witness
stand yesterday that he had left any
gauze in the body of the patient be
fore sewing up the Incision and sug
gested that the sponge might have
floated over from the left side.
Dr. Pruett, the students who wit
nessed and the nurses who assisted at
the operation testified that they had
not seen any gauze left in the wound
at either operation. It was in such a
position as to render the theory im
possible that It could have been swal-
lowed by the patient.
The Jury returned a verdict that Ah
Sing's death had been caused by peri
tonitis "on account of presence of
gauze in the abdominal cavity found
after death. It is impossible to de
termine whether the gauze was used at
the first or second operation."
FIVE DAYS IX JAIL FOR
VIOLATING AN INJUNCTION
3Ieraber of Cooks* Union Ordered Into
Custody by Judge. Hebbard
Acted as Picket. '*
Disregard of- the court's injunction
has brought a penalty of five days in
jailfor H. A. Hoburg of the Cooks'
Union. His arrest was ordered yes
terday by Judge Hebbard at the in
stance of S. Constaritini, proprietor of
the Maison Tortonl, who had obtained
an Injunction against the boycotting
tactics of the Cooks' and Waiters'
Union. Hoburg was examined and ad
mitted that he had continued at his
post as picket for a day after receiv
ing the court's order to quit. Attor
ney Devoto, representing the union,
announced that he would move that
the injunction be aet aside because it
was "improvldently granted." He
said that the Tortonl was a notorious
resort and therefore Its proprietors
did not come into a court of equity
with clean hands.
Judge Hebbard also heard the order
to show cause why a member of the

There's Only One Way to
Get the Best of Whisky?
And that Js to let It alone. /. If you try
any other way it will get the best of
you. If you can't let it alone you need
Dr. McKanna's treatment. â¢ Dr. McKan-
na cures the liquor habit by destroying
the desire for liquor and , putting the
system in its natural condition. whÂ»re
liquor is not needed to help the machin-
ery of the body to do Its work. Dr.
McKanna effects a complete cure In three
days without the use of dangerous hy-
podermics, annoying confinement or bad
after effects. Dr. McKanna's treatmeni
is absolutely safe and cannot harm the
most delicate constitution. Why waste
time and money in drinking whisky
when you can be cured of the liquor
habit in three days with no char.ee of
failure, no risk and no unpleasantness?

Maintain That as. De Rome Hazing
;â¢/. Occurred Outside School They
â¢ .â¢".-, Can" Take Xo "Action.- . .'
-The board of . directors of the" San
Francisco. Art Association met last
night to take action on the report of
the school committee in reference to
the hazing of Albert T. de Rome, a
Mark Hopkins art student. The di
rectors formally decided that as the
hazing occurred outside the jurisdic
tion of the art school they could take
no action in the matter.
The hazing occurred several days
ago at 611 Clay street in the studio
of one of the members of the life
class, into which De Rome was being
initiated. The boys were charged
with using an electric battery, from :
the effects of which De Rome was !
partially paralyzed and went under !
the doctor's care.
The members of the board present
at last night's deliberation were Wil
lis E. Davis, chairman; Lorenzo P.
Latimer, Henry Heyman, â¢ George W.
Turner, William G. Warren
â¢D. Clark and Robert H. Fletcher.
Their report Is as follows:
The board of directors of the San Francisco
Art Association, while deeply regretting that
any member of the California School of De
elgn. should have received such treatment as
It is reported was sustained by Albert T. de
Rome at the hands of Borne of his fellow stu
dents, finds that the affair occurred outside of
and remote from the school and without the
knowledge of any of Its officers.
This being the case, the board after due
deliberation does not feel that It Is required
or has the authority, to Investigate this inci.
dent, since the acts of Individual students out
side of the school are not within its Juris
diction.
As a consequence the board, while deploring
the fact that the name of the school has been'
brought Into undesirable and. it Is believed
Ti , li K , und '?Â«7 v <^ notoriety. Is of the opinion
that it Is not In the position to take any action
In the matter.

MEET TO HONOR
PATRON SAINT
The St. Andrew's Society of
This City Enjoys Banquet
. and Oratory and ' Song
MANY LADIES PRESENT
Families of Members and
Their Friends Welcome
Guests at the Celebration
In honor of St. Andrew's day the
members of the society that bears his
name and keeps his faith assembled
with their families and friends at the
Palace Hotel last evening. After an
excellent dinner, prepared to please the
fancy of the truest Scot, had been dis
cussed, the gathering, feasted of elo
quence and music and then danced to
the piper's drone and again to the
strains of an orchestra, hidden by -a
bunTc of greens.
The'occasion was picturesque. In fhe
hall where, as a rule, men In the som
ber garb <of evening sit in. unbroken,
monotonous rows, there was a welcome
rolief of color last evening. All the
ladies were in evening dress and, in
deference "to them, the cigars were
gently puffed and a clear and whole
some atmosphere- told that a restrain
ing influence was there. Red arid yel
low shaded, candelebra added the only
color to. the table decorations, but they
were sufficient and did not permit the
throning of any- flower where the thistle
should have ; Been. â¢ . .
Y. C. Ivawson, president of the -St.
.Andrew's-. Society," acted as toastmaster
and to his call eloquent stories of Scot-)
land and of California were told. First
the president called for a toast to the
â¢President 'of ithe United States a.nd,
while they held aloft their glasses, the
dlnersf sang' "The Star-Spangled Ban
ner," thenr -drank -;to the chief executive
.of. the nation.- â¢ â¢ â¢ . â¢ .
"1. wlll.'.now cal.l upon Mr. James D.
Phelan to" respond to the toast/ 'Cali
fornia, the Land of Adoption,' "
said President. La wson. "This is the
land of our choice- that hasTeceived us
with-, open -arms, and -that has offered
â¢us glorious opportunities which, I am
glad to say; most of us have taken ad
vantage, of: 1 ' . ;:T^V^-\ J
. CALIFORNIA IX IHSTORY. -:.;
Mr. Phelan said that when California
was" mentioned no- man could keep
silent. He said that in. his opinion
there is no -equaT territory in the -whole,
world that is. so productive as Cali
fornia. Remote as- is the State it has
played a remarkable, part in the his
tory .of the "United Stat?B and- its In
fluence had been recorded in the politi
cal.' and commercial history of the
whole world
.â¢ "But," he continued, "what always
holds the most attention Is the roman
tic charm that attaches . to \ the- State.
This charm comes with its climate, and
here man can enjoy more .days of every
year that he may work in comfort than
in anv other land, and In consequence
enjoys- a greater . return than" all- the
civilizations of. the Old World can con
fer." " â¢ â¢"â¢.â¢ ...â¢-'â .:â¢.â â¢â .â â¢.
In. conclusion Mr. Phelan said that he
wanted- 'to .thank .the Scotch people .of
this city for what -they had done to con
tribute to its progress and 'prosperity,
but. "they, had .been repaid,, he- ;added,"
because their endeavors, were in this
land, which is. the first on the earth in
"everything '.that makes -life, worth the
living. : - \. 'â  , ' ' '' : ' }â â â â â  ':â . . .'
."At-..the conclusion of.Mri'Phelan's ad
dress "Alfred C. Read. sang. "My Own
United States" in' splendid, voice. A
toast to the King' was, then, drtink and
then another to "Scotland, the land of
our., .birth;" which: was 'greeted' -with
hearty cheers
'fjohn McXaught responded \!tq' . the
toast "Scotland,, the tend" "of our- birth,. 1 -'
and: eloquently told the- story' of .the.
rugged land to whidh the minds .of all
his "listeners were turnect â  \ here is no
crag in all that land. \t%' said", nor
through : its -valleys do<*s a" river flow,
that Is unnoted in efther song c5r poem.
The love of the Scotchman for his coun
try is ever manifest in its literature, he
said, and on the earth ;no truer .democ
racy exists, for in that 'land all" men
share in the wealth of cbmmon hu
manity. ',"..-â¢"â  ,
LAND WITH A SOUL
Into that land, said Mr. McNaught,
in conclusion, there was born a soul, and
nothing can shake its' steadfast faith.
Through that soul the genius of her
people prevailed and it steeled the
hearts of her men in battle, ever flght-
ing for the right.
. Miss A. Fletcher, who recently ar
rived in this city from' the land of
the heather, sans two songs of Scot
land that were much appreciated. At
their conclusion President Lawson
said the wires had carried greetings
to the society from their brothers in
Albany, St. Paul, .Victoria, B. C, Mon
treal, Canada, Tacoma, Xevv York and
Vancouver, B. C. The reading of the
telegrams was greeted wllh cheers,
and then all rose and drank to" the
toast, "St. Andrew's day."
Hon. Lucien Shaw, Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court, was the
last speaker of , the evening. He re
sponded to the toast, "St. Andrew's
day and what It brings to us."
Justice Shaw said that only the recol
lection of the good time he had had
as a guest. of the society at its last
picnic could. tempt him to attempt i to
make an after-dinner speech, for
after-dinner speaking to all men Â» is
sometimes difficult, but to him was an
absolutely lost art.
"However,"., he- said. ,'-'I have been
called uponjto speak to St.. Andrew,
and I must confess that I know very
little of him. It! Is certain that he
was the. patron, saint -of, Scotland, and
I will remark that I think -that : this
Is enough, glory, considering modern
conditions. He represents : the spirit
of ! goodf ellowship we- "see ; here ; to
night, and it is his ' spirit that has
made this " fine ' institution flourish.

Shaw's ' remarks, and then the guests
adjourned to'; the i_ Marble 1 and ' Maple

'd.e'c^di" patrolman.r. Kiniry will be af

, In. : . Department. 2 of .the- Police Court.
â¢yjvmbrrow,. when a plea will be taken
qjidahe time-will. be set for the prelim
injary -.examination. â¢â  '"â . " .
. .Wiliing enough 'to talk along Tine^--
Fe'nijal 'lihes.' Kiniry to-day .showed
..'rnarke'd â¢ reficence -concerning the real
. issue before him. ' .
*'I shall plead notguilty,".hedeclareai
"and:l shall '-use all 'of the. legal rights
I r>OEsess . to . defend myself. ' No. I
haven't engaged an attorney yet.
There's time enough, and I guess; I can
pet. hold of money enouzh to pay hirr."
This confidence in his ability to raise
means convinces the police that Kiniry
has money at his disposal. But they
have no information where his hidden
fund might be located. When Kiniry
was taken in charge by Chief. of Poliee
Hodgkins his possessions consisted of
51 75 and the clothes on his back.
Kiniry is rated by the police as a
desperate thug, ready for any crime
and willing to take human life without
the slightest compunction. The police
strip the situation of glamor and mock
heroics. They insist that the prisoner,
clever and self-possessed as he may be,
shall not be held up as an object of
morbid curiosity. Upon that theory or
ders have been given that no persons
whose business does not warrant shall
be permitted to see Kiniry. He will be
given such medical or other attention
as his case requires, but under no cir
cumstances will there be any pamper
ing of the man.
KXMRY TALKATIVE. . -
Kiniry was willing enough to talk to
day. He rather indicated a weakness
to ehine a bit under the limelight. His
interviewers had no difficulty in gain
ing much Information from the prisoner.
up to the r>oint of actual part in the
duel that ended Policeman Smith's life,
â¢There Kiniry halted. Voluble and a bit
boastful was hÂ» about "his burglaries
â and the battle of pistols at Los An
geles that ended In his captuce. All of
that he told and retold, as he nad done
many times during his stay In the
â¢ southern" city after his' arrest there.
But it had become an old story and the
recital opened no new lines of sugges
tion.
Kiniry is 22 years old and a native
of Montreal, Canada. His mother re
sides In the East. Much of his life
was spent i # n St. Louis. Mo., but If his
etory be true he has been a thief and.
burglar since he was 16 years old; His
associations have riot been with_
criminals. Young, Men's Christian
Associations have appealed to him and
his name has been '.oh 'the. rolls of; hot
a few', such organizations. " Thus he
has .hidden-., for' years the real trend
of his movements.. â¢ .'. '.â¢'.."
AH' of these- details have been in the
possession- of : . the. police for 'months.
The very minute '.and..accurate descrip
th-e "circulars sent out by the' Oakland
departnhnt sbon ; after' the shooting of
Smith iovered' -these items closely.
ICiniry meets, the description perfect
ly. .. He is tall.- slender, athletic In
build, with .a. \ clean-cut . face,, not
marked by criminal' lines; that is
strongly enough, to be observed by an
ordinary investigation. Thdt the pro
fessional c'rinjinal characteristics are
absent Is due. in'great measure, say the
police, to' the fact that-Kiniry has al
.ways kept company of a respectable
class." , "â¢ .
FEW iBAD HABITS. .
" Kiniry has few bad- habits. He
neither' use"s-'tobacco in any form nor
dof-s he use ; intoxicants. . He is a
"crank" on physical exercise. His
practice for years has beep to take a
regular daily course in bicycling, ten
nis or walking, with constant pistol
practice. He lives plainly and eschews
all tendency . toward "high living."
This anomalous criminal has been able
to keep his mind clear, to work with
ready wit and strong muscle at his
murderous calling.
Now that the man is here, ready for
the process of the courts, the police
and Prosecuting Attorney A. P. Leach
have commenced to get their evidence
in shape. They have a mass of cir
.cumstances which they are very hope
ful can be worked into a perfectly
linked chain of proof to convict
Much of the case rests upon Kiniry's
admissions, 'coupled with Policeman
Smith's dying statements. One im
portant item is the possession by the
police of two bicycles, which they ex
pect to prove were purchased by

The -trite statement- that "there is nothing
new under. the- sun" lacks merit in these pro
gressive 1 days, .for" every once In a while some
Oakland hostess surprises hÂ«r friends with some
new "stunt." Mrs. AV. A. Schrock may al

and, the members of a little card club, whom
she 'entertained yesterday, will - remember thÂ«
occasion as a "red-letter day."
â¢ Promptly* at '11:30 o'clock the invited ones
assembled at a â  fashionable downtown â¢ res
taurant in â¢ Ban â  Francisco, where they enjoyed
a delicious breakfast, while feasting ' the ear
with music . and the eye with the violets . that
adorned the table. Each lady â sixteen sat at
the tableâ carried away a large corsage bou
quet of the fragrant blossoms. \ \ ,-â¢-
â  At the conclusion of the breakfast the - party
boarded the waiting '^Iermosa.7 : the street
railway . company's luxurious private car, and
then away,* they ''sped .'over a devious and In
teresting route to the Cliff House.f&gg&KHC}
Mrs. Schrock must have had a very per
suasive heart-to-heart talk with the weather
clerk, for the day was . perfect. Not even a
faint breeze : ruffled the . sluggish waves and
the glorious sunshine spread a golden : warmth
over earth and sea. ' The car party remained
at the seaside resort for almost an hour, dur
ing which the hostess had "tin -types" taken
of the merry group, presenting one to each
lady as a souvenir of the occaslOR.-*HHSMBK
During the ride to the Cliff House several
games of > "500" ' were played ' and the - prize, a
dainty ; little . cloth-bound telephone memoranda
book, was won by Mrs. R. C. Craft.

at the ferry and returned to Oakland, after

her.' â¢ *
There, was a painful scene in court
during the rendering of the decision
by Judge Ogden,' Van Horn and his
wife were both there and heard the
words by which both were condemned.
Van Horn, according to the opinion of
the Judge, had not been the sympa
thetic husband of his wife that, he
should have been. She, Judge' Ogden
believed, had- been- led away by the
sympathy and blandishments of
Knopf, who came in for a grilling at
the hands of the Judge for having
stayed in the house when Van Horn
had protested 'against his being there.
There are two children, a boy. and
a girl. â¢ Marion, the girl, was given
into the" custody of the mother,' while
â¢the boy, Willis, was given to the
father. . Mrs. Van Horn was given the
household furniture at her home at
22 2 2. Bancroft way, and Van Horn was
also mad.e to pay nearly $400 in coun
sel fees and costs for his wife's attor
neys, besides thfe fees of his own at
torneys, James A. Johnson and George

HUSBAND FILES
DIVORCE SUIT
Lays Claim to Fortune Left
l>y AVife Who Had Sought
Separation From Spouse
Special Dispatch to" The CalL
â¢SAX BERNARDINO, Xov. SO.â One
of the most sensational divorce suits
ever filed in this county, both by rea-
I son of the prominence of the partjes
j interested and the facts In the case,
j has just been changed by the death of
the petitioner, Mrs. May Florence
! Johns Dewey, into a bitter will con-
J test, involving about $200,000. "
Addison Chester â¢ Dewey - l Â»^l Miss
Johns were married in Los A.n&eles six
years ago and took up their residence
at Upland, in this county. At about
the time of the marriage,. H. Robert
son, who claimed to have adopted Mrs.
Dewey as his daughter, presented her
with $35,000, but this did not become
known to the husband for some time.-
About two years later Robertson, who
was then 70 years of age, went to live
with the Deweys. The. husband ob
jected in vain .and quarreling began.
Last July Mr. and Mrs. Dewey agreed
to separate. He rented her the house
they had occupied in common and built
for himself another immediately at the
rear. This proved unsatisfactory to the
wife and she filed suit for divorce on
the 17th instant.
Last Tuesday was the last day on
which Dewey might have filed an an
swer, but the news of the wife's death
came before it could be learned whether
he meant to default. ;
Robertson, the cause of the estrange
! ment, <Jied in June of last year, but the
': sisters of the dead woman had been
I with her, Dewey claims, during the
I preceding month of May and kept alive
her resolution to apply for a divorce.
Y."hen the complaint' was filed it
charged that Dewey had threatened to
shoot his wife. . â¢
The petition for probate filed this
forenoon by Mrs. Gertrude Johns Har
kinson, Mrs. Dewey's sister, before the
funeral of Mrs. Dewey, sets forth that
the sisters and brothers of the decedent
are made sole devisees by a will which
was executed in May last, the Umo
Dewey gives as the period of the visit
by the sisters. Dewey was in this city
to-day and the forenoon had not passed
before an atto'rney had taken the" pre
liminary steps to contest the will,
which' cuts off the husband.
Among the sisters mentioned in the
petition are Eddie Eleanor Johns and
Mattte Johns of San Francisco. The? re
mainder bf the family are living in
Powellton and Napa. ]

MINES NEEDED
FOR HARBORS
General Story Points . Out
That Coast Defenses Lack
in Important Particular
ALSO SHORT IX MEN
Annual Eeport Indicates tlie
Changes Which Must Be
Made in Service at Once
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30. â Brigadier
General Story, chief of artilllery, U.
jS. A., in his annual report to General
i Chaff ee, {he chief of staff, â¢dwells
! upon- what he regards as the most
i urgent demands of the coast defenses.
(He says that the best and most econ
| omical use of the entire armament for
i tne coast requires one complete relief
i to man each and every element of de
! fevise. He adds:
: "It is inconceivable that Congress.
; after appropriating millions for na
| tional defense, would be^ willing, if its
i attention were drawn to the fact, to
i leave this defense Ineffective for want
I of a proper organization to ma.n and
! conduct it." - Cv'
j He says that if torpedoes are co
; operated with proper armament, as at
j Port_ Arthur and Vladivostok, it is not
j probable that' any enemy, however en
i terprising, would attemjjt to force the
j line of defense.
| "To secure at the present time." he
continues, "the greatest measure of
j national safety at the least the
i entire torpedo Â«\efe"nse of our. harbors
should be at oncÂ«! made "complete, and
it would be. criminal neglect if I did
not urge as earnestly" as I can the im
mediate completion of the torpedo de
fense of all our fortified ports. To-*
day this defense is lamentably de
ficient, both in material and person
nel^
"If we were suddenly confronted by
war no amount of money* could pro
cure submarine mines in time to be bf
strvlce for our harbor defense."
The Teport further says that even
with complete material for torpedo j
1 defense it is -practically valueless with- j
! out a trained personnel, carefully in-"
; structed .in its operation, and that to- j
day we are substantially without such'i
a force. . Only 400 men can be" as- j
signed, he says, for a service requiring
about 5000. :.*-":
The report adds: '
"It would be impossible if Â«we have
our position-finding equipment com
pletely installed for hostile vessels to
remain 10,000 or 12,000 meters from
our* batteries of twelve-Inch guns or
mortars for two or three hours and
not be destroyed. I regret, however,
to. have to say that even at this' day
most of our fortified harbors are not
better supplied with a position-finding
equipment than apparently is Port
Arthur.

Resolutions were adopted as follows: j
â¢Whereas, The limitation " which * the trades :
unions set upon tfcÂ« number of apprentices In â 
any thop Is largely responsible for the dis- i
appearance ol skilled labor, is HestrucUve of
the Industry and is one of the greatest dis
turbing factors in thÂ« Industrial development
of the country. In that it limits the- right of.
the individual to learn a trade; and.
Whersa?.. The effort made by the employer
to increase the number of apprentices In a
trade is necessarily hampered bv tne above ;
limitations; therefore, be it â 
Resolved That the Citizens' Industrial As- 1

danrerous. . " .
TELLS OF SAX" FRA>*CISCO. !
James A. Emory, counsel of the Cit-'
izens* Alliance of San. Francisco, told
of the system of organization on' the
Pacific Coast. He said that In San
j Francisco labor was so well organized
| that it â¢ had unions of chicken-pick- j
era. ten-pin men and the sandwich, or
banner carriers. He continued:
These were the conditions . we had to meet '
when the Citizens' Alliance was formed", and
then we realized that what we wanted was i
cne single unifying principle to .bring the peo
ple together. ThÂ« political situation was such
that at first the police would not enforce thÂ«
law or protect willing workers. Then we
supplied -these men with guns and told them
to protect themselves. We are nÂ«jt barbarians, I
but we have barbarians- in* our midst and we j
will not stop until they are suppressed. We I
stand for no class or clique, but united we '
drove the political representatives of the
rioters from power and in their place e^cted
men .who will enforce thÂ« law.

OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
TX'all of our doriiestic industries \yc pay.the hi^h^st wages in the
I world.: -The -5tah'dardof : life rises to the wage.s; and consuming
â¢ power. mc.ets the increased cost of production, artd we flourish and
prosper. .The case is different, however, when the same high wages
are carried into the operation of deep water shipping. There .we
meet the competition of the low wage nations", and have long been
practically driven off the sea. . As our ships are built by our own
high wage labor we' have a- higher first cost of -ships., higher rates
6(- interest during construction, higher rates of underwriting and
repairs; Higher" wages and cost of feeding crews, and are thereby so
handipapped that we cannot compete for deep water- carrying. It
is this condition that appeals- to Congress for ihelp to re-establish
our merchant marine. Just how this is to be done no one has yet
iouiid -biit. ixvct-Iight on the subject is expected from the report of
the- Congressional Commission, of -\yhich Senator Gallinger is ch'air
mair... '.'. . â .' :..-;: .'y â¢ .â¢ .
./Shippers, seelc the "cheapest m'.eans. Even 'the Government as a
shipper does this. The' first- contract for carrying Pacific Coast lum
â¢ber for use -on the Panama" canal went to a .German line, because it
could jjfforcl to do it cheaper thari aify American ship.' To show
how the cost of a crew alone figures in this competition between
ships' that'pay port wages .and salaries in San Francisco,
Â»r.(i"d<\bn;isi0e?s along the Central and South" American coast, we
have the-.. figures -.pn* two steamers of the" same class and tonnage, c6m
petmg. for the. isame trade. One of these,, a.' British .steamer,.'has a
payrofi tyi.'/ofhccrs and.cre.w of $i8,oop ..per. annum; the other, an
â¢Arherican s.te?tmeT, has a payroll of $36,cxx) per annum',, a loss for
operating, under the American flag, of $i8,ooO perannuhi on that
"single- itemi . A "comparison of two. steamers in the same trade of a
Higher- -tonhage and class shows' a loss"" in the item of salaries and
;'<vajres;tp the American slu'p of $26,175 44 .per Jiriniim. In still an
atTierclasv;, a\] of these being in the Central and South .American
tradeV the loss; to the American steamer is'$i5,cxx> per- annum." .
:â :â¢ -The fibres' prove: that every .American "ship owiied i"n our Pa
cific /.ports â¢. makes on the one item of wages and salaries an annual
Josh. Going into comparisons still further, on the. foreign.. lines in
this Pacific "Coast trade, on. the American, ships- the. first. assistant
engineer. get : < : $90 per month, on the foreign ship. $50'; the second
assistant on .the American ship gets $80. per month; .pn. the foreign
:ship. $37 50:. . The American ship' is. compelled by law to. .carry a
third assistant engineer at $70 per month'; the foreign ship carries
none:;. On ithese same ships the-. American chief- engineer gets $150,
the. foreign: $82. 50; the American captiiin gets per month, the
foreign- captain $125. .The 'same disparity- extends" to the' seamen's
.wages-^the American, sliip paying port- wages and the foreign ship
paying the lower-foreign rate. â¢ ." : : '.";-- ''â ."â  'â  â¢'â 
-. .. In the trans- Pacific trade, Arnericari ships' compete with " ttie
â¢British .lines, running to Vancouver and with the Japanese lines
'running to our American . ports. â¢ The American ship pa'y.s San
Fraaci^co port wages. ' If the law: compel what is called "American
crews" to -b.e carried on Pacific liners, the loss per each ship of 5006
rtcms.'.-un-der the American '.flag, as compared with a foreign ship of
.the 1 - same class, is $42,743 .76 per annum." It' goes', without saying"
that no : business can survive that loss, especially: when the greater
first cost! repairs and underwriting. are added to "it.
- -. These comparisons reveal the :. reason why American ships are
out of busiiness. and why. bur flag is not seen on merchant ships in
the .^seaports, of the world. The situation is understood by all
shipping fhen.- There is no difference of opinion about the cause
tof the decline of o American shipping. It .is inextricably connected
with the American standard of life, which nothing can affect at home,
.But which is* a handicap when carried into shipping conditions on
the high' seas. â¢ No interest; is "great enough to have the right to
lbwer-ihat standard for its awn. benefit. It must be. maintained, but
thje- pin)blem is how. to â¢ maintain' it on deep water and still "com
pet^-on nearly equal terms for the .'ocean carrying trade. The
principle â  of protection must t>e applied . somehow. The matter
[has beÂ«n debated, in Congress* both dogmatically and academically,
and. but tittle light" has teen cast upon it thereby. .. For this reason
the\ forthcoming report of Senator Gallinger-s commission is looked
ior with' 1 the- "liveliest' interest'. â¢' .. â  :. ; â¢ . . . ;: ".

THE MINERS ARE COMING.
THE California â¢-. Miners'' Association meets on the 5th and- will
hold. its. sessions in the. assembly, room o.f the St.- Francis. Hotel.
The meeting- -tvill be" very. important.. There are uneasy signs of
.rising, wrath between the mitrers and the \a4Jey- people.. It is asv
sert.ed that the dredge mining oh : the river 'benches' violates Judge
Sawyer's injunction .against-, hydraulic ..mining; and .already the
slogan is ; sounded along, the ".valley to this i effect 1 : J ;All mining looks,
alike to us. valley people.^'.- â  -. : â¢ "';â¢â¢â¢' â¢':''.'â ; -. â¢ â  .
Conflict should be avoided if science arid p.itience can avert it.
,It is probable that the money, expended yeafs ago in- litigation over
this subject .would have paid for engineering methods to permit
mining to go on to. the benefit and not the injury of the valleys.
That it was mjurious. is judicially decided and settled, as. far .iÂ»
hydraulic mining is concerned. If all mining is considered by the
valley people to be the same., there, is danger of a serious 'clash that
will be costly and the result doubtful. :- ;' .7 â¢;
Among, the miners and the farmers, there are many very able
men, leading citizens, who desire the good of the State. Let the
voice of such.be heard in. the meetings next week, .and let the ut
terance of mere prejudice and passion be suppressed. The valley
people are- asking much public help', to keep .the floods off fheir
lands and maintain the navigability of their rivers." Any unneces
sary contention will raise up enemies to these plans and start a war
.that wili injure all and benefit none.

young fellow, with that basket. It's
full of home cookies and preserves for
my boy, John Pierce. Is he here?"
Eve turned and watched her. John
Pierce her son! So this was the little
mother he had told her ofâ the mother
who had effaced herse.lf that her son
might have his wish!
After, dinner Eve sat on the porch
alone. 'Soon she became conscious of
a couple pausing near. With a throb
bing heart she recognized Pierce's
voice. *
"Hilda," he was saying, "surely I
misunderstand you! You are angryâ "
"Angry. Indeed!" The answering
voice â¢ waa well modulated, but there
was a hardness that robbed it of pleas-
Ing. "I persuaded mother to_come here
in order to be with you. I sacrificed a
week and Newport,, and for what? To
be shamed by *hat woman "
"Hilda!"" Pierce's voice rang with a
new quality that compelled Miss
Chauncey to pause. Eve longed to slip
away, but it .was impossible without
disclosing her presence. Besides, .'the
others Would no doubt resume their
walk. Pierce continued: pfpM
"When you wrote me of your coming
I did not expect my mother. Her ap
pearance was a surprise. I've tried at
times to persuade her to visit me, but
hitherto she has seemed rooted to the
bo 11. Now that she is here I purpose
giving : her the holiday of her life."
"What. about me?"
"You? Dear girl, when you know my
mother you -will forget her rough man
ner as y^u forgave mine, and' remem
ber only her true heart. I made no se
cret of my life or antecedents. I told
you all. Be kind! She will not trouble
you often. It Is the first time In thirty*
years that she has left the farm. But
on such occasions my wife must re
member that she is my mother."

"Let us end this unworthy discussion!
I offer you the service and devotion of

of my wife?"

Columbus, Ohio, May 19, X903. â¢
Some four years ago I vvas suffering
from impure' "blood and a gcaenrl run-
down ccuditiori of the system. I had no
eppetitie, Tjas losing flesh, and had an all-
gone tired feeling that made me xnlsera*
ble. I began the use of S . S, S., and
after taking seven or eight bottles znyskia
was clcaredof all eruptions and took on a
ruddy, healthy glow that assured me that
my blood had been restored to its norÂ«
mal, healthy condition. My appetite was
restored, as I could eat anything put beÂ«
fore me, and as I regained my appetite
I increased in weight, and that 4 'tirea feel-
ing" which worried me' so much disap-
peared, and I vras once again my old sell.
I heartily recommend S. S. S. as the
best blood purifier and tonic made, and
strongly advis:: its use to all those in need
of such medicine. Victor Stubbies.
Cor. Barthman and Washington Aves.
Wheeling, W. V., May 28, 1903.
My-system was run down and my joints
ached and pained me considerably. I had
used S. S. S. before and knew what it
was, so I purchased a bottle of it and have
taken several bottles aad the aches and
pains are gone, my blood has been cleas-
ed and mv general health built up. I can
testify to ifcas a blood purifier and tonic.'

Harrison's circular says: .Since the steam
ship Sierra .left there have been eight arrivals
of Australian Coal from Newcastle, namely:.
Notre Dam: d'Arvor. -3000 tons; Marguerite
Dollfus, 2560 tons; Ardencraig, 3150 .tons;
Marechal de Vlllars 2950 tons; Rene, 2990
tons; Belford. 3030 tons; William Nottingham.
1341 tons; Max, 250O tons; total. 21.611 tons.
It is evident that colonial Coal Is being de
livered here more generously than our imme
diate requirements call for. as some ships ar
riving here early last month have not yet -been
ordered to a discharging wharf.' The loading
list at Newcastle now numbers only thirteen,
with a carrying capacity of about 32,000 tons;
this is the grualtefet amount at any iln-.*- t.-.n
year. With the coal freights at present ruling'
rates <li.6s to 15s per ton) there will be very
few new names to be added to the chartered .
list for some time, hence our Coal orders wilt
be filled from our coast collieries. Owing to
the. absence of stormy weather Â»o far. this rea
son the demand for domestic .fuel .has been ex-.
ceptionally light. Oil producers are endeavor
ing combtnedly to increase the value of tlrelc"
output, and they feel â¢ assured they will t*Â»
successful. Any advances in fuel oil 'will prove
of advantage to stcaiti coals; the market .for
foreign Coals here at present is well sustained,
but the sales are. lighter th*n : usual at this
season.' The best evidence that thfs port ts
not a seductive one for sailing vessels to seek
Is the departure from h<re of a number of
carriers to the colonies for orders "In ballast.'
being unable to find any profitable business
here." â¢ - ...

.tering voice betrayed tears behind. his
spectacles.
"I .can't Help worshiping her," . he
murmured. "Earnestly have I tried
to thrust Her from my mind, but each
