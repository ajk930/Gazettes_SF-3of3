SITUATION
IN CUBA IS
NOW GRAVE
United States May
Be Forced to
Intervene.
Officials in Washington
Are Disturbed by
Late Reports.
Trouble in Republic Is Said
to Be Due to Political
Firebrands.
Special I>i?f>*ich' to Ti)Â« CÂ«IL
\\".VSHl.'vuTOi\*, Sept. T7. â Consider
able uneasiness is ninifested in of
ficial circles regarding the in
Cuba. Confidential advices received in
dicate that. a. number of political fire
brands.' faqve determined to make
trouble for tho Cuban Government and
force. the United States to intervene in
the interests of life, liberty and prop
erty.
Consul General Steinhart, with head
qua j-te'rs at Havana, to-day had a con
ference with Acting Secretary of State
lx>omis. He Informed Loomis that con
ditions in Cuba were much quieter than
h lew days ago, when there was riot
ing in Cienfu<*gos, where. a- Congress
man and the Chief of Police were
killed. Notwithstanding these encour
aging reports it has also come to the
notice of this Government that affairs
In Cuba are far from satisfactory and it
is declared that the trouble will assume
eueh proportions shortly that this Gov
ernment may be .forced to take some
steps to pacify the Island.' -
One of the difficulties with the Island
republic, according to these reports, is
that it is. too prosperous and that the
JIa.OOO.'OOO surplus in the Cuban treas
ury has excited the cupidity of some of
the patriots, including General Gomez.
GOMEZ WITHDRAWS.
Deltne* to Hun for tbe Presidency of
Cuba.
HAVANA, Sept. 57. â Jose Miguel
Gomez, Governor of the province of
Santa Clara, who was nominated by
the Liberals for the Presidency, has
resigned his candidacy. In letters to
the executive committee of his party
he gives his reasons for his action,
laying part of the blame on the United
States owing to the Platt amendment.
(Jomez says:
. "It Is impossible to continue the cam
paign within the bounds of the law. The
Government has won \ complete and
overwhelming victory. With Liberals in
3ailn and with rifles of armed forces and
even with the daggers of hired assassins
against unarmed voters, the problem con
fronting me is whether I should continue
to lead my followers to the polls and per
mit them to become the victims of this
sort of treatment. One other road is
open, that followed by other nations in
analogous circumstances, namely, the
right of revolution; but Cuba stands in
a peculiar position, as an armed conflict
would inevitably bring foreign interven
tion. â¢ '
"Before this was accomplished, how
ever, our material prosperity would run
grave danger and property which Is to
a great extent in foreign hands wotild
be destroyed, while the neutral de
ments would suffer. Therefore I, who
had the courageHo rebel 'against Spain,
â¢which was 1000 times stronger than
Palma's Government, decline to accept
the responsibility of plunging the coun
try into war." 3BHSE

LONDON. Sept. 27.â 1t is stated that a
flying force left Pretoria on September
â¢2C for the border of Basutoland. Since
the death of Lerothodl, the paramount
thief, and the report of the last German
defeat" in southwest Africa, the Basutos
have been restles? and a warlike feeling
has been simmering," ready. to;burst out
at any moment. Young chiefs are tra
versing the ccuutry stirring -up a sort
of holy war -that Is aimed -more at the
Boers than the British.
It is alleged that. the British residents
at Masaru have urgently anpealed to the
High Commissioner to arm the "farmers

PACIFIC GROVE, Sept. 27.â Shortly be
fore 8 o'clock to-night the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company's 'freight' steamship
Gipsy went on . the 2 . rocks off McAbees
Beach, a/mile and a half from this city,
and is a total. wreck. .The Gipsy was on
its regular, weekly trip between : San
Francisco and Port Harford and was
heavily laden" with grain and other
freight. Captain Boyd was in charge.
The boat was due at 6 o'clock,' but it
was 7:30 when Chief Wharflnger 'Norton,
in charge of the Paeiiie Coast' Steamship
Company's . wharf at Monterey, sighted
the boat, coming in. - When the Gipsy,
cameÂ« within aquarter of a mile of the
wharf 'she appeared to turn and go beach
ward. She* drifted â¢ outward and shore
ward,, finally landing -on the ledge of
rocks immediately In front of- McAbees
Beach at a point half-way : between Pa
cific Grove and Monterey. The distress
whistles were immediately sounded. The
life-saving crew from- 1 McAbees -Beach,
headed by J. B. McAbee, immediately
launched a boat and rescued the crew
of the freighter. ; â¢.;**,*;*:
Five minutes after striking the engine
room was flooded with water and the
boat began -beating on -the- rocks-and
tearing to pieces. In thirty minutes' time
the 'beach was strewn with broken tim
bers and sacks of grain.
Captain Boyd could give no ; clear ex
planation as to the cause-of the disaster.
He was promoted about two -weeks ago
and this was his maiden v voyage. "He
claims the red lights displayed as danger
s'gnals off the beach of New Monterey,
where a sewer is being constructed, con
fused him, and he thought he was enter
ing port when he went aground;
The Gipsy was the oldest boat â¢In use
by the Pacific Coast Steamship Company
and has been in - a frightful condition
for years. The loss is estimated at
522,500, cargo $10,000 and ship $12,500. c^-';

Official Believes tlie Chinese
Boycott Is' Dying Out
- . Secretary, of War Taft prepared a long interview before ., the Ko
rea arrived in Sail -Francisco, in which he told bf the- trip of the party
and the many pleasant'receptions which were accorded the members ii\ "
the Orient.. Thelfarewell at Tokio was a. grand affair. The Japanese evi
denced the best of good feeling- toward the Americans and plainly
showed their, friendship. At Manila the reception was equally demon
strative,, the natives turning out in great crowds.
Secretary Taft said -his impression is that the boycott of American
goods by: China will soon^die out because the Chinese merchant must of
necessity purchase goods of the American agent. <TThc interview is as
follows:
V. Reports, cqming\ from the Philippine
Is&tids to-rindlcate that it

Philippine Government. : The .Philippine
Government.w as poor, and; was unable
to do more than arrange l for the pas
sage money, of -the -Congressman who
would form \ part of j the' party.. g This
did 'riot' include the sleeping car accom
modations or the meals. along the way,
and indeed left the Congressmen to de
fray from- their, own pockets by far the
larger part 'Of the actual traveling ex
penses. -The party as organized con
sisted of \u25a0 twenty-three Representatives
and seven Senators.- Of these, thirteen
were- accompanied 1 by- their wives. -~ln

XETVHOTEL FOIV MANILA.
'.'Proceeding on "the Manchuria to
Manila we enjoyed a four days' rest. Wa
landed in Manila on Saturday, the sth
of -August. The" whole party, was taken
care of by private houses, as there wera
no hotels suitable. This is one trouble
in Manila, but the . commission, through
the municipal council, is taking' steps lo
secure the necessary capital for. the erec
tion of a great hotel upon "the^ Luneta.

'"Most elaborate preparations had beta
made for our reception in Manila, but we
arrived one day ahead' of time. Accord
ingly, all \ of the reception except the flo
tilla of boats, which met us In the harbor,
was postponed until* Monday morning,
when we were given an opportunity to
see in the procession the progress which
had oten made in the civil government
and in the business of the Islands. The
procession was certainly most instructive,
and worthy the character of a municipal
organization of Manila. The importance
of the school organization, the fire depart
ment of Manila, showed that the city
was now under American management,
an excellent up-to-date city. It is stilt
lacking in adequate water supply . and in
a proper hygienic sewer system, but au
thority has been given by Congress to
construct both. Plans l have been mails
and approved, under the direction of Des
mond Fitzgerald, the famous municipal
engineer of -Boston," for adding to the
water supply from a very pure source In
tho mountains, . and for constructing a
sewer which will carry off the sewase
from Manila.. ln a way to avoid injury to
the health of inhabitants. Manila is so
low, being only about seven or eight . feet
above the sea level at any point, that it
is necessary to run the sewage into
reservoirs and pump it out to sea.

ma rurally, subjects the. Government to
criticism, because an alien Government
Is much more likely to be criticised for

Govern ment.
"Some of the younger men of education
had been advocating immediate- inde
pendence.: It therefore became necessary
to state with considerable emphasis the
policy of the administration upon this
subject.- and to say that In' the opinion
of the administration there was no pos
sible hope for independence short of a
generation, because the people could not
be fitted for self -government in that time
Indeed, it would probably take a much
longer period.
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN*.
"The party consisted, as is known, of
Democratic "as 'well as Republican Sen
ators and Congressmen, and they In their
views represented all side's of the Philip
pine questions, but with a self-restraint
and moderation, which cannot be too
highly commended it was tacitly agreed
between the members of the Congression
al party on both sides that it would be
meet unwise for them to discuss before
the Filipinos their differences of opinion,
and. therefore, that any statement should
be- made by the representative of the ad
ministration as to the policy of the pres
ent administration. Hence the sight which
some of the Irreconcilable Filipinos hoped
for. to wit. a constant combat between
the Republican and Democratic members,
with the Filipino people as an audience,
was not presented, and I cannot express
too emphatically my appreciation of the
patriotic stand which our Democratic
brethren took In this matter 'in remitting
a discussion of differences of opinion to
the proper Representatives in Congress.

MAKE TOUR OF ISLANDS.
"After a week's festivities In Manila
the party proceeded on the transport Lo
gan >on a tour among the islands. It
visited first Iloilo, then Zamboanga, then
Jolo. then Malabang, Mindanao, where
the Congressmen left the | Logan, and,
taking Doherty wagons and horses, drove
on the road from Malabang .to ; Camp
Vickers, located on the south side of Lake
Lanao. thence across the lake to Mara
hue or Camp Keiihley, and from there
proceeded to Camp Overton. on the north
side of Mindanao, where the Logan came
and took aboard the party. This .trip
across a part of Mindanao was made for
the purpose of considering the ' question
of the construction of a railroad from
Camp' Overton to Marahue, or Kelthley,
in accordance with the recommendations
oi Generals Corbin and Wood.' From
Overton the party proceeded to Cebu,
where they were handsomely entertained,
ac they had been at Iloilo, by the Fili
pino people at a banquet- Then we went
to Tacloban by way of the straits ly
ing t>etween the island of Samar and the
Island of Leite.
"In Manila. Iloilo and Cebu were heard
complaints of the failure of the crops
and of the stringency of the times. At
Tacloban, on Leite, one of the hemp prov
inces, and again at IxgasU, the chief city
of Albay, the greatest of the hemp
provinces, and at Sorsogon, the capital
of Sorogan. another hemp province, we
found the people very happy and a con
dition of prosperity prevailing, due to the
profitable production of hemp. From Sor
scgon we returned to Manila... r .> ,'/
BOYCOTT WILL SOOX DIE.
"The visit to the islands was made in
August, which Is in the middle of thewet
season,' and yet it is pleasant to remark
that not a single plan or entertainment
of the delegation had been interfered
with by rain. It was hot in Japan. It
was not quite so hot in Manila and the
Philippine Islands. It was very hot in
Shanghai and In Yokohama until ; the
day we' sailed for home.
"Returning to* Manila, the delegation
resumed Its investigations and the con
sideration of complaints, while I -was oc
cupied with conferences- with Governor
General Wright, the various members of
the commission, prominent Filipinos and
others upon questions of governmental
practice and policy. From Manila we
went to Hongkong in the transport Lo
pan." There I received a telegram from
the President requesting, that I visit Can
ton and confer with the Viceroy on the
subject of the boycott then supposed [to
be in force. Tht Viceroy was seriously

party to a luncheon with the provincial,

and more in the Government; : Filipinos
are being introduced very rapidly, to take
the place of Americans, and on the whole,
in looking back over two years, decided
steps forward have been taken. '
"Of the questions which were opened,
when-we started on this trip, and. in the
settlement- of which it was hoped the trip
might lend aid, one was the establish*
ment of a special tribunal for the hearing
of disputed questions in connection , with
churches and rectories and cemeteries. I.
am glad to say that before we > reached
the islands a satisfactory law had: been
enacted which It is hoped will rapidly dis
pose of these cases. The law .refers the
issues directly to the Supreme Court. ,

"There- was also remaining unsettled a
question about- the title to one-half of the

the Dominican order. After a conference
with the representatives . of the venders,
a satisfactory compromise was effected by
which good title to the lands will be im
mediately conveyed to the Government,
and possession given, so far as that pos
session is in the venders, and the differ
ence as to price, a matter of some $200,000,
will be left to adjustment by arbitration..
"The. question of the operation of the
Internal revenue law is one which is'
still under consideration. The princi
ple of the law. in taxing, tobacco and
alcoholic liquors is, of course, to be
maintained, -but the question whether
the provisions of the law are' not too
inquisitorial with respect to other'mat
ters and whether the itax is not too
high at present is one which. requires
some study before it can be decided.)

from* "Ohio. "There are wonderful
things to' be done with this: produot
In the Philippines during the next few'
years. Hemp is a\ natural monopoly
In general, but here I saw great fields
of it. Many acres of this green product
waved sturdllv in the soft breezes, and
ttiei'vigorous growth I saw there prom

growth jOf hemp and the ollmate Is
especially propitious for Its cultiva

ods; I look for this to become the most

"There is, of course, plenty of rice

so surprised . at this because I had
heard of the wealth of these products'
before I entered Manila. These, too,
have a great future. There Is plenty
of room for advanced methods; much ia
wasted now that will in the future be
saved and the output of rice' and to

Yet I do not believe that these products
will be shipped. to the United States

are the natural ports for the Philip

Congressman Cooper .of Wisconsin;
chairman of the House committee on
insular affairs, said: \
"One effect of the trip will be, In large
measure, to take the 'question' of Imme
diate Philippine independence out'of poli
tics. Personal study of the situation has,
I think, convinced the members of our
party, . Democrats - v and \u25a0> Republcans, - that
the inhabitants of; the. Philippine Islands
are not now capable of free . self-govern
ment This conclusion is admitted \u25a0to[ be
true by educated, . conservative Filipinos
themselves, though they, like -a majority
of the other people of ,the | Islands, hope
for an Independent government- when "the

ister.; of Foreign Affairs of Norway, " to
day, gave the Temps' Christiania corre
spondent an \u25a0 authorized statement. , He
said Norway would take steps to secure
an^early ' recognition by/ the ; Powers.
This recognition would cover Nor.way's
Independent sovereignty without refer
ence to the question of the 'Govern
ment's status as 'a monarchy or a re T
public, which would- be . subsequently
determined.." \u25a0; -;/'\u25a0'â¢..: ;
' Concerning the offer of the throne
to. Prince Charles of. Sweden, M, Loev
land aaids :
- "The - Storthing's offer, still operates
as it has not been formally and' of
ficially rejected. But Norway, will not
make a second offer, nor can:: we In
definitely wait for an answer from' King
Oscar. If we do hot receive a raanouse
very soon we, shall ; consider ourselves
relieved and /turn; elsewhere. Prince
Charles; of- Denmark /would then be
most . available through language and
nationality. 1 " - .-.\ â¢.\u25a0\u25a0-.: '-\u25a0 -* ": - ;
\u25a0 ."Prince Charles of Sweden would have
received an \u25a0 euthualastlc- welcome nad
he \u25a0 accepted . the throne. He would still
be welcome, but the people still' are no
longer enthusiastic."
Asked what form of government Nor
way would : adopt if the monarchy is
abandoned, ' Mr. Loe viand answered:
v,Â»VWe ..shall choose - between: -three
kinds of republics: First, a monarchical
republic, Mike France, where 'the Presi
dent ;is .virtually King, .with a /fixed
term; second, an absolute republic, like
that of the United States, of which the
President; is /autocratic in, power, and
third, a democratic republic like Switz
erland. -This -last satisfies us best and
we shall undoubtedly, adopt It." '' â¢\u25a0
CHRISTIANIA,', Norway. Sept. 27.â- A
resolution signed' by ten deputies' was
Introduced . In ; the' Storthing ' at to-day's
session, proposing firstly the summon
ing of a constituent Storthing before
the middle of November to decide on
the/future form of Norwegian govern
ment,: and, , secondly, that a final de
cision of the matter be postponed until
after the. elections of 1906. ,'
contentment reigns among the masses.
Japan has everything hopeful ahead of
her."
Thus, spoke Sereno E. Payne, member
of Congress from New /York, as he
stepped from the-.decksvof .the Korea
yesterday morning.' \u0084,'He -has Just re
turned/from the Oriental trip with the
â¢raft-party and ho spoke of the Japan
ese/ situation -with; great interest He
was in Japan -when 'the news of the
signing of the'peace terms reached
Toklo and he remained there until aft
er the disturbances had subsided.
v "Take for examp+p tfa,e tearing down

continued.' "in" the United" States reports
the affair was glveirthe'eolor 1 of>: a regu

one of the ; large theaters. /.For some
reason the speakers did not appear and
the crowd - became restless. Finally
those assembled started, to go and a
scramble for the doora ensued. In the
mix-up one/of the police booths,' a
small affair,: nothing like one of our
police stations, .was. overturned and
broken up in the . rush. That was the
extent of the greatest of the so-called
riots. The others I dl* not see, but I
do not think they \u25a0: were any more
serious than was- this -one' near the

"There are many people in Japan

RIOT REIGNS
IN BUDAPEST
Socialists and Adherents of
the Coalition Clash in
Streets and Many Are Hurt
POLICE QUELL FIGHTERS
Angry Feeling Pervades All
Classes and Situation Is
Steadily .Growing Worse
BUDAPEST, Sept. 27.â Between forty
and J fifty I persons were injured* in ' riots
here this evening when Socialists and the
adherents "of the .coalition parties, : In
cluding students, clashed opposite the
Royal;.Hptel, and j for two hours there
were, scenes of tremendous "excitement.
The â¢ Royal Hotel is j the headquarters jof
the Independence Club, in which is - thÂ«
council room of the coalition leaders.
The . students* and ather supporters of
the coalition" had arranged for a glgantlo
torchlight procession to-night, but dur
ing, the day the- Socialists issued : inflam
matory proclamations calling on all So
cialists and. others opposed -to the-coal
ition to gather and fight for their rights,
which they said the coalition was trying
to sidetrack under cover of an alleged
affront by the '.. King -Emperor -to: the
whole nation. Owing to these proclama
tions the coalition leaders decided to
postpone the torchlight procession, ieek
ing thus to avoid bloodshed. .
At 8 o'clock about 150 Socialists gathered
outside the Independence Club and an
nounced their Intention of entering and
tearing down the council room. A large
force of police was present and. was as
sisted by 150 prominent . citizens. . " :
POLICE DISPERSE MOB.
The mob. made an effort to enter, but
was vigorously ; opposed by the police.
A fight ensued, and amid the wildest
clamor a number of persons were stab
bed, but the Socialists were finally scat-:
tered. Fifteen' minutes' later, however,
the Socialists , again gathered. By this
time adherents of the coalition in large
numbers appeared .upon' the 'scene,- and
their appearance resulted in a free fight
between the "two factions. A dense mass"
of humanity surged In every direction,
shouting and singing the Marsellalse and
other songs. Knives, sticks and stones
were used vigorously. ' Meanwhile a
thunderstorm j came jup and vivid light
ning lit up the square while the thunder
added a note of terror. Rain fell in tor
rents and the combatants were finally
dispersed by the police.
It is reported that over forty persons
were wounded, eight of them seriously.
There were no deaths.
Scattered fights continued in different
quarters and a section of the Socialists
marched; to/a building; in which is pub
lished a newspaper, that supports the
coalition, where they broke the windows
and attempted to gain an entrance. The
mob was held back by the police while
the printers and .editors threw furniture
from the windows on the heads of the
crowd.'- â¢ Here, too, a number of persons
received . wounds. Finally quiet was re
stored and up to 10 o'clook there was no
renewal of the. disorders. ;--.-- -\u0084\u25a0\u25a0.-. â¢
It is not â¢ thoueht \u25a0 that the \ rioting of
to-night will have any effect on the gen
eral situation,:. which: certainly has grown
worse, while the feeifng throughout; Hun
gary ; against . the dynasty.: Is- Increasing.
Among Weil-informed \ persons It Is -. be
lieved .that better ;- counsel will- prevail
after the first flush of passion dies away.
>'O HARSH MEASURES.
It is said that the Emperor has issued
orders that in the event of disturbances
harsh ; measures must be avoided |if pos
sible, but no one knows what will happen
next. Revolutionary cries are frequently
heard In the: streets, and an. element of
the population Is endeavoring to stir up
the passions of the people. This effort,
however, is being discountenanced by the
coalition leaders and others.'
It is certain that Parliament will not
meet October 10 under the existing cir
cumstances, and it may - even be dis
solved. Among, the better classes it is
believed everything hinges on the mem
bers of the different j parties adhering to
the coalition. This meeting will take the
form.' of fa national conference and- it is
hoped that' demonstrations will be avoid
ed ) and that some, way out of the diffi
culty ' will^ be suggested.' . In the mean
while the crisis undoubtedly Is a serious
one. \u25a0 '\u25a0\u25a0:\u25a0 ;, - \u25a0 /\u25a0'! \u25a0 ''. '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0;,. :'.
The manifesto issued by, the coalition
committee contains, among ' other things,
a ' protest against the ... accusation , ? that
Hungary desires .to settle the 'common
affairs; of the empire without consulting
Austria, and, continues: ..
"Such arrogant Ideas can only be im
puted to Hungary by those , who: are
creating, an evil feeling against" Hungary
In Vienna. We "know, wÂ«H enough that
every provision of . th^e law we would
enact which may I require any co-opera
tion on the part of Austria can only be
come valid in practice i when Austria of
her own freewill creates a suitable law."
The manifesto in . conclusion says :
\u25a0 "We desire to conclude a just treaty
of commerce with "Austria on the basis
of an independent sphere for both parties.
The decision :as 'to a whether we shall es
tablish an Independent customs sphere . or
maintain a common fiscal system depends
on the free will of \ the Hungarian . Diet
Protests are - being ? made as If the de
cision of - fiscal matters . were dependent
on an j . understanding with '\u25a0 Austria."

Loairof $026,096 Made in
Name of One of the Clerks
. NEW.TORK, Sept. 27.â T0-day's ses
sion of. the legislative committee to in
vestigate insurance methods was given
over to the matter of syndicate trans
actions of the Equltablo'Life Assurance
Society. Henry R. Winthrop, assistant
secretary and financial manager of the
society, was again on the witness stand,
and many, of his stateÂ«>^nts were ac
companied by itypewritten -documents
giving the various transactions in de
tail.. It was brought out that In one
of these syndicates Senator Depew was
a participant to the extent of $100,000.
and; the Senator was requested to ap
pear before the committee. ,
Winthrop was unable jto find, where
a' record of the profits from a number
of the syndicate transactions was made,
and expert accountants now \u25a0 at work
on the tJooks of the society are ex
pected to unearth these later.
The witness detailed a number of
loans to the Equitable Trust and Mer
cantile Trust companies as well as the
sharing of these companies in . syndi
cate transactions with tha society.
Late in the day Henry Greaves, who
was a clerk for Georoge H. Squire, former
ly a member of the finance committee,
was called to supply some information
regarding the "George H. Squire Trus
tee" account, and from him it was
learned that there were a number of
these accounts. There was, beside the
"George H. Squire Trustee" account,
the "Marcellus Hartley Trustee" ac
count and another, the "J. W. Alexan
der Trustee" account. Greaves pro
duced the bank book of the Squire ac
count, and by means of It Attorney
Hughes tried to ytrace amounts that
would correspond , to profits' to, this ac
count; but the witness could not re
member the items of the amounts de
posited. Greaves was still on the
stand when the session adjourned for
the day. r ' ij/>" :
PROFITABLE SYNDICATE DEALS.
Greaves, however, gave way tem
porarily to Winthrop, while Attorney
Hughes queried further regarding syn
dicates. Winthrop was asked to fur
nish a list of the individual participants
in syndicates, and said that President
Morton was preparing such .a state
ment. Winthrop said he had no posi
tive information of the James H- v Hyde
and associates' syndicates, but he ex
pects -to have them . to-morrow. - Win
throp said 'on Baltimore, Washington
and Long Island fours, organized by
Kuhn, Loeb & Co., there were two pay
ments, one of j $500,000. the other of
$50,000. The company derived profits
of $5283 on the transaction, while J. "W.
Alexander, G. H/ Squire and "J. H. Hyde
divided profits on the $500,000. When
asked if the matter had been called
to the attention of these gentlemen,
Winthrop said:
"It will bÂ«: M - " " -
In. a syndicate* formed to: bold Illinois
Central Railroad bonds, which was. or
ganized by Kuhn, Loeb & Co., the Equit
able Society participated " to the ; extent
df $500,000 and actually paid :in $472,000.
The Equitable bought $1,000,000 worth of
bonds in -the open market at 94, though
the syndicate price was 88. and interest.
Winthrop- did not know whether . any
Equitable officers were. In that trans
action. - â'.â¢;'â¢;*;â¢
BOOKS ARE INCOMPLETE. â¢â¢-'*
During the questioning of Winthrop.lt
was brought out that the Equitable Trust
Company loaned the Equitable Life As
surance Society $626,096 in the name of
a . clerk, Eugene '-. Barrington. Witness
said- this loan did not appear on the books
of the Equitable Life.
In the Chicago and Northwestern syn
dicate-in which there < was a participa
tion of . the Equitable to the extent j of
$1;250,000,- Winthrop -. read a' letter 'from
Kuhn, Loeb & Co., in which that firm
said it had forwarded a check for $12,500
as profits. This check witness had failed
to find recorded on the books of the
Equitable. The .various syndicate trans
actions were inquired \u25a0 into by "Attorney
Hughes.-. After obtaining the figures in
the Japanese bond sales, Hughes asked:
"Did not the Equitable j Life become a
large purchaser of these bonds?"
"Yes, but we gave the â¢ profits of our
purchase tto the trust* company.", said
Winthrop.
Hughes stated that he intended to con
tinue the examination of Greaves and the
mysterious "George H. Squire Trustee"
account, jAs there are a number of en
tries yet to be considered in the new
account and as there is very little light
upon them at present, a good deal of time
will J probably be consumed in ' trying .to
find out their true meaning.

Fusion of Parties That Will Battle for
Reform Is Successfully Concluded;
Calm Deliberation Insures Freedom From
Error and Success at Election.
Two hundred and twenty-four dele
rates to the Republican municipal con
vention attended the majority caucus at
Pioneer Hall last night and without a
disserting voice adopted the report of
the joint conference committee on fusion.
In leeular convention at the Alhambra
Theater this evening the will of the ma
jority will be executed in the final rati
tication of the report. Ever eince'the first
ctep was taken in the movement to bring
about a. ecaliticn of all the forces of
gaod citizenship, irrespective of party af
liliaiion.-_;to redeem -San Francisco and
give her people local government of cred
itable character, the grafters, guided by
EtUffJ have interposed every obstacle to
*U-fÂ«2i fixulcn. \u25a0 When the true inside se
cret history of this campaign Js brought
to light, the fact will be disclosed that
vnrt sums, of money were offered by the
hoss agents of graft to tempt delegates
to vcte in the Republican convention
against the fu=*on resolutions. Of the
131 delegates elected to.' the convention
undtr the auspices of the San Francisco
Republican League only seven betrayed
the confidence of the people. The seven
miserable w^aklincE who abandoned the
post of duty under the fire of graft can
not be reinforced by other traitors. The
anti-Ruef column of the league is firm
and invincible, as to-night's proceedings
viH demonstrate.
EGGERS FOII TAX COLLECTOR.
The Republican convention this even
ing will nominate for Tax Collector Fred
Eggers; for Supervisors, Fred Bent, Jo
eeph S. Nyland, John A. McGee, I. Gold
man. Harry E. Leland. Fred H. Graham,
together with the twelve candidates for
the Board of Supervisors who were nom
inated by the Democratic convention last
Tuesday evening. Other Democratic
nominees as follow will be nominated by
the Republicans in regular convention to- !
night: Sheriff, Peter J. Curtis; District
Attorney, H. U. Brandenstein; Recorder,*
Edmund Godchaux; Pubilc Administra
tor, M. J. Hyncs; Coroner, T. W.B. Le
land and Police Judges, Charles T. Con- |
lan and A. J. Fritz. Caucus approval of
these nominations were given at Pioneer
Hall last night. The Democratic con
vention -In Lyric Hall this evening will
nominate for Mayor, John is. Partridge;
Auditor. Harry Bathr; Treasurer, John
E. llcl>cugald; City Attorney, Percy V. i
Long, Tax Collector, Fred Eggers; and i
the six Supervisorial nominees named by
the Republican majority caucus.
It is common gossip in political camps !
that the Ruef delegates in the Republican
convention will walk out to-night. The
eignal for the departure of the Ruefters
will be the announcement of the vofe
declaring the adoption of the report of
the conference committee on fusion.
No. one in the column of good citizen
ship cares a blank whether the Ruef
ters walk out or stay. In. The Ruef
delegates are now In the Schmitz camp
and have been there every minute
e'.nce the inception of the campaign.
I:uef expected to gain control of the
Republican convention and nominate
some weakling to oppose Schmitz. To
his utter surprise and chagrin the San
Francisco Republican League won out
at the primary and Ruef was tumbled
Into the political ditch. His remaining
political asset Is the Union . Labor con
vention. Tom Eagan is there, ready at
any hour to take the Ruef pro
gramme. Moreover, Eagan, being the
superior of Tom Kase and Countryman
In mental equipment and early political
training, can read a boss programme
blindfolded.
BE.VT WINS FIGHT. '
There were no surprises at the Re
publican majority caucus last night,
but there was some gratification when
H. T. Smith of the Grand Army began
his retrospective speech by reference
to events in 1861, rather than to Revo
lutionary record*. RO9Q|
'There was some comment when Fred
Bent was nominated for Supervisor. It
transpired that the liquor men of the
city made a strong and earnest demand
in Bent's favor.
John S. Partridge, the candidate for
Mayor, is' not only the choice of young
men, but the old boys are for him. Mr.
Dimond, who Is 109 years of age. called
at league headquarters yesterday and
announced his intention of actively
supporting the cause of good citizen
ship. Twenty years ago the newspa
pers made reference to the incident
that Mr. Dimond walked out to the new
City Hall to get himself registered. He
was then 89 years of age, and the. walk
was regarded as quite a Jaunt for a
man of his years. Yesterday he gave
Ms personal' recollections of New York
City 100 hundred years ago. He has
seen many sights in* the eighteenth
nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
but he never saw anything quite so
raw as Ruef s government of San
Francisco.; . \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0

will speak to the Democratic Convention
at Lyric Hall this evening.
CAUCUS CONVENES LATE.
It was long after" 9 o'clock when Chair
man Ryan called the caucus to order.
During the early hours of the evening
the various delegations stood in groups
on the floor of the hall and in the gal
lery engaged in contests over who should
represent them on the Board of Super
visors, or in selecting county committee
men to be reported to the convention this
evening. However, the chairman finally
called for order and the caucus immedi
ately got down to business, the calling of
the roll and the reading of the minutes
of the last caucus being dispensed with
that proceedings might be facilitated.
The report of the committee on order
of business was first called for and Dele
gate E. F. Treadwell of the Thirty-fifth
District, chairman of this committee,
stated that the committee recommended
that the caucus first hear the report of
the conference committee and that nom
inations be then proceeded with in the
following order: Tax Collector, six Super
visors, Sheriff, Recorder, Public Admin
istrator, Coroner, twelve Supervisors, in
accordance with the fusion agreement
with the Democratic convention, and
other officials in the order named Â»by the
Democratic convention. The report was
adopted without a dissenting voice and
David Rich, chairman of the conference
committee, moved that the report of the
committee be read by the secretary. It
was so ordered and Secretary C. C. Mor
ris acquainted the caucus with the
recommendations of the committee. The
report, as read by Secretary Morris, is
given above in full.
NOMINATIONS MADE.
Nominations were then declared In or
der and H. N. Beatty of the Thirty-sixth
named Fred Eggers ''for Tax Collector.
Eggers' name was greeted with cheers
and there .was a scurry among the dele
gates to second his nomination. After
all had been heard, a motion that nom
inations close prevailed and Secretary
Morris cast the ballot of the caucus for
the nominee. Eggers was present and.
though he was not called upon for a
speech, . the pressure of business inter
fering, he personally thanked the dele
gates for their support and was congratu
lated on all isides. â¢
Nominations for six Supervisors were
next called for. H. T. Smith named Fred
N. Bent for the office, referring to the
admirable record of the incumbent, his
remarks being enthusiastically applauded.
Hugh Duff of the Thirty-fourth named
Joseph S. Nyland, W. H. Esdor of the
Forty-second named John A. McGee,
Senator E. I. Wolfe named I. Goldman.
C. .B. Perkins of the Thirty-seventh
named Harry E. Leland and Carlton W.
Greene of the Forty-third named Fred
H. Graham. The several districts second
ed the nominations of the various candi
dates and it was then moved that nomina
tions close. The motion carried and the
secretary cast the, ballot of . the caucus
for the candidates and they were de
clared duly elected.
David Rich, chairman of the conference
commtftee, was next recognized by the
chairman, and after reading the nominees
of the Democratic Convention moved that
they be declared the nominees of the Re
publican Convention under the fusion"
agreement/These nominees are: District
Attorney, Henry U. Brandenstein: Sher
iff, Peter J. Curtis; Recorder, Edmond *J.
Godchaux;" Public* Administrator," M. j!

Marius, George B. McClellan, Henry
Payot, Oscar Hocks . arid Charles A.
Sweigert. Chairman Ryan , called ' for the
vote on Rich's motion. It carried, and
the fusion ticket. was complete.,
QUESTIONS OF LAW. â¢
Delegate Coughlin rose at '.this point
and moved . that the . conference committee
be Instructed to report . to ; the \ Republican
Convention this evening" in* favor of do-
THE" SAN FRAWCISGO .'CALL, THURSDAY.: SEPTEMBER : 28, 1905, .
daring the nominees of the Democratic
Convention the nominees of the Republi
can Convention at one and the same
time. He said that in his opinion such
procedure would prevent strife that was
sure to come from the opposition, and
that it would be far better to settle one'
fight at once than to cary on a dozen.
Treadwell, however, pointed out that
there were some nice questions of law
involved as to the legality of a blan.cet
nomination, and he suggested that the
question as to how the nominations of
the Democratic Con\-entlon should be rat
ified by the Republican Convention be left
to the conference committee to deter
mine. Coughlin then withdrew, his mo
tion, stating that he simply offered if as
a suggestion, and that if. there was any
question, as to the advisability of the pro
cedure he would rather it be settled in
open convention.
This concluded the deliberations of the
caucus and it adjourned to the call of the
chair. The Republican Convention will
meet to-night, however, at the. Alhambra
and the Democratic, Convention at Lyric
HalL ThÂ« last formalities will then be
dispensed with and the campaign for civ
ic honesty will be on. .
BYINGTON IS NON-COMMITTAL.
RcfuNea to Make Statement About His
Failure to Obtain Rrnominut ion.
The turning down of District At
torney Lewis F. Bylngton, who sought
renomination by; the Democratic Con
vention, has occasioned considerable com
ment, though the Democrats "generally
agree that Mr. Brandenstein will
prove as forceful , and emecient a suc
cessor. The failure of Byington toget
a renomination has given rise to many re
ports, among them being that he would
seek nomination from the Union Labor
party and another, that he would run
independently.
Mr. Byington was asked regarding 1
these reports, and he said: "I have no
statement to make at thip- time. I
have not given the matter; ahy serious
thought." Asked if he would positively
announce that he would â¢not ..be* a can
didate for re-election he refused. to an
swer the question, reiterating '. his de
termination not to make a statement
at this time.

FATE OF STUFFERS
ALARMS GANGSTERS
Bosses /Tools Must Answer for Crimes
Harry Douglas Glllbert, the colored
registration stuffer, and Paul McCarthy,
son- of the secretary of the Fire Com
mission and a Ruef gangster, were
arraigned before Judge Fritz yesterday.
Glllbert was charged with illegal reg
istration and McCarthy with violating
the election ordinance.
Arthur Mack, the Police Court at
torney c who gained notoriety in the
brothel cases, appeared as attorney for
Ruef's tools. McCarthy kept up a show
of bravado, but the negro was visibly
ill at ease, despite the assurance that
he will 'be protected.
Since the conviction of Wyman,
Steffens and Rebstock, Ruef's power to
take care of those who are willing to
commit crimes at the bidding: of the
gangsters is being: doubted. Even the
weakest minded tools of the curly boss
arc beginning to realize that he is not
omnipotent. >.
Judge Fritz will not let the prosecu-
"touting" people to register and vote for
Schm..z. Newberrj' says that " Carrol,
who was on duty in the Registrar's
ofllce, paced the halls with an eye for
Schmitz voters! In his pocket he car
ried 250 blang registration" slips." These
he/passed out whenhe thought he had
found .a recruit. Several of the blanks
found ; their way into Newberry's hands.
Oiher' policemen barred the doors and
allowed no one to enter Registrar Adams'
private Schmitz registration room, except
those \u25a0 who wore, Schmitz buttons. Al
though there was not the Jam of the
preceding night, still decent citizens who
refused , to adorn their persons with the
likeness of the -Mayor were compelled to
wait In line for two hours before they
could register.
\u25a0>J. George. Boyne has registered a num
ber'of Chinamen and hundreds of hop
heads. His assistant is "Hop" - Rus

Tibby Thornton, an ex-convlct from the
Twenty-eighth District, brazenly worked
throughoutthe night, rushing In Schmitz
voters. He . pranced up , and down the
hall pinning Schmitz butJor.s on every
one/ he met. , ; When Ta'man objected to
this foul-breathfd,,_ criminal-looking In
dividual.tampering with his. clothes, he
was r roundly cursed. Policemen were

Election CommiÃslonfr Thomas Magulre
assrrted his Imaginary authority < and
boldly threw ,from the City Hall a re
spectable v citizen who . refused to be
brushed out of , line by Ruers thugs. A

tion and the Ruef hireling slunk from the
place. .

CAUSES ARREST
OF LANDSBURG
Nathan Landsburgr, who carries on a
merchandise business in Calexlco, San
Diego County, was taken Into custody
In Los Angeles yesterday afternoon at
the instance of the Board of Trade of
San Francisco." Attorney Kirk of thÂ«
board said late last night that It had
been' looking for " Landsburg for a
month. The allegation brought against
Landsburg was that he procured goods
on false pretenses to quite a large
amount. Until Mr. Kirk knew that a
warrant had been procured for Lands
burg', he said, he would not disclose thÂ«
names of the complaining parties. . '
A dispatch was received late yester
day by the San Francisco Board of
Trade, in which news of Landsburg's
arrest "was contained. The greatest
possible secrecy concerning* the matter
was maintained in San Francisco and
also in Los Angeles. A special dis
patch to The Call from Los Angeles
mentioned that the reason of this se
crecy was the fear that a writ or
habeas corpus might be secured. The
Wholesalers' Board of Trade of Loa
Angeles assisted in having Landsburg
taken ' and also notified : the San Fran
cisco Board of Trade that Landsburg
was in jail at Los Angeles.
Landsburg is well known in Los
Angeles - and ' San ' Diego ' counties. His
business operations in the latter coun
ty have been quite extensive. Calexlco,
where his* business,. is centered, is in
the' somewhat -famous Imperial region
that lies partly in California and partly
in * Mexico. Additional particulars may
be developed to-day.

<Jrove L. Jchuson for the defense in the
limmons trial fpent the morning- in the
of witnesses called to con
tiadict testimony adduced by the prose
i/ution, and a long processiouof charac
ter witnesses engaged the attention of at
torneys and 'jurymen until the close of
the afternoon. ' An effort was made dur
ing the morning session to show that
Clarence Grange when the investigation
of building and loan associations . was
commenced had attempted to get togeth
er a bribery fund without explaining to
the contributors any Intention to arrange
for the entrapping of members of the
legislature.
W. H. Busch, manager of one of the
Han Francisco concerns mentioned. by va
rious witnesses, testified to this effect and
was not contradicted. â¢
Edward Short, on? of the assistant Bee*
gcants-at-arms of the Senate, contradict
ed several portions -of Harry Bunkers'
testimony relative to a 'trip to San Fran
cisco whtn Bunkers and Jordan were said
to have had a conversation that led up to
the bribery proposal. The remanider of
the testimony was without important ap
plication.
SPEAK ILL OF DETECTIVES.
The entire afternoon was devoted to
examination of charactec witnesses, all
residents of Kern County, who professed
a reluctance to believe Detectives Hart
ling and Tichenor under oath or under
any other circumstances. The defence
was able to draw from a score of sulh
witnesses who stood in the corridor out
side the courtroom. They were for the
most part friends and neighbors of the
d^f^ndant, and many of them had been
involved in the trouble between the Kern
County Land Association and the set
tlers, wbfch led to the Midway shooting
affray and the subsequent employment of
Hart ling and Ti< Imior as detectives.
Johnson was indisposed and the charac
ter witnesses were examined by Rowen
Irwln. one of the attorneys for the de
fense, and were cross-examined by
Charies T. Jones. : v
\u25a0 Johnson to-day made the tirst move to
carry the fight into the camp of- the
prosecution, as he threatened to do at the
time he caused subpenas to be Lssued
for certain building and Joan association
representatives in the earlier stages of
the trial. Johnson ' called W. H. Busch.
wrretary of the Pacific States Building
and l.Kian Association, to the witness
stand, me Pacific States is the associa
tion which refused to make any contribu
tion 'to tht fund to be raised to entrap
tne Senators.
TESTIMONY OF DI'SCII.
Seymour objected strenuously to the in
troduction of any testimony Busch might
give, but Johnson in reply said that while
the prosecution had declared that Clar
â¢ence Grange, secretary and manager of
the Phoenix Building "and I^oan Assocla
. tioa. was only a feigned accomplice in
the bribing of the legislators, he pro
rwsp.d to show by the witness that Grange
was an actual accomplice.
After an argument as to the admis
f&bility of the testimony, Busch was per
mitted to testify that he had a conversa
tion with Grange. The witness said
Grange tcld him some Senators had com
bined and they wanted money for im
munity. Bosch said he told Grange he
v/as not in favor of paying money for
immunity. , Busch said Grange named
5500 as th* sum for each. association.
On cross-examination Busch was asked
if the names of Joseph S. Jordan and the
four eccuÂ«d Senators had not been men
tioned by Grange. Busch said he did
not recall that any names had beer, men
tioned. Seymour asked if Grange had
not told him that he would not put up
a dollar for bribery, and the witness said
Grange made no such statement. There
was no redirect examination and Busch
was excused.

JAPAN VICTOR WITHOUT

F. T. Cable, superintendent of the Holland Submarine Torpedo B oat Company, who returned
from the Orient yesterday, says thai the submarine boats' purchased by the Japanese Government

Rojestvensky 7 Fleet
Crushed by Brown
% Men's Wit.
F. J. Cable, superintendent of the Hol
land Submarine Torpedo Boat Company
of New York, was among the passengers
returning yesterday on . the Korea from
Japan. Cable entirely dispells the state
ments that have been made regarding the
active part -that the submarine torpedo
boats were supposed to have played when
Rojestvensky's fleet was sunk. As a mat
ter of fact there was not a single sub
marine torpedo boat'ln that great naval
battle, when Togo's fleet wiped -the Rus
sian battleships out of existence. In fact,
there was not a single submarine boat
near that battle in the Sea of - Japan:
The five submarines were all peacefully
lying- at Gokoska dockyard, unfinished,
not in condition to go into service, and
it was nearly a month after that battle
before any of them were put in commis
sion. So it will be seen that the Japanese
won out their fight by other methods than
those employed by the use of the sub
marines built in America,
In â¢ th<> Japanese navy are but five of
these little -destroyers. They 'were all
built in New York by the Holland Sub
marine Torpedo Boat Company. â¢ They
were shipped in sections across the" con
tinent to Seattle and from that point re
shipped to Japan. Mr. Cable went over
to the Island Empire about six months
ago and there superintended the putting
together of the different parts of these
boats. Under his direction- they were
completed, and the last one was put into
service just prior to his starting for this
country.
On their trial trips they proved emi
nently successful. They all made an av
erage speed of about eight miles an hour.
During- the trials they were sunk to 't
depth of ninety feet beneath the surface
of the eea. -"
These boats are all practically like the
Grampus and Pike, which were built here
some three years ago by the Holland
Company at the Union Iron Works. They
have some improvements over those, con
structed here, ' but are to all intents^aijcl
purposes of, comparatively speaking, the
same \u25a0 class. Mr. â¢ Cable said that <hls
company had built over forty of these
submarine boats for England and that
they were all In' commission there now.
They all belong* to the same class ( and
style as- those built at the Iron
Works by the Holland Company.
Mr. Cable is an electrical engineer by
profession and has devoted recent -years
to work on submarines. He is . staying
at the St.- Francis and will remain .here
about a week before journeying to New
York. '\u25a0: \u25a0 ; \u25a0â¢ -- -' ' -:\u2666 . '
EAGLES DELVE INTO
SECRETARY'S LEDCxER
Howard Prentice Leaves Oak
land Suddenly and Lodge
men Become Suspicious.
OAKLAND. Sept. 27.â The trustees of
Oakland Aerie No. 7, Fraternal Order of
Eagles, have taken charge of the books
of Howard Prentice, financial secretary
of the lodge, which numbers 1500 mem
bers. Prentice, who had left the city,
was called back to his post on an emer
gency "notice, and an investigation of his
accounts was begun to-night by the three
trustees, Richard Smith, M. J. Hallahan
and Morgan Fltzpatrick. Prentice is un
der a $200 bond for the fatihful perform
ance of his duties, although In his posi
tion he is called upon to handle large
sums of money for dues and other collec
tions."
The utmost secrecy has : been main
tained by the board of trustees. It was
not until Monday night that the three
trustees got possession of the secretary's
ledger. -A cursory examination was made
of the book and the result was a decision'
by the trustees to hold a meeting within
forty-eight hoiirs for further and closer
Investigation.
.No formal charges have been made,
against the financial secretary. He had
gone to Reno, ostensibly on business, and
was there located by the Eagles "last
week. Word was sent to members of the
order there to see to it that Prentice re
turned to Oakland with all dispatch.
Prentice was at his accustomed posÂ£ at
the lodge meeting Monday night. After
the lodge adjourned Prentice departed,
leaving his ledger behind.
Prentice has received a salary .'of J2O a*
month as financial secretary. He was
formerly in the florist business on Wash
ington street, but gave that up about
six months . ago. . The reports from the
trustees, each of whom is under $15,000
bonds to the lodge, have each quarter
regularly showed that the financial sec
retary's accounts were correct. Some of
the members who have received an "ink
ling of what Is under way declare that
the ledger had ;not -been closely examined
before the. quarterly reports were made.
In lodge circles it is understood . that
overtures have been made by Prentice
looking toward a settlement of. any. dis
crepancies that might be! found in his
accounts. Owing to the large member
ship of the aerje a considerable amount
of money passed into his hands:

THE SAN FRANCISCO" CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1905.
Noted Correspondent
Home From Scene
of Strife.
Martin Egan on Way
to His I^abors in
London.
Among;: the passengers who arrived
here from the Orient , yesterday on the
liner Korea was Martin J. Egan, a few
years ago identified, with the local press
and to-day recognized as. one of the
foremost newspaper men of the world.
Egan is accompanied by his wife. Mrs.
Egan was, Miss Eleanor Franklin of
New York. She was sent to the Orient
by Leslie's Weekly. She met Martin
Egan. Egan won. And on September
11, in Tokio, he and Miss Franklin were
married. They will: make their home in
London, whither Mr. Egan is on his way
to take charge of the London office of
the Associated Press.
Egan for the last two years has been
in Tokioin charge of, the.; Associated
Press bureau "established there for: re
porting the news of the war. He was
on the scene , before \ hostilities began
and organized a" service which covered
the stiffest assignment that ever fell to
the lot of the war correspondent in. a
manner which compelled the respect
and admiration. of the world. While the
special correspondent,; veteran of many
wars, was loaling- about Tokio awaiting
official permission to go to the front,
the Associated Press was telling to the
world the story of the war as the great
drama unfolded itself. That it was able
to do this was due largely to Martin J.
Egan. ;'"V..v' '."\u25a0-, .â¢ \u25a0." -.â¢. '- ', "': \u25a0 '-v:-j-- \
Melville Stone, manager of the Asso
ciated Press, recently wrote the story of
that great organization for.the Century
Magazine. In the chapter, dealing with
the Russo-Japanese War he gives Mar
tin Egan: handsome credit for his .work
in the Orient and incidentally pays a
rare tribute to the personal worth of
the former San Francisco newspaper
man. \u25a0| j '\u25a0 : : ' :\u25a0 " ' ..' v "- ..-.:\u25a0 :;:\u25a0.;
"!A successful war correspondent,",
writes Stone, "must be temperamentally
a diplomat and capable of ingratiating
himself into the sympathetic and help
ful friendship of those with whom he
comes ; In' -contact."
After setting- up this standard, Stone i
tells of his selection of Egan 'for the
difficult task of handling- the Japanese
end of the war story. He refers to Egan
as "a gentleman of wide experience and
rare ability." ' i
Of Egan's work in Tokio, Stone
writes : . . ' "He early established relations
with the Government more intimate
than any other journalist. , His /high
sense of ; honor, his administrative abil
ity and his fcact were appreciated, and
soon won for him the confidence and e%-.
teem of , the Japanese officials. -; He i.was
given the official reports from the gen
erals in'the field -several hours ahead of
; any other, correspondent, and his wishes
I In regard to the treatment accorded^- to
I Associated Press [correspondents at ; the
; front were respected in a remarkable
I. manner.' W. _-
j \u25a0 Returning., war correspondents and

1 red ; tape. ";. More ' than ; one special ; corre-
I spondent : owes j his ' chance" to igolto jthe

;Egan. .' "
One correspondent 5 of- note, \whore7
turned'abouta year. ago,'. said of Egan:
.'.'Every .decent ' newspaper . man! in/the

The Marshal was accompanied by J.

DR. JORDAN DENIES
THE EELICS STORY
Collection Presented by
Thomas Welton Stanford-
Now in: the Museiun.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
r STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 27.â
The fact that Stanford" University is in
possession of a very.valuable collection of
Egyptian coins and tablets has been
brought to the -notice of the university
community by the recent statement made
by President David Starr Jordan in which
he flatly denies that he ever refused any
gift of Thomas Welton Stanford, as was
asserted ih one of the San Francisco
newspapers.
The story*, which Dr. Jordan has de
clared to be absolutely without founda
tion, is that Thomas Welton Stanford,
brother of the late Senator Stanford, by
means of the agency of an Australian
spiritualistic medium obtained a remark
able assortment of ancient relics from the
heart of Africa. These relics, upon being
presented to the head of. the university,
according to the story, were denied ad
mission to the museum upon, the ground
that as Dr. Jordan is not a believer in
spiritualism the acceptance of the prof
fered collection would be taken in the
light of a confession that it was possible
that the relics could have been gathered
in the manner "related. ,
All this President Jordan has corrected
and declares that two years ago a valu
able collection of coins and tablets was
presented to the ' museum by Thomas
Welton Stanford and was accepted by the
trustees of the university and has since
been on exhibition here.

FORMALLY ACCEPTED BY MUNICIPALITY.
Mayor Responds to
S Address of W. G
Harrison.
Work on Panhandle
Will Begin Im
mediately.
Tbe Board of Supervisors held a spe
cial meeting: yesterday afternoon to
accept the Burnham plans which were
presented to the city by the Improve
ment and Adornment Club for future
guidance in the building of highways,
public places and parks.
William Clrecr Harrison, acting: presi
dent of thc^mprovement and Adornment
Club, addressed the board and members
oâ¬ the different improvement societies
TthJch were represented at the meeting:,
and presented the plans. Mayor
Schiaitz responded in behalf of the
Board of Supervisors and the citizens
of the city and promised to beg-in work
on them immediately. He hoped the
work would never cease until this city
was known as '"City Beautiful."
During the course of his address Mr.
Harrison said lv part: _^
A fÂ«w years ago Hon. James D. Phelan
conceived the idea of l*eautif>lns the city on
an extensive scale and called together a body
of representative men for the purpose of or
ganizing and *-.cinq what could be done. At
that ir.erting the Improvement and Adornment
<"!ub was organised and Mayor Phelan was
made It* president.
Ex-Mayor Phelan is now absent from the city.
lut 1 have been in . constant communication
with fclc. and he Inform* me that nothing
would give him greater pleasure than to be
here to-day and address you on the subject
co dear to him. Wlsen he returns he will take
up the wia-k where he has left off and carry
H to a successful end.
Shortly after the club wa6 organized Mr.
Plielan invited D. H. Burnham. the greatest
upbuilder of cities in the world, to visit him
in the city, and after a drive and a visit to
Twin Peaks Mr. Burnham was co favorably
Impressed with v.hat might be done for the
beauty o f the city that he offered his services
without compensation, and after twelve
months of hard labor this genius and his com
panions have presented the plans you now ccc
before you.
In a letter to me Mr. Burnham stated that
these plans cover work to be done for the next
fifty years, and also states that Edward H.
IlÂ»Hinctt deserves full credit for the work per
fonued. *
It is a. crime to permit ugliness where beauty
is permissible, and it is our business to make
this city sn beautiful that each and every
Terser* wi'.l hÂ» pleased to call It his home. The
city of San Francisco shall be known as the
\u25a0"City Beautiful." i
W> nsk to-day that Â«very man In the city
do -what h* oÂ«n to help the good cause along
and no record of any city -will be more preg
nant than the record of this day's proceed
!nzs.
After Mr. Harrison had finished his
address the Mayor accepted the plans
in behalf of the Board of Supervisors
and the citizens of the city. The Mayor
said In part:
la behalf .of the citizens of San Francisco It
giv-ea me great pleasure to accept these plans
anfl to state that in the future they shall ever
bÂ« our guiding etar. as far as the beauty of
the city Ik concerned. â¢"'-
It has been my pleasure to visit Mr. Burn
ham on Twin \u25a0 Peaks, and have him explain
his beÂ«utifal Ideas in every detail, and the
thins â¢which Impressed me most was the en
\u25a0ihusiasm he expressed In his work.
Mr. Burnham toas allowed fifty year* to
complete the" work, but Fbould this city pro
â¢â¢ Â«iwÂ« â¢-Â»Â»- rapidly - a* it "bas for -the last 'fifty
years it \u25a0will be no Idle boavt that in twenty
yÂ«>srs It will have earned the title of "City
Beautiful."
It, haa b<Â»en estimated that $50,000,000 will
'-'\u25a0mplete these plans, und while that seems &
'arpe mm it Is very email in comparison with
the. grog* benefit the city will derive from it.
The Boulevard around the city and the Pan
handle from Baker street to Market are to be
started first, and the great work which we will
f.srt.wfll be completed by those who follow us.
Supervisor d'Ancona gave a short ad
<?r*>ps of acceptance and Mrs. Lovell
\u25a0^Vhlte, president of the Outdoor Art
LeaiErue, said a few -words on behalf
of the leairue. which was well repre-
KÂ«r.tÂ©d at the meeting:. The Art League
T^as bÂ«en doing: a i^reat deal to beautify
the city. It has Just finished its work
on the old Dolores Mission and Is now
trying: to have a bill passed through
fr>ngre-ES for an appropriation to
hpautify the military reservations
about the city. The members were
particularly interested' ln Twin Peaks,
as they were about to take up that
work when they were notified that the
peaks were included in Mr. Burahara's
plans and were to be taken care of
"by the city.
NOTED MORMON
WOMAN PASSES
AWAY IN UTAH
EAI.T LAKE CITY, Sept. 27. â Mrs.
Catherine Phillips Smith, who claimed
to have been the plural wife of the
patriarch Hyrum Smith, who, with his
brother, the so-called Mormon prophet,
Joseph Smith, was slain by a mob in
the jail at Carthage, 111., in 1844, died
here to-day. Mrs. Smith has been a
central figure in the controversy that
split the Mormon church into the two
branches known as the "Brighamites"
and "Joaepfcites." To disprove the al
legation of the Josephltes, or the re
organized church, that the so-called
Prophet Joseph had never countenanced
the polygamous practices of the Utah
Mormons, Mrs. Smith two years ago
made affidavit before a notary that she
was not only tEe plural wife of, Hyrum
Smith, but that "the sealing was per
formed by the Prophet Joseph Smith
himself at Nauvoo, State of Illinois, in
August, 1843."
&he further testified that so great
wa3 the feeling in Nauvoo against per
eons suspected of having entered into
plural marriage that with her mother
she moved to S.t, Louis near the close
of the year. Up to the day of her death
Mrs. Sml^h maintained the accuracy of
her affidavits.

The members of the "Association for the
Improvement and Adornment of San
Francisco gathered around the festal
board in the white and gold room of
the St. Francis last night, and, during
the course of the banquet . many promi
nent citizens . talked on the plans and the
outlook foi* beautifying the city. Great

gee, Thomas McCaleb, Edward Bennett,
Supervisor D'Ancona and Henry A.

a well-worded speech.
Thomas McCaleb, secretary of the as
sociation, paid a glowing tribute to the
energy and zeal displayed by Burnham
Un his efforts to make San ; Francisco
the most beautiful oi all cities. He
dwelt on the other great tasks per
formed by the j eminent Chicagoan and
expressed his opinion . that his labors in
the far western field would â¢ bear fruit
Just as they had done elsewhere. In part
McCaleb said: : , . -
The artistic side of. our great city haa been
neglected in the rush - and bustle that has at
tended Itn commercial â¢ progresa. - The peopls
are only Just beginning /to realize now that
they need a. beautiful as well as a great city.
If our plans are successful and we can adorn
San Francisco as \u25a0it should be adorned there
is no question- that its growth will increase
and ' people will be attracted here who other
wise would not come, j Its fame will spread
and in a few years the cost of the great under
taking will be entirely forgotten.
We are fortunate to have, as our guiding
star Daniel Burnham, the great ts Chicago
architect. If Mr.' Burnhanfs' Â»lansÂ« succeed;
then Indeed ours will be the grandest city of
the world Mr Burnham has done Innumerable
things He is the .father of the modern tire
proof building and - the designer of come of
the world's greatest structures. He was prac
tically unknown to -the vast body of people of

tion, which was read by: Harrison. The

The. fight waged between 0.. H. P. Bel

use hacks regularly, _- while Belmont is
backed by those whose automobiles ' and
carriages meet them ' at I the station each
day. ; \u25a0\u25a0 .
Belmont caused the village trustees ;to
pass an ordinance a year ago forbidding
hackmen to occupy the space alongside
the stetlon' platform and 'making: other
strict rules. All went along fairly, smooth

came to the", station and Luke Fagan
was In the way.' Just .what was said Is
no_t clear, but Fagan fired , up instantly
and refused to. i budge. .The 'automobile
had' to be guided, around his carriage. :
To-day, when the 3 o'clock train arrived
Harold Vanderbilt alighted and one of the
Belmont carriages met him. ; On the same

Plans for a City
Beautiful Are
Superb.
Unity and Dignity
Have a Place in
the Scheme
LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
As. the possession of an ideal is essen
tial to" the development of ,. the characters
of men, in just such measure is an ideal
necessary to the consistent development
of ..a.; city.i :V.- :*\u25a0..-\u25a0.\u25a0.:- .â¢'â¢'.. '....-\u25a0\u25a0 /
i; .And, it.. is an idealâ a superb idealâ of
what I San ' Fjrahcisco may become, and
shall strive" to be, that .the wizard Burn
ham has given' us. in the plans turned over
yesterday? by ; -William Greer Harrison, \u25a0 of
the\ Association for the Improvement and
! Adornment- of .. San - Francisco, -to the
Board of Supervisors, which formally ac
cepted them on behalf of ithe city.
Thus is the. first step taken to carry
out the destiny of beauty' that the Father
intended; when he fashioned the hills and
stretches of 'valley upon which our city
lies. '\u25a0-. -; ; ;\u25a0-'\u25a0\u25a0 '\u25a0\u25a0: .
Steeped in the conviction that the City
by-the-Golden Gate was divinely en
dowed â but undeveloped and therefore
.damply appreciatedâ James D. Phelan in
duced Mr. Burnham. to come to this city.
To him he confessed his convictions, and
then begged an expert opinion upon them.
Taking the visitor out to Twin Peaks
one -summer, afternoon, ' whenN the blue
haze hung lightly over the city in its
turquoise setting,. Mr. Phelan heard his
answer. And it ran something like thisâ
after the artist. had: rediscovered articu
lation: "Sir, 'your city has one of the
most beautiful situations in the world. It
is incomparable. :. It surpasses in point of
natural beauty/any. other city I have ever
known." . . - .
Now, Mr. Burnham* has known quite a
few. "cities. Moreover, he is a man of
truth. | And . thus did .it come to pass that
the man from Chicago, j who | caught the
grandeur, of. the j view _in a sweep of his
eye, was soon- commissioned |to'> create* an
ideal, which the adolescent city ."should
set before it, and for which it should
reach out year by year. / .
To ; "practical" peopleâ who mostly be
long to the Cold . Water Brigade â an
"ideal" suggests . a rainbow. - Now, let
me say at the outset that Mr. Burnham
lias held well in mind the baser and the
utilitarian wants of the city, but he has
created an ideal for them, even as he has
for" the social and the altruistic and the
esthetic demands. But I must confess
that I like the latter the best. So will
yo,u, if you are blessed with imagination
enough to stand in the Atheneaum, the
great terraced court near Twin Peaks,
with . its statues and colonnades and its
vista out to the sea and the brown' shores
beyond. . . _
Or perhaps Ihe Amphitheater will at
tract youâ the great stadium that will He
in" a glen that nature. built for it in her
original plans \and {Specifications. This
will". He' to" the' '"north" of Twin Peaks, in
the hollow on Clarendon Heights, and
here while the tourney is on, the .specta
tors may joy , in 'the glow of the sun as
it sinks into the burnished sea". â¢"â¢-. "
Perhaps the most logical point at which
to beginâ but the way of-logicis not a
woman's wayâ is' the' great "civic center,"
that you will find at the junction jof
Market . 1 street, S I Van >\u25a0/ Ness ; avenue and
Eleventh* street." Here is what French
architects call the "perimeter of distri
bution"âa majestic ornamental spot from
which, radiate arteries of traffic." '.â¢". â¢
.Connected with the Golden Gate Park
by the old plan of the Panhandle ex
tension, it expands into Eleventh street,
making of It a splendid . avenue, to be
certain point or spot. -. Evidence to prove this is seen
on every side \u25a0of street. Take the signsâ that is
the merchant's ''blind spot* He : sees the value of
weU-dfessed windows, of an attractive street front, yet
- he cannot see that his/ sign does not do credit to the
name it bears; that it is slovenly, unkempt and uninvit-
ing. But you can see it because you are a customer.

announces the marriage at ' that place of
Colonel Charles H. - Sonntag. a well
known . merchant 7 and - clubman . of . San
Francisco, :to Miss - Grace January, a
young woman , some years his Junior.
Colonel Sonntag took every precaution to
keep the affair a secret, saying his ob
ject was to spring a surprise on his San
Francisco '.- friends . by returning home a
benedict. The local newspapers were
pledged, to keep the wedding quiet and
the County Clerk was under promise to
leave the names of the parties off the
public record for a number of days.
Miss January,*, supposedly by prear
rangement, was on a visit to her cousin,
Mrs. R.B. Richards,, who is a former
resident of San Jose. The ceremony took
place at the Richards home on Fifth
street, an Episcopal clergyman from Sac
ramento officiating. , Miss January is well
known in San _Jose and San -Francisco,
where she has resided. The honeymoon
will be spent at the Portland Exposition.
Intercepted by a grand Union railway
station at Bryant street," a blessed boon,
even in visions of the future.
North of the "center" the same avenue
extends to Jefferson Park, intercepted
below by a .splendid \u25a0 opera house â the
prospects of which should send a thrill of
joy into the hearts of the "independents"
in the profession and -out.

have had Babylon and Athens, and Rome
and Parisâ but San Franciscans are made

Company,- and E. B. Fish, who la onÂ» of
the traffic officials of the company. It is
announced to-day have been subpenaed
by the Government as witnesses In the
beef itnist cases : to testify against Ar
mour^ & Co. and the other defendants.
Two other employes of the Schwarzschild
& Sulzberger Company -have also been
subpenaed by the Government. â¢
. Officials of the Schwarzschild & SuU
berger Company pleaded guilty recently
to charges of conspiracy and to illegally
obtaining railroad rebates. The offenders
through pleading guilty escaped impris
onment, being sentenced to pay fines ag
gregating $25,000. - \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0
The subpenaes made public to-day wers
served some weeks ago. but the matter
was kept secret. Traffic Manager K. B.
Fish is the witness whom it was charged
in an indictment Attorney Joseph V/eis
enbach and three other i men spirited
away to Canada.
. . Government secret service asents
worked on the case for a long time and
finally reported that Sulzberger -and the
other three attaches of the company are
in possession of facts concerning a meet
ing of packing officials held within the
past year, almost within the time of the
Grand Jury investigation. It was learned,
it Is declared, that a representative of the
Schwarzschild &*- Sulzberger Company
was seated at the table about which the
packers gathered. The details of this al
leged meeting- will, it is hoped by the
prosecution, be exposed before the Jury
which tries the packers. Attorney Wels
enbach to-day, however, strenuously de
nied that the company is turning State's
evidence in order, to "get even" with the
other packing companies. He declared
that the witnesses will go on the stand
under protest. , -\u25a0
After a search of many weeks the Gov
ernment officials have succeeded In .find
ing an Important witness. George L. Cof
fin, manager for Hammond & Co. at the
stockyards. He has been out of the city,
it is declared, for some time. He was
subpenaed to-day.
" Arguments were begun before Federal
Judge J. Otis Humphrey to-day in con
nection with a plea in abatement to the
indictment against J. Ogden Armour and
other packers charged with combining in
restraint of trade. The questions argued
in . law before the court were on the de
murrer which alleged insufficiency, alle
gations by Interference and a number of
other points, under which It Is claimed
that the plea should be denied.
The objection by the defendants to the
manner in which the jury was drawn
was then taken up and at the time of
adjournment to-night Attorney Rosen
thai was reading authorities supporting
his contention that the Jury was drawn
from . a part of the district without a.
proper order of the court. The Jury was
drawn from the eastern district of the
northern division of the State and it is
contended by the defendants that ' the
court ordered the Jury drawn from the
"body" of the district, meaning both the
eastern and- western divisions. The hear
ing will be resumed to-morrow morning.

With Yell header Unbalances Her Mind.
BERKELEY, Sept. 27.â Mrs. Ada B.
Hent, mother of Corinne Barry Bulke
ley, a young woman whose marriage to
Lewis Bulkeley last spring took place
after Bulkeley was threatened with
prosecution on a felony charge, was ar
rested and taken to Oakland last night,
charged with -insanity. Dr. J. W. Stitt,
who has been the family physician,
Ewore to the complaint.
ThÂ«? marriage of Mrs. Hent's daugh
ter to Bulkeley was accompanied with
such notoriety as to have, unbalanced
the mother's reason, in the opinion of
the woman's friends and her physician.
Bulkeley was yell leader of the univer
sity and a prominent student. He was
dismissed from the university shortly
after his marriage to Corinne Barry.
She had also been a university student,
where she made Bulkeley's acquaint
ance two years ago.
Mrs. Hent and her daughter have
lived alone in a suite of rodms in the
house of Mrs. M. B. Davis at Rose and
Oxford streets for the last month. Mem
bers of the family have been estranged
for many years, but were united in a
measure when the daughter's distress
called for assistance and sympathy last
spring. Mrs. Hent is said to have
turned upon her children, abusing and
threatening them. She is declared to
have threatened a niece, Lucy Singly,
'With death and to have displayed un
called for rancor and bitter hatred for
â¢Dr. Stitt's little children, who are be
ing coached in their studies at night by
Mrs. Bulkeley.
â¢ Mrs. Hent's daughters, Mrs. E. Newell
and Mrs. R. Dixon of San Francisco,
held a consultation yesterday and de
cided that the mother would best be
.placed under restraint and the insanity
"complaint accordingly was made.
It developed to-day that Mrs. Bulke
ley sought recently to end her life by
taking chloroform, but was saved by
Dr. Stitt'a services. She ia declared to
have abused her mother and' beaten
her when In hysterics, but asserts that
the insanity charge was prompted by
kindest motives and that the entire af
fair is 'like death" to ner. ,
lltb. Bulkeley. after a long stay in
en Oakland sanitarium, began recently
to : attempt to support' hersfelf, and
mother In an office in the First National
Bank building by painting menu cards
end similar articles. She paid to-day
that Mr. Bulkeley contributed nothing
to her support; that she. was greatly
Indebted, as* was her mother, to Dr.
Btltt top: his kindnesses, and that the
mothers' attacks upon.TDi 1 . Stitt'a chil
dren were sufficient to show that her
mind was unbalanced. ...
Mrs. M. B. Davis, where the mother
and daughter have lleved, believes.that
â¢'Mrs. Hent Is being railroaded Jo an

UNPLEASANT NOTORIETT AND
CAUSED MOTHER TO LOSE HER
MIND. ?
WIDOW LOSES
WILL CONTEST
Mrs. Sarah L. Bump Forfeits
Even Little Bequeathed
Her by Bringing the Suit
OAKLAND, Sept. 27.â The widow of the
late Nelson Bump goes forth into the
world penniless, while the four daughters
of the deceased divide.'among themselves
an estate valued at $65,000," according to a
decision rendered this afternoon by Judge
B. F. Ogden, in' the trial Â« of the. will
contest which has been on before him. for
the last six weeks. By,a T provision of
the will the widow forfeits the little left
her if she contests/so that practically
she has nothing. Judge Ogden, however,
did order the expenses of the suit to be
borne by the estate.
According to; the opinion 'rendered" by
Judge Ogden the ( will was an unjust-one
and in this connection 4 he* said:-' -
Under the provision of this will Nelson
Bump left his wife .less than she would^have
received as a metrtal working for him for
f-0 a month. This widow was his .faithful
\u25a0 wife for nearly a quarter ; of a century, per
- forming duties for him in the later years- o f hi*
life that many women would have refused to
perform. The- document is unjust, -but I can
not agree with the contestants here that
Bump was Insane. ; He was self-centered and
aelfisb. .. 3e had Ms photograph, taken with
thirty-two of his "ilescendants, but excluded
his sons-in-law, apparently not recognizing
their, share in the fearing of his progeny. He
kept his money for -Ills own and to -the woman
who was his companion In his later years he
gave a pittance. Nevertheless, I believe, he
did co with a full knowledge of- what, he was
doing, and will have to decide that thjs Was
so. He was fearful of a contest and*threat
ened his widow with diinheritance, for there
was no one else to whom. this provision could
apply if she made any objectlonito the pro
vision of the will. . \u25a0
The contest was brought by Attorneys
M. C. Chapman and W. A. Dow for Mrs,
Sarah L. Bump, the widow, while At
torneys R. H. . Countryman and George
W. Reed represented ; the four daughters
of the deceased, to whom the estate is
left. The property Is located mostly on
Merrit Island |in the Sacramento River,
just opposite the town of Courtland. -

Sweetheart of Dead Cashier

RELATES TO CORONER
Miss Ruth Roberts Gives a
Clew as to Why Man She
Was to Wed Shot Himself
OAKLAND, Sept 27.â Financial trou
ble in connection with his position as
cashier of. the draying firm of E. T.
Frasier & Co., 105 Second street, San
Francisco, was the cause of the suicide
of Joe B. Wells, whose body, - with a
bullet wound in ' the head, was found
yesterday afternoon in .a room at the
Oriental House, 564 Washington street.
Miss Ruth Roberts of 509 Leaven
wortn street, San Francisco, to whom
Wells 'was engaged, furnished the ex
planation to-night at the Coroner's in
quest, She last saw Wells alive Mon
day morning, when he met her at 523
Market street, San Francisco, her place
of business.
"He tried to be cheerful enough," tes
tined the bereft young woman, "but
there were troubles on his mind. He
said there were money matters in which
he was involved with his firm. He tried
to explain things to me, but I could not
understand. Itjwas only a matter of a
few dollars, he thought. He had decid
ed it was best for him to go away. If
matters were straightened out he would
come back, but he did not know how
things would end."
Miss Roberts received a letter from
him in wjÂ»ich Wells sent her Jl5, "wish
ing it we're $15,000." His note concluded:
"It's best lam gone.'.* ; .
The jury returned a verdict of sui
cide. Wells' parents reside at Chelaw,
South Carolina. He was 26 years old.
The body is being held here- pending
instructions from Wells' relatives.
E. T. Frasier of the E. T. Frasier
Draying Company admitted yesterday
that Joe B. Wells was short in his ac
counts at the time of his suicide. Fra
sier said:
'"I have not had the heart to go.
through the books yet, but there was a
discrepancy in Wells' accounts. I treat
ed him like a brother and had the full
est confidence in him. Had he told me
that he was short in the cash I would
have willingly forgiven' him; lam sure
of one thing and that is that his short
age was not responsible for his taking
his life. Last Sunday he told me he had
a serious quarrel with Miss Ruth Rob
erts, and that, I think, may account for
his act. Whatever the shortage, it will
come to much less than $1000.
"Wells was refined, educated and a
\u25a0gentlemancÂ»nd , J:.would*have ; trusted
him -with -anything. I'have.**The last I
saw of him was Monday morning at 11
o'clock; when I handed him my bank
book and $227 58, which he deposited.
He then returned me the. book. and went
away." .;.. \u0084"" , . â¢'â¢-,-

PATIENTS GIVEN
A SCANT DIET
Officials of Marin^ County
Investigate Sanitarium of
"Divine Healer" Lachance
HIS PLACE NOT TIDY
Doctor Said to Enjoy a Big
Income From the Seventy
Guests at Strange Resort
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL* Sept. 27.â District At
torney Thomas P. Boyd and Sheriff Wil
liam P. Taylor this afternoon drove over
to the Mount View Hotel, now used as a*
"divine healer's" sanitarium, to pay a
visit to the institution and question its
inmates as to the conditions existing
there. The so-called "divine healer," Jo
seph Lachance, recognized District At
torney Boyd as .his inquisitor of yester
day before the Coroner's* jury. Lachance
at that time told of his visions, com
mands, walks . with Moses and Ellas
through ,the streets of ' Minneapolis, in
visible and unobserved by the passers-by,
and how the angel had told him in Oak
land that Mount View Hotel would be his
next healing place. After some hesita
tion Lachance sent Joseph Mast, one of
his assistants in the distribution of di
vine power, to show the officers through
the institution.' .
Mast is. a young man about 2S years of
age, with a robust frame and ' adorned
with a fiery red beard. He. bails from
Esparto, where hia parents are large
landowners. He says that the divine
power of Lachance attracted -htm to his
new vocation, and he felt 1 that his mis
sion was to aid the sick.. His four sisters
are working in the sanitarium, perform
ing household duties, j Two weeks ago
Mast was married to Miss Jessie Pon
cini, a patient, who is now numbered as
one of the staff. The courtship lasted
only a couple' of weeks. ...
Mast accompanied the â¢ District Attor
ney and the Sheriff through the. buildings
and grounds,\ pleasantly answering every
question put to him. i He. told them of
the numerous cures that. he believed to
have occurred through the treatment of
Dr. Lachance. The officials found the
place only in a fairly clean condition. The
plumbing is in a bad state. All the pa
trons of the place seemed to be content
ed with their treatment and resented any
illusion to faking on the . part of La
chance.
As the party was passing the office of
Lachance they heard him speaking
loudly to a lady, evidently a patient. He
said to her: "Do you believe that I can
cure you?" He repeated the question
three times, each louder than the last.
He will not take any one for treatment
who has not implicit confidence in him.
The sanitarium is in Ross Valley, "a
couple of miles from this city, lying on
the south slope of the ridge of hills
which mark the southerly boundary
line of this city. The location is an
ideal one, the main building being on a
knoll commanding a beautiful view of
Tamalpais and the surrounding coun
try. Morton .C. Fisher, an Eng
lish capitalist, largely interested in Cal
ifornia investments, selected this site
for his home more' than twenty years
ago and expended fully $175,000 build
ing and fitting the mansion now known
as Mount View Hotel. Every conven
ience and accommodation that money
could secure was Installed. Shortly
after the completion of the, building
Fisher's wife died and he went away
broken-hearted. Since that time the
place is said to have been haunted.
About five months ago Lachance
leased the place for three years, with
the privilege of remaining for five
years. Shortly after, he took possession
the terrible Stephens murder and sui
cide occurred in the western portion of
the grounds. The house where the mur
der was committed was immediately
torn down. District Atorney Boyd this
evening said:
I found the place very untidy. The ' patients
seemed to be vÂ«ry contented and happy. 1
will take no action In the matter until I hear
from the State Board of Medical Examiners
and see what action it may wish to take In the
matter. I asked the attendant. Mast, what diet
was furnished and he replied: "We give them
a substantial diet. In the morning, coffee and
cornbread. Of course If they are very sick
we *lv# them eggs and milk. We don't give
them fruit or anything like that."
I called his attention to the absence of food
In the pantry, and he replied: "We don't keep
a supply on hand ; only enough for a day or
two. otherwise we would have ants, files and
other insects which would breed disease."
Sheriff Taylor agreed with the Dis
trict Attorney about the condition of
the place and believes that the sanita
rium needs decided attention. Every
one he saw had perfect faith in La
chance. Lachance easily has a net in
come of^more than ?200 weekly. In the
event that the State Board'of Examin
ers proceed against him he could easily
slip away, practically leaving nothing
behind except a lot of disappointed pa
tients. He has very little invested as
the place was rented partly furnished.
Lachance charges nothing for treat
ment, but collectsllO a week in board
from his seventy patients.

COSTLY HOMES
FOR SAN MATEO
Handsome Xew Residences to
Be Erected Soon in City
Famed for Elegant Villas
RICH 3IEX WILL BUILD
Section Near the Burlingame
Club Will Also Be Dotted
With Some Palatial Houses
SAN MATKO, Sept. 27.â This city,
which is already noted a$ one possess
ing: some of the most beautiful homes in
California, is soon to have several more
that will rival those now here. Walter
S. Martin has closed a deal for the pur
chase of twenty acres of land near the
Burllngaine Club. He intends to erect,
a handsome country home in the midst
of a beautiful park. J. LÂ»owney Harvey
has bought six acres of land adjoining
the Burlingame Club on the west and
will, without delay, build a villa. Th*
price of the land. $10,000 Is an indica
tion of values In this vicinity.
Philip Lansdale and Edward Howard
have also secured holdings and will im
prove them without delay with hand
some homes. Eugene de Sabla. the
president of the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company, who recently bought
the artin villa in El Cerrito Park, is
adorning 1 the grounds on a most elab
orate scale. The plans provide for a
Japanese garden of exceptional beauty.
It is now practically settled that tho
magnificent Jiayward home, which re
cently passed into the hands of a syn
dicate of capitalists, will be trans
formed into a hotel. The purchasers
of the property have unlimited capital
behind them and it is understood that
they will spare no expense in equipping
the place for the purpose for which it
has been acquired.
The syndicate is composed of Captain
John Barneson, the San Francisco ship
ping man. Antone Borel. the San Fran
cisco banker and millionaire. John Ro
senfeld, the millionaire and coal opera
tor, A. S. Baldwin, the real estate man
and W. S. Tevis. the millionaire. It is
the intention of the purchasers to re
build the structure and add several
wings that 'will supply accommodations
for several hundred guests. This hotel
will be surrounded by sixteen acres,
which will be laid out as a beautiful
park.
The remainder of the Hayward tract,
consisting of ninety-four acres, will
probably be divided into villa lot 3 and
placed upon the market. It is likely
also that a part of the tract will be con
verted into a public park and given to
the city. While all or these improve
ments are of the highest value the most
important consideration to the people
of San Mateo 13 the opening of the town
in a southerly direction. The Hayward
property has long been a barrier to the)
extension of the city, but now a'patu
ral development is not only possible,
but Inevitable.

She Claims Sole Ownership on
Ground That He Drinks.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Mrs. Mary B. Burke charged her hus
band, Thomas, with having disturbed the
peace by refusing to give her and their
9-year-old daughter sole and undisputed
possession of the family domicile, 2335
Greenwich street.
"It's my house," said the woman to Po
lice Judgo Fritz, "because I paid for It
with money I BavÂ«d." \
"She saved the xnonÂ«y from my earn
ings." said the man, "and she starved
me to do It."
"If I hadn't saved the money he would
a-sj?ent it for drink," retorted the wife.
"If I wouldn't drink I .wouldn't work
all day at a furnace in the gashouse,"
pleaded the husband.
"Maybe It's community property," ven
tured the Judge.
"Community nothin'." responded Mrs.
Burke. "I'd like to see myself giving him
anything that he could sell for beer."
"It's mine or it's nobuddy's," growled
Mr. Burke.
"The law might decide that it belongs
to both of you.'V opined his Honor.
"It's mine, and the law has nothin' to
do with it," snapped the complainant.
"The law can't make any house big
enough to hold me an' her," deolared the
defendant.
"Well, ownership of the mansion can
not be settled here," decreed the court.
"Let me hear something about this
charge of peace disturbance." :
Mrs. Burke let him hear a great deal
about It from her viewpoint. If one
couldn't eat one's meals or sleep in one's
bed without being worried almost to
death she would like to be enlightened
as to what constituted peace " disturb
ance. "Morning, noon and night" she was
subjected to reminders of her Inability
to accomplish by physical force what Bhe
yearned to do â namely, rid her presence
of Mr. Burke. All she desired was to be
left alone In peace by him, and as he
positively declined to leave her alone he
disturbed the peace. Did he ever strike
her? "Well, a dog can be killed by other
means than that of hanging. "Would she
please give direct answerâ had he ever
struck her? "Well, to strike one with a
fist Is frequently less punishing than to
etab one with stinging words. Then he
had not struck her? Well, If to call one
this, that and the other thing was not as
bad as striking onÂ», what was it as bad
as? <;v
Mr. Burke hinted at alienation of Mrs.
Burkes affections from himself as being
the baeic cause of her "naggln*," which
was Interminable. He would "not men
tion no names/ but he knew "what da
goes was." Every dollar of the sum paid
for the house was earned by the sweat
of his brow, and if he had been treated
better at home he might have found
steam beer less enticing. No, he never
raised his hand to her â at least, he never
allowed his band to fall upon herâ ln an
ger. If she or her advisers â without men
tioning namesâ would pay him the_price
that was paid with his money for the
house he would depart from it and never
return. Otherwise he would stay, nag
ging or no nagging.
"You'd better go home and talk it
over," said the Judge to both Burkes,
"and if you cannot agree to dwell in am
ity you'd better sell the bone of conten
tion and divide the proceeds. Come back
here next Wednesday and let me know
what you've decided to do."
Patrolman Kraacke believed that he
prevented another Chinese tragedy by
overhauling and searching Wong Hing, a
shifty-eyed little heathen, last Tuesday
evening on Kearny street, for In one of the
suspect's sleeves he discovered a butcher
knife so long that if extended from wrist
to shoulder. Judge Conlan - apparently
shared the officer's belief, for he sen
tenced Wong Hlng to six months' impris
onment
"By the time you art restored to lib
erty," said his Honor to the sullen de
fendant, "a new shift in the murderous
politics of Chinatown may have made a
copartlsan of the gentleman whom you
intended to carve with that weapon."
After he has served his six months
Wong Hing will be taken before Judge
Moganuo answer for a similar offense*
committed prior, to his last arrest. On
that occasion he was found lurking at
midnight in a Chinatown doorway, and
after he had put up a vigorous but futile
fight the policeman discovered beneath
his blouse a knife big enough to serve as
a sword. When arraigned before Judge
Mogan he asked for and was granted a
Jury, and pending the setting of a date
for trial he was released on $500 bonds.
Mles Maude Wendell, of willowy form
and fair complexion, was arrested for
disorderly conduct at Fifth and Market
streets last Sunday evening, and she told
Judge Mogan that he would commit a
grievous error, by pronouncing; her guilty,
because all she had done to provoke ar
rest was to orally rebuke some "fresh
guys" who made heÂ« a butt for coarse
badinage as she walked past the; cigar
store In which they were congregated.
"What did they say to offend you?"
hfÃ Honor Inquired. = ' \u25a0 -
"Well," replied Miss Wendell, "you see,
I'm a blonde an* have lots of yellah hair.
Well. I'm "passing by this cigar, store

In response, to a query as to whether
she had ever been arrested before, Miss
"Wendell said with great positlveness that
she had not. Then a policeman arose in
the auditory and announced that several
weeks ago he arrested her for peace dis
turbance and Judge Conlan. fined her 95.
Miss "Wendell pondered a moment ere she
said that maybe she had been arrested
and fined, Just as her accuser had de
clared. Then she was remanded for sen

Jacob Cardin, middle-aged, and Johnnie
Murphy, Juvenile, werÂ« driving their re
spective f rult-peddllng wagons at Kearny
and Pine, streets when the vehicles col
lided, and the result was Jacob's arraign
ment before Judge Gonlan on thÂ« charge
of having battered Johnnie. i
Two witnesses for tha defense swore
that they were neighbors of Jacob on
Howard street, and just happened to be
at Kearny and Pine streets when they
saw Johnnie deliberately drive his wagon
into that of Jacob and then orally abuse
Jacob and finally hurl. a diseased apple
full in Jacob*s face. Asked if they saw
anything more of the encounter, the two
neighbors of Jacob replied that they did
not, because they were so shocked by the
appearance of Jacob's face after the ap
ple had struck it that they turned their
gaze elsewhere.
It looked like acquittal for Jacob when
O. Gross, an insurance agent, mounted
the stand and turned thÂ« tables by aver
ring that he saw Jaoob strike and shake
Johnnie so roughly that he (Mr. Gross)
interfered, and jthat a moment later Ja
cob renewed his onslaught.
After complimenting Jacob on the loyal,

At this Juncture the complaining po

Eeport of the Mission to the

Colonial Authorities Collect
Taxes by Starving Help
less Wives and Children
PARIS, Sapt 27.â M." - elemental, Minis
ter of the Colonies, yesterday received
the report of the mission to the French
Congo sent \u25a0 out' last spring under Count
de Brazza, who on the return Journey
died at Dakar, a seaport of French West
Africa. In connection with the sending
of this mission a considerable sensation
was aroused owing jto the publication *of
charges against M. Gentil, Commissioner
General of the French Congo, alleging
maladministration and great cruelty to
the nativta. M. Gentil is now In Paris
in a precarious state of health.
Among the cases of cruelty contained
In the report is that of a number of na
tives who were flogged to death with
knotted whips. It is also asserted that In
order to force the natives to pay taxes
the Colonial Office at Banqul in May, 1904,
imprisoned fifty-eight women and ten
children, and that within five weeks for
ty-seven of these died of starvation.
A letter from. Count de Brazza, dated
August 24, Just before the beginning -of
his fatal return Journey, throws ' light on
the explorer's opinions of what he saw
in the Congo. In It he. says:
"J. found the conditions at Banqul In
tolerable. The people there were being
destroyed by requisitions. Everything
was done to hide the true state ;of af

KANSAS CITY. Sept. 27. â A letter
was received yesterday from James B.
Garneld of the Department of Com
merce and Labor by John M. Swenson,
City Attorney for this city, for infor
mation relative to the measures used by
the Standard Oil Company in this city.'
Garneld writes that the Federal Gov
ernment wants the evidence obtained
by the City Attorney as a matter of
record and it is not to be used in the
prosecution of the oil company for al
leged short measures.
Swenson was unable to secure a ver
dict of conviction in the Police Court
against the -oil company, as the- Judge
ruled that the oil cans should have been
tested by a standard of measurement
authorized by the statutes of Missouri
and no standard could be secured. Gar
field Bays that he will send a special
agent here to Inspect five-gallon cans
tested by the City Attorney and a re
port will be made to "Washington.

THE UNION COMPLETE.
THE action of the Democratic city convention completes tne
union of the two parly organizations in a joint effort to purge
cleanse the government of San Francisco. The steps taken
follow closely the plan by which Oakland has risen superior to politi
cal partisanship in securing a municipal government, separated from
national politics and constituted for the business of running a city on
clean, modern and enlightened lines. ". . - ;
With such a government Oakland has prospered. The popula
tion has received gi J eat additions every year. The progress of build
ing for residence ami business purposes has been extraordinary. Ex
penditures have been economized and the Council finds itself able,
without extra taxation, to recently inaugurate important projects for
beautifying the city. Lake Merritt is to have park and 'boulevard
surroundings worthy of that sheet of water, which is in itself a
scenic and sanitary asset possessed by no other city in the world.
In like manner, ahd without extra taxation, the park land on the
former marsh in West Oakland is to he improved, the main lake
sewer reconstructed and the marsh on its north side filled.
These and other important and valuable results have come tG
Oakland through, having a city government devoted to business and
jiot to inapplicable politics. The methods which secured' such a
government there should secure it here, and the leaders of the two
I'arK- organizations in San Francisco have honored themselves by di
vesting Themselves of partisanship and investing their organizations
with local patriotism. They cease to dissipate- their great power in
useless political contention and join it in a worthy effort for the
common good. The Call has preached without ceasing the high
needs of this city, and the way of their attainment, and both parties
have heard the sermon and heeded it.
The platform of the Democratic convention, makes these high
declarations of purpose: "We have no hesitation in expressing our
firm conviction that the general welfare of our citizens and the pros
perity, good name and destiny of our city depend in a large measure
upon the separation of municipal from State and national politics.
Jn all issues, therefore, which directly concern San Francisco,, we
believe there is greater and more immediate need for good citizenship
than there is for partisanship." The platform statement of the needs
of the city and the benefits to follow united actipn to meet them
cannot be excelled, and this damnatory part has the right ring: "We
believe that organized and united action of our citizens will put an
end to the complete and nefarious system of graft that has enriched
some men beyond the dreams of avarice, that has given equal treat
ment to all- men only upon the basis of equal pay, while it bestowed
with lavish hand special privileges upon those who could contribute
a special price â that complete and nefarious system of graft that now
fosters any vice for a percentage, permits the violation of any or
dinance or law for gain, and retards the development of our city by
holding up legitimate enterprises until it has levied the tribute of a
fee." -
The leaders of botli parties and their followers, constituting the
jrreat Grand Jury of the people, have now joined in a terrible indict
ment of the present municipal administration. The counts are many,
the proof abundant, and the trial will proceed to the verdict and
judgment in November. There can be no doubt of the verdict if all
men do their duty and crime be driven from the polls. The sup*
porters of the administration, the grafters and the vicious classes
who pay over a percentage of the profits of crime as the price of
immunity in its commission have done their worst in false regis
tration. Hut the eye of detective vigilance is upon them, and the
heavy hand of public vengeance is over them, and all their craft and
cunning will be ineffective in securing the authority of law for law
less use, if every citizen do his duty, in voting right and urging right
voting upon others.
The public officers in charge of registration have mostly shown
their sympathy with the machine in which they are cogs. In the
crowding of the last days and hours of registration the grossest fa
voritism has been shown to their own partisans. Illegal voters, wear
ing the graft button, have had the preference over legal voters in the
line who are the enemies of graft. Every art and trick has been tried
to secure for crime an undue advantage over decency, but the register
is a public document, it cannot be hidden, and the splendid organiza
tion'of the Republican League and of its allies," the Democratic pa
triots, will sift the tens of thousands of names, and the chances are
good that the sifting will start some more stuffers on the way to join
their companions in stripes who have gone before them to* the pen
itentiary. â¢ . i
There is exhilaration in the very air of the conflict. It is the
first time that a straight and unmistakable issue has been made be
tween decency and graft. No citizen need err. Every voter knows
exactly what he is voting for and what against. The cohorts of de
cency have to meet and overcome every one of the agencies of govr
crnment, now in the hands of the enemy. It is the storming of a
fortress, and the guns and ammunition paid for by the besiegers are
turned against them in battle. But they will prevail, and the strong
hold of vice and crime will be captured, and cleansed.
THE? TRAINED SOCIAL WORKER.
UNSCIENTIFIC philanthropy is so prone to do harm when it
intends only good, and to do good clumsily and half effectively,
that schools for specially trained social workers vvill have a
wide field of usefulness. The country is soon to have three thor
oughly equipped schools for that purpose. One has been estab
lished a year, the Simmons College, in Boston; the University of
Chicago is preparing to establish an Institute of Social Science and
Art; and in New York the School of Philanthropy opens in October.
These schools come into being in recognition of the fact tHat
philanthropy must be something more than emotional. When the
power of kindheartedness gets its training for -precision of effecK
in the systematic way that other sciences are undertaken, we may
confidently expect far greater results in the betterment of social
conditions. "A recent number of "Charities" shows to how extended
a class of. workers, the education of such schools would be useful.
The}' will not only be good for those who wish to devote themselves
\vhÂ«lly to philanthropic duty, -but all aspirants to administration
work, and teachers, preachers, managers of charitable societies and
physicians can -thereby get the* fundamental training for- wise social
activity. ;f ; .9 . i
. The Boston Transcript is authority for the statement that there
is a~ distinct market for these social^ workers upon their graduation
from this scientific training, and that numbers of young men and
women now going. through college are attracted^to ward this phil
anthropic work. There are young men who are thinking more
a&out making ove^ conditions rather th^n to bend their whole en
ergies to accumulating 'wealth, under present social defects, and
while there is. so much*, wrong, and suffering-in jhe world. \u25a0â¢* '

2VO I..UV AKKDED.
(Uo/ernor Folk j>ut himself, close. tÂ« .the
hearts of his heartre by telling, them that he
and his party were so impressed with the beau
ties of California that he believed a law should
be j.assed compelling every one in | thÂ« country
to pay a- visit to the Golden State. â From The
Call's l-cttortj
WHEN it comes to judging beauty
all of us out here agree.
That Missouri's honored leader is
" the ejtDert he should ue.
He knows where Nature, kindly dame,
ne'er wears ,a chilling frown.
While every day's a princess 'neath a
sunshine-elided crown.
Ah, yes, dear Governor, -we seÂ» that na
ture's charms you heed,
\u25a0Hut when you talk of law to makÂ» the
whole world westward speed.
Why, we file a brief demurrer, for It's
clear to us as day'
That glories here should lure a man, or
he should stay away.
Take from the grace of every land the
charm it loves the most:
Add beauty unto beauty in a love-cor
n\u25a0 pelling host; ; Â«â¢
Pile grandeur -upon grandeur, hang the
summit o'er.
Till man's utmost dream of glory can
conceive of nothing more,
And here in California, In our land of
Bprln'g and fall.
We'll meet and match them e'*ery one,
and add unto them all; .
r.U he who needs a' law to make" his
footsteps hither stray,
Why, excuse the repetition, but ned bet
ter stay away. *,
Here the grape aye turns to ambsr, and
the olive's silver's told;
Here the orange stores tjie sunlight in its
globe of yellow sold; â¢
Hero the autumns merge in springtime,
and the winter none doth know.
For 'tis then the lilies blossom and a mil
lion roses grow,
Ami there's not a whit, of difference in
the long diurnal line
Save ii- added bits of gladness or a little
more of shine:
And If any law is needed man to lur<Â» an>l
hold him thrall.
He should find it in Dame Nature, or
f Luulfl find it not at all.
Long our hearts have half forgo'-tan all
the rigors of the cold,
For our bleakest bit of winter blooming
roses dptJi enfold;
And we've walked so lons in sunlight
glimmering" white throughput the
year
That too scant is our thanksgiving for
our never-failing cheer, â¢\u25a0-\u25a0 \u25a0
But though we are recreants proven, yet
we know, and know right wall,
Happy Is a favored mortal in this Eden
land to dwell.
Still the law that lures men westward Is
enwrit where sunbeams play,
And if some man" needs another, he had
better stay away. ; .
imittHT YOUPfG MAN'S ESSAY.
Once there was a Bright Younjj Man
who, after much reflection, : decided that
he would write Good, True and Beautiful
Thoughts for the journals and thus eie
vate and upraise the Thoughtless Public.
So he sat down and thought and thought,
and after he had thought long enough
he wrote the Brilliant Essay from which
I quote:
','We- a.re .too, prone i to feel .that wealth
Is: the greatest:-". thing . in"- life,*. In the
bright scintillant splendor" of youth's
brief morning hour the : glitter Pf gold is
a lure to us and we snap at its Erilded
bait. Much .to enthrall and hold the
reader in the silken chains of .lojclc has
been written on this* subject and more
might fittingly be written, but not the
less does the baleful glimmer of the yel
low metal allure us and we find it diffi
cult to say of it,' 'This is enough: 1 If
this finds favor^with the 'editor I shall
cpntlnue the discussion 'in another, treat
ise. Thoughtfully yours for the right;
"K. 'RUFUS 'POGGS.' 1
There were about seventeen yards 'â¢' of
the essay, but the foregoing extracts give
a sufficient idea of It. .
Now it chancexl that the Editor to
whom the Brilliant Essay was sent was
a kindly, well-tiisposed man, and he said
to himself, : "I guess I had' better' give
Poggs a show." But in order; to do' this
of course it was necessary to do some
editinff. \u25a0 V â¢â¢\u25a0'."\u25a0\u25a0â¢ \u25a0';;,
â¢ So the Editor went to work. First he
blue-penciled; then he blue-penciled some
more, and .then be blue-Denciled again,
and yet again. Then he measured and
said to himself, "The derh thing still Is
too long for; the space I have." So he
blue-penciled some more,' and some more.
The next day young Mr. Poggs' Brilliant
Essay appeared in the Journal, and this
is the way it read;
"Wealth, is the greatest thing in life.
Gold is a snap. Much has been written
on this subject and more might be writ
ten, but this is enough. Thoughtfully
yours ' for the right, ' ' â¢ *
}\ " "X, RUFU3 POGGS."
If you will observe closely you will
note that the Editor did not publish a
word that Mr. Poggs did not writeâ
only, of course," some editing was-ad
visable.
But you "should have' heard 'the Brtght
Young Man talk when he saw his es
say as it was published! It was awful!
Moral: Mr. Poggs is/ not the only
Bright Young Man who 'has concluded
to elevate and upraise the Thoughtless
Public, only to' fall with a Dull, Sick
ening Thud.

ANDREW CARNEGIE DESIGNS
A COAT-OF-ARMS.
UNIQUE COAT-OF-ARMS PESIQMSD BY THE STEEfc MAGNATE.
Iff addition to many other belongings,
Andrew Carnegie is thÂ« possessor
of a coat of arms.. It was not, to be
sure, granted to an ancestor for prow
ess an the neld of battle nor for any
deed of valor. It has a much more in
teresting history. Any oneâ almost any
oneâ has a coat of arms, 'which has
been handed down to him like any other
heirloom. Mr. Carnegie had none such,
but, like the man of enterprise and
originality that he is, he went to work
and devised one and then he got an
artist. to paint it high tip on the walls
of his splended library, not the library
htj gives ftway pvery ether day, but his
own, in his fine New. York mansion.
Upon . the escutcheon there is . a
weaver's shuttle, because his father,
William Carnegie, was a weaver; 'ttjere
is also a "shoemaker's knife, because
an ancestor not very remote worked at
his trade of shoemaker. They say
plainly that he has no desire to ignore
his humble beginning and that he
wishes to. honor, the memory "of the
weaver and the shoemaker, his fore
bears, lie boasts not of Norman blood,
and honest hearts are more to him than
coronets.
Mr. Carnegie has /a coronet, or a
crown, for a crest, but it is reversed
and surmounted by the cap of liberty.
The supporters are the American and
Scotch flags, and the motto is "Death
to Privilege." It makes no difference,
of course, Beeing that the arms 'are
unique,- that according to laws of her
aldry, gpronets and .supporters are only
allowed with arms of peers, baronets
and knights of theVgarter." ' Upon his
own particular copies of his own books,
"The prosper of Wealth" for one, the
arms are emblazoned in blue and gold.
Apropos the arms of the Carnegie
family, "Biirke's Peerage" describes
half a dozen such. One, tljat of the
Newgate family, Scotland, Js or, an
eagle displayed azure, and In chief a
buckle between two amulets of the
second. ; Crest, two dexter hands gaunt
leted, issuing put of *the: clouds, con
joining &nd supporting a flaming heart
proper. The. motto, "Armls et Animis"
â by arms and by courage,
The arms of the Earl of Nprthesk,
who is of this family, show an # eagle
displayed charged with \ a naval crown
and over it the word Trafalgar. There
are two crests, the first the stern of a
line of battleships on flre. The sec
ond, out of a naval crown or a demi
leopard. Supporters, two leopards, each
with a banner : charged witl} the cross
qf St. George and inscribed "Britannia
Vlctrix," "Tache sans Tache"=â duty
without spotâ is the Nortfyesk motto.
Other Carnegie mpttoes are: "Video
Alta Sequprque"â l see and. follow high
things?; "Alls Aspicit Astra"-^flyingr he
looks to the stars. A dexter hand hold
ing a thunderbolt winged is the crest
of one Carnegie arms, with the legend
"Deum Tf mete'V-Dear God, or\"i3read
God," as it ap.pears-apon one coat of
armÂ§. - The Carnegies. of Lindsay have
for crest an ostrich with a horseshoe fn
his mouth, with the mptto, "Endure
and Suffer Bravely." .
Hr. Carnegie, it may be mentioned,
THE FARMER IS KING
QH, the mines may be rich with deposits of ore, V
With ingots ;of silver and nuggets of gold; '
And Iron and copper, from shore | unto shore,
Frpm the depths of the ea.rth ma y be constantly rolled.
But the .wealth of ! the world is an atom compared .
With the millions of dollars that annually spring
In the track of the plow, and the trail pfthÂ§ rake,
And tne path of the hoe, for the farmer is king.
His throne is a: stack of the -sweet-smelling hay,
His : crown is;the'gpld. of the parrot and corn,
His^Gepter.a sheaf of his newlyrcut wheat, V
His audience ' chamber the meadows of morn.
The pats' and the barley await his conrunand
Their : slender- green spears frpm the darkness to bring;
The orchards drop apples of gold at his feet,
â¢ And a 4? nature. proclaims that the farmer \a k|ng.
Columbia stands at the head pf the world, ': "..
v â¢ The goddess of liberty, plenty and peace, ;:.
To thefarmer she owes it that year after year ,
*\u25a0\u25a0'.â¢" Her riches, her power and her glories increase. â¢
May his furrow, be"' straight and his harvest be great,
. The scythe and the sickle Ipng. long may he swing.
Hats off 'as he passes,, a monarch of men, / â¢
All hall to' the farmer, the farmer is Jking!

Cairn, or came, a heap of stones â a
Druidical heap of. gtones^is given as
the word from whjch Carnegje is de
rived. The name also appears as Car
ney, Camie, Carnagie and Carnegy.
The Carries, of Glamorgan, Wales, take
their name from Pen Came, the birth
place of the first of the'family. But
this, too, goes back, to the. original
meaning of Came,
The Carnegies have been seated }n
Fifeshire for centuries, Andrew Car r
negie's family came from Dunf ermline,
borrowing .eleven shillings from a
friend to aid them to emigrate in 1847.
The story is told regarding this loan
that recently an American firm, doing
business- in, London, asked its patrons
to suggest ideas for the distribution
of Andrew Carnegie's wealth. Mr.
Hqn,ry .D. Lennox, pf Glasgow, advised
that the millionaire repay a loan of
eleven shillings made by his aunt to
the Carnegies when they needed help.
Mr. Lennox computed that, with inter-?
est, Â£9 was due.
Mr. Carnegie has. investigated and
found that the ; facts of \u25a0 the case had
bpen correctly stated. The debt was
not only paid, but Mrs. Lennox's (the
aunt) children have been endowed with
a sum sufficient to keep them ln-comr
fort as long as they live,
Mr. Lennox . said, regarding the mat?
ter: "When'.thq Carnegies left Dunr
'fermline they were so poor, that they
had to borrow money to,- take them to
the United States, My aunt, though a
poor . woman, helped', them ou^ to the
extent/of eleven shillings, but the
promise to" return the loan evidently
escaped the memory of the beneficiaries,
for they never repaid theT sum bor
rowed.*--:--*j>S'S . ' . - -
"My aunt is dead, but' she left two
daughters, one the wife of a humble
tradesman, the other a maiden lady, en
gaged in a small drapery business in
Edinburgh."
It seems that Mr- Carnegie called In
person on the child ren ot nls benefactor
and thanked them for the generosity of
their mother. From minys eleven
shillings to plus $350,000,000 is a story
suggestive of the Arabian Nights.
It is a twjpe told tale how the young
Scotch boy began life as a bobbin boy
at $1 20 s)i week. He was then. 12. years
old. At fourteen he was messenger in
a telegraph office. He was the third
operator in the United States to read
the Morse signals by sound. At fifteen
he was an expert telegraph operator;
a fe^y -years later he was train
dispatcher; at twenty-four railroad bu
perintendent.- At thirty he began hia
career as an Ironmaster. . He Is now
"seventy years youngr." '.

"SHOFERS"
The keen observer who is interested in

some of Pittsburgh millionaires to pilot
their wives and daughters around the

7s your handsome coachman?" is giving
way ttÂ» that of "Who is your handsome
chauffeur?" says a writer in the Pitts
burs Dispatch, - 1 noticed a smart car
drawn up In front of one of our big
dry goods houses yesterday afternoon
and I recognized the pretty woman who
alighted as the wife of one of Pittsburgh
wealthiest men. I noticed, too, that her
chauffeur was undeniably handsome and
well groomed, Jtnd that he manipulated
his car with the ease and grace of an
expert. While he waited the return of
his mistress he reached ! into his pocket
for some' change to purchase a paper,
when he carelessly dropped a quarter into
the gutter. After five minutes' diligent
fishing he recovered the piece of ailver,
In the meantime quite a crowd gathered.

AN ANCIENT MOTTO
"While I was up in New Hampshire
the other day," said Hon. John W.
Yerkes of Kentucky, at the Raleigh, "I
went through a historical house famed
throughout New England. It was built
in 1620, and every visitor to Portsmouth
makes a pilgrimage to the ancient
structure. I was greatly interested in
all that pertains to it, and. among other
things, was struck by a toast carved on
the walls that I do not remember to
have ever seen stated in . such pretty
phraseology.
"It ran like this: 'Here's hoping that
you may live as long as you want, and
that you may never want as long as
you llve.'"^ â -Washington Post,^^>
JOKE ON THE DOCTOR
- A Baltimore physician says that re
cently he boarded a Charles-street car
that was sadly overcrowded, relates
Harper's Weekly. He soon observed a
big German sprawled over an area suf
ficient to seat two persons at least,
while just in front of him stood a poor
wan woman, hanging to a strap. Jn
dlgnant at this exhibition of selfish
ness on the part of -'the German, the
physician tapped hini on the shoulder,
saying:
"See here! Why don't you move a
little, bo that this tired woman may
have a seat?"
For a mpment the German looked
dazed. Then a brpad smile spread over
his countenance as he answered:
''Say,, dot's a joke on you, all right!
Dot's my vlfe!"

MEN ON PAROLE
GIVEN WARNING
State Prison Directors Are
Enforcing Law Regarding
' the Conduct of Convicts
The State Prison directors intend to
deeply impress on the mmds of paroled
convicts that any violation of the con
ditions under which they are enjoying
liberty will result in their prompt ar
rest and reincarceration. It was stated
yesterday by one of the directors that a
strict surveillance is being kept on all
paroled men and any misconduct on their
part will cause their paroles to be re
voked. Under the condition of the parole
system a convict who is given his lib
erty is prohibited from entering any place
where drinks are gold. It was a viola
tion of th}s provision that caused William
J. gtafiton to be arrested Tuesday night
and sent back to 6an Quentin yesterday
to serve out seventeen years of a twenty
fiye year sentence for the murder of a
woman in Solano In February, IS'j6.
Stanton had served eight years of his
sentence for murder in the second de
gree, when he was paroled. He was
recommended for parole by some of the
most prominent men in the State, includ
ing Judges Lawlor. Cook, Kerrigan and
Mogan, Alfred B. Lawsen, Warden
Aguirre, Charles Spear, Senator Hoey,
Captain L<eale, Senator Tyrrell and John
C. Lynch. He%left the prison in No
vember, 1903, and later married. Several
days ago Prison Director Devlin received
a letter from. Stanton's wife in which
she accused him of maltreating her and
threatening her life. The local police
were asked to investigate Stanton's daily
conduct and it was discovered' that he
was visiting saloons and drinking heav
ily. Tbe Board of Prison Directors there
upon issued a warrant for his arrest and
Tuesday night Stanton was found drunk
in a saloon and promptly arrested. As
a^result of his violation of. the parole^
rules he will now have to serve out his
full sentence and will not even be allowed
the benefits pf credits. Discussing " the
Stanton* case, Director Felton said that
the pame treatment will be administered
In every case brought to the attention
of the prison board,

WHIRLING SHAFT
SCALPS A GIRL
Catches Woman Operative in
Los Angeles Factory by
Hair and Nearly Kills Her
LCJS ANGELES. Sept. 27.â Emma
Blauvelt, a ypung 1 woman operative in
an overall factory, was almost entirely
scalped to-day when her hair caught
In the rapidly revolving shaft which
propels the machinery for riveting but
tons on the garments. She probably
will die her injuries.
The young woman was seated before
a small riveting machine, which la
worked by a shaft making 190 revolu
tions a minute. ' This shaft is two
inches in diameter and revolves a small
rubber belt connected with the riveting
machine.
Miss Blauvelt stooped to pick up the
paper boxes standing under the shaft.
She leaned so near the revolvingr shaft
that her front hair was caught and
wound around it. When the top of her
head was drawn against the wall it
acted as a leyer and the ' relentless
shaft tore loose her scalp from just
above the eyes and lifted It gradually
until her skull was bare almost to the
neck. Then the shaft ceased to re
volve.
No one saw the accident, as Miss
Blauvelt did not 'scream..': but when the
machinery stopped the" man in charge
turned off the electricity and discov
ered the unconscious body of Miss
Blauvelt doubled up against the wall.

plained in this paper, corn and corn
meal, under tiiis arrangement, would
come to trie Pacific Coast at the same
rate* of fFeight. As the Pacific. Coast
brings its corn from the East to grind,
a rate on menl as low as the rate on
corn wifl result in crowding th,e Cali
fprnia and "otlicr Pacific Coast millers
from the corn meal business,
.Yesterday it was announced that the
Southern Paninc Company is going to
Join Jn opposing the change proposed
in til e corn a)>ri corn meal differential.
The reason of this is that at the sama
rate corn pays better to transport than
torn meal, because the corn Is of greater
bulk, is easily handled and is carried at
less risk. The interests of the overland
carriers and the Interests of the Pacific
Coast millers therefore coincide in this
matter. A large business is at stake
in the outcome of the differential mat
ter.

CLEVER AMATEUR
TO MAKE DEBUT
Meets. Harry Foley To-Night in Wood
ward's Pavilion in First Long Fight,
Al. Kaufmans Is a pronounced public
choice over Harry Foley for their
twenty- round fight In "Woodward's
Pavilion to-night, under the auspices of
the Hayes Valley Club. Foley was of
fered at the tempting odds of 10 to 6,
but he was not fancied at any price,
all the public demand being for Kauf
mann. This is a marked compliment
"to the ex-amateur^ unless there is an
understanding which would explain the
long price.
The contest is one of those affairs
between the boxer and the fighter.,
which always result well from a spec- j
tator's standpoint. The recent en- j
counter down at Colma between Jimmy !
Britt and Battling Nelson was of the
same character. Brltt furnished the
boxing end of the set-to, while Nelson
supplied the actual warfare. It will be
the same to-night, Foley being sup
posedly the boxer and Kaufmann the
tighter. In looking over the pages of
pugilistic history it will be found that
battles which involve a boxer
and a fighter have always been the
best contests.
It Is the opinion of . many that if
the contest is decided by a knockout
Kaufmann will be the one to score it,
while should the battle be a long af
fair and go the full twenty rounds,
Foley's chances look the brighter.
The rival "boxers finished their actual
training yesterday afternoon. Kauf
mann took a sharp run of two miles on
the road just to keep his wind in shape.
In the gymnasium In the afternoon he
boxed four rounds with big Joe Ken
nedy, punched the light ball for three
rounds and did two rounds of shadow
boxing, working altogether about
thlrty-flve minuses. This morning
Kaufmann will take a short walk of
about one mile. He will leave Ala
meda early In the afternoon, accom
panied by Billy Delaney and his
trainers. *-.Vâ
Foley did three times as much road
work as Kaufmann. covering more than
six' miles. He seemed fresh and bright
when he was getting ready for his rub
down. Foley 6aid he weighed a few
ounces less than 171 pounds when he
had finished his road running. In the
afternoon he worked for three-quarters
of an hour In the gymnasium, the work
Including four rounds of boxing with
Jack Johnson, six minutes of boxing
an Imaginary foe, and ten minutes at
the faÂ«st punching bag. The work was
light and fast and resembled that in
which his opponent indulged.
Jack Welch will referee the con
test. \u25a0 s--;-'^?'

ALAMEDA, Sept. 27.â Scandal as the

FIGHT VIEWS
ARE A SUCCESS
Exhibition Hall Is Thronged
at Both the Afternoon
and Evening Performances
Fortune is beaming" on Manager Jim
Coffroth these days. The sad, wan smile
which he wore on Admission day while
seated on the short flight of steps leading
into the ring at Colma has been replaced
by one of enormous proportions. On that
memorable occasion he was trying to de
termine how he could refund ,the money
to the fight patrons when it seemed there
would be no conteÃt. He knew thrifty,
get-rich-qulck peace official* had passed
in many eager spectators at a dollar a
head. Others had entered the arena un
der and over and through the fence with
out the formality of presenting the
necessary bit of pasteboard. He figured
the majority of these would be In line
when the checks were given out on which
money would be refunded. How to sepa
rate the sheep from the goats was the
problem confronting him. He- had not
reached a solution when Nelson entered
the ring and the situation was relieved.
At the present time he seems in the
graces of the fairy queen of the Christ
mas extravaganza, whose magic wand
turns into gold everything it touches.
His moving picture show at Mechanics'
Pavilion has been thronged at every per
formance, the receipts totaling something
like $2500 per day. .
Willus Brltt will give the first public
exhibition of the pictures in New York
to-day. Gregory Mitchell, a personal rep
resentative of Coffroth, leaves this morn-
Ing direct for Bpston, where he will give
exhibitions of the wonderful pictures.
Billy Roche, another . representative,
reaches Chicago to-day, where he will
Join forces with Lou Houseman, a clever
promoter. The latter handled the Cor
bett-Fitzslmmons fight pictures in the
Middle West, and one machine is cred
ited with. earning $135,000 for the people
Houseman represented. 'C -"-.v:*-
A theatrical man has made the predic
tion that if 100 sets of the Britt-Nelson
pictures could be sent out to-day over
carefully selected routes throughout the
world they would show gate receipts of
$500,000 within six months. The expense
of promotion Is comparatively small.
Nelson, on the advice of Manager No
lan, sold. his Interest outright for $5000.
Britt retained a one-third interest. .
The Battler is wearing out his fresh
young life in an endeavor to elevate the
stage.. Brltt in the meantime is spending
his afternoons on horseback oh the
shaded bridle paths of the park, while
one little machine in Mechanics' Pavilion
is earning more money . for him in one
day than Nelson earns in a week. When
the wheels of 'all the machines begin to
move Rockefeller and his associates will
begin to stare at Coffroth ' and Brltt.-

The Angels played ball like a lot, of
bushers at Recreation Park yesterday,
and the Seals had victory copped by the
time the fourth round had been reeled
off. It was a fierce-looking exhibition
from the outset. Instead of improving
with age, it degenerated till all the fans
felt ill.
Two pitchers unwound their offerings
on both sides. Rusty Hall got his in the |
fourth inning and Morley chased him.
He had nothing save his glove, and there
was surely something wrong with that.
Henley "forgot where the plate was dur
ing the mixup in the fifth, and he was
pulled out in the middle of the inning to
make way for Whalen.
The Seals led 2 to 0 , up to the fifth,
when they proceeded /to break the game up
for fair. Nealon ushered all the trouble
in by rapping a three-cushion boy to the
farthest corner of left field. Householder
laid one down to Brashear,; who booted
It. Then the whole Angel team went up
in the air. The Seals > bunted and wal
loped till they had five rui^s home. Goch
nauer brought in two of these by slam
ming a double to the right garden. Every
man in the team took a wallop in that
inning.
Hall was succeeded by a young man
named Brown, who says he comes from
Denver. Mr. Brown did not seem to have
anything, but he held the Indian sign
over the Seals. They only made one hit
off him. The run that . resulted in the
sixth came In when Cravath dropped . an
easy fly. Brown has -a lot of front and
likes to call the umpire. He is also there
with the real funny motions, and the
fans were kept husy sizing him up.
i CravathtiWSiÃÂ»the/atariJtÂ»ad : ,performer of
the day.-H e-made (t thcee* errors out in
right field. One of these came when he
dropped a fly. Another time he booted a
ball from Householder's bat, and again
he threw one away at the plate. The
score: "

RHEUMATISM
COMMON IN SUMMER
The time to get rid of Rheumatism is
in Summer while the blood is endeavor-
ing to purge itself of all poisons and im-
purities, and the skin is active, with all
the pores and glands open and able, rtaW
this way, to assist in the elimination. jW
Columbus, 0., 1355 Mt. Vernon, Aye.
Six years ago I had a severe asttaok oÂ£
Inflammatory Rheumatism, anA the doc-
tors I had did me no good. They changed
medicine every week and nothing they
prescribed seemed to help me. Finally
I left off their medicine and began the
useofS.S.S. My knee and elbow joints
were swollen terribly, and at onÂ© time
my hands were so swollen and painful
that I could not close them when opened.
I was getting discouraged, you may be
sure, when I began S. S. B.,but as I saw
it was helping me I continued it, and to-
day I am a sound, well man and have
never had a return of the disease.
- - .B. H. CHAPMAN.
The inactivity of the Liver, Kidneys and
Bowels causes the refuse matter to remain
in the system, which, coming in contact
with the different acids . of the body,
forms uric acid to be absorbed by the
blood and distributed to the different
joints and muscles, producing the pains,
; inflammation and other distressing sytnp-
1 toms of Rheumatism.' The wandering
pains of the disease remind the sufferer
that the poison is still in the blood and
he should lose no time in getting it out.

the * blood rich and pure. It " tones up

GOTHENBERG, Sweden, Sept. 27. â A
severe earthquake was felt at 1:30 p. m.
yesterday at 'Lundby, Hisingen Island.
It cracked the windows of houses and
fissured the surface of the ground.
Subterranean 'rumbling's were quickly
followed by the violent rocking of the
houses, the splitting of inner and outer
walls, driving the inmates to seek
safety in the open air. In many places
fissures a foot wide were opened up,
while the level of the 'ground in the
eastern part of the island sank appre

3IAY BLOCK PLANS'
OF THE GOULD ROAD
liockef eller Threatens to

orado Fuel Company: v
The , local officials . of the Weste rn Pa
cific Railroad Company, are worried over
the : recent "report from the East that
George Gould and John D. \ Rockefeller
are at outs in a financial way, for that
report has Just been 'followed by a quiet
tip from the : East l that 'the two million
aires, are soon to make; a hostile demon
stration-in Denver. On - October IS : the
annual meeting of the Colorado Fuel and
Iron Company, in- which both , Gould and
Rockefeller are interested; will be held in
Denver. â¢; r. Private reports ' received her*
ycsterdayV, say that Wall street la
anxiously looking ; ahead to > the â¢ meeting,
the outcome of "which means much to, the
Western Pacific road. >.
Shortly , after ' his ', return from EuropÂ«,
recently, Gould "caused it to be announced
through -his New York , brokers that his
heavy purchases ; of Colorado : Futl and
Iron stock -were for- the purpose' of gain
ing control of that. concern with a view
of " furthering . his plans for the : hurried
construction :of the . new ; road , to this
coas* A' few . days later . the statement
was madeâat Gould proposed to. use the
Colorado" Fuel and Iron \u25a0 Company's plant
as a source of supplies for the new road.
It was his intention, to -have the rails
for/! the '. We stern â¢ Pacific ; made by that
concern, thus .; much expense in
the way of freight and cost of production
and a'great deal of .valuable 'time. .
Should the coming meeting result in
Rockefeller and Harriman, who Is also
a holder of Colorado Fuel and Iron stock,
ousting Gould from" the company.^ It Is
feared that a serious setback will be
given the new Gould enterprise, for Gould
wijl have 'considerable "difficulty in se
curing; an early delivery of : rails and
structural material r from the large mills"
of the East, now rushed with orders.
It was reported yesterday 'that General
Counsel Bartnett's; hurried departure for
New York Tuesday night was for the ;
purpose fof ' conferring with Gould con- <
cerning | the interruption of
the Western Pacific p?ans. It was also
learm d that President F. J. Hearne of
the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company is
already In New York awaiting Bartnett's
arrival. .

ADMINISTRATION
FEARS RUPTURE
Approaching Crisis in Kela
tions Between France and
Venezuela Closely Watched
ON A SECRET raSSIOX
Belief, in Washington That
Penfield Bears Message
From President to Paris
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27.â A1l signs
point to a growing apprehension on the
part of the Roosevelt administration con
cerning the strained relations between
France and Venezuela as a result of the
nullification of the French Cable Com
pany's concession and the refusal of Ven
zuela to treat with M. Taigny, the French
Charge at Caracas.
The belief prevails on the part of cer
tain prominent persons here whose inter
ests cause them to watch Venezuela af
fairs closely that Judge William L.. Pen
field, Solicitor of . the Department of
State, sailed for Europe on September 5,
not on a mission to investigate commer
cial relations between Europe and South
American countries, but on a more deli
cate duty connected with the fast ap
proaching crisis between France and
Venezuela.
Judge Penfleld made a hurried trip to
Oyster Bay early in September, when the
Venezuelan courts had rendered a decis
ion adverse to the â¢ French Cable Com
pany. It was known here that France
would not submit to this decision and
that relations between M. Taigny, the
French Charge at Caracas, and the Vene
zuela Government were fast. approaching
the breaking off point. It was even then
apparent that France would not be able
to get the satisfaction she desired through
her legation in Caracas.
Mr. Calhoun was already in Venezuela.
Recent advices from there state that he
has spent hours every day in consulta
tion with the French Charge. This can
not be in relation to any of the pending
questions between the United States and
Venezuela, which are the New York and
Bermudez Asphalt Company controversy,"
the Jaurett, Critchfleld and Orinoco
Steamship Company claims.
When ' the allies made their demonstra
tion in 1903 it was said that President
Roosevelt never again would- permit a
foreign warship to engage in such a com
mission, 'but would himeslf endeavor to
influence the adjustment of rows between
European Governments and South Ameri
can republics so that there would be no
need for military coercion

DISCUSSES NEW
NAVAL SURGERY
General Surgeon Suzuki of
* Japanese Navy Addresses
the Military Convention
CLEANLINESS ESSENTIAL
Clean Clothing Saves the
Mikado's Wounded Sailors
From Blood Poisoning
DETROIT. Mich.. Sept. 27.â General
j Surgeon Suzuki of the Imperial Japan
ese Navy, to-day In his address before
the convention of military surgeons of
the United States, made what was de
clared by Medical Director J. S* Wise
of .the United States ! Navy to be ' the
most valuable contribution of modern
times to naval surgery. ' .
"Much of our success In the treatment^
of wounds," said Dr. Suzuki, "I ascr^M
to the fact that before every engagement^
I I ordered each member of the crew to
bathe and put on perfectly clean under-.
clothing. In a great many cases of shot
wounds fragments of clothing are car
ried into the body and our insistence on
clean underclothing prevented many cases
of blood poisoning among our wounded.
"Our experience during the war proved,
that the conning tower of a warship is a
most dangerous situation; fragments of
shells penetrating through the slits in
the tower made to furnish the command
ing officer a range- of vision do great
damage. Realizing this fact. Admiral
Togo, in the naval engagements, directed
his fleet from the compass bridge of the
Mlkasa without receiving the slightest
wound.
"The vision of the men who firÂ© tha
guns on a warship must necessarily be
of the very best if their shots are to
count. Before every engagement the sur
geons- in tho Japanese fleets examined
carefully the eyes of all tha gunners.
Any of them found with slight impair
ments of vision were treated and if tho
impairment was too grave to yield to
immediate treatment they were trans
ferred to another station and their places
filled by men whose eyes were perfect."
An address by Colonel Valery
Havard. U. S. A., on his experiences
with the Russian army in Manchuria
was the feature of the afternoon ses
sion of the convention. Colonel Havard
said that losses from artillery flre in
the Russo-Japanese war were greater
from this source than in any previo^J
war. He ascribed this somewhat to '.%mt
fact that' much of the time of the ar
tillery flre between the two armies was
so heavy that it prevented the men
from getting into close contact to make
their rifle flre effective.

The New York circular of J. S. Bache &

The course of prices was generally upwara
cur;sg the wetk under the influence of a mora
favorabi* outlook for money due to the en
t utÂ« merit of ovtr four million dollars goia ror
import and subst&nilal gains maJe by tne
.New York banks In their sub-treasury Â°PÂ«ra'
tiocs. Abroad, money was easier, the aan {f
of England discount rate remaining unchanged
tt 3 per cent Proreseional eentlmtnt was de
cide Sly mixed and the public interest in the
ir.arket was considerably less than lor stfme
v.-^ks ijast. Prices were large.y dominated
by the operations of cliques advancing spe
c aluee. and this upward movement affected
the gt-neraJ list f> mpatheucally. Sentinvnt
jtfnfrally was rather optimistic, as It we* !elt
tn c co-aree of the money market demonstrates
Ci-tr'.y tnat leading bankers are bulllth.

"W- atauuy is enjoying prosperity in ntarly
every I'ranch of io-iustry. the exceptions being
the titununous coal trade, in which there is
& laire overprpiuction, ar.d in certain lines of
manufactured commodities, such as glucoÂ«o
products. These soft spots in the business
situation ere negligible ie comparison to a
tf-ntrai high level of induttrial activity. Steel
Billets have l**n advanced officlsJly to $25 a

is increasing. Rail orders of well over one

iarsrtly professional and under the influence of
closely held specialties. Prices are high and
the public shows little inclination to come into
the ir.arket on a big scale at the moment.
ConsequentiX; a traders' market will .probably
rule, in which etamiarti s!-.aree, such as the
Gould. Morgsx and Harrinian issues. and
those of the Pennsylvania group, are a pur
chase on Kcescions and a saie on raJlire.
%'&xues ir.in^ priow is the k.ne run and we
feel cocflder.t that in the near tuture the
market will work to a higher level."

BOSTON, Sept. 27. â The activity in Coppers
still continues and we are having the best
market tor many months. Centennial was the
feature to-day. Jumping three - points on con
centrated buying, with 29 bid for 500 shares
at the close. Allouez advanced- still further,
but after the opening was subject to consider
able liquidation. Ail thÂ« bullish talk at pres
ent seems on- the properties which have or
have had prospects of the Kearsarge lode.

sion' is that New Orleans selling Is for New

ton report. It makes the December in the aver"
age condition of crop bnly.3 per csnt deteriora

were 719 tons, of which fully 500 tons was of

The market rules -very firm at the \u25a0 improved

' "There were 3300 .- tons of , Hay â¢ shipped to

though we believe we' will; have relief In this
connection within a week or 'two. ThÂ© market'
here is featureless with respect to the demand,
for nothing" is '-being shipped away and; on
the market.nobody seems to.want Hay except
the retailer's who carry very light stocks. -
"The continuance of fair weather is helping

fore a bit weak at the moment, although a
good rain would change conditions very ma*
terially. , .
"Straw, Is .being^shipped : in' very sparingly

There was a scarcity of fancy river Pota
toes during the early trade, as the principal
boat was very late, but prices showed no Ira- 1
provement, the market being heavily burdened
with carried-over stock and trade quiet. Fine
Salinas Burbanks were scarce and held at a
slight advance, .while common- stock was still
pressed for sale at easy rates. Onions were
quiet and weak. \u25a0 , .-,
Miscellaneous vegetables were plentiful and
generally weak. Nearly all of , the day's ar

EAST HAS ITS EYES
/ ON GOLDEN STATE
J. Raphael Says Wherever
One Turns He Hears of
San Francisco.
Julius W. Raphael of the well-known
firm of Raphael's Inc., 9, "t0 15 Kearny
street, has Just returned from the East
and gives some Interesting results of his
observations, especially as to California's
status in the great commercial center.
Speaking yesterday \of his experiences
Mr. Raphael said: .
In Saw York - everything is Â«vÂ« v California,
wherever . one iurtis one hear* oÂ£ San Fran
cisco.' - -
Prominent' business men are looking thii
way with keen eyes on the future Industries of
the coast, feeling: certain that substantial In
vestments here will "have 4 â¢ greater chance of
doubling in value than will any investment in
Wall street. Â» . - : \u25a0- . *â¢\u25a0 <
Yes, the eyes of the New Yorker are turned
from gambling on the street to the golden op
portunities of California.
It is only speaking the truth to say that
Tom Laweon has frightened men' of moderate
means from dabbling \u25a0in â¢ speculative - stocks,
with the result that all legitimate industries
and those of this coast; especially, will reap a
large and permanent . commercial impetus.
Such a. radical . change . in' New York could
never have been even hoped,' for two years ago.
Money that has been going into rash gambling
and .doubtful 'speculation Is, now finding its
way Into legitimate .commercial channels.
This is naturally ' a healthful sign for the
future sound prosperity of our. great, nation.
The- stand . for- honesty and. clean men in all
walks of life taken by â¢ President Roosevelt
has had its palmary effect, and to-day no man
is so revered in New York City as la the
President. â¢ ; . \u25a0 :
â¢Trade \u25a0 and * commercial conditions in the
great metropolis are flourishing, and the hum
of industry can be' heard from the Battery
far-away beyond theHudsonV
The country throughout I found', to be in a
thrivlns' condition. '. â¢ ,".V- -

WOMAN ASSAILS
INSURANCE MAN
Mrs. Alois L. Lejeal, Wife of
} Capitalist, \u25a0\u25a0vHurisi^Thqijias"
Godwin Through Window
SAVES HDI EKOM FALL
As the Object of Her ., Wrath
Is Dropping to Eavement
She Seizes Him by the Coat
A foud of a year's standing between the
family of ' Alois L. I^ejeal", 1 ; capitalist,
and Thomas Godwin, manager of the Pre
ferred Accident Insuranco Company, re
sulted yesterday morning In Mrs. Lejeal's
knocking Godwin through a third-story
window of the Manhattan' Hotel. -Just as
Godwin was about to topjile over ,-the '* sill
to thÂ« sidewalk, Mrs. Lejeal seized him
by the coat and pulled htm back- again.
The Manhattan, is a' quiet family hotel
and the encounter has caused.' all sorts
of wild. gossip anjong the inmates.
Mrs. Lejeal- was talking with Mrs. John
P. Gallagher, wife of the. proprietor,
when, she declares; Godwin came upstairs
and . made some slighting remark about
her. Instantly' the 'Indignant- .woman
pounced upon him. Though she is short
in stature and not very string, she struck
him a blow that staggered 'him and shov
ed him toward the window. V
The blow musf have bewildered God
win. He was borne unresistingly to the
window. There was a crashing of - shat
tered glass and the man hung out of the
third story window. Just as he was about
to fall to the stone pavement, nearly 100
feet below, Mrs. Lejeal dragged him back.
When asked about the episode at his
office in the Mills building, "l must Bleep
over this affair." he said. "I will nay
nothing about it now."
Mr. and Mre. Lejeal werÂ« interviewed
in their apartment at the Manhattan Ho
tel last night. Lejeal said: ,
I "About seven years ago my wife and I
had a little difference. Through a misun
derstanding the jj matter almost reached
the divorce courts. It was adjusted, how
ever, \u25a0 and we were reconciled. . We have
been living together here happily ever
since.
"This man Godwin .got .hold of that
old story and spread it about the hotel.
It came to my. ears and about two weeks
ago I met him In the lobby. I told him
that if any more stories of the same sort
were circulated I would hold him to an
swer personally."
"Yes," put in Mrs. Lejeal, "and there
was also the trouble . about the apart
ments."
"A year ago, when we left for the sum
mer, Godwin asked if- we were going to
leave.. I told him that it was only tem
porarily. After that it seemed as if he
were trying to hound' us from the place.
Yes, my wife did strike him. She saved
his life, too. Had she not caught him in
time he would have fallen to the side
walk and been killed.";
"He came upstairs and insulted me
openly before Mrs. Gallagher," declared
Mrs. Lejeal. "I am very sorry that it
beppened. I dread the notoriety, but my
indignation carried me away. I could not
waif td;teH my husband. Si just flew at
him then and there. | It is very unfortu
nate, but I think that any woman would
have done the same."
Mr*. Lejeal: is a mild-mannered woman
and evidently regrets the occurrence.
There is nothing of the Amazon about
her. The Lejeals have been living at the
Manhattan for seven years and every
body there seems to think well of them.
They have three grown- children. .The
story of Mr. and Mrs. Lejeal is . borne
out In the ". main by the hotel proprietor.
John P. Gallagher, and his wife.
What will be the outcome of the affair
is the- ruling gossip about the Manhattan.
Godwin declines positively to sky what he
will 'do. The Lejeals declare that all they
want Is to be left alone. , ; : .
"We have never annoyed Godwin," de
clared Lejeal. "He seemed to have taken
a spite against us about a. year ago. He
dug uÂ» old stories about my wifeâout
rageous lies'â and Spread them broadcast.
He got only what, he deserved. : If he ever
bother's us again I . shall take steps to
stop him effectively."

FIGURES ALSO OFFERED
Hppe That Proof of Codicils
Being a Forgery Will Be
Stibwn .by the Bequest
Again' the .entire: day's proceedings In
the Davis will 'contest before Judge Ker
rigan, was devoted ; to the submission of
samples; of the late .capitalist's hand
writing, by .attorneys; for the contestant.
In addition- to \ samples of handwriting,
many sheets *of paper bearing innumer
able columns of ;" figures in ; Davis' hand
were entered as evidence and will have
weight in determining the genuineness
of the: codicil. : : - - V
1 Throughout" the day Attorney Richard
Belcher was on the stand identifying the
handwriting "submitted and it is -likely
that his arduous ordeal will be continued
to-day. ? Notwithstanding the delay in the
proceedings,' there '.was . a . good . sized
crowd lin the courtroom, the â¢ amount of
money involved, in the contest making It
a trial of unusual Interest.
In a letter book containing copies of
letters from July 19, 1903, to March 19,
1904, r there are - lead pencil V continuations
of letters that failed to ; reproduce prop
erly, are among the many docu
ments - offered by the contestants. -In a
letter ( dated" February, 17, * 1904. jto j Fran
cisca B. -'. Scamman, .who is .left* a : be
quest 'in '.the? codicil. Davis ''mentions that
he was i troubled^with heart failure. :Re
garding'; his. condition he says: :"I am
so weak In my lungs : and heart that I
can scarcely walk "up the stairs leading
from the sidewalk to my office. I . am
in no pain ; I sleep j fairly . well â¢ and my
appetite is fair. My' legs' from the knees
down are somewhat swollen, which 'the
doctor says is dropsy." . \
It was a month after this letter was
sent that Davis was forced to have as
sistance in climbing the office stairs and
from that time he failed rap.idly until
his condition compelled his removal to
Lane Hospital on April. 1, 1904, ' where he
died on April 5.' . ._ ',
The â¢ submission Sof documents contain
ing; nothing but figures in Davis" hand
writing has given rise to 'the rumor that
the .contestant ; proposes to 'prove the
codicil a forgery by means of the figures
in the document. This the attorneys
would neither affirm nor deny.
In a second letter, book covering a pe
riod from June 12, 1901, to 'July 22, 1903,
there are several lead pencil signatures of
Samuel .Davis. which show slight
variance. '*\u25a0".\u25a0": ."\u25a0->"\u25a0 , ,
With -the entry of several small books
and diaries /upon the records as evidence,
the day's L proceedings, ended. An ad

until 10:30 o'clock this \ morning. \u25a0

BURGLAR FIRES
SHOT TO KILL
Louis; Lovey Narrowly Es
capes Death at Hands of
Bold Midnight Maraiyier
.Louis LovÂ«y of 169 Carl street had a
thrilling experience with * a.;' burglar
who invaded the bedroom occupied by
him and his wife Tuesday night. When
the criminal saw that he had been dis
covered he fired point blank at Lovey
with, a pistol, narrowly missing him,
and . fled. ~
The burglar made his entrance
through a basement door, which had
been left open by a milkman. He crept
softly into the house and made his way
to the room where Lovey and. his wife
were sleeping.
Mrs. Lovey was awakened by a noise
in the room. She looked up and saw
the burglar trying to open a bureau
drawer. The woman screamed in ter
ror, waking her husband. Lovey
leaped out of bed and tried to grapple
with the fellow. The" burglar.' drew a
pistol and fired. The pistol was so near
Lovey's face that the flash blinded him
temporarily. When he recovered from
the shock itheiburglar. was gone.
\u25a0Hastily drawing on a pair of shoes
Lovey gave chase In his pajamas. The
burglar ran toward Parnassus avenue
and quickly disappeared, dropping his
revolver^ in his flight.
V. O. "T. Long'of UO3B 'Shrader street
heard- the. shot and : hurried" to , the
Lovey.- house. â¢â¢ "Get a policeman,"
shouted the burglar. "A man has tried
to kill -my wife." Long ran to the- Park
police station and got Sergeant Boyd
and Policeman Kerrison. The ruse suc
ceeded and the burglar made good his
escape before the officers arrived.
The burglar is described as very
short and of slight build. He wore a
black derby hat and a dark suit: Lovey
said that he could .not be more, than
20 years old. The burglar did not get
acent's worth. of loot, as all the val
uables in^the. place, were in the bed
room.- The pistol used* by the burglar
is in the possession of tha police. It
Is \ a hammerless 3 S -caliber revolver of
cheap make.
