ANNOUNCES
FINDING OF
WIFE'S WILL
Dr. HempMll Tells
Flock Document
Is in Hand.
Testament Is Turned
Up by People Clean
ing Pastor's House.
Discovery of Important Paper
Lifts Load From Min
ister's Mind.
The lon* searched for will of the late
Mrs. Uzzie HempMll. wife of Rev. Dr.
Hemphill, has at last been found, much
to tha relief of the venerable pastor of
Calvary Presbyterian Church, who has
V been anxiously hunting for the missing
â¢ document for a number of months. In a
bureau drawer in the Hemphill home on
Broadway, hidden beneath a strip of pa
per that covered the bottom of the re
ceptacle, the will, executed eight years
ago by Mrs. Hemphill, was discovered
yesterday by Sexton Radcliffe of Calvary
Church, and his wife, while they were
Â«:. gaged in cleaning the house. Dr. Hemp
hill was immediately apprised of the fact
*nd was not slow in notifying his law
yers, who will present the document to
judge Coffey to-day.
The finding of the will was made at a
most opportune time, for it was learned
last night from E>r. Hemphill that he had
agreed with his wife's daughter, Mrs. J.
\V. D*;: ir li of London, to divide the estate,
which is valued at $120,000, and thus prer
eluded the continuance of the proceedings
instituted by Mrs. Daniell several 'weeks
Â£KO co ha,Â« t^e-cÃtitte divided. So pleased
â¢was Dr. HemDhlll. over the discovery of
the will that be made known the fact to
the members of his congregation, who
â¢fathered at a church meeting last night.
He said he was tired of the worry that
tfce litigation had caused him and was
glad that the mystery surroundins the
disappearance of the will, which he knew
hi s wife had made, had finally been
cleared uj>.
COPY DECLARED INVALID.
The failure to find Mrs. HemphiU's will
after her death on March 20. 1905, was
followed by no end of trouble to Dr.
Uernphill, who declared several months
ago thai he would willingly give 510.000 to
recover ihe document. In the absence of
* the will Dr. Hemphill went into court
v.iih a copy of the document, which, by
Competent testimony, was shown to
have been drawn up by Attorney Mount
foru Wilson in I*o7. The will devised in
trust to Dr. Hemphill the entire estate
for tlie benefit of himself. Mrs. Daniell
of Jvondon. daughter of Mrs. Hemphill,
Elizabeth Parker Hastings and Hairy C.
Hastings, rhildren of Mrs. Daniell by a
former husband, and H. Sydney Beck, a
brother of the deceased, and his three
Ciiildnn. Mrs. lizzie Taibott, Henry P.
Beck and Mrs. ]ra Robira-on.
Hardly had Dr. Hemphill petitioned
fur letters of administration on the
copy of the will before k contest was
Instituted by Mrs. Danicll, whose law
.y*rs not only <ju^stfoned the legality
of probating ba estate on a copy of a.
\u25a0will, but also intimated that if the orig
inal document was found later \u25a0 and
contained the trust provision they
xv<uld right it bitterly in the courts.
On March *_'9 of this year Judge Coffey
decided the copy of the will invalid,
but ini mediately afterward appointed
Dr. Hemphill administrator of his
wife's estate and fixed the latter's
bund at $2500.
VIXDIXG OF WILL.
Since then there have been rumors
of a compromise between Dr. Ilemphill
end Mrs. Daniell, and the statement l
r.mdc by Dr. Hemphill last evening con-
Jirms the theory that he was preparing
to forestall the threatened contest that
Mrs. Daniell had instituted. In the
, absence of a will Dr. Hemphill would
have been entitled to half of his wife's
estate and her daughter to the other
half. With the finding of the will Mre.
Daniell, if her purpose is to secure an
Immediate distribution of her mother's
estate, will have to enter another con
test to break the trust clause. What
the other relatives of the deceased will
do is, only a matter of speculation.
It was stated last night by Dr. Hemp
hill that Mrs. Danieii's London attor
ney Is due here to-day, he having start
ed to this country, with the Idea that
a settlement with his client would be
effected on his arrival. Dr. Hemphill
had abandoned all hope of ever finding
the will and had. also* decided to rent
his Broadway home. It was with a
view of carrying out this latter de
termination that he engaged Mr. and
Mrs. Radcliffe to clean the house, and it
was while performing their work that
they came upon the missing will.
TROUBLES WITH HUSBAXD.
The friends of the Hemphllls had looked
forward to the hear*Mg of Mrs. Daniell's
contest with much uneasiness, for It was
feared that the many troubles of the
woman with her English husband, which
filled the papers several years ago, would
be thoroughly aired in court. Mrs.
J)aniell hurried home â¢ from London 'six
years ago and the fact was followed by
a story that she contemplated suing her
husband for a divorce. Dr. Hempnul,
Just previously, had gone -to London,
presumably for the purpose ot restoring
peaceful relations in the Daniell house
hold there and had partially succeeded
when there was another outbreak of hos
tilities.-
Daniell accompanied his " wife to San
Francisco, and on his way across the
continent he became engaged in a quar
rel with Nick Kittleman, the horseman,
who had resented Daniell's alleged un
manly treatment of his wife and had
threatened to whip the husband. After*

Epeclal Olepatcb to The Call.
HERMOSILLO, Mex.. Oct. 11.â A mes
senger reached here. Tuesday night,
bringing to Victor Aguilar, a wealthy
ranch proprietor, the news that a band
of fully fifty Yaqul Indians has sacked
his ranch near Carbo, killing Romualdo
Lopez, who had charge of the place,
the members of Aguiliir's family and
two cowboys. Lopez and his men
made a brave resistance, but were
overwhelmed. A third cowboy was
chased by the Yauuis, but succeeded
in escaping to a nearby ranch. A re
lief party, was at once organized by
neighboring' ranchers and when they
reached the scene they found that Lo
pez's wife, two small children and a
babe a few weeks old had been mur
dered by the Indians. The ranch housw
had been looted. A runner was at once
dispatched to -Hermosillo for help,
while the Mexicans on the outlying
ranches l*cd to Carbo for safety.
Governor l'sabel has sent a company
of the Twentieth Regiment to Carbo,
from which point It will take the field
against the rebellious savages. Gov
ernor Ysabel returned Sunday . from
Carbo with a number of Yaqiils cap
tured by a force under his command
in the vicinity of the latest uprising,
which is supposed to be a retaliatory
act on the part of the Indians who es
caped.
KISSI^S NOT PEIULQUS
UNLESS PJ{O]iONGED
CINCINNATI. Oct. ILâ All of Cincin
nati's doctors do not agree with the dec
laration of Professor F/ournie? at the
tuberculosis convention in Paris that
there is extreme risk in kissing.
"Before calling kissing -criminal and
dangerous," said Dr. E. F.Beebew, "one
should bear In mind that there are many
times more germs beneficial than there
are malignant ones. Everything we
touch, everything we cat or driuk la full
of germs. So who shall say a kiss is
more dangerous than anything else we
do?" ,
"A kins in Itself is not dangerous," de
clared Dr. Albert Fat!r-r. "unless one of
the kissers coughs in the other's face or
some time there Is some other violent
exhalation produced. There is no "danger
fiom mere moisture- of the lip?. Danger
ous gfrms corns- from the. lungs and bron
chial tubes. Therefore a long kiss is niore
dangerous than a short one." â¢
"It is no crime to kiss,", declared Judge
Caldwell. former Mayor of Cincinnati,
"providing the .other party is willing. Of
course, a kfts becomes an assault If : force \
is used. The danger in kissing, claimed
by the doclyrs" is something I. don't' know
anything t about.- y I never got . anything
worse than" fever- blisters as the result
of a' kiss and I don't think all the doc-:
tors say about', the perils of osculation
will prevent a single kiss."

The- Ihuss beat Quinn on the head and
face with the butt end of -a revolver,
knocking out all of his teeth arid leaving
him sweltering in his own blood on the
depot Dlatform at,Hazen. That Quinn
succeeded in saving his diamonds and
money is due to the fact that he had them
concealed in a belt which was around his
waist. With his. face, swathed in band
ages and very muchp the, worse for his
terrible. experience, Quinn passed through
Reno to-night en route ; to San Francisco.

BERKELEY, Oct. â¢ 11.â With ' the blood

tralian horseman, staggered into the liv
ery stable of the. California Livery Com

lying on -the stable floor in a pool of blood'
told, between gasps, a most extraordi

hands and attracted the attention of a

and led him down to the stable of the

At Roosevelt Hospital, on Dwight way.
physicians attended him. Dr. Gillihan
stating: that Ellis' skull was fractured
and had been trepanned. The physicians
say that. Ellis" condition is critical, but
that he has a chance to survive.
The bullets .that were aimed at him
mi3sed their mark, as no wounds of this
character were found on the body.
lCllte came to San Francisco on the steam
| sh!p Sierra a week ago from Sidney, Aus
tralia. He had become acquainted with
a man who gave. his name as Brush in
Australia, representing himself to be a :
horseman acquainted with racing condi
tions in America! This formed the basis
of\an acquaintance, ;and as Ellis desired
to be introduced into the racing game
in America he considered Brush to be a
valuable acquaintance. Ellis loaned Brush
$200 on tho steamer, and had made ar
rangements to go to New York with
him. The rncn were to. be accom
panied by a' woman, . who posed' as the
wife, of Brush. The start was to have
been .made to-night.'- - -
Ellis had on. his person $5000 in English
notes, to be used as a reserve - fund on
the. trip. Brush knew, that Ellis carried
this money, and with his female com
panion planned to lure Ellis into a house
in: quiet Berkeley, and there assault and
rob him. \u25a0 - ;\u25a0\u25a0; , \u25a0 ,
The members of the trio met at the
Hotel Touraine in Oakland this afternoon
at 2 o'clock. , Ellis has been living at
the Touralne- for, a week, while Brush
made his headquarters in San Francisco,
spending much of his time in company
with the Australian. The clerk at the
Touraine_ says that Brush, and a: woman,
neither giving -a name, asked at - tha
hotel for Ellis'this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
A few hours before, all of Ellis' luggage
had been, sent "to San -Francisco in "prep
aration for the trip to New. York.
Apparently ..-. the plan of the , conspira

rob and perhaps murder, him there.; When

Husband Who Eobbed Park

to 1 Life Without Love
Despondent because his wife would
not live with him, and brooding over the
iact that he had robbed a man in the
park, Charles G. Hatfield gave himself
up to the police ytsterday.
He told. Captain Rejnulis that he was
cespondent, and Uid not care -what be
came of him. He <* looked dejected and
woebegone when he presented himself
to tbe police station and his statement
in no way belied his aj.pearance.
He said that he had married Miss Claire
Staity, May 2, 1904. and that they had
eJways had a ha:d time to get enough
to eat and a place to sleep in,- On July
17 last, be ta:u. he was desj>eiate, as he
and h:s wife had been hungry for two
days. He said he tried all that morning
to get any Jcb he could, to earn "enough
.iconey to buy something for supper. He
fa-Iled, and then in a tit of desperation,
he borrowed a revolver and went out
to Golden Gate Park, wht-re he held up
and robbed Louis Compart of $12. This
money he took home to his wife. When
she Itarntd that he had turned high
wayman she was horriried. and said she
could not live with him any longer, and
left him. Hatfield then went to work for
'a while at the wire works on Sixteenth
'and Mission streets, but his health was
poor, and he was only able to earn a
emal! pittance by working short hours.
.-His wife in the meantime had gone to
â¢work in a delicatessen store. Daily he
*"cuij â¢ go to her and plead with her to give
up her work, and come and live with
Jiim. She always told him that she could
not forgive him for robbing Compart.
Yestfrday he went to her again and told
"her he had decided to give himself up
to the law. unless she would live with
him. She again refused and he walked
straight to the City Hall and is now behind
bars. Previously to surrendering him
self he wrote a long tetter to his mother
in-law, Mrs. Blanche G. Staley. who lives
In RÂ«Â»no, Nevada. The epistle was
freighted with requests for forgiveness
for his actions and with protestations
that he still loved his wife.
. The robbery of Compart was reported
to the police the day after it happened.
Mrs. Hatfield visited hÂ«r husband last
night at the Hall of Justice. When they
met in tho corridor of the Jail they mere
ly thook hands and then sat down side by
tide, on a bench. Hatfleld looked sad and
<St"jt-cted. After a short conversation the
young wife quietly took her leave and
went sadly down the elevator to the
street.- Before going she said that Hat
field's statements were true, as he had
detailed them to the police. She said
she had lived with him as long as she
could. She had suffered starvation and
had hgdto go and stsk friends to take
her in .because they had no place to sleep.
She- said she still loved her husband, but
under existing circumstances she could
ftot live with him. Mrs. : Hatfield is
young and very pretty and highly edu
cated. She was on the operatic stage be
fore she married Hatfield.

hold \u25a0up the Reddlng-Delamar" stage~ was
apprehended to-day, but turned out to bf
.innocent. Driver Dur^er. toidvf he officers
and the Coroner's jury that : the bandit
resembled George Cody," a teamster who
left Delamar with a "30-30 rifle Sunday
morning. The fact that Cody did not re
turn to camp led to an investigation.
Detective Thacker and l.'nder Sheriff B
Ehrens found Cody to-day at Delamar,
he having Just returned. He was put
through a rigid questioning and proved
to the satisfaction of the officers that he
is not the bandit.
Cody went up Squaw Cieek hunting
and remained at a wood camp Sunday
and Monday nights. Detective Thacker
â¢is now working on another clew and has
under suspicion- a couple of men who
live in the vicinity of Bear Valley. It
is said the detective has found the place
where the robber took the barrel staves
with which the barricade was made.
Some persons here are inclined to the
belief that there is a woman connected,
with the robbery. - \
The funerai of the dead messenger will
take place to-morrow afternoon. There
will be eight pallbearers selected from the
ranks of his old comrades and associates.
The women of Redding are particularly
indignant over the murder and they vr>w
to mete out summary punishment to the
bandit. If the men fail to lynch him when
he Is caught. Messenger Farrell of San
Francisco will be here to-morrow to take
the place formerly occupied by Dan
Haskell. The Pit River was patrolled
to-day, as it was thought the bandit
might be driven to cross that stream.
One lone hunter was held up about six
miles up the river and had a difficult
time convincing his captors that he was
not the highwayman.

more. Dougherty's use' of. 'the "firm namv
in forging checks and school scrip, had
been extensive.-... . : : .
The vagaries of his actions are almost
incomprehensible. In one case he forged
a check for $1 57. In another a sense of
humor developed when the name of "F.

fantastic names' were 'used, and there
seems to. have been no system whatever

The Grand Jury reported to the State's
Attorney that it would report, at .least
twenty-four more cases against Dough

The latest estimate placed on his pec
ulations in padded pay rolls places the
amount at a quarter of a million dollars.
So far as it has been figured from the
canceled checks, it shows that for ten
years past he averaged from. $2500' to
$4000 a month. As new schoolhouses were
built and new teachers added the propor
tion, of added names was. _ carried out
The checks for the fictitious names were

of the robbery, states that he heard
screams at this time and a few moments
afterward saw a man and a woman hur
ry down Ellsworth street toward Oak
land. He gives a description of the couple
that tallies exactly with that which the
clerk of the Hotel Touraine provides.
The man was about 5 feet 11 inches in
height, wearing a blue suit, sack coat
and light gray hat. He had a Vandyke
beard and a long mustache, light brown
in cplor. The woman was short and
stout, wearing a brown dress, and a tan
veil. She was blonde in complexion and
had light hair.
This couple rented the house* at 2214
Ellsworth street a week ago; according
to Mrs. S. Roberts, who. lives in an ad
joining dwelling. It is a small cottage,
sitting back 75 feet from the road. It
is cheaply furnished. W. E. Sell, .a
prominent resident of Berkeley, recently
died In the house, which his daughter
owns. . ;
HURRIED FLIGHT APPARENT.
When the police came to the house
to-day they found it open. 'There were
no signs of a struggle in the dining-room
where the assault occurred. The bed in
an aa joining room was disarranged, and
under the pillows . were found a small
arsenal of weapons. A big dirk, a butch
er knife, a pair of scissors and a large
fork were stowed beneath -. the pillows.
A box containing rubber gloves, and a
bottle of acid were under the sheet at
the head of the bed. The chairs con
tained clothing, thrown carelessly about,
the rooms being in great confusion. A
woman's underclothing, complete to the
last detail, was on a chair, indicating
apparent haste in the departure made
trom the house. Ellis' coat and hat lay
on the floor where the thieves had left
them. :
Ellis lived in Sydney, Australia, and
had been connected with racing pursuits
for a number of years. He is a smooth
shaven, keen-eyed, typical horseman in
appearance. His nerve was shown by
the \ manner in which he told his story
to the police- while .he ..lay writhing in
pain on the floor of. the stable.
WARNED AGAINST BRUSH.
Ellis told the following story, at in
tervals, to the police before being ope
ruted upon. at the hospital:
"My home is at 235 Crown street,
Sydney, Australia, where my wife and
tiiree children are now. I am a horse
man and - became acquainted with
Brush, or Curtis, as he called himself in
Sydney, and the woman who passed as
his wife,. during the racing season in
Sydney. He said he was a racetrack
nia-n and owned a string of fine horses
in, America. His tales of the wealth to
be gained in America induced me to
accompany him here.
"I was warned, by. friends to beware
of Biu*h, or Cuitis. and was told that he
and his companion were thieves and of
bad character generally. I paid little
attention to these reports, as the cou
ple appeared to me to be perfectly re
spectable oersons.
"We took passage on tho Sierra, and
I learned on the boat that the man who
had called himself Curtis in Australia
was traveling under the name of
Brush. He said they were known by
the name of Brush in the United States
I came over to Oakland on October ' 3
and engaged rooms at the Hotel Tou
raine, while Curtis, : or Brush, and his
companion rented the cottage in Berke
ley. I had visited them several times
and agreed to accompany them- to New
York. We were to have left on to
night's overland, but I had grown sus
picious of them and did not intend to
take the train. To deceive them I had
my trunks checked for New York.
"This afternoon "at 2 o'clock Brush
and the woman came to the Touraine
and invited me to come to lunch with
them in Berkeley to-day. At that time
Brush said he was short of money
and asked for a loan. I gave him fifty
pounds in currency.
"This afternoon at about 2 o'clock Ij
arrived at the house on Ellsworth street.
There was hardly anything on the table
to eat, but both Brush and his wife
seemed happy and in good humor. I had
just taken my seat at the table when I
was struck a fearful blow on the head
from behind. I turned around and could
just see., as through a haze. Brush stand
ing with a hammer in one hand and a
stiletto in the other.

Brush caught me when I fell to the floor
and tore off my coat. Then he grabbed
the roll of money from my pocket. That
is the last I remember until I came to."
S. 13. Kentield. the agent who rented the
house in which the robbery took place,
said to-night that he had rented the house
to three people. Mr. Kenfleld explained
the matter by saying: "On October 3
three people came to me, a man and a
woman who answer the descriptions of
those who brousht Ellis to the house,
and a third man, who looked enough like
the woman to be her brother. They said
that they were from Chicago, and that
the health of the woman being delicate
they wanted to locate in some quiet place.
They drove around with me and finally
spied this house, which they said would
suit them. They said that their trunks
and furniture would come from Chicago
in a few days."
PI*AX>*ED GHASTLY DEED.
; Town Marshal Vollmer and Chief of
Police Hodgkins of Oakland had a lou^
interview to-nlffht with Eilis and made
a detailed inspection of the premises.
They hud decided that Brush and* the
woman intended to murder Ellhs and to
cut up his body to get rid of it In the
hope of avoiding detection. This theory
they explain by pointing to the various
implements found in the foom, the knives,
acid and rubber gloves. The carcet in
the room where the trio took lunch had
been taken up and removed to a side
room and the floor had been covered. with
pieces of oilcloth, so placed that Kills
after he had been killed could have been
wrapped in the stuff witheu't his
chair resting on the oilcloth. The table
had been set over against the side of the
room out of the customary place in the
center. The appearance to the polict was
that of careful, well-planned preananse
ment for handling the body. The removal
of the carpet suggested the elimination
of dancer from blood stains, as the oil
cloth could readily have been washed cr
destroyed. There was none but_ ihtui
selves to know that Eilis had Wen <\u25a0.
guest there and in event of hU murder
the body could have been disposed of ,
quietly, ample time being given for the i
culprits to make their escape, after re
moving all signs of the crime. Bui that
plan failed.
WOMAN WAS THE BAIT.
That Ellis has been a victim of a
pair of crafty criminals, the police are
satisfied after to-night's interview. The
Australian admitted to Vollmer and
Hodgkins that he had been â to use
street parlance â "played for a sucker,"
and the woman was the .bait. During
his acquaintance with them In Aus
tralia, Ellis said he had spent Â£1000,
or $5000, on the pair, much of it going
for purchases of jewels for "Mrs. Brush."
That the woman was adorned by gems
,waÂ« noticed by Mrs. Roberts, a neigh
bor at Berkeley, and by others who ob
served the unusual display of diamonds
the. stranger made.
Ellis confessed he had fallen into a
trap, and, despite the fact that be has
a family in the Antipodes, he permitted
the woman to lure him on. But his
suspicions that they meant to do him
harm were not thoroughly enough
aroused to save him. That they were
aroused at all was a fact. It came
about on Monday night, when he occu
pied a room at the cottage. He was
there as the guest of the pair. After
he retired, Elli3 told the police, the man
and woman kept up a steady whisper
ing. He continued:
"I hate a whisperer, and their con
duct so upset me that I didn't sleep all
night. Suspicions that all was not
right entered my mind and I wondered
what all that mysterious whispering
could have been about. But the trouble
Is. my suspicions, while they greatly
disturbed me, did not take on definite
form. I was unable to make up my
mind just what it might mean. I In the
morning my disturbance "wa3 not al
layed and I decided to have nothing
more to do with these people. I should
have kept to that resolution, tor *w.Â»
premonition was strong enough to ha.ye
served me as a warning."
Ellis recovered at midnight suffi
ciently to give the police a detailed de
scription of Brush. It is as follows:
Brush, alias Cutter, waa 30 years old. six
feÂ«-t and one-half Inch In height, weighed about
140 pounds, had a scar on the right clieelc
three inches In length, had sallow complex
ion. !onÂ«r face. cloÂ»*Iy triramed bear<i and
wore a $2CO solitaire diamond ring on the Â»eo
ond finger of tb* left hand, and a gold chain,
with an eagle on the charm. The woman.
Mildred Brush. Is 20 yÂ«ars old, five feet four
and one-half Inches in height, has black hair
and full brown eyes and was of medium build,
wore diamond brooch costing $200 and several
diamond rings on her hands.
Early in the evening Ellis said the
woman was a blonde, but corrected this
at midnight.
Barney Bernard, the actor, knew Ellis
in Australia. "When seen in his dressing
room, at the Majestic theater last night
he said: "I met William C. Ellis at the
National Sporting Club. In Sidney, Aus
tralia, when I was playing in that city
last year. He was Interested in sporting
there, being prominent in bookmakir.s
circles. He also devoted a good deal of
his time to traip^ng, and Is an expert in
that line. He has been connected with
horse racing for twenty-five years. I to!d
him a good deal about the coast, so he
came over hare to see what it was like.
He went to the Touraine Hotel in Oak
land. One night last week, when I was
playing a\ the Liberty Theater there, he
came to see me. He told me he wanted
to meet the racing men here. and. I ad
vised him to come to this side of the bay.
He asked mo to get a. room for him
here, and I engaged one for him at the
Adams Hotel, and he was to have taken
It this morning. I know nothing about
his financial affairs, or how much money
he had. with him. He stood well In Sid

FUBOR IN- THE -CHAMBER
Minority Members Opposed to

OMAHA, Nebr., Oct. 11. â Mayor
Moores stationed a cordon of policemen
at the doors of the City Council cham
ber to-day and prevented three mem
bers of the Council leaving the room,
thus keeping intact a quorum, which
the majority used to pass an ordinance
entering Into a contract with the
Omaha Gas Company to* supply illumir
nating gas to,the city.
The Council met in adjourned ses
sion, a quorum not having been pres
ent at Tuesday night's regular meeting.
After the roll of the Council was called
President Zicman and Councilman
Nicholson and O'Brien started to leave,
thus breaking the quorum. They found
every door blocked by. policemen and
were forced to remain in the room.
A member of the majority made a
motion placing- the ordinance on its
passage, but President Ziemati refused
to put the question. Councilman Hunt
ington. a member of the majority, put
the question, five members voting for
it. The minority members declined to
vote.
Mayor Moores .was present and im
mediately returned the contract, with
the bond approved. The Mayor made
an impassioned speech and harsh words
were passed between the majority and
minority members of the Council.
During the parley between Mayor
Moores and Councilman O'Brien there
occurred one of the most sensational
scenes ever enacted in a legislative
body in Nebraska* Threats of personal
violence were made and a clash at fisti
cuffs between the Mayor and O'Brien
seemed certain, when ' Councilman
Nicholson, another minority member,
interfered. Twice O'Brien attempted to
leave the Council chamber and was
forcibly pushed back by a policeman.
City Attorney Herdman declares the
ordinance is Illegal, while an attorney
representing the gas company says the
contract as approved is satisfactory.
The ordinance provides for a ten
year contract with the gas company for
furnishing street lamps at $2S each a
year. It is alleged by the minority that
cheaper lights could be secured.

SHAW TALKS OF SHIPS.
Leslie M. Shaw, Secretary of -the
Treasury, discussed the questions of trade
expansion and merchant marine at some
length, giving statistics of- the enormous
production and commerce of the United
States and concluding as follows:
Our foreign commerce is four times as large
as forty years ago, but we carry In our
bhips unly one-thlro. as many gruss tons as
forty years ago. We have' protected and en
couraged every Interest - but our . merchant
marine and every protected interest has
flourished. We have every tacllity for Inter
national commerce except international mer
chants, international bankers and an Inter
national merchant marine. Shall we not have
these. 1 am nut urti.ng miip sunsnue's. i
am speaking of results, not of methods. If
w e will but take advantage of our opportun
ities we will send these products ot farm
and factory under every sky and into every
port and make our financial centers the clear
ing houses o> at least a fraction of the world's
trade.
Within the last half century the United
States has not only assumed importance among
commercial countries, but in the -last decadt
she has become the greatest commercial nation
of the world. Not only do her exports ex
ceed those of any other country, but her
domestic commerce is two and a- half tlmea
as large as the aggregate international com
merce of the round earth. While the eighty
and more commercial countries are selling,
the one to the other, merchandise worth $11).-
CCO.OCO.OOO. the American people sell to each
other merchandise worth practically ?25,00<>,-
OOO.CCO. These stupendous and incomprehensi
ble figures make some of us proud, .some ar
rogant. They should make us all thoughtful
and prevent any of us from becoming reck
lessly critical.
The time Is coming with our increasing
population, more largely urban than ever,
with factories multiplying more rapldiy than
farms, with limitless manufacturing resources
and, matchless aptitude for production, when
the United ' States will need new and im
portant marketr. The world may am* to us
in its own ships for the products of our farms
and the raw products of its mines, but it will
not come in Its own ships for the , finished
products of our factories. The time is com
ing when we wll| need International bankers
and international merchants and an inter
atlonal merchant marine.
The Unlte'd States is the owner of the Phil
ippine Islands and these possessions, plus the
Panama canal, plus a merchant marine,
would insure to the American people some
what more than their present 10 per cent of
the trade washed by the shores of the Pacific.
We transport this matchless product of farm
and factory, forest and mine from the Interior
to the sea at one-third what similar services
cost anywhere else beneath the skies. We
carry it from point to point along the coast
in better vessels, in quicker time and at
cheaper rates than others. But at our coast â¢
.line we are brought to an abrupt halt. Here
we are no longer Independent.
VAXDERLIP GIVES VIEWS.
Mr. Vanderlip said that greatly in
creased income, ' demolishing liabilities,
and the provision of ample working capi
tal, had worked marvels in the \ way of
prosperity for the agricultural communi- i
ties during recent years. In the game
time similar conditions had developed in ]
the industrial field, and narrowness of
outlook and lack of co-ordination, which
led to the wasteful duplication of plants
and a vast expenditure of capital,- had
given way to more intelligent manage
ment. In the earlier stages, he said,
many of the combinations of industries,
which had been swept together under
hastily considered plans, were properly ]
open to criticism. He believed, however,
that evidence had accumulated to prove
that the men who had formed these great
corporations had shown true wisdom and
that . the improvement already fore
shadowed In Income accounts and balance
sheets was but an Indication of what may
yet come. He called attention to the ne
cessity of ceaselessly prosecuting the
struggle for foreign markets, and said he
believed opposition in the way of duties
would be met after every succeeding
meeting of the continental Parliaments.
The ease with which the financial world
stood the strain of a war which cost the
combatant nations two billions of dollars,
Vanderlip said, he believed was due to
the greatly increased production of gold
in recent years. To this" Increased pro
duction he also gave the credit for the
recovery from industrial depression dur
ing the past three years. At the same
time he expressed the belief that in this
very instance there was a possible future,
disturbance of values. Should the pres
ent rate of production continue, he be
lieved, the volume of money In the world
would be doubled in twenty years, with
the result that prices of many commodi
ties would be greatly increasedâ possibly
doubled.
SOUNDS NOTE OF WARNING.
While the increase in the supply of
money would tend to advance the price
of real / property, however, the price of
an obligation repayable in money would
not advance. Thus all persons having a
fixed income, persons .receiving a fixed
salary, or wage earners generally, would
be at a" disadvantage, for their incomes
would not tejid to increase as rapidly as
the purchasing power of their incomes de
creased. 'He believed, however, that the
theory of the classical economists .-.< that
with. the doubling of the gold stock would
cpmea doubling of prices would not hold
entirely good. Such, a result, he thought,
would be | prevented by the exploitation
of virgin fields of t development, such as
followed the dlscoverey of great quanti
ties of gold in Mexico, Peru, California
and Australia, and that, the next, [few
years would witness the expansion of the
field of commercial enterprise into many
new places.
: He declared .the outlook at;the present
time to be | very bright, .but gave, warning
that- almost surely there were dangers
lurking , in ; the situation. He added r<" ,
' Should a stock market speculation, start from
the present high level of : prices :in r the \face
of - the extraordinary > demand : for capital and
money which \u25a0 crops : and ?. business * alike \u25a0 are
making the result might easily be temporary
atsaster. Although there may be many favor
able i features to â¢ the i outlook, -- It : is ;no < time
for prudence to : be' cast . to . the winds,', no time
for speculative commitments which would yield
disaster' If temporary, reverses: came; mo time
for laxness 'In \u25a0 any , forms of business prudence
and conservatism.'.." .'",' \u25a0,;';'
W. B. RIDGLEY TALKS.
W. B. Ridgley, Comptroller of the Cur-
rency, followed Vanderlip. He said in
part: WÂ£?MM . - .ot
I â¢ am firmly convinced that no system *of
bank examination or supervision from the out
side of the bank can absolutely prevent fraud
ulent bank failures. \u25a0 - Â»
I am also equally convinced that with care- :
ful and 'efficient work on the part of the ex
aminer., aided by intelligent and thorough let
ters of criticism based on the examiner's re
ports, any board of bank directors of fair Intel
ligence with an .honest desire to obey thÂ« law
can, by co-operating with the examiner and
> the Compirolltr, make the failure of their bank
' practically, if not absolutely, Impossible. I
; Of the- seven thousand nine hundred and
thirty national banks which have been organ
ized -13S have failed, or 5^ per cent of the
whole number, as against about 17V4 per cent
of banks other than national in the same
period. The national banks which have failed
have paid their creditors over 78 per cent of
the amount due them, while the other bank*
have paid unly about 45 per cent. Of. the bil
lions and billions of dollars they ' have had
on deposit the national banks have lost for
their creditors in the whole period of their
existence only about thirty million dollars.
These .records in favor of the national banks
are mainly, it' not entirely, due to the wise
provisions and restriction of the national bank
act. and examination and supervision by the
national authority.
\u25a0 Rldgley said that the weakest feature
of the present system of examinations
is that the examinersoare 'paid by fee 3
instead of salaries. The Government
can, he said, and should . by all means
Improve the service", by paying the ex
aminers salaries and greatly increasing
their number, so that a man would have
time to go into matters more thoroughly.
liidgley said that recent disclosures oÂ£
the most disgraceful - betrayal of trusts
by men- in the' highest positions, and the
use of these very positions for private
gain at the expense of those whom it
was ; their sacred duty to protect, have
put the Amtrican' financier on trial be
fore the country and the world, v
"It is a shame, a disgrace and a mis
fortune .that such things could have hap
pened when and where they did, but it
is a great good fortune that. through the
quarrel over the spoils the knavery has
been discovered."
PRESIDENT SWIXXEV SPEAKS.
In his opening address President Swin
ney of the association said:
We' have cause to congratulate ourselves
upon the abundant evidence that the past year
has been in the main marked by prosperity in
all lines of business and comparatively few
bank lailures have occurred. AIL such periods
have, however, produced a feeling of over
contidence and lead to the forming of unsound
industrial enterprises. The few bank failures
of the past year are mostly traceable to excess
loans made to enterprises of their promoters.
The present statutory provisions ; ot the na
tional banking act limiting loans to any one
Individual, mm or corporation to 10 per cent
of the capital stock of the lending bank seem
to be inadequate.
I would recommend a change in the banking
laws fvermitting banks to loan one-tenth of
their combined capital and surplus to one
individual, tirm or corporation and provide'
suitable penalties for any bank violating the
law. At the same time I would recommend
that any tunds passed to surplus be reported
to the Comptroller of the Currency and be not
thereafter allowed to be In any way Impaired
under the- same penalties and conditions as
now prescribed for Impairment of capital stock.
! It is an observable lact that in a great num
ber of bank failures there have been found
among their asstts the worthless notes of high
officers of the bank for the large loans, fre
eiut-ntly without any security at all, or. with
â¢"straw" security which proved to be absolute
ly worthless. This is a most flagrant and
reprehensible violation of law, to say nothing
of business ethics. It is the essence of per
sonal dishonesty. It is a wanton disregard
for the fundamental conceptions that such offi
cers are the chosen guardians of a trust.

BITTERLY SCORES RECENT GRAND d.URY
Earnestly Asks People of VSan Francisco
to Support the Entire Ticket.
A monster crowd filled the Alhambra Theater at the thrice delayed ratification meeting of the Union
Labor party last night, and cheered Justily for the candidates of the ticket. Every in the house was ,
occupied and every bit of standing room was taken up. So vast a body was the crowd that an overflow meet
ing of over three hundred voters was held in the open air outside of the theatre. Inside the audience listened
to the speakers and cheered vociferously at every emphasized sentiment. Enthusiasm was Gn the air, and the
cheers~\vhich burst forth spontaneously when Mayor Schmitz entered the building rolled to the very rafters
and then reverberated with the strenght of the volume of sound. There were cheers for everybody. The
crowd yelled for everybody mentioned: George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas
Egan, Abe Ruef and Battling Nelson sharing equally in the applause.
Mayor Schmitz read his speech. It was a long address, but the audience listened attentively through
out. He told of his long administration and the peace and prosperity which he said had followed it; he
reviewed the business of the city since his first election, and he scored the Citnzens' Alliance and the recent
Grand Jury. His speech is, in part, as follows:
Ladies and Gentlemen, Fellow-Citizens:
Standing here to-night, now for the third time the standard bearer
of your rights, put forward as the representative of the body of the
people for the highest office In the city's gift, I bring you
an account of my stewardship and a retrospect of my administration,
as an \u2666arneet of the future, and an argument for your support in
tte costing election.
A grave crisis confronts the people, a situation fraught with im
portant issue*, and with results which may mean thaf peace, the
prosperity and the aflvancement of the city and of Its people, or
thtlr retardation for nanny years.
Not without significance Is the fusion of the old parties, not
without motive and express purpose. The lion does not lie down in
pÂ«*ce *ith the lamb, or the fox in amity with his feathered victim,
unless some almost supernatural Influence intervenes, and in politics
the Republican does not lie down with the Democrat unless there Is
a tuprÂ«me reason for it. And what Is that reason, what Is it that
maVrs the bitt-T partisan forget his factionalism, the avaricious capi
talist untie his purse strings, the employer for the first time leave
Mr counting-room or factory for a turn at the political wheel, and
all the blackmailing newspapers sling their Inky libels? Is it for
the betterment of political conditions in this city? The Democrats J
and Republicans have been In rower and the constant abuse of one
party by the othrr brought forth many unpleasant truths which even
the present coalition cannot conceal, and yet there never was such
a proposed fusion of antagonistic forces. Is it because of ' alleged
graft or dishonesty In the municipal government that these elements
have combined? Why, if there were graft or dishonesty these inter
ests would be absolutely at home. The public eervics corporations
of the town which are actively supporting our adversaries are of
course opposed to Kraft. They hold up their hands In horror at the
suggestion. Poor rate payers and the public know how sincere is
their dread cf awful graft.
Mo Graft Exists in City Hall.
No. my friends, it Is not because of so-called graft in the admin
tstration that the hounds of war have been unleashed. It Is not
because of rpasmodic virtue or chronic morality that all the engines
of libel and slander, of dffamation and of pollution .have been set
In motion. No grrcft has existed or does exist; none has. been found
or discovered after the most microscopical examination by a boughten
press, by a jjrostituted Grand Jury, by hired detectives, by purchased
assassins of reputation and of character. The failure to discover
wrong Is not always a proof that wrong does not exist, but when
the wrong charged involves thousands of people, when tens of thou
sands are supposed to be affected by it, is It not strange that the most
minute investigation has failed to disclose even the. shadow of
foundation for the numerous false and general charges which have
beir. thrown before the public for the past two years? Is it not incon
ceivable that so many outrages shr.uld have been perpetrated Involving
6O many men and non-s brought to light? Is It not incredible that so
much criminality as is charged should exist and none be dragged forth
by the harrow, the ux and the spade with which malice has been
urmed?
No. my friends, again no; nothing has been brought into the
light of day because nothing of this character exists. The opposition
to us on this ground is based on an absolute false issue, deliberately
and maliciously framed to becloud the real Issue and to deceive the
honest but unthinking voter (of which our opponents believe there are
more than in reality exists). It is a false and fictitious Issue fabri
cated for tlie express purpose of diverting the public mind from the
renl issues at stake over which our opponents dare not hope for
victory- It is a false Issue designed to warp the public thought,
a cleverly feigned and cleverly contrived issue which must necessarily
fcppe-al to the public mind and heart, an issue Involving the com
mon honesty of your trusted public servants. The people as a
mass are honest, far more honest than the limited ring of plotters
which put fortti this false issue, and as the people's representative
on the issue of honesty, I am willing to submit to them the fate of
this administration, confident thai their verdict upon the evidence
presented and weighed must, as. the verdict of honest men, be In/
favor of the most henest administration which this city has ever
had. And I Â«ay this with all due modesty and a thorough knowledge
oâ¬ prevailing conditions. /
Capital and Labor the Issuq of Day.
Now. what Is the real issue T The real issue Is the old one which,
from the beginning" of civilization to this very day, has moved the
force* of the world â the Issue between the toiler and the # man who
buys the product of his ton, or who employs his labor. It* Is the old
economic question of capital and labor carried now into the realm
of politics, because cf the organization of the wage worker, his real
ization of his political individuality and power; his centralization of i
industrial effort. It Is because by organization the workingman has
secured strength and power and influence, because he seeks to merit
and to hold the respect of his fellow man, be he employer or employe,'
*m an American cftizen demanding and hoping to 6ecure equal rights,
that thÂ« rage of battle has be^n flung tnto his face, and that the
political war based on Industrial conditions' is now raging. In other
* words. It Is the struggle or> "the political Held of aggregated, capital
against the lntrenchments of organized and co-operative labor. In
a nutshell it is th- Citizen's Alliance against the common people,
against the man who works for a living. Despise it a* you will lvis
in the ultimate analysis the unfair contest of money against men,'
It 1c the fight of paid anj subsidized . hirelings, weaklings and cor
raptionftt* against the open-hearted, open-soul*d and honest wage
earner â the honest wage earner who.^ because of his fidelity to prin
ciple or friend, is denounced as a criminal, a blackguard and a
graftÂ«r ty the vena.l journalistic instruments of- Herbert- George's
aggression. It is a fight for the lifeblood and the manhood -'of San
Fr&aclaco; It Is a fight for the maintenance of the advancement, the
progresa end the civilization which labor has acquired in the last
few decades; It lc a figlit for securing and preserving the equal rights
and fair play between man and man. Shall we falter, shall we
fail? Xo. a thousand times no. Your ticket, your, whole ticket, my
eelf v well as the others, are but your rr-presentativet. * Our success
is your triumph, our low; If your defeat. To the polls then, on Novem
ber 7. a straight ticket from top to bottom, and an, assured victory is
your*.
But, my friend?, falsehood and calumny are no new things In these
figbu, wben labor sÂ»eks to raise its head. Let us go back a little, let
us consider and reflect.
Four year* ago, our opponents filled the city with their cries
foreboding the evli that wax to fall upon Ean Francisco because the
people â the plain peopl'â had elected one of their number to be the
chief executive of the municipal government. Among the calamity
huwler* there was weeping and walling and gnashing of teeth; with
the telescopic eyes oi thtir evil Imagination* they foresaw banks
tottering, merchant* ruined, capital withdrawing, commerce destroyed,
lartcrle* closed, soup houses opened, working men begging their
bread, and devastation, v-ist and grim, playing havoc throughout
tU-j length and bn.-a<'.th of the city. Anarchy, they taid. would**
float it* red \u25a0 flag over the dome of the City Hail, and murder and
sudden death would wait at every street corner to fall upon the
unsuspecting pecpb*. Sa picture was too terrible for thin to draw;
no calamity so great that they could net tee it with the jaundiced eyes
of their pretudiecd miJids. Accorling to thexe harbingers of evil, this
wonderful city by the Golden Gate tilled with the strength of \u0084
glorious youth, awakening a* a Samson from hie slumbers to the
immeaae posslbillt!*^ cf its future year*, glorious in the grandeur
of IU present strength, pulsing with ea^er Hie. was to sicken and
decay. Â«-Â»d finally to sink into nothingness, its ruins. to mark what
one* It was, and w\ memories to be its only . xiuiem. And the
city was to be thu* destroyed â why? Hecause the common people â
the people who make up the bone and sinew of the commonwealth,
the people who constitute the . State, the people who are the nation,
thÂ« people who are recognized throughout all lands as. the greatest the
world htÂ« known â because rhe*e people, plain, ordinary. God-fearing 1
men and women, tven'as you and I. had arisn In "their strength,
had shaken off the shackles of capitalistic oppression, had In the face,
of all the united power which corporate wealth can jive, announced
their determination to secure a voice in the government for them
rclves, and in pursuance â¢ f that determination, had organized the
Cnion Labor party and fought such a fight aa the city . had never
known; â¢Â« fisht which resulted in a glerious victor}'.
Opponents Are Gasping for Breath.
The shock of that victory was no rreat thai for. a lone- ttmÂ«
our opponents could not recover their breath, so that they might assail
with defamation the caUse they could not Injure by evil forebodings.
You will remember thu.t during the first Union Labor adminis
tration, the mouthpieces of the allied political bosses, who mainly
constitute the opposition, hiid but little fault to find. They had not
then entered fully upon their campaign of slander and vile abuse
which has since distinguished them and which now marks them as
foul instruments for thÂ» destruction of reputations. .
Again, they did not then think that the Union Labor party would
retain its organization, and would continue as a political factor in 'the
battle which must be constantly fought for the maintenance of the
rights of the people against the encroachments of what has been
aptly termed by a pastmaster in the use of epithetsâ the associated
villainies. But when they found that we had come to stay they
, sent their agents abroad among employer and employe, endeavoring
to atir up industrial strife. No method was so low that they did not
resort to it; no deceit so great and villainous they did not practice it.
Their object was to disrupt the Union Labor party by making union
men appear to be antagonistic to the city's best interests. They are
firm believers in the false and vicious argumentâ the end Justifies the
means. By all foul means they tried and tried again to place us in
a false position before the people, feeling that if we lost the confidence
of those for whose rights we have fought the fight, the Union Labor
party would pass Into history. But we vexposed their schemes, we
blocked their i'lajb, we upset their machinations, and in the broad
light of day we shewed them for what they areâ men who are animated
solely by a desire to prevent the toiling masses from having a positive
voice in the management of the government which without them
could not exist. "WV arc proud to say that we retain the confidence
of the people. After four years we again appear before the citizens,
confident that they will support our ticket at the po^is in November,
because of the justice of our cause, which is thi cause of all the
people. Irrespective of station and regardless of -creed.
To-day, San Francisco is more prosperous than ever before in its
hlFtory. During the four years of my administration, it has made
gigantic strides, in the pathway of progress.- It stands, to-day one
of the great cities of the world, at the threshold of a new era,
destined by Providence to continue to increase in population, in wealth,
in prosperity and in power until it ranks with those mighty munici
palties of the present and of, the past, whose- wonderful- development
Is symbolical of the people that made .them great. *" . , â¢ â¢ , -
I have presented the picture drawn by the opponents of the
Union Labor party four, years ago, when its Mayor assumed office.
Xow, let us consider the state of the city to-day. For the satisfaction
of the opponents of the working, classes, who- always figure prosperity
In dollars and cents. I shall first .refer, to the condition of the banks.
The - aggregate deposits of the twelve savings banks of the city on
August 25, 1904, were $1C3,150,195 03. This year, the aggregate de
posits in thÂ« same banks on the sime date were $177,010,3(53 43. That
bhows an Increase of over $13,000,000 in deposits made In the savings
banks in one year, over a million dollars a month. On May 2i) last,
the .Bank Commissioners also issued, a statement on savings banks.
Their August statement, compared with that of May, shows that
during the three intervening months, the resources of the savings
banks were increased by $2,383,002 15 and the deposits by $3,296,316 82.
New, the savings banks, remember, are different from the national
banks and the .^commercial banks. , The savings of the people are
deposited in the saving", bankc. The workingman, at the end of the
! wttk, or the end of the month, sets aside what he can from his accumu
lated wages,Â«and deposits it in a savings bank against a rainy day. So
does the small shopkeeper, tht clerk, the school teacher and all the
many people of small means. The condition of a clty.'s savings
bar.ks is the best indication of -the condition of the. city's people.
And the poor people of San Francisco â for your millionaire and capi
talist seldom patronize a savings bank, for the returns are too small
for him â the poor peopie of San Francisco Increased their savings In
bank last year at the average rate of over $1,000,000 a month.
Labor Party Is for Prosperity.
But what has the Union Lnbor party to do with ' that? The
Union Labor party has this to do with It â that by protecting and
maintaining the Interests of the workingmen, by fostering labor
unions, by preventing those conditions existent under a former admin
istration when union men, for asserting their rights, were beaten down
by policemen's clubs; by preventing the disturbance of Industrial peace,
and by insisting that union men shall receive a fair wage for their
work, the Union Labor party has assisted largely in making it
possible for the working people to save any money at all. .And what
is an increase of- f million', dollars *a month for .'the wage earners
of a city of half a million people? 'it is Just 50 cents a week for each
person that goes to m-^ke up our population. Now, 50 cents a week
is not a large amount, but it Is good to know that even wi^h the
red flag Sylng. which Herbert George has floated over the City Hall,
our thrifty, honest sober, hard working people are able to Â£aye now
even that sum in excess of what they saved a year ago. Bear this
fact also in mmd â that at the end of the four years during which
the city has had a Labor, Union party Mayor, there is more money
In the savings banks than ever before since the first bank opened ita
doors In San Francisco.
Turn now to. the commercial banks, through which the merchants
transact their business.
A newspaper article reads:
"The wealth of San Francisco continues to grow, as indicated by
the Increase of resources of the local banks. The Bank Commissioners
have received the statements of the thirty-five city commercial banks,
shewing their' financial condition- at the close of business August 25,
lt>os. Compared with the former statement of May 29, 1903, the
gain in total resources for the city commercial banks in the past three
months is $15,229,0ti9 20, while the amount due to depositors increased
during the same period $6,105,743 39. This does not Include national
nor savings banks. The large increase in the material wealth of the
city i* especially notable,, because .it covers a season when money Is
In demand for handling the crops of the State."
Here we have an increase in three months of the amount dun
depositors to commercial banks of over $6,000,000. Add that to the
Increase of over $3,000,000 in the savings banks for the same period,
and we have a total increase of over $9,000,0C0 in deposits in our local
banks In three months of this year. The exact figures are $9,402. 0(i0,
over $3,0(.0,0C0 a month. And "all this at a time when it waa known
that the Union Labor party would again have the temerity to go
1 l:eiore , the people "asking their suffrage. Do the figures show, that
j capital is afraid, that merchant* are timid, that factories are to
I be closed, that the city is going to destrucion because a Union Labor
Mayor has been twice elected, and. with the support of the masses
cl the people, will be elected again? I
ClearingH ouse Figures Prove Facts.
And If these figures tÂ« not enough, take up the figures of the
San Francisco, clearing-house. You know the great bulk of commer
cial business is done by check.' But a small percentage of the amounts
i :nvolved In trade are ever handled in actual cash. The ' banks send
| tl.eir checks and drafts every morning to the clearing-house, and there
they are rwapped around until every bank gets in the orders drawn on
' Itself by exchanging for them orders it holds drawn on other banks.
' The balances are paid daily _in gold, no balance tags, due bills or
j checks being permitted. Hy this system, each day's "clearings" Is
['complete in itself, and no part of It figures in the succeeding day's
I derations. On January 1. 1903, \ last New Year's day, . the Chronicle
\u25a0 l ublished an article shewing the. business. of the San Francisco clear
! luR-hous* for the twelve months ended November 30, : 1904. The total
! was over $1,025.C00,0C0 â that it. $28,000,000 more than one "and a half
i billions, an increase of $0. 400,000 over the clearances of 1903, and an
< Increase of morr than JISU.COO.OOO over the clearances of 1902,. in
'which year the Union Labor Mayor . assumed office. Her* are the
! figures:* In 1902. the first year of a Union Labor administration, the
i clearances amounted to $1,342,927,000,^ the largest amount handled In
i ar.y one year in the San Francisco clearance-house, since it's orsaniza
! tlcn up to that time. In 1903,. the second Union Labor year, the
j clearances were Increased by $ISO,COO,COO, the total being $1. ".â¢-'_>, ooo, ooo.
â¢ This result showed that during my second year in the Mayor's chair,
j the city's commercial business had increased by nearly $.'00, 000. 000,
land the totals wen. again the greatest ; on record. For thi. 1 . twel%-e
â¢ months commencing; wtth lifctmbfr, 1903, and ending with November,
ilfiOt â - 1 again quote the Chronicle 'figuresâ the" clearances amounted to
$1,525,000, 000, again an incrcase,over the preceding year. The largest
j monthly total on record up to that time was for November, 1904,. when
I the amount cleared was $142,675,000. \u25a0 So much for the three- years

FALSE STATEMENTS MADE.
Firstâ That applicants whose nameel do not

That the two political parties which, respect

said election officers do not possess all the
qualifications required by law. for such elec

figures Indicate stagnation In business or a paralysis of traae? But
now.lÂ«t us look at the figures for this year, commencing last January,
to and including last month. September. During seven of the nine
months of this year the monthly clearances in this city exceeded
by many millions the total for November, 1904, the banner month In
the history of the clearance-house. In August last the clearances
amounted to ever $162,000,000. a clear gain ot ,$20,000,000 over the
record established in November, 1904. Those figures show something!
for' the Increased prosperity of San Francisco, and are . arguments in I
themselves unanswerable when presented In refutation of the mail- I
ciously false statements that the success of the Union Labor party i
would put San Francisco back ten or twenty years. But even with!
the increase of over 520, 000, 000 in ' excess of ; the record for 1904, the ;
business of the city continued to flourish, for the clearances for last,
monthâ September, 1905â amounted to ' the \u25a0' stupendous total of $IG.J.- j
249.C06. On the eve of this campaign, at a time when political con- |
ventions were in session, during the very days that the opposition
press was howling again the direful cries of calamity should the
Union Labor party win at the polls, the business of the city, as shown
by the returns of the clearing-house, was absolutely' the greatest San
Francisco has/ever known. For the nine months'" of ; this year, ending
w'.th September, the amount cleared at the clearing-house was 51,329,-,

Now it Is fair to presume that the , business*"f or. this month
and for November and December next will equal the business for the
last quarter of last year. Present indications are that- 1\ will greatly
exceed the figures- for the corresponding quarter 'of last year. But!
want to be absolutely fair, and so I have added to the totals for" the
past nine months of this year the totals .for October, November and
December, IUO4. The aggregate for the twelve months is $1,763,000,000,
which is over $220,000,000 In excess of the. clearances .for 1904, and is
beyond all calculation the banner recorder the city. "And yet this
Is the fourth year of a Union Labor; administration. In 1904, San
Francisco held the , seventh place among; the \u25a0 great : business "cities of
the United Statesâ New . York. Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia,.; St.

The preliminary examination of^
Harry jD. Gilbert, the colored barber,
charged by the Republican League with
illegal registration, was concluded be
fore Police : Judge Fritz yesterday
morning. After hearing the arguments
of Attorney Dam, special prosecutor,
and Attorney Mack, for the . defense,
the Judge resecyed his decision till Oc
tober 16.
Attorney Mack argued that there had
been no Intent to commit a crime and
contended it had been shown by the'
witnesses for the prosecution that Gil
bert had â applied at the information
bureau at the Registrar's office and had
acted upon the information received
there. If any crime had been com
mitted it had been unintentional on Gil
bert's part. He was declaiming that
Gilbert was being persecuted by the
Citizens' Alliance, w;hen the Judge
stopped him, remarking that the alli
ance was not in the case and that there
was no need of making any grand stand
play. - , ... \u25a0 - ..

at the same time the defendant could

and his every act, public or private, has. been Inquired Into and tljen
maliciously misinterpreted; when his whole life has been laid bara
by those who are eagerl> seeking for a something to prove his unworth.
and he comes out from such an ordeal unharmed because nothing coyld
be found against him. he may be pardoned for thinking that the
abuse of his enemies was,a compliment to his own integrity, for had
they any facts â knd If they existed they would have had them â general
abuse would give way to direct charges and there would be something
to answer. ..Political condition* in this city to-day are simply the nat
ural outcome of the contest between the two opposing elements. On
the one side is thf Citizens' Alliance, headed by Herbert George,
Gavin McNab, Fairfax -Wheelan and Frank J. Symmes, and on the
other side the workingmen of the city and all those free-minded. Inde
pendent citizens . who believe in fair play with equal rights to all
and special privileges for none. There can be no doubt of the outcome.
; The masses of the people arc' with us In this fight. They cannot be
deceived. They know that Herbert George has openly boasted in hla
Denver paper that the Citizens' Alliance won the Republican primaries.
The people know that behind the fusion ticket are all these forces
that are i antagonistic to Individual, development, to the exercise of
a tree franchise, to the payment of a fair 'day's wage for a fair day's* j
work, and to the participation ot workingmen in politics. Tne people )
know that on our side we are fighting for a principle. On the other
side there is simply an organized appetite for public office, and the
ravenous leaders are already quarreling over a division of the spoils.
This Is a government of the reople, for the people and by the people.
The people as a whole never go wrong; the people as a whole are honest
and sincere. For this reason in ' this j campaign, as in the last two
campaigns, we depend for success, not as do our opponents, on the
i expenditure of vast sums of money, cbtalned from corporations nor on
untrue accusations In falsifying newspapers, . but on the honest Judg- I
ment' of the people themselves. They . know that our cause Is their i
cause and that our cause U Just. . "VVlia them and with you we leave

KANNGIESSER

Judge de Haven Sentences
Postal Thief to Eight
Years in Penitentiary
PLEA AVAILS NOTHING
Postollice Inspector Jame3
O'Connell Says This Will
Keep Other Clerks Honest
To plead guilty In tha United States
District Court of any crime Is to go v?
like a lamb against the slaughter. For
mer Poatofflce Clerk Emll Kanngiesser
13 the latest Illustration of this action.
He pleaded- guilty to an Indictment accus
ing him of having stolen various sums of
money out of letters intrusted to his
charge, and he and his friends expected
that a year or two la the penitentiary
would be about the size of the' dose of
correction to be administered by Dr. dÂ» â¢
Haven. But to their surprise, he got a
sentence of eight years imprisonment at
hard labor in the penitentiary at San
Quentin, a fine of $100. and thirty days
Imprisonment ' in the County Jail at the
close of the penitentiary sentence.
Congressman Kahn, before sentence
bad been pronounced, made a moving ap
peal for leniency. He called the atten
tion of the court to the previous good
reputation of Kanngiesser during his
seven years of employment in the post
office, and expressed the hope that in
consideration of that fact and the fur
ther fact that his client had saved tha
Government the expense of a trial, tha
court would make the sentence as lighc
as it possibly could. Bert Schlesinger
added his plea for mercy to that of the
i Congressman. Judge de Haven appeared
' to be moved by the appeals of the elo
! quent gentlemen. He remarked in a ju
i dicially didactic tone that the defendant
j had pleaded guilty to the whole indict-
I ment, that the indictment contained ten
! counts, that the maximum penalty on
| each of two of the couat3 was one year
: and the minimum penalty on each of the
[ eight counts was one year. He had,
! therefore, no discretion, except to Impose
1 sentence on each of the counts and he
; would Impose the minimum which wad
: eight years on eight counts and thirty
j days on the two counts, together with a
â¢ fine of $100. A stay of ten days' execu
j tien was granted.
1 Postofflce Inspector James O'Connell
I was well pleased with the aenteu-je. auii
j said that It would have the effect of do
| terring other clerks from stealing from
i letters.
! For fourteen months during 1004 and the
I early part of 1305 complaints had been
frequent that letters containing money
had never reached their destination. The
toal amount of losses aggregated $2200.
On February D of this yÂ«ar Inspector
O'Connell secreted himself in the ferry
postofflce, where Kanngiesser was em
ployed as special delivery clerk and saw
j him open ten letters and place the money
in his pockets. The Inspector at oneÂ©
arrested him and found the money and
fragments of the letters on his person.

Frank Woods' Confession on
Scaffold Likely to Lead to
Freedom of a Prisoner
Serving a Life Sentence
WORKS IX STEIPES
FOE THIRTEEN YEARS
Belief Grows That Convict
Is Wearing His Life Away
for Another's Crime and
There Is Hope of Release
The confession of Frank "Woods, who
\u25a0<vas hang-ed at Ban Quentin last Friday
for the murder of Policeman Robinson.
that it was he who stabbed Michael
Klnney to death in Fresno in 1891, is
regarded as almost conclusive proof
that Thomas Washoe Kelley, who was
convicted of the crime, is innocently
serving a life term in the penitentiary,
find that he Is the victim of a cruel
rslscarrlas* of Justice. Kelley has al
ready spent over thirteen years In
prison, and efforts are to be made Â» at
once to secure his release.
Charles Montgomery, president of the
California Prison Commission, believes
Kelley Is Innocent, and his belief Is
ebared by Under Sheriff Hensley of Ma
dera, who was Sheriff at Fresno when
Kelley was convicted. TV. D. Tupper and
H. H. Welsh, who prosecuted Kelley,
believe fee should be pardoned.
While It Is recognized that Woods
might have been actuated by the code
of heroics of criminals to help get a
pardon for Kelley, there were so many
doubtful circumstances connected with
the evidence adduced at the trial that
very 6trong probability Is given to the
confession made In the shadow of the
g-allows. The opinion is strong that
Kelley should at least be given the
benefit of the doubts that have now
been made hundredfold stronger, and
for the most part the belief is strong
in his innocence.
Walter D. Tupper of Fresno, who was
the District* Attorney that prosecuted
Kelley, will urge upon Governor Par
dee that the convict be given his free
dom. "I remember the case very well,"
says Mr. Tupper, "for it -was a peculiar
one. The defendant interrupted me in
the course of my address, claiming that
he had had no chance to produce wit
nesses. There w:is a doubt in my mind.
at least in regard to his deserving to
be hansred. and I virtually advised the
not to bring in a hanging verdict."
PAROLE ALMOST CERTAIN.
The attorney says that before me
Woods confession lie had recommended
that Kelley be paroled, but he will now
ask that Governor PardeÂ« make an In
vestigation of the case looking toward
A pardon of the convict. , â¢ \u25a0
The principal testimony against Kel
ley was that of Thomas Mitchell, the
bartender in the saloon where the
killing occurred. He testiiied that
when he ran to the backyard where
the assassin had lain in wait the dying
jflan gasped, "the one-armed man did
It." Kelley has only one arm, and this
BÂ«?emed to clinch the case against him.
But the strange feature is that several
weeks elaDsed before Mitchell made
known" this evidence. At the time of
the murder and at the coroner's Inquest
the bartender asserted that he had
heard nothing from the dying man.
The morning after the murder Kelley
walked into the Sheriff's office and
made the following statement:
"I heard this morning that the officers
are looking for me, and I thought 1 would
come in and Eec what is wanted. I am
told, that I am accused of killing a man
<ast night. I didn't do it and I don't
Know anything about it. When I left
tlie saloon I went out to a tree and slept
there till morning. When I came in
they told rue what' had happened and I
thought I would come In and surrender.
My name Is Thomas Washoe Kelley."
kelley was a typical tramp. He de
clared to the last that he was innoceot.
In the course of his address to the
jury District Attorney Tupper adverted
to the fact that if Kelley knew of wit
nesses who could have shown that he was
innocent he should have had them in
court. This aroused the prisoner, who
said:
"I had no chance to get my witnesses.
I was put in jail, and for six days I sent
continually for the Sheriff, and he would
not come. My witnesses left and I could
not get them. I have been given no
chance."
"Didn't you have an attorney?" asked
Mr. Tupper.
â¢"No," replied Kelley, "I had no lawyer
until lons after."
. Then Tupper said to the jury:
"It is no pleasure for me to prosecute
"this prisoner who sits here crying. If
be is Innocent I would rather have my
arm cut off than see him convicted. See
that he eets Justice."
Woods' confession came fourteen years

SAN QUENTIN, Oct. 11.â Kelley came
here on January G, 1592, and has been
a model prisoner and has faithfully
performed all the duties imposed upon
him. For the last three years he has
had charge of crazy alley. Captain
Harrison says that Kelley was un
doubtedly railroaded here for want of
proper defense and believes him to be
innocent. Many other's employed ex
pressed themselves in the same manner.
Kelley was seen this evening and, in
response to questions put regarding his
alleged crime, said:
I Â»m the victim of the perjured evidence
of a barkeeper named Mitchell, employed at
that time In thÂ« Circle Bar Ealoon In Fresno,
and the authorities who wanted to fasten the
crime on some one. If they had acted 1 accord

confined five days, preventing me from any
communication wlt'i the outside. I am a na

I was in this State a year prior to theJdllinK
of Kinney and have made a living prape-plck
ins an<i other similar work. I* have never
had any trouble ot any kind and the Fresno

and on the morning of the murder I met Kenny
for the flret time. I was at the Circle liar.
There were about thirty there. We had a
couple or drinks and left, as tlure was trouble
tn the back yard, and went to Ralston's sa
loon. We were there ten minutes when we
heard that Kinney wat killed.
The next morning when I heard that I was
chargfd -with the crime I went to the Sheriff 'a
office and told him that I heard that I was
accused of the murder, declaring- my.;elf In
nocent. I aeked him to detain my companions
of the previous evening and I would prove my
Innocence by them. Ho failed to do so. and
1 have not r-een them since. I understand that
some of them were In San Francisco recently
and stated that rhcy left town because they
were afraid that they would be implicated on
general principles.
My lawyers. Hood and Edwards, appointed
by the court, advised me not to go on the
Et&nd In my own defense, and I had no wit-
lietsses in my behalf. I wanted my attorneys
to take the case to the Supreme Court, but
they refund, as I had no money. A poor

SCHOOL CHILDREN E&JOYING A
PLUNGE -AT THE LURLINE
BATHS.
The first Grammar School Swimming
Club had a dip in the Liirline Baths yes
terday afternoon. Over 180 healthy boys,
ranging In age from 8 to 14 years, had
the time of their lives In the cool salt
water. Principal A. M. Armstrong of the
Hancock Grammar- School was the first
to adopt School Director Rbncovieri's idea
of establishing swimming clubs In all the
public schools and his boys â¢ reaped the
benefit yesterday. The idea has proven a
success and in time, will be taken up by
every school principal.
The boys themselves deserve much of
the credit. -Principal .Armstrong intro
duced the preposition to them when the
weather was good and warm:'
"Do we want to go in s^immin'?" said
the boys. "Well we guess. Do we want
a swiramfn 1 club? Sure."
So they met in the school-yard . and
talked it over.. "We've got \u25a0to have a
committee," suggested one of the young
sters, "that's . the way : rown folks do
things." \u25a0 ' ,
"What's a committee?" asked an eight
year-old. â¢ . , : â¢ \u0084 / ' â¢
"Huh, don't, you knowv.it's a crowd' ot
fellerg that get together and talk things
over. We've got to have -a. committee."
So a committee, one from each class,
was appointed. : Richard; Fontana was
made president and the members went to
work. There wtre some shrewd lads on
that committee, for they arranged to get
uniform bathing 'suits at" a wonderfully
cheap rate. \u25a0 ' â¢
The. girls heard about it. and started to
organize a swimming: club, too. But they
were . just a little bit slower, or \ their
bathing suits required a little more time
to prepare. They #l:not be ready to
take to ,the water until some time next
week ; \u25a0 ' . . \u25a0
After the management of the LurHne
Baths had had a talk with the boys'- com
mittee, It willingly consented to give. a
special rate. This lent more encourage
ment, to the idea, for President Ronco
vieri declares that if a lucent rate can be
secured at j*iy of the baths the city will
pay for the . swims' after awhile.
The bqys. marched' from the school,
headed by Principal Armstrong and. ; Vice
Principal Madison Babcock. TThey. 'ca r
rier their neat bathing suits over their
arms. They piled through the doors and
before you could turn ' your head they
were out of those^ warm clothes and Into
the bathing suits and splashing; in the
water. ,
The only girl who accompanied the
swimming club was Principal Armstrong's
pretty little daughter,. Isabelle, who
came along as mascot. . The whole club
was in the water within, five minutes,
enjoying life to the fullest. / .
President William , Grcer" Harrison of
the Olympic Club, has. invited the swim
ming club to make, itself at home In the
club's tank on next ' Thursday evening.
After that the members will go to the
Sutro Baths. .
\u25a0 Principal Armstrong is determined that
the swimming club shall be a permanent
thing as far as his school is concerned.
Anybody who could see those merry
youngsters splashing about in the water
would want to encourage it too.

BARTLETT GIVES
HIS TESTIMONY
Lieutenant Cominaiuleiv oil
Witness Stand All Day at
_tJie Yoiflig Court-Mart hi I
EVIDENCE IS TECHNICAL
Says l)rain Pipes
to Carry Water From, the
Boilers Were Defective
VALLEJO, Oct. 11.â Lieutenant Com
mander Bartlett occupied the witness
stand all day at the Young court-martial,
and proved a strong witness for the pros
ecution. -He spent the morning laying
the /foundation for his technical tes
timony on engineering and his theory
of the cause of the explosion. In describ
ing the construction of the boilers Bart
lett stated that the- drain pipes, which
were intended to cany the water away
from the boiler?, were . defective and al
lowed the water to run back into the
boiler. This was the most important point
covered in his testimony during the two
hours of the. forenoon session.
The admission of blue prints- showing
the condition of the. boilers on August 4.
190-1, and since the explosion were admit
ted only after, a sharp exchange . between
Judge Advocate West and Judge Clear for
the-tlefense.
The court resassembled in the aft
ernoon in the engine-room of the
ship. â¢ To reach the room it was nec
essary for the members of the court
to pass \ through "death alley," where
the bodies of more than a Kcore
of the victims were found wedged after
the explosion. The terrible work of the
explosion was everywhere in evidence, al
though the ship's canvas had been used
at many places to soften the grimness
of the scene. Lieutenant Commander
Bartlett continued his explanation of the
explosion and prefaced # hls remarks
with a wealth of technical knowledge
that confused the members of the court,
one of whom asked if the board had been
"brought down to this cavern to learn
about boilers generally or just what hap
pened to the boilers of the Bennington."
The brown sheet of boiler B. Bartlett
said, had weakened and gave away un
der continued overpressure until the top
of the boiler sank almost to the middle
of the boiler and the pressure from the
bottom' had been so great that that side
had been forced up until the top and bot
tom "of the boiler met in the center. Ex
cessive pressure was the principal cause
of the explosion, according to Bartlett's
theory. In testing the wing furnaces, it
had. been found that one of the furnaces
was not out of order and that any engi
neer would have gone to 1 sea with it, but
that the other furnace was in bad condi
tion.

OAKLAND, Oct. 11. â "'May many more such
days as these to us befall." The sentiment
was meet, for without the day was perfect
and within were scores of pretty, clever wom
en, flowers, music â what more could one ask
tv make repetition desirable? At the annual
breakfast to-day the Oakland Club certainly
excelled ittelf and the participants will long
icmcmtcr it as one of the brilliant social suc
eesfea of that rapidly growing organization.
The club polons, green and gold, blended pleas
ingiy In the decorations, golden lilies and yel
low c-oreopses adorning the long tables and
mingling with the jialm plumes that clung to
pillars an.l archways. The tiny booklets con
tau.:r.g the programme wÂ«re green, lied with
>el!ow ribbons and bearing the club's seal in
gold on the back. During the serving o;' the
breuktast â anrt the menu was excellent â a
string orchestra of several pieces furni.-hed
eor.ie very good music.
AÂ«rs. Cora K. Jonts. recently elected presi
dent of the Oakland club, presided tor the first
time since that honor was conferred upon her
and in a few well-chosen words gave greeting
to her co-workers a/id their guests. ' At the
round table â which Is alwayi the. president's .
table and from which the others radiate, star- I

Thane, president of AJameda Federation: Mrs
H. A. Melvin. Mrs. Sara Htamer, Mrs. M T.
Mott. Miss fc-arah Horron and Mrs. Cushing.
The responses to the toasts were limited to
fhe minutes and could some Adam have looked
in upon this cub Eden to-day he would have
been surprised to hear how some women
can say so many clever things ia so short
a time â when she has to. Among the speak
ers were Mrs. J. E. Thane. Mrs. Mary Tracy
ilott. Mr*. Patterson. Mrs. B. M. de Leon.
Miss f-larah Horton. Mrs. J. H. Aydelotte, Mrs
Heamtr and Mrs. H. C. Â£apwelL Mr*, de

another breezy little speech. "Pin Money"
wag the subject *il Mre. Capweli's toast and
was handled in her usual droll and sprightly
manner.
Many of the gowns to-day were "simply
stunning," one of the most attractive being
worn by Mrs. M. J. Laymance. the cloth suit
of Alice blue being topped by an extremely
modish and becoming hat of the same blue,
with a cerlÂ«e velvet crown and four black
tips falling over the upturned brim. Mrs. \V.
W. Kergan's all-violet suit â gown and turban â
was another striking costume. Other notice

; George Humphreys'. Mrs. Henry Abrahamson.
Professor Wolle and his charming wife were
gutits of honor to-day at a reception, unique
and typically Californlan in its cordial hos
pitality. The ladies of the Piano Club in
Berkeley were the hostesses and their quaint
little studio, which in days long gone was
a barn, was crowded frgm 3 to Â« with a
steady inflow of guests eager to greet the
man upon whom the eyes of musicians and
lovers of music alike are now centered. HU
advent among us means, much for the ad
vancement of things musical and much is ex
pected of him. It is to be hoped that when
he raises hiÂ» standard of "work t!/ professionals
and students will rally about him as eagerly
as did the throngs of visitors to-day.
The club rooms were draped In rugs, and
vines and blossoms outlined the picturesque
window and filled odd nooks with color. On
the lawn In front punch and other refresh
ments were served and altogether the after
noon was a delightful success In every way.

There was an inexplicable explosion of a gas. meter in the basement, of Frank B. Hill's resi

OAKLAND, Oct. 11.â Frank B. Hill,
a mining man, residing at 318 Grand
avenue, was badly injured at 11:46
o'clock this morning by an explosion
of gas In the basement of his residence,
where he had been working over some
business papers in a desk.
The shock hurled -Hill across the
basement, while the enveloping flames
severely burned him. A gas meter ex
ploded and pieces of flying metal were
buried in Hfll's back, intlicting many
severe cuts. With the injured man at
the time were his children. Robert, 1
years old, and Katherine, 5 years ot
age. They were playing there a short
distance from their father. but,
shielded by the back of the desk, the
little ones escaped injury.
Their screams of fright, the shock
and flames attracted Anna Pawer. the
Hills' domestic. She ran into the base
ment, caught the children and ran out
again to give an alarm. Deputy City
Treasurer George Gross, Philip Bowles,
son of P. E. Bowles, president of the
First National Bank; William Leimert
and Dr. A. L. Cunningham rushed to
the rescue. Hill, his face and beard
badly burned, his clothing in shreds,
was borne out" of the cellar uncon
scious. The flre department extin
guished the fire, after $500 damage had
been done.
Hill was taken to his apartments
and the family physician, * Dr. W. S.
Porter, was called. He dressed the in
juries. There were several very seri
ous cuts in the back caused by the fly-
Ing metal. The patient suffered severe
ly from shock. To the physician Hill
said he could not explain the explosion.
There was no open light in the base
ment. He was near the meter when the
shocks occurred, \u25a0 but had not noticed
the odor of leaking gas.
\u25a0\u25a0To the heroism of the servant girl
Hill owes his life. When Miss Pawer
rushed into. the basement she saw. her
employer prostrate, his clothing on
fire. She ran to him after seeing the
children ,were saved and.'wlth much
presence of mind, rolled him over ana
over until the blazing garments were
extinguished. The fire burned briskly
at the burst meter until the department
got it under control. -
The cause of the explosion was not
discovered. Fire Warden George Mc-
Donald made a careful examination,
but said he could not explain the ac
cident. One theory was that crossed
electric, wires produced a spark that
ignited gas which might have accumu
lated above the meter in the space be
tween the floor joists. The residence,
which is leased by Hill, is owned by
Mrs. Emma Percy. Hill haÃ extensive
mining interests in Sierra County.

From that remark the I prosecutor led
her to tell what she knew of her former
husband's connection with the case, and
she was persuaded to arrange a meeting
of Bowsher and Wilkins at her home.
Court Stenographer Scott and Deputy
Sheriff Fro^t were hidden in the room
above and heard the story of the rob
bery discussed by the men as they were
cleverly questioned by Mrs. Wilkins. The
statements were taken down In shorthand
and "given to the Grand Jury.
Since his -arrest Bowsher refuses to
talk other than to say the trial will show
him in a different light. Wilkins will
say .nothing.

EIIONS TRIAL
NEARINC I END
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 11.-I n the Em
mons bribery trial before Judge Hart
this morning Grove L. Johnson resumed
his argument to the Jury for the defense.
The courtroom was crowded to Its full
capacity and several times the Sheriff
had to call for order when the auditors
responded by laughter to Johnson's
sallies.
The attorney went rapidly over the
whole case as presented by the testimony *
to illustrate claim that neither Jor
dan, Bunkers nor Lee had Jbeen corrobo
rated. He implored the Jury to discover
If it could prove any testimony corrobo
rative of either Bunkers, the confessed
perjurer and felon, or Jordan, the alleged
go-between. He assailed the Continental
Building and Loan Association as the
real plaintiff in the case, the Institution,
he said, being corrupt and debauched and
operated in the interest of schemers: that
Corbin had overdrawn and defrauded the
company.
Johnson declared that there was ample
cause for investigation of that company,
and held that it feared investigation and
entered into a scheme to forestall Inves
tigation! and stand off exposure by turn
ing upon the defendant with accusations
that should serve to distract attention
from it/Â« own corruption and cover Its
own villainies.
At 3:15 District Attorney Seymour be
gan the concluding address to the Jury.
Ha opened with a tribute to the State
and the manhood and womanhood that
had builded the commonwealth. But a
shame had come upon it when a Senator
was brought to the bar of justice for
wantonly violating his sacred trust.
Lee. the negro, was not an accomplice,
but an accessory after the fact and does
not require corroboratlon. In legislative
bribery the question is what did the
boodler intend, not what did the briber
contemplate.
Was Emmons a Senator and did he re
ceive money to bar and defeat Investiga
tion of the b:sr companies? Those are all
the things needful to be proved, and
they, have been proved beyond the
shadow of a possibility of a doubt.
Shall the cost of the trial weigh against
the honor and life of the State? Shall
Emmona be acquitted because other men
walk the streets who are guilty and go
unpunished? Shall all murderers go free
because some arc -not detected? Why
should not Sacramento be the moral
clearing-house of ,thÂ© State? It i 3 the
capital and here the laws are made.
Wife and child are pleaded to save
Emmons. but hearts had to be steeleil
against the plea that duty might be done
and corruption punl3hed, no matter how
hard it may be.
At this point the court adjourned until
to-morrow morning.

FEDERAL JUDGE
Case of Jurist Who Solicited
Campaign Funds Goes to
the Department of Justice
OFFENDER IS SCORED
Civil Service Commission
\u25baSays He Has Admitted
tlie Charges Against Him
WASHIXGT.ON, Oct. 11.â The charge of
soliciting and accepting campaign con
tributions in the campaign of 1902, made
against United States Circuit Judge Bak
er of Indiana, by the Civil Service Com
mission, has been referred to the Depart
ment of Justice by the commission. In
connection with the reference the com
mission gave out an official statement of
the case, in which it was said the
"statute of limitation Is the only defense
which can be opposed to the charge."
The commission's statement in part said:
The Civil Service Commission, through Com
missioner Grtene. conducted an examination
on the 22d and 23d of September, l'JOo, into
a charge of a violation of the civil service act
by the collection of illegal assessments at
GoElien. Ind. In the course of this investiga
tion Guy C. H.iu'.ton, a clerk In the postoftice
at Goshen, tcs-tified that he was told in the
tail of 1O')2 by the assistant postmaster. Al
derman, to visit Francis E. Baker, Judge of
the United States Court of Appeals for the
fc-eventh Ctrcu.t: that he was sent during office
houii to sÂ«<? Judge Baker; that upon visiting
I.lm he was told by Judge Baker that it was
to Ms :ntÂ»rest to keep in power the servant
of the party to which witness (Boulton) owed
his appoin m<nt: and that even If witness was
in the civil service his superior would give
him trouble in eas-e of a change of administra
tion. He was also told that Judge Baker paid
liberally himself for political purposes and that
clerks in the service usually gave 6 per cent
o-f their salary, with other statements along
the same line. In pursuance of these sugges
tions fom Judg-p Baker Boulton afterward paid
T> p< r cent of his salary, being $3l>, to D. XV.
Xeiolg. chairman of the Republican County
Committee.
Lamar Croop, also a clerk in the Goshen
posiot'flce. testified that Judge Baker was in
the postofflce in the fall of 1002; that In the
samÂ« fall tho assistant postmaster told witness
to go and see Judge Baker, just as Boulton
had betn told to go and see him during office
liours. The Judge urged witness to pay money
for campaign i>urposeB and the witness told
Judge Baker that he could not afford to.
Wht reupon Judge Baker said *to him:
"You can afford to do without a suit of
clothes and make your payment."
He was urged to pay 5 per cent. Thereafter
the v/ltness spoke to Postmaster Sherwin about
paying his assessment and said that he did
not have the money to pay. and Sherwin ad
vanced him $50 for his assessment, which was
paid by Mr. Croop.
Martin L. Schnur. a clerk in the postofflce,
testified that he also was sent In the fall of
1902 to Judge Baker and was In like- manner
urged by him to pay money to the Republican
campaign fund, and did pay $25, 5 per cent
of his salary. He was unable to make the
payment and the postmaster loaned him the
amount.
This testimony was presented to Judge
Baker, and without going Into the details of
the conversation the facts etated by the above
witnesses were admitted by â¢ him to be true.
The Civil Service Commission has felt some
hesitation !n taking any action In the premises
but it Is felt by the commission that. Inasmuch
as violations by others of the civil service
act occurring: In the Goshen postofflce are to
be proceeded against and punished, it Is not
right that distinction should be made In favor
of a violator of the law, however exalted his
position may be. The charges against Judge
Baker have therefore been referred to the De
partment of Justice.

"SON NAM BU LA"
MOVES CROWD
TO CRY "BRAVA"
With scores of men standing and
shouting "Brava!" with a great audi
ence that filled the Tivoll, manifesting
its enthusiasm in various .ways, the
curtain fell Tuesday evening on a per
formance of "Sonnambula" that was re
cord-breaking in several particulars.
First and foremost was the delicacy
and exactness and languishment with
which Polacco steered chorus, orches
tra, and even principals at times,
through the shallows â¢of what might
easily have proved to be mediocrity of
rendering into currents that ran deep
with emotion.
The soprano was Tetrazzini, scintil
lating staccato upper notes ad lib.;
making long skips with dazzling ease
and certainty; warbling like a robin at
sunrise on an old apple tree, whenever
there was a warbling mood" in the score
â which was often; hitting so far up
among the leger line notes that the ad
mirers of sheer vocalism went daft
over what she did with so little show
of exertion. -
There was Bazelli, for tenor, whose
voice was in the best shape that it has
been since â¢ the season opened; who
made musical sounds about all the time
with his vocal apparatus and whose
supply of sentiment met all demands,
so that he was a success.
For basso Gravina figured, and he was
amply able to do all that was needed
without imparting any thrills, but care
ful and conscientious. The other roles
were filled by Signorlna Caesarlni, Slg
norlna Lucchini, Signor, Cervi and
"Signor" Fogarty of old-time comic
opera fame at the Tivoll, when' he was
not, a few weeks ago, a "signor" at all,
but good, jolly Fogarty, with a brogue.
The end of the second act, with the
triply sweet languishing duet be
tween Tetraz'zinl and Bazelli, naturally
made the most impression upon an
audience that quickly came into sym
pathy with the music that our grand
mothers and grandfathers loved. From
this time on the standing of the old
opera, "so often abused by incompetent
conductors and slurred by indifferent
singers, gained steadily in current esti
mation. â¢ : -
So it was with progressive interest
that the climax came with a storm of
"Bravas" and hand clapping. The act
ing was as good as the singing and
that Is sufficient to say. "Sonnambula"
was one of the most pronounced suc
cesses of a good season.
WEATHER IS COOLER.â The weather was
much cooler yesterday / than for \ several days
and Professor McAdle declares that the hot
Bpell Is over. The maximum temperature was
70 degrees and toward night the air was much
cooler. - - '"; . . "
ROCKHILL COMES

Mismanagement of Reception
toVAlice Koosevelt and
Friends Causes Comment
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. 11.â Mall ad
vices by the Empress of Japan included
a Manila dispatch to the Japanese Adver-.
tiser of Yokohama, which states that
General Corbin severely censures United
States Minister Rockhill at Peking, charg
ing him with dereliction of social duty
in the provisions for the reception and
entertainment of the President's daugh
ter and party at Peking. The Advertiser
says:
"Execrable mismanagement of the re
ception and direct discourtesy on the part
of the Minister, are charges freely made.
The returning party say the marked
scantiness of attention paid them was
sufficient to elicit surprise from the vari
ous legation staffs' of the other Peking
embassies."
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11.â National cap
ital circles are not surprised that Gen
eral Corbin, commanding in the Phil
ippines, has complained that Minister
Rockhill did not sufficiently exert him
self to provide honors for Miss Alice
Roosevelt while in the Chinese Empire.
General Corbin is well known in army
and social circles as a stickler for the
niceties of life. Minister Rockhill, on the
contrary, is man of affairs, charged di
rectly by the President with the execu
tion of extraordinary work In the empire
of the draKon. Twenty years of study
in Pekging in the provinces, and even
In far-off Tibet, it is declared, have
fitted' him to care for the weighty inter
ests of this Government in the ' Far East
beyond any other man.
Upon Rockhill devolves the duty of in
terpreting the policy of China and the
European powers there to the President
and Secretary Root, and of explaining to
China the policy of the United States.
It is believed possible that these questions
outweigh in importance in his own mind
General Corbin's views on social etiquette.

TWO LOCAL OFFICES
Goulds Looking Around for
' Bis: Building in This
City.y
The Goulds are considering: a plan
to consolidatethe offices of the Western
Pacific Railroad Company and the
Western Union Telegraph Company in
a bii building in this city. Although'
the third floor of the Safe Deposit
Building recently has been remodeled
to meet the requirements of the new
railroad, it is well known that the
company will need larger accommoda
tions when the .work of construction
along: the overland route has pro
gressed to some degree, and It Is In
recognition of this fact that the Goulds
have been trying to find a suitable
place that would also accommodate
the Western Union.
It was learned from a reliable source
yesterday that Morris Schmltt. . who,
with hi|3 brother, owns the Stock Ex
change Building on Pine street, has
had a talk with the Gould representa
tives in New York regarding a future
sale of the big stone structure. No
deal is on, but the Goulds wanted to
know whether the building could be
purchased. It Is said to be so con
structed that two more stories can be
built on It and its interior is of a char
acter that will permit a remodeling to
suit the purposes of a railroad and tele
graph company. The lease of the Stock
Exchange does not expire until next
July, but even then the Goulds would
not need the building. Their idea has
been to purchase a large building and
hold it until their heeds demand a
change of quarters for both railroad
and telegraph companies. .

STILL QUESTION'S HEWITT,
WHO WANTS MORE MONEY
Finance Committee's Expert Thinks
Regular Appropriation Sufficient
for Underground Districts.
The Supervisors* Finance Committee
yesterday resumed its Investigation into
the request of Chief Hewitt of the De
partment of Electricity for additional
funds' to keep underground districts 1,
2 and 3 in repair. A. M. Corey, an ex
pert employed by the committee to
keep tab on Hewitt's expenditures, said
that the $1500 allowed in the budget
was sufficient for the purpose intended,
as the districts are not in use.
Hewitt, however, -wants some $5000
more and Corey held that Hewitt should
utilize a special maintenance fund of
$20,000 out of which to employ cable
testers and cable splicers, which Hewjtt
said were indispensable. After a desul
tory cross-questioning, to -which Hewitt
gracefully responded, the committee
took the matter under advisement.
It would try your patience to go upon
an excursion on which the train would
be side-tracked and laid up for a day
now and then â chiefly because of the
"great cost of running every day." 13

Will Contest.
The unveiling: of gigantic exemplars
to be used by Theodore Kytka In an
effort to establish his contention that
the contested codicil of the will of thÂ«
late Samuel Davis is not genuine was a
feature* in Judge Kerrigan's court yes
terday. In these exemplars there are
hundreds of fragments of the known
writings of Davis and portions of the
contested codicil placed side by side for
comparison. In them Kytka professes
to see unmistakable evidences of tho
theory of the contestants that the codi
cil is a forgery, while the proponents
of the codicil take comfort In the fact
that at least to the layman's eye ths
writing's look very much alike.
Kytka was on the stand all day. Ha
testified that he examined hundreds of
thousands of words and letters known
'to have been penned by the deceased

THURSDAY OCTOBER 12, 1905
THE RATIFICATION.
Til]-: great meeting at the Alhambra to ratify the nomination of
Tohn S. Partridge and the joint ticket was an event of note in
our municipal politics. In defiance of the grafters it was held
en the scene of one of the administration outrages upon law and
decency. 1 The audience filled the house whose doors were unlaw
fully broken down by the police to admit a mob for the purpose of
intimidating the Republican city convention. The people crowded
the house that had been subjected to police lawlessness under pro
tection of the city government.
The president of the meeting was Joseph Sadoc Tobin, in poli
tics a Democrat, in principles an American, in practice a fearless
gentleman. When he was a candidate for Mayor, while making a
speech, a man in the crowd cried out that he was a hereditary aris
tocrat, when Tobin answered: "'My father was once a day laborer
on the streets of San Francisco, and I'm proud of it." That is the
kind of hereditary aristocrats loved by the American people.
In his introduction of Mr. Partridge Mr. Tobin said: "Is it not
the glory and hope of our democracy that those whose childhood is
so often" spent in privation, far from the rush of great cities, are so
frequently chosen to be our leaders and so often exalted to high
place among us? Without the suspicion of flattery I can say that
our young candidate is of this type, and his very life and person
ality are inconsistent with the false issue raised in this 'campaign.
With neither wealth nor influence how often has such a man proved
himself the vindication and triumph of government by the. people.
Such a man is presented to this meeting as the candidate of Repub
licans and Democrats."
The speeches were all excellent and inspiring, and the great
audience was receptive and responsive to every appeal for united
action to purge the fame of San Francisco of the foulness that makes
garbage of the city's good name.
In his exceptionally strong speech Mr. Partridge furnished the
battle cry of reform. He said: "It is no time for partisanship.
GRAFT "HAS NO PRINCIPLES AND HONESTY SHOULD
HAVE NO POLITICS. We must fight graft ; we must smash cor
ruption wherever we find it; above all things, we must not be
afraid. The enemy is wily, unscrupulous, desperate, and will stop.
at nothing. In such a fight in St. Louis hired thugs beat aged men
into insensibility; the foulest and most disgraceful lies were print
ed about Mr. Folk. But he was not afraid. He had in him fighting
blood, and he was backed by fighting men, laborers, artisans, mer
chants â and with their aid he filled the jails with the gang of
thieves and boodlers, and SL Louis and Missouri were redeemed."
Every sentence was a bugle call to duty, to labor and to sac
rifice in the cause of civic righteousness, and the people who lis
tened went out to gird them for the combat. Not for many years
has San Francisco heard as high a call to action and not for many
years has the need been as great. There is only one issue. All
others can wait. The government of San Francisco must be made
pure and then it will be powerful in all things legitimate.
When the two parties, with all their pride of partisanship, with
their widely diverse views of national policy, with their leaders in
the republic in array under opposing party banners, with their an
tagonisms in many hard battles all upon them, put it all aside and
come into cordial combination on the one issue of redemption of
the city, it is an impressive spectacle and is the only evidence re
quired'that an imperative necessity demands reform. With Partridge
and Tobin, Hickey, Brandenstein and General Woodruff speaking
from the same platform, on the same issue, in a common cause so
pressing as to wipe out their partisan differences and disputes, the
voters of San Francisco who prize decency and dignity in their
government need no further evidence and no stronger proof of
the necessity and the righteousness of joint action against the
grafters.
The list of vice presidents of the meeting shows how'far
reaching is the sentiment of union for reform. Party leaders, past
and present, the men best known as promoters of the city|s wel
fare and contributors to righteojas progress were there, anxious by
their presence and such weight as their fellow citizens ascribe to
them, to give impetus to a common cause. It was a great ratifica
tion, but only the forerunner of a greater that will be held after the
November victory. * .
THE PERMANENT EXPOSITION.
SINCE our notice of the contemplated Permanent International
Exposition in New York we are in receipt of more complete
information about the plan from the chairman' of the prelim
inary committee, Mr. George A. Bagley. * Instead of one large
building, it is proposed to have a number of fit structures, in a large
park at Verplanks Point, on the Hudson, near Peekskill, one
hour's ride from the center of New York City, and when the electric
line is finished this will be reduced to forty minutes. At the site
proposed the Hudson River makes the halfmoon curve where Hen
drik Hudson anchored his ship and was yisited by the Indians.
Across the river is Stony Point, where General Anthony Wayne
made his heroic charge upon the British fortifications in the Revo
lution. Between Verplanck and Stony points plied the "King's
ferry."' Over this the French troops passed on their way to the
battle of Yorktown and' the surrender of Cornwallis, and at Ver
plancks Point occurred the junction of the American and French
armies. Just below the point is Tappan Zee, where the British
ship Vulture waited the results of Arnold's treason.
So, in addition to its convenience, its ample space of two thou
sand acres and its grand scenery, the place for the proposed ex
position is rich in its historic associations. Ocean going steamers
can ascend the Hudson to Tappan Zee and land passengers at
the exposition grounds. It is expected that this exposition will be
ready for the world's eye in 1909, and that it will remain the most
complete evidence of the progress of the nations that has ever been
assembled.
The day of great temporary expositions has passed. Their ex
pense is too great and their existence too short. â¢ They have been
deliberately undertaken with the sure prospect of financial loss, and,
while their educational effect has been great, they were merely
steps forward toward the greater usefulness of such a permanent
exposition as is proposed. W-*- 1
California will take a keen interest in this project, and when it
is ready it will be seen that this State is one of the greatest con
tributors to its attractions.

A SORT o' sawny flve-foot-flve
strolled inter camp one day,
An' â¢ he called a public meetin',
announcin* he would stay,
An* addressin' of that meetin'. Tils style
was somewhat neat,
Per he used some gorgeous-figgers that is
reely hard ter beat.
"My feller citerzens,'.' he sold, "I'm proud
ter meet ydu here"
The builders of a commonwealth ter me

Pallajerums of liberty is all you reely

Ter put a polish on this camp that's

A free, untrammeled press," he said, "is
all you're needln' now
To win a everlastin' fame, sling laurels
at your brow.
The Dobbins Camp Pallajerum, I'm
happy fer ter fitate,
I now will startâ subscriptions took at
jest the usual rate."
Then Lonesome William rose an' said:
"Interpretln'i fc* them

I'd merely state this cuss has come a

An* . 1 ante fifty dollars, fer ter show
I'm settin' in."
Then Slim he rose an' freely says: "I
raise you Jest an ounce,"
An' all the fellers then chipjjed in in
various amounts.
An' then we waited patient till a week
from Thursday come, '
Fer ter see the openin' issue of- that there
Pallajerum,
An' when at las' the paper come it's
painful fer terj tell
Of how that sawny five-foot-five had
fired his shot and shell.
Fir he'd started in presoomin' that he'd
. give old Sin a cramp,
An' -chawed up several citerzens, some
prom'nent in the camp.
"Shall we have hellholes in our miilst?"
his leadin' effort run. (
"Ah, no!".' he. answered then himself, "we
mus' not have a one!
Shall we have desperaders that is fre
quent on the shoot?
Not by rid means!" he then replied. "Seen
folks has got to scoot!"
An* 'fore he got done writin' he called
some men by name.
Which, havin' yearnin's fer ter live, I
wouldn't do the same.
'Twas a painful sitlwation presented .to
us then,
An* sev'ral leadin' citerzens and num'r
ous prom'nent men.
They called a little meetin' fer to argue
on the case,
Fer they jedged, with some o' sadness
that the cuss had missed his place.
They voted quite unanermous, them dls
-\u25a0â'appointed men,
The cuss had better , mosey on an' drop
his gifted pen.
The subsekent perceedin's then some
folks might jedge was wrong.
But that Pallajerumnal chap, he did not
linger long. , . â
"I s'pose," said Lonesome William, sad,
"you'd read your title clear.
But heaven prob'ly is your Held; it reely
is not here."
He argued some, that five-foot-five, that
freedom was his star-
But when he galloped o'er the hill his
garments were' of tar.

is y t he- thing- -â¢ '"'" ' :

A man should have a right- ter say the
things he feels he should.
An' I'm not here a*urgln' that seen con

But I coyly wish ter mention, wen a cuss
would lift the- race,
That he'd better be some cautious in
selectin' of the place.
At.FAL.FA PHILOSOPHY.
They's many a man 'at wishes , 'at the

I can understand man's accidents, but
God's accidents beat me. Fer instance,
why should a mere fool be the heir to old
Billyun's millions?
Wen I got hard up my Uncle Richman
said he regretted deeply 'at all his money
was in urgent use; my Uncle Poorman
said, "How much do you need?" Prob'ly
that's how one of them come to be my
Uncle Richman, butâ do you want to gel
your money in that way?
The feller 'at says the most don't al
ters do the most. I've noticed 'at the
heifer 'at bawls the loudest ain't allers
the one 'at gives the most milk.
They say 'at they's a divinity 'at
watches over*fools an' drunken men, but
I've seen times w'en I wished it would
pay less 'tention to its business.
My son knows more'n I do to-day, but
I'm waitin' patiently fer a few years to

BRAINS PLUS BEAUTY.
Attractive Business Woman That Does Not
r-\ 1/ I) i CJ l^ I d IC- I ICI MU Vul I lUfcC 10
DOROTHY FEMIMORE
[. S a woman justified in trading tipon her personal charms in business? Is
it refined and womanly for her to do so? Is it ethical?' Is' it business
like? (
The other day when lunching down town I overheard this edifying scrap
of conversation between two business women who were evidently discujss-
ing a third whose beauty and success
were equally remarkable.
Said the first: "Do you know, she's
awfully vain? s It is really amusing to
see what pains she takes to keep her
face, powdered and her hair arranged."
"But that's business," objected the
other, in a tone of surprise.
That it is business for a woman who
works to make herself as. attractive
as possible one learns from question
ing the head of any agency office. A
pretty girl of average ability ha(* twice
the chance of getting a. good position
that a plain one of superior talents
possesses. A handsome, well-dressed
woman succeeds as a canvarner, or a
book agent, where another whose ap
pearance is less prepossessing falls.
The demand for good-looking office
girls- exceeds the supply. . Brains plus
beauty is a commodity more than twice
as marki table as plain brains.
There are subtle reasons for this,
as well as that obvious reason that
mortal man enjoys. tho sight and prox
imity of dainty womanhood. There Is
involved an important question of per
sonality. A pretty girl has learned
assurance from the homage to which
stio has been accustomed from her
birth. She is not easily embarrassed..
She Is accustomed to having others do
her will.
The offlco gets an esthetic benefit
from tho salary that ia paid her, in ad
dition to the material one of work per
formed, for she spends a good part of
her Â«:arning|T in personal adornment.
Besides the presence of an attractive
woman in ;ui office helps to create a
cheerful atmosphere. Tho mere sight
of her beauty is refreshing, and does
11 great deal to relieve the deadly dullness of the sordid grind.
Charm is distinctly a business asset, and the business woman who has it and
does not appreciate the ad\ f antage' which it gives her is either a saint or a sim
pleton; and neither of these individualities is likely to succeed in the commercial
world. , ' ' â¢ â¢
At the same time, having charm, and us*ing it as any other of her talents, she
must be very much of a philosopher, or something of a cynic not to let the acid
of humiliation bite into her pride now and then because it is her femininity which
assures her success, instead of the surpassing quality of her attainments.
This is a drop of bitterness which does not spoil the savor of her plainer sis
ter's cup of pleasure at success; the plain woman who wins from genuine worth.
If she wins in competition with men it is because she is the "best man" in the
field. She wins in spite of her sex, and not because of it. There can be no ele
ment of self-scorn, therefore, in her self-congratulation.
But this does not alter the fact* that fora, woman worker an attractive ap
pearance is capital for her as much as are her ability and her bank account.
HE HAD HIS LIFE INSURED
AN ordinary citizen
A morning paper read. *
"Murder in Harlem," "Crime in Bronx,"
The cheerful headlines said,-' V
"Three Holdups," "Seven Burglaries,"
"How Can the Scourge Be ' Cured?"
("Gee!" said the nervous citizen,
"I'll get my life insured.")
And so the man betook him to
The Wrequitable Life. _^>
A masked man met him with a gun;
_ Another held a knife
And hissed, "Hands up!" And when the purse
Was thus by force secured
They dropped him gently to the streetâ
He'd had his life insured!
And now that reckless citizen
Fares boldly forth at night.
"Q burglars, come and talk to me!"
He says in tones polite.
"Go through my pockets if you wish;
They're empty as a gourd.
I'm not afraid of robbers now â
I've had my life insured!"
EXPRESSION OF FEELING.
WALLACE RICE
SAVAGE man, unless carefully schooled and by way of exception, gives way
to his feelings freely and frequently. Civilized man, on the contrary, is con
tinually taught to suppress every evidence of feeling.
In the highest society, especially among English-speaking peoples, every pub
lic evidence of sentiment is rigorously frowned upon.
It Is a perfectly well ascertained fact that with the suppression of external
evidence* of feeling goes suppression of the feeling itself. If a man were to set
his will against smiling and laughing through an extended period of time it would
end in atrophy of the sense of the ridiculousâ he. would Jjecome as serious in
mind as in countenance. Probably there has never been a more striking instance
of this than among a large class of New England people of the old stock.
â¢ The Puritan set his mind on the next world. This mundane sphere of ours
was nothing more to him than a place of preparation for the joys of paradiseâ
or the other place, without Joys. Worldly things grew to be unimportant in his
inmost soul, and the more they savored of this world the less important they
were. He was kept sane In all likelihood by having to work so hard to wrest
*a living from a stubborn soil.
One reads that, there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage hereafter, and
by a parity of reasoning there would be little recollection in the next world of
pother ties of relationship^ 1 As a result, in New England, as amongÂ»ascetlc peoples
everywhere, marriage was regarded as more or less of an Imperative duty. As a
duty it must be, but that was no reason for growing sentimental over it. Feelings
were suppressed. j
It has. always seenjed to me that the result has been to eliminate feeling from
a large und important, almost a ruling, class among Americans. It certainly has
done away with much expression of feeling. Men may grow to regard one an
other with intense affection and be bound by the most complete ties of friendship,
yet hesitate about showing it by any outward sign. . .
It also seems to me that life Is too short for that sort of thing. None of us
makes so many friends that he" can afford to let friendship go unacknowledged
by tender and trustful words and signs. . \u2666
In reason, affection should be shown, and shown frequently. It is the most
preciouiTthing in the world.. * > - -;\u25a0

Human Ostrich
This Woman
AT the Salop Infirmary a woman sue
' cumbed to an operation the other
day which brought to light one of
the strangest collections of miscellaneous
objects that ever found lodgment in a hu
man stomach, says the London corre
spondent of the New York Sun. This is
a list of them as catalogued by the sur
i geon who performed the operation:
Thiriy-two hairpins.
Nineteen nails. . ,
Seventeen fragments of glass.
. Fourteen needles.
Four horseshoe nails.
Two pieces of chalk.
One hook.
j The woman, the wife of a poor man.
was first admitted to the infirmary suf
fering from an injury to her thumb which
necessitated it.s amputation.- She returned
to her home much depressed In spirits
and there her condition grew steadily
worse. At last she acknowledged to her
husband that some three weeks before
she had began swallowing various articles
with the intention of putting an end -to
her existence. He had been such a good
husband to her, she said, that she felt the
least she could do for him was to relieve
him of the burden of her support.
Every time she swallowed one of the
queer things, she said, she hoped that
death would speedily ensue, but after the
hook railed to kill her she had been forced
to the conclusion that she could not rid
herself of life by such jneans. When she
was again admitted to the infirmary it
was found that in addition to the strange
diet she had adopted ahe wa3 sufft ring
from an Internal tumor. She died within
a few hours after the operation had been
performed.

EXTENSION FISHES.
Former Ambassador Joseph H. Choate
recently told a story of an Englishman
and a Scotchman who were swapping fish
tales while dining with a number of
friends.
The Briton related the tall story of a
fish he had landed whose alleged meas
urements were such that every one pres
ent smiled, though none ventured to ex
press doubt as to the truth of the ac
count. The Scot, in his turn, related a
yarn. He had, he averred, once caught
a fish that he had been unable to pull in
alone, managing to land It at last only
with the aid of two friends. "It was
a skate, and four or five feet long," de
clared the Scot, in the solemnest of
tones. Silence followed this extraordin
ary statement, during which the Briton,
offended, left the table. The host fol
lowed. After returning he said to the
Scotchman: "Sir, you have insulted my
friend. You must apologize."
"1 didna insult hlm.'N said the Scot
"Yes, you did," indignantly responded
the host, "with that confounded story of
a skate four or five feet long." v
"Weel," finally said the offender, slow
ly and with the air of one making a
great concession, "tell him if he will take
a few feet off his fish I will see what 1
can 'do with 'mine."â Harper's Weekly.
ERRORS IN COMPLIMENTS.
"It Is always a fatal mistake to pay
a compliment to a woman at the ex
pense of her good looks," said Israel
Ziingwill. "In London last season a
young English swell was caught in the
trap of conscientious compliment. It
so happened that he was seated at the
table between a distinguished author
ess and a famous' beauty. In an effort
to be agreeable to both ladie3 he said:
" 'Am I not fortunate in being thus
placed between beauty and talent?'
" 'Not so very fortunate,' replied the

possess' neither one nor the other." "

A wedding under the moon, with its
eilver light falling upon a garden fair as
Fontainebleau; upon the lovely young
bride and her guard of honor; and cpon
ihe gay throng of friends gathered upon
the lawn to rejoice in the newest triumph
of love â such was the wedding of Miss
Doris Batchelder and De Lancy Lewis,
celebrated last night at Menlo Park, at
the splendid Batchelder home among the
oaks.
From early sunset guests were arriv
ing from San Joseâ the home of the groom
âand from this city and the Alameda
tide of the bay, and were met at the
cepot by carriage and motors.
At the fall of twilight thousands of
Tairy lights gleamed from the bearded
c;.ks that encircle the home and that
m retch away to the brook that sings
through the gardens.
Not since the uniting of Flora Sharon
V/d Sir Thomas Hesketh was so beauti
ful a wedding service seen in old Menlo
âthirty years ago â the scene of the most
brilli&r.t social affairs of the West.
A colonial wedding was this of last
nightâ and to the smallest detail was it
colonial. The service was read beneath
the portico of the colonial home by
Dr. Lewis, father of the groom, and a
retired Episcopal divine.
The briday party, arrayed in the pic
turesque garb of ye colonial days, toned
and Eoftened in the moonlight, wrought a
picture not unlike an old tapestry. The
bride's robÂ« was of eoftest cream satin
beneath an exquisite lace drape, long an
heirloom in the Batchelder's family.
With dextrous fingers, this was draped
over the bodice, and over the hips, form-

THE ARMY RATIOX.
A Good Suggestion From an Old Sol-
dier.
The Government lias been experiment-
ing tor some years seeking a condensed
food to be used by soldiers in case of
emergency when the army shall cut loose
from its base of supplies and cast off its
<vagon trains and the troops shall carry
tlielr rations for a number of days in
their haversacks. While some progress
has ,beeu made the problem has not yet
solved-
A veteran from the Civil War. writing
from New England. 6ays in this connec-
tion:
â¢I have been using Grape-Nuts food
for rome time, and my liking for it In-
creases with use. I flr.d It extremely
palatable and not only digestible, but an
aid to the digestion of other food which
used to srive rue trouble.
"What has particularly struck me Is
the fact that a very Email quantity of
it is sufficient for an entire meal-
that 1 really need no other food. It
is my custom to begin my breakfast
, with two heaping tableepoonfuls of
Grape-Nuts with cream. By the time I
\u25a0 have eaten that I find that ray appetite
lias been completely satisfied. I feel the
" comfortable sensation of one who rtaÂ»
breakfasted wisely and well and while I
sometimes eat a little of other things, I
do It more as a matter of habit than any-
thing else. I find that I can go till noon
â¢on'the two tableepoonfuls of Grape-Nuts
and cream alone, and what is also an im- |
plirtant consideration, without any un-
comfortable sense of fullness Euch as 1 !
usually feel when I eat my old style
Â« breakfast. Especially is this so If I drink
B cup of good, hot Postum Coffee with
the meal, for I must confess the old kind I
of coffee fills me full of gas and discom- j
fort for some hours after I drink st. |
"Now It has occurred to me that Grape- J
Nuts food ought to be added to the army
ration for thÂ« reason that It furnishes so
much satisfying, nourishing food In such
1 .*mall bulk. A soldier with a package of
Grape-Tsuts In his haversack would have
a food supply adequate for several days j
\u25a0Â»^.f marching and fighting. It wouldn't
f take up much room, and the weight Is
â¢ nothing."
"There's a reason."
Look in each pkg. for the famous little
book. 'The Road to Wcllville."
ing Quaint paniers and part of the splen
did court train. Over all fell a film of
white tulle, soft and vaporous as the
mists of the morning. "
Accompanying the bride were nine
bridesmaids and two little pagesâ Miss'
Jean Howard. Miss Beatrice Simpson,
Miss Josephine Dunning, Miss Margery
Lynch, Miss Alysse Warner. Miss Anna
Bard, Mies Ruth Casey, Miss Miriam
Harris and Miss Phyllis Moulton, all
dainty maids in the fetching low bodices,
patches and paniers of the period, while
the little pagesâ Kittridge Batchelder
and Howard Goodwinâ were winsome at
tendants in white satin knee-breeches and
lace waistcoats.
George Batchelder, father of the bride,
gave her into the tender keeping of the
groom, who was attended by Richard
Batchelder. â¢
The ushersâ a dashing lot of chaps
were Austin Sperry, Raymond Moore,
Frank Corbusier, Fred Harkncss, Carl
Shoonmaker, Harry Lack and Archie
Perrln. /
The wedding service over, an informal
reception was held on the veranda, as
wag the wont of brides in the balmy
South, and as California is wooing them
to doâ in her soft Indian summer.
The bride, who is said to resemble her
mother, who was a Klttridge, is a maid
of strong qualitiesâ a head and heart girl,
whose love for the free life of the country
side has held her above the limitations
of the swirl of society. Infinitely prefer
ring a gallop across country to the in
anities of tea-table chatter.
The groom is an interesting chap, of
perfect manners and is a deep student,
having been graduated from Harvard and
having taken a post-graduate course at
Stanford last year.
One of the prettiest features of this
distinctively pretty wedding was the
singing of the rollicking songs of Stan
ford by college mates of Mr. Lewis.
And thus, under the silver moon of soft
California night, was the wedding of
Doris Batchelder and De Lancy Lewis
celebratedâ and a picture long to linger
in the memory of the .countryside, as the
prettiest wedding since Flora Sharon
gave her hand to the gallant young Eng
lishman who had wooed her so ardently.

Wabash system from George J. Gould.
Not only was he unanimously defeated in
all he undertook, but he was forced from
the directory of the road and now has
nothing whatever to do with its manage
ment in any manner. He put up a hard
fight and struggled gamely to the last,
but was so hopelessly in the minority
that he never had a chance. He filed
protests all through the meeting, not with
the reason, as he afterward declared, of
being an obstructionist, but because\he
desired to lay the foundation , for any
contest that might hereafter be made.
He took his defeat In a philosophical man
ner. '
Gould was highly pleased at the out
come, although he showed his feelings
less in words than by his manner and
hearty laugh as he contemplated the fig

nounced, Judge Doyle, speaking, for Ram

CUTS OUT .jMUCH WOEK
Resolution for Paving Cali
. fornia Street, Between Ma
son 'and Jones, Rescinded
The Board of Works yesterday received
from City Architect Shea revised, plans
for the proposed new Washington Gram
mar school building so as to bring the
cost thereof within, the $119,000 available
under the bond issue. The lowest bid
heretofore received was $215,000 and the
plans have now been revised to reduce
the cost, so that common . brick will be
substituted for the exterior atone and
pressed brick work; that the iron stair
ways, will be eliminated; the steel roof
replaced' by a wooden one; the heating
and ventilating piant omU^-d and no pro
vision made for tinting and painting and
ga.s pipes. The new plans practically
provide for the bare waliÂ» of the structure
and were at once submitted to the Board
of Education for approval.
Shea reports tha^ $13,000 must be ex
pended to grade tho site, which is of a
peculiar character, and he did not think
it advisable to reduce the size of the
building, as sixteen class-rooms are re
quired.
The board also sent to the Board of
Education ior approval plans for the
Laguna Honda ecnool of twelve rooms, to
be erected, on Sixth avenue, between 1
and J street at a cost of $31,000, and the
plans of an eight-room brick schoolhouse
for the Sunnyslle district on Hearst ave
nue near Forester street to cost $54,000.
The board rescinded its resolution
adopted last Saturday ordering the re
pairing of California street, between Ma
son ajid Jones. Maestretti objected to
the resolution on the ground that the
work was not specifically provided for
in the bond issue and that it was il
legal because it'was passed at the meet
ing called only for the purpose of grant
ing the Ocean Shore Railway Company a
permit to begin construction work>
Contracts were awarded tp Flynn &
Treacy to repair bitumen pavements in
the Mission district for $3000 and to
Thomas Clark to construct stone side
walks on Clement street, between Third
and Ninth avenues.
The boara" appointed William Morgan,
Edward McDade, Oscar Haupt and Bert
Mullin as draughtsmen and Tracy Cum
mings, stenographer.
The board ordered bids invited for
building a bridge on Mount Vernon ave
nue and for repairing Larkin street from
Hayes to McAllister and Harrison street
from Fourth to Sixth.
Property owners on Kentucky street,
from Army to Railroad avenue, and Third
avenue, between Clement and California,
were notified to put their sidewalks in
good' condition.

EIIECTS AX IMMENSE TOWER
Structure Welffhine: . More Than One
Hundred Tout Is Plnced on
Mount TnmnlpalH.
The Pacific Wireless Telegraph Com
pany completed the first of two towers
three hundred feet high on Mount Ta
malpais on Tuesday evening.
Considerable interest attaches to this
work because it is the initial station
of this company in the vicinity of San
Francisco and for the further reason
that this tower, weighing more than
one hundred tons.iwas put together and
raised in one completed section. The
proposition was passed upon by many
prominent engineers of the Pacific
coast and they were unanimous in, the
opinion that it could not be done.
There Is yet 1 to be erected another
tower of like dimensions one hundred
feet distant irom the one just finished.
The tower was put in place with the
least possible difficulty and stands
there as a signal light to the entire sur
rounding country. There is about forty
thousand feet of lumber in each of
these towers supported by forty-four
cables. It is expected that the other
tower will be completed in a very short
time, when the apparatus wilU be in
stalled, making complete the most
powerful wireless telegraph station in
the world.

UNIVERSITY SOCIETY LOSES
SUIT IX JUSTICE'S COURT
JuilÃf l.mvion Decides Plaintiff in
Case Is Not a Corporation, as It
: ,- Claimed to Be.
Justice of the Peace Lawson yester
day gave judgment against the Uni
versity Society of San Francisco, which
sued Mrs. J. S. Vallance for $3 due on
three monthly installments of a book
called the "World's Best Music". Mrs.
Vallance refused to carry out her con
tract on the ground that the book did
not live up to its name.
Lawson decided against the plaintiff
because it did not prove that it is a
corporation and also because Mrs. Val
lance's husband was not Joined as a
defendant, both of which points are re
quired to give a case standing in court.
The decision will be of Interest to some
2000 people, who have signed similar
agreements.

ROUGHNESS OF THE GAME
IS PRINCIPAL TOPIC.
CAMP AIRS HIS VIEWS
Secretary Taft Threatens to Expel
Rowdy West Point Men.
NEW YORK, Oct. 11.â Circulars will be
â¢â¢nt in a few days to the collegiate ath-
Utic world from the football experts who
last Monday met President Roosevelt, in
which it will be suggested that all bru
tality bÂ« eliminated from the American
rarne.
Contests which are scheduled for this
season will be played in accordance with
the prevailing rules. At the annual meet
ing of the football association, to be
held late Ja the winter at Philadelphia.
It is expected that the changes which
have been spoken of with such force by
the President will ;be thoroughly con
sidered.
Of the three best known of the ex
perts who attended the White House con
ference. Professor William Reid of Har
vard and Professor Fine of Princeton
are of the opinion that the game can be
no modified that there will be less bru
tality. Walter Camp of Yale declared
last night that with the present rules
the roughness of the sport could not be
abolished.
TAFT DEXOUXCES ROUGHNESS.
John Oweley, coach of the Yale eleven,
eaid the suggestions made by the Presi
dent have no effect in modifying the
games this year, but intimated that there
might be changes in the rules next year.
Secretary of War Taft. speaking of^
football, said yesterday he had discussed!
the situation with President Roosevelt
and they were in accord on the point
that much of the rough element in the
fame should be eliminated. Secretary
Taft added that he would cause any West
Point student to be dismissed who was
found guilty of playing with, unnecessary
roughness.

"The President, with characteristic
vigor, tackled a' hard job. It is hard to

chance is to convince them that the evils
have become intolerable."

ASSERTS IT IS VICTIM
OF A PALPABLE FRAUD
Kern River Oil Company Flic* Yn-vrrr
io Suit of Pipe Line
Compauy.
In answer to the claim of the Kern
County Pipe Line and Storage Company
for $7800 rental of a pipe line through
the McKittrick district, the defendant
in the suit, the Kern River Oil Com
pany, asserts that it does not owe the
sum demanded by the plaintiff corpora
tion. Further, it says that in fact the
plaintiff corporation is endeavoring to
make it the victim of a fraud and in
truth it is entitled to judgment against
the plaintiff for $5196 and interest
The Kern lliver Oil Company in a
cross-complaint alleges that after the
plaintiff corporation found that its line
would prove a losing: venture, owing to
the fact that the Southern Pacific had
built a line into MeKittrick, it decided
to cause the loss to fall on the Kern
River Oil Company, a scheme easy of
accomplishment because four of the
members of the board of directors of
the plaintiff corporation, a majority
thereof, also constituted a majority of
the meynbers of the board of the de
fendant corporation. ,', â¢
To accomplish their object, says the
oil company, they made an agreement
with the oil company by which it was
to pay $50 a day for the transportation
of 500 barrels of oil through the pipe
line and five cents for each additional
barrel up to 2400 barrels a day. This
did not pay the expenses of the pipe
line, so,' it is alleged, the four directors,
whose names are not given, rescinded
the first agreement and executed an
other by which the oil company 'was
to pay $600 a month for the rent of the
pipe line. This change in agreement,
it Is alleged, was never submitted to
the stockholders of the oil company for
ratification, though they were com
pelled to pay the ' sum for several
months.
The sum demanded by the oil com
pany in its cross-complaint was thus
paid out in rentals under the later
agreement, which, it is alleged, con
stituted a fraud against the defendant
corporation. - rV-i;- '-~''i
Will Compromise Clalma.
W. H. iletson. as executor of the
will of the late Patrick Reddy, filed a
petition yesterday for leave to com
promise the claim against the dece
dent's estate for $7279 filed by Ida B.
Lowden. The claimant assered that the
Bum demanded was due her' for stock
in the West Belle Mining Company of
Nevada. She has now agreed to ac
cept the return of the stock in lieu
of the money demanded. The executor
has accepted her offer, and asks the
court to confirm the compromise.

Peter Brunsing of the Brunsing
Tolle & Postel Company, 512 Front

Judge Cabaniss yesterday for the ar
rest of Oscar Lazansky on a charge of

Just because Mr. Lauterborn became
over-ambitious and butted into Ben
nett's stamping ground, the Seals were
handed an extra run and also victory
in the final spasm of the game yester
day afternoon. The climax came when,
with two on the sacks, Waldron. bat
ting for Cap Wilson, lifted a dinky
fly near Bennett. Lauterborn hot
footed after the leather and tried to
gather it. The men bumped and Ben
nett let it glide through his mitts.
Nealon scored and the trouble was
over.
Such another dummy play has not
been pulled off on the Eighth street lot
for some time. It was hard luck and a
bitter, package for Miller, who tossed
shut-out ball till the last round, when
victory was snatched away from him
after he had worked hard to earn it for
eight Innings.
The Seals never had a chance until
the ninth, when Hildebrand was hit by
a pitched ball and Nealon shoved one
through second. Housholder only flew
to third, but Irwin clouted a fast baby
into left, giving Hildebrand time to
sneak over and Nealon got to third.
Then Waldron produced his pop fly and
the blunder was enacted.
The Siwashes made a noise like a
run in the opening period. With Ben
nett out of the way, Kane was given a
life of Gochnauer's wide heave to first.
Wilson let the next one go through him
and Kane pulled up at second. Walters
put him on third with a drive and
Blankenship worked the squeeze play
nicely, putting Kane over the last
jump.
! During the remainder of the game
both Whalen and Miller were very
much , in the limelight. Both tossed
shoots that were about right, and the
batters never had a license to gather
many hits., Miller winged eight men
out on strikes and had a bunch of
speed that was bewildering. ;'\u25a0 (
The reorganized Seattle team looks,
awful good., It plays a fast and snap
py game and works the inside # klnd ot
ball that generally brings trie coin
home. The team does not look like the
same aggregation that visited this city
a few weeks ago, and now every man
on the pay-roll seems Intent on win
ning instead of merely drawing his
monthly stipend.
Jimmy Whalen was very obnoxious
during the course of the game, and in
the eighth spasm he began to crab Um
pire Davis so strongly that the latter
chased him off the lot. Wheeler came
in to work and managed to dispose of
the Siwashes by means of a double
play in the last round, after they had
soused him for two clean bingles. The

LOS ANGELES. Oct. 11.â Tacoma lost
to the locals to-day by a score of 6 to
5, mainly due to. their inability to hit
the ball when men were on bases. The
northerners secu^d a total of eleven
hits, but they were unable to get more
than five runs, and eleven men died on
bases. The locals, scored six runs off
seven hits, but were aided by bases on
balls and errors. The home run of
Cravath in the sixth Inning, which net
ted two runs, was also a factor. Baum
replaced Gray in the' seventh. and suc
ceeded in stopping the run-getting of
the visitors. Fisher sent Fitzgerald to
replace Keefe in the middle of the third
inning, but the change did not effect
the result. Doyle's: double ; with the
bases full in the sixth, scoring three
runs, was , a timely rap. . Score':

B'A fl HI A A!Y WEAKENS THE SYSTEM
nl/'DL\JVI/ AND INVITES DISEASE
Every part of the body is dependent on the blood for nourishment and
strength, and .when from any cause this vital stream of life becomes impov-
erished or run-down, it invites disease to enter. % No one can be well when the
blood is impure; they lack the energy that is natural with health, the com-
plexion becomes pale and sallow, the vital energies are at a low ebb, and they
suffer from a general broken-down condition of health. The system is weak-
ened and unable to resist the diseases and disorders that are constantly assail-
ing it. The Liver and Kidneys, failing to receive the proper stimulation and
nourishment from the blood, grow inactive and dull, and the waste matters
and bodily impurities that should jiass off through these channels of nature
are left in the system to pi oduce Rheumatism, Catarrh, Sores and Ulcers,
Skin Diseases or some other blood disorderl When the blood is in this weak-
ened and diseased conditiori it should be treated with a remedy that is not
only thorough, but gentle in its action. S. S. S. , a purely vegetable remedy,
made of roots, herbs and barks, is just what is needed. It not only cleanses
the blood of all impurities and poisons, and enriches and strengthens it, but

Ballasting- at Low Rate.
The British ship Scottish Moors is the first
b:g foreigner to call at California City. She
is there taicing on ballast and is the first ves
sel to profit by a new arrangement whereby
the expense of ballasting is reduced to a very
low figure. She It anchored within a ehort
clstarice of the quarry. The ballast is taken
out in trucks loaded on ecows. These trucks
ere hoisted over the chip's side, lowered into
the hold and capsized wherever required.
This method of ballasting does away with
dock tolls, wharfage and many stevedores, the
tnJy. handling, necessary I* -Ir.g the first load
!.-.* of the truck* at the quarry.

on her doorstep shortly before midnight
Tuesday night. It was wrapped up in
a woman's skirt and jacket.
Airs. Marinella told Captain Reynolds
that she has six children of her own,
one of . them a boy. She said if the
abandoned infant had been a. boy she
might have adopted it, but she would
have to be paid for its support, Mrs.
Marinella was accompanied by Mrs!
Dorothea Frontera, also the wife of a
fisherman. She said she had been mar
ried twenty years and had no children.
She offered to adopt the baby if she
was guaranteed payment for . carins

ARMY QUARTERS
NOT ADEQUATE
General Funston's Annual
Beport of Department of
California Is Published
NEED NEW BUILDINGS
Posts at Presidio and Fort
McDowell Are No Credit
to the U. S. Govemnient
. General Funston's annual report of the
department of California was issued here
yesterday and -.handed to \ ail officers of
the department. Following a report of
the .record of events, General Funston
states that several of the posts about
here, so far as the buildings are con
cerned, are not a credit to the Govern
ment of the United States. As to the
buildings at Fort McDowell, he says, they
have outlived their usefulness. He sees
no use of maintaining a post there, ex
cept for the use :of casuals. He thinks
the post should be abandoned or new
buildings erected there.
The Government should take action and
improve the grounds at the Presidio to
make them suitable for dwellings. Among
other things General Funston says:
"The condition of many of the buildings
on the Presidio reservation and the ap
pearance of the post in general is not
a credit to the Government of the United
States. This does not arise from dere
liction on the part' of the successive post
commanders, but from long years of ne
glect of one of the most important posts
in the United States and one of the show
places of the Pacific Coast."
In speaking of the grounds at the Pre
sidio for drill purposes General Funston
says:
In connection with this question there should
be taken into corisideration the advisability
of changing to some other station the battal
ion of field artillery now at this post. There
Is no suitable drill ground for a field artillery
battalion on the Presidio reservation nor In
its vicinity. Long marches must be under
taken to find ground suitable for target prac
tice. The ground most used for drills by the
three batteries constituting the field artillery
battalion in question is that part of the reser
vation known as the "golf links." but here the
ground is bo broken and the hillsides so steep
and slippery In places that drills at a trot or
gallop are fraught with no little peril to the
personnel and .. the horses of the batteries,
while the space Is so limited that satisfactory
drills cannot be had. Even the projected fill
ing up of the low land along the bay shore,
while It will furnish & quite satisfactory drill
ground for a regiment of Infantry or a squad
ron of cavalry, will be altogether Inadequate
for a battalion of field artillery. For the same
reasons that apply to the Presidio of San
Francisco, there is no pest In this department
suited for the station of a field artillery bat
talion. , ;'; . Â£''-?;';;'.â¢ .. .
Referring to Fort McDowell, he says:
At Fort McDowell, on Angel Island. Cal.,
all of the more important buildings of the post,
with the exception of the hospital, are very
old, the barracks especially having about
reached -the limit of their usefulness. The
whole post, with its old wooden buildings hud
dled closely together, \u25a0 Is a veritable fire trap.
There is no apparent reason . for the further
maintenance of this post, except that the loca
tion is a good one for a depot of recruits and
casuals,.- better, .in fact, than the location of
the present . depot on the opposite side of the
Island. Fort McDowell Is unsulted for an in
fantry post for the reason that -there is no
room for drills ' in extended ! order, the hill
slopes near the post being exceedingly steep,
and there being practically no level ground
in , the vicinity. These features,, however,
would not militate against its use as a depot
of recruivi and casuals. In any event, modern
buildings should' be constructed, or. the. post
â¢abandoned within a year.- > ..
The depot of recruits and casuals, a sub
post of Fort McDowell, is located on the oppo
site or eastern ' side of Angel Island. 'The
buildings at this post are mere Â»'shacks," with
the exception of the hospital, which 1* a cred
itable brick building. - .
Lieutenant John H. Allen left yester
day for his new post at Fort Sill. Col
onel George H. Toney, commanding the
General Hospital, referring to this young
surgeon said: "Lieutenant Allen has been
stationed here for two years as executive
officer. He has proved himself to be a
thoroughly efficient officer in every way,
and. l am sorry to see him leave here."
Mrs. Malcolm Henry and Miss Cath
erine Wright, whose father is Governor
Wright of the Philippines, visited the
Presidio yesterday, as the guests of Lieu
tenant J. F. Hall. They were shown all
through the general hospital, including
the big new operating .room.
Lieutenant W. P. Goodall, who has been
laid up at the general hospital at the Pre
sidio for the last month with catarrhal
jaundice is fast returning to health.
Captain Chauncey B. Humphrey, Twen
ty-second Infantry^ having reported at
these headquarters on the Bth instant, will
report to the commanding officer. Fort
McDowell, California, for duty at that
station pending the arrival of his regi
ment, which he will then Join.
Leave of absence for one month, to
take effect about November 1. 1905. Is
granted Second Lieutenant David B. Tal
le"y, Third- Cavalry, Presidio of San Fran
cisco, California-
Leave of absence for one month,, to
take effect about the 15th instant, with
permission to apply to. the military sec
retary of the army for an extension of
one month, i 3 granted Captain Lawrence
B. Slmonds, commissary, assistant to the
chief commissary of the department.
Captain and Mrs.- Slmonds will probably
leave on Saturday.
Lieutenant A. R. Jones, Third Cavalry,
returned from leave, registered at de
partment headquarters yesterday.
311 m Johnston Wants Freedom.
An application for a writ of habeas
corpus" for the release, of -Mi^ Jennie
Johnston was made before Judge Cook
yesterday and it was made returnable
this morning. She is the young woman
who is accused of arranging the meet
ing between Henrietta Reush and Ben
nett Millar, who is on trial in Judge
Cook's court on a' charge of criminal
ly assaulting Miss Reush.' at which
meeting Miss Reush says she was in
duced to testify that Millar was Inno
cent of the crime. The police want
to hold Miss Johnston till the Millar
case comes up again to-morrow, when
she may be ordered into custody for
subornation of perjury.

Islais Creek Improvement

CHAMBER HAS A PLAX
Newhall Says Governor and
State Legislators Will Be
Asked, to Take Action
, The Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco has set on foot a movement
which President George A. Newhall
says he hopes other commercial or
ganizations of the city will take up.
that, In the end, I^lals Creek and In
dia Basin may add largely to the ship
ping facilities of this port.
The Chamber of Commerce, so says
Mr. Newhall, will put Itself in com
munication with Governor Pardee, with
the California legislators and with the
Board of State Harbor Commissioners
as soon o.J convenient and an official
investigation of the benefits and cost
involved in making an inland harbor
of the India Basin and .improving ana
lining with wharves Islais Creek
will be asked for a preliminary
step to prlng about what is desired.
President Newhall last evening
that the Improvements now proposed
have been discussed before. The dis
cussion has not reached the stage of
acttion heretofore. It was necessary
for some body to step in. and the
Chamber of Commerce has simply put
Itself In position to lead the way. Pres
ident Newhall has communicated with
the Board of State Harbor Commission
ers and has learned that lt Is read>
and willing, to co-operate as much as
possible. :y:-.f: y:-.f
A plan map has been prepared for the
'Chamber of Commerce, which shows
what might be accomplished in the way
of adding wharfage facilities to the
harbor of San Francisco. â¢ As the move
ment is In the formative stage, of
course, there is nothing final about the
map, which serves mainly as an object
lesson and source of suggestions. The
following resolution has been adopt
ed by the trustees of the Chamber of
Commerce:
Whereas, The work of increasing: the dock-
Ing facilities of San Francisco is progressing
aj fast as circumstances will permit; and
Whereas. The Increase at present contem
plated by the Board of- Harbor Commlsisoaers
amounts to 10.00U dockage feet, to be avail
able within the next five years; and
Whereas. It is apparent that the growing
commerce of the port demands larger docking
space, especially with a view to the commercial
needs of the future; therefore be lt
Itesolved. That the Chamber of Commerce
o* San Francisco deems it essential that steps
be taken by proper authorities for the im
provement of Islais Creek and the conversion
of India Basin into an inland harbor.
COMPLICATION'S AltlSE OUT
OF SEARCH WARRANT CASE
Sirs. Sarah Ilerksteln Accuses Joseph
Fuer of Knocking Her Down "\u25a0 ;.
and Robbing Her.
Joseph Fuer, 149 Russ street, was ar
rested in the Hall of Justice yester
day morning by Detectives Regan and
O'Connell on complaint of Mrs. Sarah
Berksteln. 43 Harriet street, and
booked at the City Prison on a charge
of : robbery. His attorney, Henry A.
Jacobs, made such an outcry to Acting
Captain- Reynolds against his arrest
that Reynolds instructed Detectivea
Buhner and Freel to arrest Jacobs on
a charge of disturbing the peace. Fuer
was released on $50 cash bail and Ja
cobs on $20 cash.
The trouble arose over a search-war
rant case, Mrs. Berkstein alleging that
Fuer took possession of personal prop
erty belonging to her. 'After the search
warrant was issued on Tuesday, Mrs.
Berksteln says that Fuer met .her In
the afternoon at. Folsora and Russ
streets. He knocked her down and at
tempted to take her purse containing
$35 from her. During the struggle' the
coin fell out of the purse and a num
ber of small boys pounced upon it and
ran away with it. The case will.be
threflhed out before Pcrtlce Judge Ca
banlss to-day. Both parties are re
cently from tbe East.

BIG PLUM TO GO
TO COAST MAN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 11. â A special to
the Press from Washington says: Pres
ident Roosevelt has decided to name a
man from the Pacific Coast for the va
cancay in the Interstate Com
merce Commission on January 1.
when former Governor Fifer ,-of
Illinois will retire. On good authority
it is, said one of two men will be ap
pointed, either William R. Wheeler or
Franklin K. Lane, recently the Demo
cratic nominee for Governor of Cali
fornia.
President Wheeler of the University
of California, it is said, was asked by
President Roosevelt to suggest some
one for the place. It is believed that
he suggested William R. Wheeler.
There is another authority, however,
close to the President for the state
ment that President Roosevelt is con
templating the appointment of Lane,
although that would create a Demo
cratic majority in the Interstate Com
merce Commission, where now there Is
one more Republican than there are
Democrats.
Friends of the administration say
that they believe the President may
seek to accentuate his desire to have
the traffic rate legislation and its en
forcement entirely removed from poll
tics by selecting Lane for Fifer's place.
POLICE HELPED
BY MAN SOUGHT
CHICAGO, Oct. 11.â Charles {Mahle,
charged with fifteen robberies and com
plicity in one murder, was arrested
near Hobart, Ind., last night after a
running: revolver fight, during which
he was severely wounded by deptuy
sheriffs. Mahle for the last two weeks
had been assisting the police and depu
ties in their efforts to solve the mys
tery surrounding the crimes for which
he was finally arrested.
That he could be implicated in the
crimes was not suspected until Mahle
offered to sell a watch In a saloon at
Hobart. His eagerness to sell the
watch at any price aroused the sus
picions of a deputy, who followed him
from the place. The deputy learned
later that the watch corresponded to
the description of one stolen from Wil
liam Halstead, a farmer.
When Mahle found that he was sus
pected he took flight, but was followed
by a number of farmers and deputies.
Several shots were fired on both sides
and the fugitive at last hid in a hay
stack, where he was captured.

â¢ '"In the afternoon the Vanderlip sr>etch at
"Washington in which he made the statement
that should a stock market speculation start
from the present level of prices In the face
of the extra demand on money which the crop
aad business alike are making, the result
might easily be temporary disaster." was con
sidered raiher bearish and a warning from
important financial interests against any bull
teh activity in the stock market until the
mtnetary situation had improved. It caused
Â«. general selling movement and a decline
one to three DOlr.te in prices, with the
largest losses on the higher priced stocks. The
fundamental conditions are all favorable, and
\u25a0with the elnsla exception of the money mar
ket the outlook encourages expectations ef a
resumption of the bull movement within a rea
â¢onabie tiiae. The fi>eech was taken to In
dicate the attitude of the Standard Oil City

about heavy and ureent selling of ptock* and

"The feature of the trading during the past
week has been the steadiness of security prices
in the face of high rates for call money and
the great resistance to attempts to depress
prices. Money advanced to as high as S per
cent, and 7 per cent was the prevailing rate.
Notwithstanding this unfavorable influence,
coupled with renewed discussion of govern
mental control of railroad rate*, prices did
r<n break. They eased off slowly and stub
bciroly and short commitments resulted only
In loss of stock. Stocks did not come out on
t- 'esslons, nor so far as we can learn are
t! ere any stop orders oZ -importance near the
present level of prifpy. Copper chares were
more genuinely active and showed bettei
s-trength than at any time since the big ad
vance four years ago. It seemed as though
trs increase in the Anaconda dividend sup
Â«Jk -i the needed 6timu;us to a bull market in
- "The only change worth mentioning in the
business eituation is iYe strength and activity
of the Iron and steil situation. The fall
buying movement has begun much earlier than
\u25a0usual, and is 'in surprising volume. Stee!
li'lets continue in heavy demand and it is
rrobable the prices of both billets and Besse
mer iron will be advanced shortly.
"The increased money rates will undoubtedly
tali for further gold imports, but in view of
i!ie Panama canal expenses, the ~ activity in
f<=ntra! business and the magnitude of the
<-rr r-s It seems improbable that money rates
v.li! permanently fall much btlow 5 per cent
for the balance of the year. We feel that the
market will net again become active until
money falls to at leant 5 PÂ«"r cent, but prices
have not yet discounted the improvement in
tho business and industrial situation and con
sequently we look for a higher level of prices
in time."

\>vÂ» York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 11. â One'of the seemingly
abrupt rerf^rsais of sentiment which puzzle
the observer of Wall street^occurred in the
s"^ck market to-day. From, an appearance
"V!J strength and confident buying the market
,?_ -tray turned weak and a flood cf offerings
'â¢s.iie upon it from all directions. ca4Â»l n JT
\u25a0 prices rapidly downward. The abruptness of
t!ie transition from extreme confidence to some
thing like fright was more apparent than
r-ral. owing to the fact of the artificial char
t -ter which has been taken on by epeculation
cf late due to the large predominance of pro
tfÂ«siona.l operations. The necessities in the
money market bave restricted the active specu
lation, and. with a period of dullness to be
faced, large interests in stocks determined to
l.o!d prices and await the return of ease in
mopey for a renewal of the campaign to lift
prices to a higher level. Speculative markets,
however, will rot remain stationary and if
an advancing tendency halts there la almost
inevitably a disposition to react. Speculators
who are hoiding stocks on margin get im
j atier.t at the non-appearance of profits and
*. re Inclined to pell out even if no pressure is
}'lae*-d upon them in the way of restriction of
credits and of decline In prices which threaten
losses. Credits In use for stock market com
rn'.tmtnts hav e rot been free from pressure
end occasional declines of late have threatened
losses as wel!. The result has been the growth
of doubtful sentiment in the speculation which
\u25a0 rr.sde .the market vulnerable to any sudden
ir.fluence. Th<; influence which was accorded
:srgest importance during the day's sudden
Belliac was th* address before the bankers'
ccivention in Washington by an official of a
N*w York bank. rnoÂ«t closely affiliated with
one of the groups of capitalist*. Room-trader*
\u25a0 professed great alarm when it was reported
. that this official asserted, in connection with
the country's prospects, that a "tree never
Quite grows m heaven." and that he ex
rre*MHJ the opinion that a stock market specu
lation starting from the present high level
cf prioee in the face of the extraordinary de
tr.er.d for capital and money might easily re
sult in temporary <j:Kai?ter. The Great North
era "melon cutting" had a sympathetic effect
' en & number of high-priced railroad stocks.
fXrs.nn Pacific had the benefit of its holdings
yl^ 'ireat .Northern. sJthough the latter stock
wei under pressure throughout, said to be
on liquidation of Cnion Pacific holdings. Pub
lished reports of new interest* In Wisconsin
Central were made the basis of rumors of
an Trie extension in that property. But these
and other factors of strength were totally un
availing to hold the market in the face of
the afternoon liquidation. The last prices wer*
about the lowest and the closing was weak.

New York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 11.â COTTONâ The mar
ket made a further recovery from the loss of
the last five days, the maximum gain being
10 to 10 points over last night's close. The
chief influence was a" frost scare, with tem
peratures In Oklahoma and Indian Territory
reported nt 32.- â¢ a good many were inclin-ed
to regard the matter of frost at this early date
as largely sentimental, with small probability
of actual damage. For this reason the mar
ket was freely sold on all rallies. The short
interest is much larger than it has been in
months.

ing I has been . due entirely ." to the scarcity of
cars, . for there seems to be quite a" healthy
demand for good Hay. with practically, none
coming in. Owing -to the large amount of
poor . Hay marketed ' during, the summer â¢ but
comparatively little of the No. 1 grades was
stored away here; now that there is a; good
demand for it there is none to be had, with
the .consequence that very high prices are
being paid for strictly choice grades. We ex

year it has come a bit late, but In a more
marked degree than . heretofore. ! All lndlcav
tions point toward its continuance until the

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The Potato market is slenderly supplied
with Salinas Burbanks pwing to the scarcity
of freight cars. There were none received yes
terday and what little stock was on hand was
flrrnly held at stiff prices. Stocks of river
Potatoes are very large and are being adcted
to dally. Sweet Potatoes were In Compara
tively light supply and higher prices ruled for
good stock. Onions were ih good supply but
firm, with trade active.
Price* of miscellaneous vegetables showed
but little change from the previous report.
Trade was of average proportions, but stocks
of most kinds were more than sufficient for
market needs and there was quite a surplus
on hand at the close. Green Corn has about
had its run.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs,
The Butter market was bare yesterday and
prices moved up again. The demand for fine
goods was urgent and could . not be filled.
Cheese ruled firm, with supplies s:eadily grow,
ing smaller. Eggs were steady to firm and
tho market was unsettled, some houses quoting
the best ranch up to 41c and others offering
to sell them at 39c. It was purely a case ot
individual stocks. ' But, taken as a whole, the
Dairy market was strong all around, with re
duced supplies.
Receipts were 20.000 lbs Butter, 775 cases

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
There was another car of Eastern Cranberries
in yesterday and still another is due to-day.
These last arrivals are held for' more money,
with higher markets East. Coos Bay lota were
firmly held at the old quotations and some
dealers were expecting a higher range of prices.
The warm weather continued to favor trade
in other fru'.ts. but thtre was not much im
provement in prices, supplies of most descrip
tions being well up to requirements. Small
orchard fruits were firm with the exception
of Apples, which continued to accumulate, and
it wae difficult to obtain over 90c per box for
round lots of the fanciest stock. Watermelons
were In good request. The bulk of the) avail
able supplies were controlled by one hindler,
who took advantage ot the situation and ad
vanced prices. Nutmegs and Cantaloupes
shared in the firmness and the best lots met
with prompt sale at or near the oucside quota
tions, while poor and old stock was neffiected.
Citrus goods, too, were active and prices of
Grape Fruit were advanced. Table Grapes
were generally firm. The receipts were light
and a good portion arrived late. Wine Grapes
were unchanged, but the demand was less
urgent. Strawberries, Raspberries and Black
berries continued to command firm prices

A local house says of Wool: "Boston re
ports a quiet market, with only moderate
dealings.. Prices there, however, seem to be
well sustained and dealers have faith in the
future ff>r considerable volume of trade at
satisfactory prices. .The stock .of domestic
Wool in the country la not too large, there
fore there is no reason to expect much. If
any. change In prices for the balance of the
year. Most of the spring shearing is now In
the hands of dealers. The fall shearing prac
tically cuts no figure In prices at any time, aa
fall Wools are limited In quantity at best. The
local market is quiet and featureless."

Harrison's circular says: "Since the steam
ship Sierra left this port In September there
has not been ,a Coal arrival from Australia.
There are twenty-three vessels listed to load
Coal at Newcastle, N.S . W., with a carrying
capacity of about 50,000 tons; Included in this
list are three steamers, with a carrying capa
city-'of about 15,000 tons. The arrivals of
colonial Coal for the month of September.
1904. were 15,952 tons: for the month of Sep
tember of the presÂ«nt year, only 5250 tons. Tn*
deliver^ of British Columbia last month werÂ»
over IS.COO tons. The total deliveries of Coal
from all sources this year for September show
a shrinkage of 19,000 tons, against the Coal
arrivals of the same period for 1904. There
is a perceptible shrinkage of all grades of
Coal in the yards here, etill the wholesale
prices remain unchanged, as early relief Is
expected from the British Columbia collieries
as soon as future freight engagements can be
arranged. There is but one vessel due from
Newcastle. N. Â§. W. F but the three steamer
cargoes should be received here early next
month. The strike at British Columbia that
has been in progress for the past four months
has been amicably arranged, and work will be
recommenced at .an early date. Duration of
the agreement will be for two years, and the
minimum rate of wages to the miners appears
to be a very generous one. All collieries
that have been arfected by the strike just
ended belong to the Western Fuel Company
here, which have absolute control over all Brit
ish Columbia Coal products coming |to this
market. Producers cf fuel oil are endeavor
ing to establish a better rate for their products
it is very doubtful if they will be successful.

TH!i SAN KRvVNCISCO CALL, THURSDAY;, OCTOBER- -12, iL9OS/
CONSUL'S ACTS
ARE PECULIAR
Federal Authorities 3lay Be
Asked to Make liuiuiry Into
the Case of Woo Wong Ho
CONTEST OVER/ A GIRL
It Is Said She Was Not Mar
ried Although a Certifi
cate Is Produced in Court
The Federal authorities may be asked
to v in vestigate 1 the conduct of Julius S.
Lay, the American Consul at Canton,
China, and Rev. Dr. Henry V. Noyes, a
Presbyterian missionary at Canton, in
connection with the case of Woo Wong
Ho, a Chinese girl about 15 years of
age; v â¢ .;" :
The girl " was rescued about two
weeks ago from a house in Chinatown
by Miss Donaldina Cameron of the
Chinese: Presbyterian Mission, Sacra
mento street, aided by' the police,- on
the grotind that she had been brought
here on August 23 last as a slave. Sbe
was taken to the mission and an appli
cation for a writ of habeas corpus for
her release was ' made before Judge
Cook by Chin Lum, who claimed -to be
her husband.
The matter came up before the
Judge yesterday and the girl was called
to the stand. Through. an interpreter
she testified that she knew nothing
about being married to Chin Lum. She
remembered being taken before some
one in Canton, and some questions were
asked her before she left on the steam
ship, but. she never saw Chin Lum till
after the steamship had sailed. She
was happy where she was at the mis
sion and wished to stay there.
Attorney- Carpenter produced a cer
tificate of marriage signed by Rev. Dr.
Noyes arid countersigned by Consul
Lay. It purported to show that the girl
had been married at Canton on July 10 |
to Chiiv Lum. The certificate bore hei v
photograph.' Her age was given as lo ,
and Chin Lum's as 23. He said he be
lieved that the girl was intimidated
into stopping at the mission.
The court said the girl was the best
judge of what she should do, and a? she
testified that she was happy at the mis
sion and desired to remain there, he
would not interfere. The writ would
be dismissed, he said.
The point brought out by the produc
tion of the marriage certificate, which
the Federal authorities may be' asked
to investigate, is whether Rev. Dr.
Noyes and Consul Lay have an ar
rangement whereby Chinese girls may
be shipped to this country for slave
purposes under the guise of being mar
ried. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0

LOSES ONE DOLLAR
AND HER LOVER.
Coin Abstracted From Discarded Stock
ing: in Which Miss Evans Placed It.
HER SABLE WOOER ARRESTED
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Wilson Holman,; ebon-skinned and squat
of figure, deplored his plight as a pris
oner under accusation of petty , larceny,
but his keenest soul-agony was occasioned
by the realization that his accuser was
one with whom he had exchanged love
vows and who had assured him that he
was tha embodiment of all her ideals of
what constituted perfect manhood. One
brief half-hour. prior to the filing of her
charge that he was a. thief she had ec
statically thanked Providence for its ben-
eflcence in bestowing upon her the undi
vided affection of a thorough affinity.
"En ef seen," Mr. Holman bitterly
opined to Police Judge Fritz, "am de
fickleness ob de- femuline sect."
One silver dollar was the- plunder al
leged to have been pilfered from Miss
Anna Evans, chocolate-hued, by Mr.
Holman. He had spent Tuesday evening
visiting at her home. 1200& Stockton
street, and Wednesday morning was well
under. way when she ascertained her loss.
After bidding Mr. Holman a tender adieu,
of . which the man in the moon- was sole
witness; she returned to the sitting' room
in which the preceding five hours had
sped all too swiftly, and somethingâ she
knew not whatâ prompted her to examine
the green-and-orange-striped stocking in
which she had placed for safe and secre
tive keeping the nucleus of a fund for the
purchase of a wedding trousseau. Blithe
ly humming the refrain of "How Ah Lubs
Dat Man," she took the stocking from
the bureau drawer in which it was deeply
interred, and to her amazement found it
empty. \u25a0
"Ah nebbah wuz mo' flubbahgasted dan
Ah wuz at dat: minit,"' Miss Evans in
formed the court, "fcT Ah hed placed de
white dollah in de stockin' jes fo" Mistah
Holman drapped in, en 'c wuz de only
pusson dat kern inta de sittin* room aftah
dat time. Ah cud scasely b'lleve dat he'd
done gone swiped de white dollah, but dah
wuz nobuddy else teh 'spect."
"What opportunity, if any, did. this de
fendant have, to take the stocking from
the drawer and the dollar from the stock
ing without your knowledge that he was
doing so?", inquired counsel for the de
fense.
"Well, sah, Ah thunk dat obah 'fo* Ah
gits 'im "rested," was the answer, "en
Ah rekamaembahs dat w'en Ah goes teh
de kitching teh git 'im some cole biled
hamâ he's mighty fon'.ob hamâ he looks
kine ob flusterated w'en Ah kirns back.
But Ah doan 'spect he's bin arswipin'
nuffln till Ah fines dat yah white dollah
done gone."
Miss Evans declared that she felt even
more profoundly than did Mr. Holman
the humiliation of having' confidence be
trayed. Yes, she had told him while he
was munching the ham that he possessed
her whole heart, and between bites he
had asseverated that he was an abject
slave to her charms. When she thought
of that declaration and realized that it
was uttered while the white, dollar was in
hie pocket her love, gave way to con
tempt, f]
The stocking was produced in evidence,
Miss Evans having carried.it In her hand
bag to court, and the defense . tried to
make capital out of a hole in its heel
by claiming that the dollarâ if it had ever
contained a dollarâ might have dropped
therefrom and rolled to some unsearched
spot, either before or after the stocking
wÂ»s taken from the drawer by the com
plainant. But the complainant herself
and Patrolmen Bakulich and Daggett tes
tified that every. nook and cranny of the
bureau drawer and the sitting room floor
had been explored in futile quest of the
dollar.
"It 'peahs teh me lak dah's some oddah
man at de bottom of dis case," Mr.'Hol
man remarked after he had been remand
ed for further hearing.
"No oddah man fo' me if dey're all lak
you am," Miss Evans retorted.

Monday. \u25a0 ';\u25a0>;
When 'the Grays' and the Hemples,
husbands and wives, were arraigned be
fore Judge Fritz on' the charge of having
profaned- the corridor* of.,' his court by
utilizing it as a battleground the previous
day, one of the ladies '"applied for a
transfer of the: case to some other trib
unal, she opining that his Honor' might
naturally entertain .some . prejudice. The
application was "promptly, ' not to say
thankfully, granted,^ and to.. Judge
Cfibanlss hied .the -quartet, accompanied
by Attorney \u25a0.Treadwell, who ;hadjf-jre
ceived bodily injury while endeavoring to
separate the combatants.
"May It -please the court," said , Mr.
Treadwell, "the parties to this case have
met and talked it over and decided ""to
abstain from, further violence .toward
each' other. > 1 . .; may also ; state . that: the
severe blow ; unintentionally delivered by
one of them upon ; my solar plexus can
not be forgotten ' until the pain' occa
sioned by it has:entlrely. departed./but it
has been forgiven," arid I ; would respect
fully; ask for. a' dismissal ; of the charge
against the defendants.": .
, When he /alluded to. his physical, ill;, the
advocate; placed his right hand upon his
right, lower abdominal region,: thus /sig
nifying- the spot that ; had been smitten,
and when the \ Judge : askedj him \u25a0 If the
solar, plexus was located at or near that
spot he replied lln - the /affirmative.
'\u2666"Without' claiming to~ possess the an
atomical knowledge ; of; a/:. Bacigalupi,"
said his >Honor."""l must; pronounce you
In error;-; The . solar , plexus is : planted
somewhere In the vicinity- of /the heart,
which. It! may -not: be superfluous^ to In
form you, is In the left side of; the chest.
*Your hand covers the vermiform appen
dix." >/. â¢ .DjS^^^^si^S
"Well, my hand Is . where , I ,; was 'struck,
and \u25a0 the- newspapers this morning. stated
that" I was" struck upon J the solar plexus,"
rresponded the attorney. "I hnte .to.qucs-i
tion the mooted accuracy of the press,. but
your Honor's correction is cheerfully ac
cepted,; and I; would respectfully renew
my appeial for dismissal. Each of the de
fendants is pledged to abstain from as
sailing any of .the others or, any of the
attorneys in the case."
"I don't care much about what' they
say or do in regard to the attorneys,"
said the Judge,- "but before I dismiss
them, they must satisfy me that they
have become reconciled. Are they willing
to shake hands?"
"They are," replied Mr. Treadwell.
-^"Then let me see .'em shake."
Mr.; Gray and Mr. Hemple shook hands
and so did Mrs. Gray and Mrs. Hemple.
and then each gentleman shook hands
with the other gentleman's wife and
jyien Attorney Treadwell shook hands
with each member of the quartet, and
then Mrs. Hemple advanced toward Mrs.
Gray with evident intent to v give . oscu
latory emphasis to the armistice, but
Mrs. Gray was so unresponsive that Mrs.
Hemple changed her mind and looked
hurt, but managed to retain her smile of
amity. Then the Judge told them- all
to reappear before him one calendar
month from that date and tell him how
they had been getting along during the
Interim. . . : ' .-
Inconsistency is not one of the defects
of Cornelius O'Keefe's character, how
ever unenviable its other dominant traits
may be, for in the court o( Judge Slo
gan his behavior was in perfect line with
the disorderliness which . had provoked
his beng placed there as a defendant.
Whether his sturdy spirit of law defiance
will survive the long term of imprison
ment to which he shall be sentenced this
morning is a subject of debate among
the character students in the Hall, of
Justice corridors. Even money is offered
that he will emerge from incarceration
with enhanced respect for the law a^id its
machinery, but those who hold" contrary
belief are asking for. odds. . . ,
Mr. O'Keefe was originally arrested
for drunkenness, the complainants being
his wife and son, who averred that he had
imbibed to', excess and then terrorized
them by brandishing a razor and de
claring that he would carve them into
mincemeat if they dared to leave the
family residence, 29A Morris avenue,
without having obtained* his permission
to do so. To, make sure that they would
heed his desire, he sat upon the front door
sill and there, with razor displayed, did
sentinel duty ,i until" thirst compelled him
to relinquish his post. \u25a0 " * \\
When the Judge "had' heard ; the fore
going details, he ordered . that ah . addi
tional charge of threats- against life be
placed ; against Mr. C^keefe. who there
upon indulged -in -bluster to such extent
as to provoke the bench to command
that he . be booked also for disturbance
of the peace. '^Contempt of court would
have been added to the 'category of Mr.
O'Keefe's offenses If, the bailiffs had not
hastily . removed- him; for he was em
purpled and dumb with rage and strug
gling valiantly to speak when he van
ished.
It was a queer coincidence that led to
Miss Mamie Clark, a domestic employed
at '706V> Tennessee street, finding herself
a defendant before Judge Cabanlss on
the charge of: obtaining money by false
pretense. . ' *
The young woman was intrusted by her.
employer to get a 510 gold piece changed
into five silver and one $5 golden
coin, and she lost the latter and was
crying over. her inability to find it when
some small boys Informed her that six
year-old Paddy . Breen of 702 . Florida
street was its possessor. Sure enough,
Master Paddy did have a ?5 gold piece.
and when the girl claimed it he gave It
to her and in her gratitude she pre
sented him with 10 cents.
Breen pcre, , who Is a boiler-maker at
the Union Iron Works, returned to his
home that evening to find that a J5 gold
piece had been abstracted , from a pocket
of his best pantaloons, and Inquiry de
veloped the information that Master
Paddy had taken : It, also that it - had
been transferred by him to Miss Clark.
After he had sufficiently, trounced Paddy
the Irate father went to Miss Clark and
demanded . the coin, but she declined to
give it to him, so:he had her arrested.
The Judge said he believed the state
ments of both the man and; the girl, but
he could not lawfully convict her of hav
ing obtained the coin by false pre
tense,- inasmuch as she sincerely be
lieved it was the coin she had dropped,
a belief which Master Paddy, evidently
with 'an eye to "\ obtaining the 10 cents
reward, did.n ot endeavor to remove. So
the case was dismissed.
