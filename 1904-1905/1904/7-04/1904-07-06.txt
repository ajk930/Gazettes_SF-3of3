FOURTH BRINGS DEATH -
TO TWENTY-FIVE PEOPLE
Many times during the past few days
the suggestion has been made , that;
Bryan would swing his strength" to this
or that candidate, and the Democrats
who were anxious to organize a 1 win-',
nlng coalition investigated and "found
that outside of the Nebraska delegation
the former "candidate had no following
save the few scattered delegates who
were, bound by" the unit : rule and In
structed. : . â¢'-..Â¦ -Â¦Â¦; â¢'
Many visitors called at the. Nebraska
headquarters during the- day; arid ex
amined the plaster cast of Bryan ';Â¦ on
the mantel, but these callers" were not
the men who; are in control of "this con
vention. It is expected that there will
be a clash with Bryan, over- the 'plat
form, but that ; document Is not Â¦ pre
dicted to bo a conservative utterance.
Bryan Is to '.J be accorded a", respectful
hearing, but! the dominating "element- In
the convention,. It is frequently assert
ed, will not! temporize or attempt ."to
placate or conciliate. The forces which
will adopt; the platform | and name the
candidate for President will "also name
the Vice President, and- this element
has allowed if: to become known' that
no concession to' the- minority, no vote,
catching expedient, is to be adopted in
choosing the' nominee for the second
place. , : ' ';-' '. " : ; '
ST. LOUIS, July 5.â An^ interesting
feature of the day's proceedings was
the development of the waning of
Bryan. The National Cornmittee se
lected four years ago. by a convention
following his -. unquestioned Â¦ leadership
to-day turned away from him In
tling the Illinois contest. Bryan had
made the fight against Hopkins' his
own, and the unanimous action of .the
committee Indicated clearly that he no
longer wields his old-time
control. : . Â«">*,.: Â¦ .:~ i.' Â¦."*':'â¢â¢'
Convention Marks
Former Leader's
Passing:
Not'the least of the efforts of the , anti-Parker men has be.en directed
toward preventing a". stampede by delegations, 'whether bound by instruc
tions'or; otherwise. It is the rank arid file that is pressing for bandwagon
seats' and,, while the anti-Parker leaders, speak disparagingly of the men
who are; so. anxious to be on the/winning â¢ side, they ' are aware ' that these
delegates cannot be held together very long In the face of the compact
Â¦ 'Â¦' "A story was current that- David B. Hill, flushed with the fruits of vic
tory,! would undertake to force upon. the opposition a platform so radical
that! some of the : Southerh : delegates' would break away from Parker. But
the Illusion was dispelledi It was to-night learned that Hill, would not be
chairman of the resolutions committee but that John A; Mac*Mahon of Ohio
or Senator Bailey of Texas would be named and that Bailey had been se
lected\o]cross' swords with William J.' Bryan in the debate over the plat
form on the- floor of- the 'convention. ' .
'Massachusetts will give no indication or pledge. of her delegates beyond
OIney. The same ,is true of Wall of Wisconsin. Harmon of Ohio and
Conkrell of Missouri, although it is. supposed that Missouri will go to
.Gorman should there be an opportunity. -The Gorman men in West Vlr
'gihia,'Maryland arid th*e District, of Columbia prefer Parker to uncer
tainty,, and. are chafing. under the restraint placed upon them by the ven
erable Henry G. Davis,, who clings to-tho hope that something may turn
up .favorable , to Gorman.
* ; Upon slender threads^of various kinds the Parker opposition has hung
its hope'V while .the" Parker men have been moving "forward with calm as
surance to other matters connected with the convention. Former Senator
Smith of New Jersey, who has been holding hU delegation in the leash,
while. it was anxious, to go to Parker, said 'that Parker 'would be nominated
unless the disagreement On the platform should drive some State delega
tion from; New -York's, candidate.* .'.:Â¦ '. i V V - Â¦>- '-
Amonsr the candidates named who would have_been satisfactory were
P8ttlson of Pennsylvania.' Gorman of Maryland,- Gray of Delaware, Har
mon of Ohio,' OIney of Massachusetts, and Coler of New York. Upon this
proposition 7 some of the antf-Parker men have been working, but they have
not : been 'meeting with much succes: > -
;. Cohesion of the " ar. ti- Parker men is apparently impossible. Hearst
cannot transfer his' delegates, and his supporters cannot promise the in
structed and pledge Hearst" men for any man after Hearst Is out of the
running. . L i . Â¦
'. Criticism of the action of Pennsylvania has been free and harsh among
some of the anti-Parker men. but others say that a proposition made by
one of the Pennsylvania leaders Is quite -fair. It is said that after the
action of the Pennsylvania delegation last night a member of the delega
tion held a conference with some] of the anti-Parker leaders and said
that Pennsylvania, notwithstanding' the Indorsement of Parker, would give
68 : votes , to any Eastern candidateâ with the exception of Hearstâ
upon whom the opposition would concentrate enough pledged votes which,
together ' with the Â¦ 68 votes of Pennsylvania, would make.*2 votes
more than the one-third of the. convention^ .~
'.The Parker opposition was disturbed but not routed by the action
of, Pennsylvania last night. The 68 votes of that State have been for
Â¦wec-ks'jplaced in the Parker column and are part of the 500. odd votes that
have been claimed for him. They were not instructed, however, and if
they could have been secured for any other candidate it would have been
a serious 'blow to the Parker interests.
. . ST. LOUIS. July 5.â All day long the anti-Parker men have tried to
offer a candidate who would unite a third of the delesates. so as to have
a rallying point when complimentary ballots shall have been cast for
"favorite sons.'* The Impossibility of uniting has been made manifest, and
the most zealous opponents of Parker concede his nomination not later
than the second ballot. . ..?,;"-
; For several days Bryan and the hand-tied Tammany delegates opposed
to Parker have beenworklng to -one endâ the, defeat of Parkerâ but they
have not moved In unison. The, Tammany delegates are listed as con
servatives and the Bryan forces as radicals, and, in consequence, their
work has been poor. Bryan was believed to, be with Hearst before the
contest opened,, but after Parker's strength was shown he suggested that
the Pennsylvania delegation should put former : Governor . Pattlson In
nomination. That falling to find, favor, . he has proposed . Judson Harmon
of Ohio. The Ohio delegation, though; loyal. to Harmon, looked upon the
plan with some suspicion, and this Idea fell, upon barren soil.
Tammany pursued its fight in attempting to foster the "favorite son"
campaign, and to-night was claiming 400 votes pledged against Parker.
This number is more than the one- third,' which would prevent a nomina
tion. But the Parker forces displayed no alarm : at Â¦ the , report that the
votes were uniting in opposition to the New York candidate. Bvyan assert
ed that Parker had made no substantial gains and that the opposition
was becoming better crystallized.
There are many prominent politicians participating in the convention
who were compelled to submit to the will of Bryan in the last two con
ventions who are taking; unaffected satisfaction in the fact that to
day they are able to dictate terms. David B. Hill of New York, Ben T.
Cable and John P. Hopkins of Illinois, former Senator Smith of New Jer
sey. Patrick Collins of Boston, Hoke Smith of Georgia arid Bourke Cock
ran of New York are' among these. On the other hand, . there are
many persons taking minor parts in the' proceedings for no other reason
than that they held too much power in 1896, and 1900. Many of those who
stood bv Bryan then are not with him now. Some have returned to the con
servatives and others are watching in silence the working out of the party
programme. Â»
It i* certain that no convention In years wlll.be more , largely attended
than the one which will open to-morrow. Seats are in great ; demand Â¦-. and
ST. LOUIS, July 5.â Radicalism has been killed in the national Democ
racy. Not only will control of the nominations be in the hands of those
Democrats who were in the minority in 1S96 and again In 1900, but the con
servatives will dictate' the platform and assume full charge of the party's
destinies.
In defiance of such handicaps as were created by the ambitious friends
of Gorman. Cleveland, Gray, OIney, McClellan and "favorite sons" who had
followings that divided the conservative columns, this element, which ad
vanced the claims of Democratic rehabilitation, struggled against the com
bined opposition of Bryan, representing the ruling Democratic force in the
last two Presidential contests, and the personal campaign conducted by Wil
liam R. Hearst.
Throughout the week the Parker forces received material accessions from
one candidate or another until the opposition is now confessedly- in .the mi
nority and seemingly too unorganized to present a fighting front. The band
wagon seats are in such demand that the nomination is confidently predicted
on the second ballot, and the surprise would be small if the first were deci
sive.
Thoturh the result of the contest for the Presidential nomination seems to
be as rood as settled, that spirit which moves factions' to war against each
other has not been so far removed that the convention will be lacking' in en
thusiasm or Interest. The changed position of those who are in power now
and those who controlled four and. eight years ago Is attracting wide atten
tion from delegates and persona who are assembled as spectators. .
. William J. Bryan Is the most picturesque figure.' Twice the candidate of
his party for the Presidency, but running on a platform forced upon the
nominating conventions by his compelling personality and_ which robbed him
of harmonious party fealty, he is in the position of fighting for recognition
against the element which has returned to power.

Relief trains were hurriedly sent to
the scene with a full corps of physi

One man. whose identity has not
been ascertained, stepped out of the
door of the smoking-car, intending to
leap from the train and take refuge
behind the abutments of the bridge.
He was lifted bodily by the wind, car
ried into an adjacent field and set
down as gently as a mother would
place her child In a chair.
Another man was pitched into a
small ditch in such a way that he was
protected from being crushed to death
by the car which rolled over him.
By this time there was a panic
aboard. Women screamed and men
grabbed their seats in fear. The third
lift of the wind heaved every part of
the train except the locomotive from
the tracks and toppled the cars over
into the ditch. The smoking-car rolled
over twice. Thomas Wiley, baggage
man, from Springfield, was killed and
Ernest Lied of Springfield was fatally
hurt.
A dozen others were bruised. by being
thrown against the sides of the cars
or cut by broken glass from the win

Looking out of- the' window they saw
a funnel-like cloud of inky blackn^sa
sweeping toward them with fearful
rapidity. Every window wa3 hastily
put down and the ventilators closed,
but almost before this could be done
a gust of wind gave the train a lurch.
Then a weird whistling sound was
heard, there was another wrench and
then the third, which struck the cars
with frightful force.

SYDNEY. C. B., July 5.â The strike
situation here is critical, but the city
officials express the opinion that the
militia now on duty will be able to
hold the disorderly element in check.
The Sydney Field Battery and a de
tachment from the Forty-ninth High
land Regiment are patrolling the Do
minion Iron and Steel Company's prop

A, new danger which "concerns this
section is the possible extension of the
strike of the collieries of the Dominion
Coal Company, a corporation which,
although controlled by . the , interests
which own the steel works, has no?
been brought into the difficulty up to
this time. 7
The military and .the strikers clashed
to-day when the crowd about the steel
works refused to let Director Frazer of
the works, a sales agent and, the super
intendent reach the gates. A squad of
soldiers was called, and it* was only by
vigorous use of the bayonet that a
passageway was made. It is apparent
that the strikers are masters of the sit
uation outside the works.

A handsome young woman ap
peared at noon yesterday In Superior
Judge Graham's courtroom and after
a very brief recital of neglect, deser
tion and cruelty was granted an inter
locutory decree of divorce. The case
was that of Gertrude M. Sargent
against - George \T. Sargent, an adver
tising solicitor. They were married
at Chicago July 22, 1901, and have
separated six times since because of
his inability to pay hotel bills and
household expenses. Â¦ In an amended
complaint which was not submitted to
the consideration of the court she re
cites the, details of their troubles,
which included his inability to pay
the landlord at the Manitou Hotel in
Salt Lake, their housekeeping, ex
penses In a cottage in the same city,
and various tradesmen and landlords
at Los Angeles and San Rafael. Sev

she left him and went to her mother
in Denver, but upon representations
from him as to his willingness and
ability to support her in the style she
had been used to, '.she returned to him
for periods ranging from one to four
months. 1 At San Rafael he Is said to
have shaken her and applied vile epi

repeated the. insult on the streets of

'. It develops that the defendant in a
suit for divorce filed June 21 by Nel

The committee on resolutions in its
report to the convention reaffirmed
adherence to the basic truths of the
Omaha platform of 1892 and of the
subsequent platforms of 1896 and
1900. The platform then demands
that all money be issued directly by
the Government, every dollar to be
full lefcal tender; demands postal sav
ings banks; upholds the right of labor
to organize, and favors the enactment
of legislation for the improvement of
the. condition of the wage-earners;
demands the initiative and referen
dum; favors prohibition of the alien
ownership of lands: demands the
withdrawal of special privileges to
trusts and monopolies, and declarea
that the Government should own and
control â¢ the % railroads, telegraph and
telephone systems and should provide
a : oarcels-post.
- The platform was adopted unani
mously. '"Â¦ . ;V^';
Former Congressman E. F. RIdgley
of Kansas attempted to secure the post

meeting of the national committee
was held, James H. Harris of Illinois

SPRINGFIELD, 111.. July 5.â Thomas
E. Watson of Georgia, for President,
and Thomas T. Tibbies, of Nebraska,
for Vice President, were nominated by
the Populist convention to-day. The
names of William V. Allen of Nebraska
and SamUel W. Williams of Indiana
were placed before the convention for
President, but before' the list of State3
had been completed in the roll call they
were withdrawn and Watson was nomi
nated by acclamation.
Former Senator Allen made good his
word that he would not enter into any
scramble for the nomination, and while
the nominations were being made he
twice instructed the chairman of the
Nebraska delegation to say his name
must not go before the convention. In
the face of this, however, he received
more than forty votes.
Whether -Watson will accept the nomi
nation or not no one in the convention
seemed to know, and all efforts to ob
tain some definite Information from
Watson's friends failed. Watson was
quoted as having said that if the Dem
ocrats at St. Louis nominated Hearst
he would support him for President.
Williams of Indiana received only a
few votes and soon, withdrew, moving
to make Watson's nomination unani
mous.
There were five nominations for Vice
President â Thomas H. Tibbies of Ne
braska. Theodore B. Hinder of Penn
sylvania, L. H. Weller of Iowa, George
P. Washburn of Massachusetts and
Samuel W. Williams of Indiana.' The
latter two declined and Tibbies received
practically all the votes on the first
ballot.

The anxiety of many among the hun

of the eurvlvors at Stornoway was re
ceived from Copenhagen. It has been
known since yesterday that 128 survi
vors of the disaster have been landed
While the stories of the purvivors
naturally differ In some details, In the
main they agree that In the supreme
moment there were exhibitions of mar
velous heroism and additional stories
of their experiences to-day only add
In this particular to what has already
beon told.
Wh<-n the s-urviVors were dragged on
the trav.lcr the fishermen were obliged
to forcibly prevent them from eating
and drinking too much.-Jrtany of those
rescued have severe wounds sustained
In jumping on the deck of the sinking
ship. Their legs and arms are swollen
from exposure and from the salt water.
On their arrival at Aberdeen the sur
vivors were taken to the Sailors' Home.
The third mate states that three oth
er boats started with that rescued by
the Largo Bay. One'jf these contained
thirty-two persons, including several
women and children. Another boat had
fifteen men, with the second mate in
charge. The third boat had ten men on
board. Ths survivors parted company
â¢with the thr;x; boats on the 3d. For
these boats the Rritish gunboat Leda.

Ff-ls are diligently searching. The bodies
of three children rescued from the
Norgp. only to die on shore, were buried
to-day at Stornaway amid pathetic
scenes.
They drifted at the mercy of the At
lantic for six days. When their water
and food was gone and when the occu
pants were almost too exhausted to
hope, the boat hove in sight. This was
on July 4, .when the boat was about
thirty miles off St. Kilda. Those res
t ued had eked out an existence on two
biscuits per day. When they started
from the ill-fated ship there was only
one small cask of fresh water intha
boat. They weathered a gale and con
tinued as best they might, striving to
reach the coast of Scotland against the
heavy seas. From stretches of Iifebelt3
they constructed a crude sail. The men

the party platform will be one of the
most interesting of the contests. It is

take up the platform discussion and
advance .ideas as widely diverging as
those presented in the- dozens of the

vention.
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
Tarpey, unruffled by the anger of the
Lett Ahgelenos, makes the claim that
he has formed a combination that ab
solutely precludes the nomination of
Alton B. Parker. The great political
manipulators that are handling Par
kefs fight smile at the claim, but Tar
pey openly boasts that 400 delegates
will cast their ballots first and last
against the New York jurist. At a
meeting of the California, delegation
this afternoon Tarpey announced these
figures. He said that in insuring the
Joseph Simons of Los Angeles, who
was clothed with the empty honor of
vice chairman, added to the disturb
ance by throwing up his present olio.
This makes the south solid and sore.
The vice chairman does not carry the
dignity of a committeeman. If the
south could not be represented on
committee, Simons refused to enjoy
posing as one of the forty or fifty fig
urehead vice chairmen. His colleague
commended hia course. His successor
will be named to-morrow.
PUTS UP A BOLD FRONT.
"But he was wrong. Tarpey refused
to break the slate. He had placed the
honors in the north and there they
must remain. Argument and protest
were wasted. As a result the Los An
geles delegatesâ in fact, all of those
who had journeyed here from south of
Tetrachapi â are roaring mad. Joined
with McGee and Mooser. the McNab
men of the delegation, they constitute a
formidable opposition to Tarpey's
forces and Hearst would be out several
votes to-night if .these delegates could
cast aside their conscience and bolt in
structions. As it Is they may yet make
trouble for Tarpey.
Isidore Dockweiler of Los Angeles
arrived here In time to see the turning
down 6t' McCarthy. He is beside him
self with Joy. The Los Angelenos are
getting a sample of the Tarpeyâ and,
incidentally, the Hearstâ method, he
says, and he trusts they will not for
get. McCaffery is a big man with the
labor people of his section of the State,
Dockweiler points out, and he is con
fident the ignoring of McCaffery's ap
peal will put a different result on the
next contest In which Hearst and Tar
pey are principals.
Late to-night it was announced that
McCarthy could go on the committee
to notify the nominee for Vice Presi
dent, if he desired. He declined this
position with a sarcastic smile and said
he was looking for an opportunity to
do something for his party, not for an
opportunity to spend his money to sat
isfy his vanity.
TARPEY IS UNYIELDING.
It was McCaffery that hammered the
San Diego delegation into line for In
structions for Hearst, when defeat was
it Tarpey's throat. If the right of the
south to representation on committee
were not recognized, McCarthy was
positive that McCaffery's appeal would
be considered.
J. Harvey McCarthy. Martin C.
Marsh and Martin F. Betkouskl, dele
gates from Los Angeles, arrived her*
this morning. Out bf courtesy to them.
Tarpey had postponed the * meeting
called to confirm appointments of com
mltteemen. But when the Los An
gelenos arrived they refused to "take
programme." McCarthy, wanted to go
on a committee. He told Tarpey he
was ambitious to wrest some honor
from his position and that as the south
was unrepresented on the committees
his request should be granted. To
make his position stronger, he present
ed a personal appeal from Tom Mc-
Caffery, a Southern Pacific official of
Los Angeles, asking that his request
be granted.

defeat of Parker the friends of Hearst
had overcome the greatest obstacle in
the road to victory. He urged that the
delegates redouble their effort* on be
half of their candidate, as he believed
Hearst's chances were more favorable
than those of any man whose candi
dacy has won the stamp of promi
nence.
The fact that Tarpey thus Informed
the California delegation is no in
dication that he voiced unbiased
opinion. He is too old a politi
cian to betray his view. On ths
night before his Waterloo In the fight
for the chairmanship of the Santa Cruz
convention he smilingly announced
that the fight was won when It was a
foregone conclusion that he was beaten.
He knew he was beaten, too, but no In

will place Hearst out of the running.
Tarpey, after he concluded his
analysis of the Presidential situation,
announced his selections for commlt
teemen, as heretofore published.
MOOSER CRITICIZES McCABE.
An adjournment was about to ba
taken when Delegate Louis H. Mooser
complained that McCabe. secretary of
the delegation, had caused unnecessary
statements to be published about him.
McCabe said he regretted he had been
the cause of friction In the delegation
and as the row over the turning dow?.
of McCarthy eclipsed all other dissen
sions the affair was allowed to drop.
McCabe still retains his smile "and
Mooser his frown, but it is the general
opinion that the incident is closed.
The absence of former Governor
Budd. who Is an admit harmonlzer. is
an element of weakness in the flgrht
being made by the California delega
tion for Hearst. His magnetic person
ality and knowledge of the art of bring
ing: men into line make him a valuable
campaigner and his presence at the
head of the Callfornians would enthuse
them to greater efforts. Many Inquiries
are made about Budd by the Eastern
politicians, who have heard of hia
prowess as an organizer and cam
paigner. He is known as California's
biggest Democrat and would be a cen
tral figure had he made the trip to St.
Louis.
Among the San Franciscans who
celled at the California headquarters
tc-day were Sidney Schwartz, J. B.
Brooks, A. Ruef, Alfred Roncovieri,
Walter Gallagher and R. Porter Ashe.
Ruef met many Eastern politicians and
absorbed all he cauld fina on the subtle
game of caucus and ballot.
After a meeting of the Nevada dele
gation to-day Senator Newlands said:
"We are not instructed for Hearst, as
has been asserted. A resolution favor
ins Hearst was adopted by our conven
tion, but we were In no way bound tr>
stand by Mr. Hearst throughout the
fight. If it develops that It la to our
best interests to vote for some other
candidate we are at liberty to do so."
This statement is specially significant
in view of the fact that several delega
tions are considering the advisability
of abandoning the Hearst band wagon.

DR. KILMER'S SWAMP-ROOT.
A LETTER TO OUR READERS
B3 Cottage St. Melrose. Mass.
Dear Sir: Jan. Jlth. 1904.
"Ever Plnce I was in the Army, I had
more or less kidney trouble, and within
the past year it became so severe and
complicated that I suffered everything
and was much alarmed â my strength
and power were fast leaving me. I saw
an advertisement of Swamp-Root and
wrote asking for advice. I began the
use of the medicine and noted a decided
improvement after taking Swamp-Root
only a short time.
"I continued its use and am thankful
to say that I am entirely cured and
strong. In order to be very sure about
this, I had a doctor examine some of my
water to-day and he pronounced it all
right and in splendid condition. â¢
"I know that your Swamp-Root is
purely vegetable and does not contain
any harmful drugs. Thanking you for
my complete recovers* and recommending
Swamp-Root to all sufferers I am."
Very truly yours,
I. C. RICHARDSON.
You may have a sample bottle of this
wonderful remedy. Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, sent absolutely free by mail, also
a book telling all about Swamp-Root. If
you are already convinced that Swamp-
Root is what'ySu need, you can purchase
the regular fifty-cent and one-dollar size
bottles at the drug stores everywhere.
Don't make any mistake, but remember
the name, Swamp-Root, Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, and the address, Bingnam-

ST. LOUIS. July 6.â So much atten
tion hs been given to the Presidential
nomination that no conclusion ' has
been reached regarding the Vice Pres
idency. ''Several names have been
mentioned and one or two active can
didates are in the field. The friends
of former Senator Turner of Wash

gations from the inter-mountain coun

those most Interested in Parker's
nomination.
Thus far no sign has been given by
the leaders that a candidate will be
sought on the Pacific Coast. ' In fact,
some one who will add strength to the
ticket in Illinois and Indiana is want

connection with the second place, but
no effort has been made to obtain con

SECOND PLACE IN DOUBT.
ST. LOUIS. July 5. â It was gossiped
about the corridors to-night that the
Parker faction had sent a request to
Senator Gorman to preside over the
convention. He had not been rearched,
however, having left his home for
Washington. THe Maryland delega
tion had no word from him and his
son, who is here, said that he had been
unable to reach him. So the matter
is in abeyance.
GORMAN MAY PRESIDE.

meeting of the Tennessee delegation,
which organized and elected officers. K.
E. Mount was chosen national eommit
teeman. It was decided to hold the
Catmaek boom for Vice President in
abeyance until the Presidential nomina
tion shall have been disposed of.
The Virginia delegation, which ar
rived to-day, saw in an evening paper
of yesterday that it was for Senator
Gorman for President. The delegates
all signed the following declaration,
written by Senator Daniel:
"The chairman is hereby instructed to
cast the vote of the delegation for Al
ton B. Parker as long as his name Is
before the convention."
When the delegation met later it
formally resolved In the same sense.
Instructed for Parker, the Texas del
egation at its meeting to-day had only
to organise. The meeting was entirely
harmonious, and although no formal
resolutions were adopted, the unanim
ous sentiment, of ._ the delegation ap
peared to favor a conservative plat
form. R. M. Johnston was elected na
tional eommitteeman, Senator Bailey
member of the resolutions committee
and T. W. Gregory member of the cre
dentials committee. The delegation did
pot commit itself on the subject of the
Vice Presidency. Representative T. H.
Ball was selected to second the nom
ination of Judge Parker and C. .11.
Smith to second the nomination of the
Vice Presidential candidate.
Inquiry among the North, Carolina
delegation shows that Parker senti
ment is predominant, and as this del
egation is subject to the unit rule Par
ker Is assured its vote. %
DELAWARE STANDS BY GRAY.
At an informal conference of the Del
aware delegation early to-day it was
decided that the delegation should
stand by Judge Gray. While the de
cision was not final, it was said that
as yet' the delegation" saw no reason. to
abandon its "favorite son."

to accept the situation, if fairly liberal

his fellow delegates thus interpret it.
At the meeting of the Nebraska del

BRYAN MAY SURRENDER.
Andrew M. Lawrence, who is one of
the active managers of the Hearst can
didacy, was nominated for chairman of
the delegation against John P. Hop
kins, who is personally opposed to
Hearst. Lawrence received eight votes,
including that of Hopkins, while the
latter received forty-six votes.
The Michigan delegation is evenly
divided between -Parker and Hearst,
but with all the members present it
is claimed that Parker will have a ma
jority of two. The Parker forces are
under the leadership of D. J. Campau.
The Hearst men offered to compromise
the situation by voting for Campau for
president, but he declined. ' As the
unit rule prevails in the delegation,
Campau hopes to swing the entire vote
for Parker. v<Y:-i;
LAWRENCE TURNED DOWN.
Before the Illinois delegates met for
their caucus this afternoon it was ru
mored that they were about to bolt
their Hearst instructions and come out
for Parker on the first ballot. There
was no foundation for the rumor and
Chairman Fred J. Kern declared in his
address that the delegates of Illinois
would be faithful to all the obligations
imposed upon them by the State Con
vention.
In the expression of preference the
final vote stood: Parker, 25; OJney, 2;
McClellan, 7; Hearst. 4; Harmon. 7,
and Folk, 1, Tom Johnson voting for
the last named candidate.
Much feeling was manifested in the
delegation at the action of the Parker
men in withdrawing the name of Jud
son Harmon. It was claimed that
earlier in the day forty out of forty
six of the delegates had been fledged
to vote for Harmon for the Presidency
and Hearst and McClellan men and all
the factions opposed to Parker were
urged to concentrate on Ohio's favor
ite son.
John R. McLean was elected national
eommitteeman, Tom Johnson alone op
posing the motion that the election be
made unanimous. John A. McMahon
was elected over Tom Johnson as mem
ber of the resolutions committee.
ST. LOUIS, July 5.â At a caucus last
ing several hours the Ohio delegation
to-night adopted a resolution declaring
that the delegates should vote their
voluntary preference for candidates
for President. A majority express
themselves for Judge Parker and since
Ohio Is under the unit rule this action
is believed to presage the action of the
delegation in the convention. It was
agreed, however, that the action of to
night should not be binding. It is un
derstood that Judson Harmon's name
was withdrawn at his request, tele
graphed to a close friend in the dele
gation.
ST. LOUIS. July 5. â The Philippine
delegates got together soon after the
national committee meeting to-day
and drew up a protest to the conven
tion. The delegates feel that the fail
ure of the Philippine Democratic plat
form, adopted on April 30, 1904, to de
clare for the independence of- the
islands is largely responsible for their
treatment. This platform asks for a
Territorial form of government and

ST. LOUIS. July 5.â Tammany fur
nished one of the few sensational in
cidents of the day by swiftly back
tracking on a semi-official announce
ment that it had dropped its opposition
to Parker. During the forenoon the
organization allowed it to become
known through some of its most prom
inent representatives that it had de
cided to join the Parker forces. After
a period of silence and apparent po
litical idleness, late this afternoon it
renewed its warfare against his can
didacy and Senator Dowling, Charles
A. Towne, Bird S. Coler and Bourke
Cockran started to poll the delegates
and ask for votes against Parker. Sen
ator Dowlingr, on behalf of Charles F.
Murphy, made this statement:
"Judge Parker cannot be nominated.
We have 400 votes, more than one-third
of the convention, pledged against him.
He cannot be nominated. Only this aft
ernoon we won three new States to our
cause."
It was said by other Tammany men
that the real object of the fight was
McClelian, but Senator Dowllng pro
tested that Tammany was simply
against Parker. Closing his interview,
he said significantly:
"You will see a very hard fight on
the platform." K'tP
Senator Hill, Edward Murphy Jr. and
William F. Sheehan were confident at
the Parker headquarters. Senator Hill
said: "Judge Parker may not be nom
inated on the first ballot, as delegations
like to pay tribute to 'favorite sons,'
but he will be on the second."
Mr. Sheehan said: "Judge Parker will
be the nominee. Nothing can stop it
now."
Ex-Senator Murphy said: "My opin
ion of the situation has not changed
and my attitude has not. No candidate
has been nominated â not even Parker.
Before saying anything further I pro
pose to await the result of the conven
tion. The action of that body will set
tle everything and Tammany will be
as loyal to the acts of this convention
as it has been to the instructions of
the New York State Convention."
Asked whether he stood for his lieu
tenant's statements that there, were
votes enough to defeat Parker, he said:
"I cannot say; others are taking care
of the campaign."

Anti-Parker Campaign.
TAMMANY'S FLIPFLOP.
The Nevada delegation met to-day
and elected George Russell chairman
of the delegation. Senator Francis G.
Newlands was selected for the com
mittee on resolutions. P. C. Webber
for credentials, W. E: Sharon for rules
and permanent organization. J. H.
Dennis was elected a member of the
National Committee.
The caucus' of the delegation from
Minnesota developed a warm contest
between the Hearst and anti-Hearst
forces, and after a three hours' wrangle
the former faction put through its
slate. The fight centered on the selec
tion of national commiteemanr and for
a time the ballot stood at a tie. Dele
gate Nye of Morehead, who. had been
considered an anti-Hearst man, finally
threw his vote to Hudson of Duluth.
ele'eting him over O'Connor of St. Paul,
the opposition candidate. The minority
then attempted a rally with John Llnd
as a candidate for a place" on the reso
lutions committee, but Nye again voted
with the Hearst delegates and the re
mainder of the slate was put through
without opposition.
The New Mexico delegation held its
caucus this afternoon and re-elected
H. R. Ferguson a*- member of the Na
tional Committee. The. delegation is
instructed, for Hearst, but four of the
delegation declared to-night they were
anxious . to vote for Parker, and would
do, so at the _ earliest opportunity
presented itself to break away from
Hearst.
By a vote of 24 to 2 the Kentucky
delegation decided to-night to support
the. candidacy of Judge Parker.
The Alabama delegation resolved to
support Parker. ..
vote for the nomination of Edward C.
Wall until he or some other candidate
receives the nomination.
With a divided delegation, the Ore
gon delegates met to-day, organized
and elected officers, but did not come
to an understanding regarding the
Presidential nomination. Four of the
delegates are in favor of Parker, two
are for Hearst and two have hitherto
been classed as anti-Parker. \V. F.
Butcher was elected member of the
resolutions committee, C. D. Red
fields a member of the credentials
committee and the election of a na
tional eommitteeman to succeed M. A.
Miller was postponed until a candidate
for President shall have been nomi
nated, in order that Oregon's member
of the National Committee may be in
harmony with the nominee.
The Montana delegation organized
to-day unrt elected Senator William A.
Clark chairman. The unit rule was
adopted, but the consideration of can
didates was deferred until to-morrow.
The following were elected to represent
the State on committees: Governor
Joseph K. Toole. permanent organiza
tion: W. G. Conrad, credentials, Jo
soph Smith, rules and order cf Lusi
ness: Martin Maginnls, resolutions: H.
A. Oallway, to- notify the nominee for
President. C. \V. Hoffman was elected
national eommitteeman. Senator Gib

The anti-Parker men held a meeting
in the room of Senator Pettlgrew to
night and discussed means to hold
enough votes to prevent the nomina
tion of Parker. Besides Pettigrew,
there were present Towne. from the
Tammany delegation; Hardy, from
Delaware, and Tarpey of California. A
committee was appointed to take
charge of the anti-Parker movement,
with a view of uniting upon a pro
gramme of action. It was claimed by
those present that more than .400 dele
gates were represented in the meeting
who would not vote for Parker and
that they would be able to hold out
until the New Yorker was defeated.
The discussion In the conference and
elsewhere developed a determined dis
position to at least make a test of
strength on the first ballot before sur
rendering. The anti-Parkers claim
that even since the defection of Penn
sylvania they will be able to control
100 votes more than the necessary one
third to prevent Parker's nomination,
but many of them concede the impos
sibility of maintaining their full
strength through many successive bal
lots unless early inroads can be made
upon the Parker strength. This dan
ger is made evident by conditions in
the anti-Parker . delegations. It is
stated, for instance, that fully one-half
the Kansas and Colorado votes will go
to Parker on the first ballot and Mary
land and West Virginia, which consti
tute the ba3e of Gorman's strength,
are ready to go over to the New York
candidate as soon as they can be re
leased from their pledge to Gorman.
The West Virginia delegation is quite
at sea because Gorman has not yet in
dicated his attitude. Senator Davis
is holding them in line for the Mary
land man if they are needed, but once
released all but two-. of the delegates
will go to Parker.
The claim was made to-day that Ala
bama will lead off in the vote for
Farker and the hope is expressed that
the example will prove strongly en
couraging to other' delegations whose
inclinations run friendly to the New
Yorker. -
"After a consultation among the
members representing the various can
didates and delegates opposed to the
nomination of Judge Parker, it was
formally agreed among them that the
nomination of Judge Parker is im
possible. The opposition represents
easily much more than the one-third
of the votes of the convention neces
sary to prevent a nomination, all of
whom agree not to support Judge
Parker's candidacy under any circum
stances."
ST. LOUIS. "July 5.â A number of the
representatives of the opposition to
Judge Parker met for conference to
day in .Hearst's headquarters at the
Jefferson and after adjournment gave
out the following statement:

to the Democratic National Convention
were tendered a reception at their State
building at the World's Fair to-day.
In the Sixteenth District, which is
the home of Frank P. Quinn, who acted
as chairman of the convention, R. M.
Barnes, who presented the case of the
contestants, declared that the names
of the delegates as announced by Sec
retary Brennan constituted a clear case
of forgery, and asserted that the state
ments of the contestees were not en
titled to weight, because any man who
would fo.rge a signature would commit
perjury to back it up.
"Whom do you mean?" asked Quinn.
"I mean the man who altered the
names on the report of that district
caucus," replied Barnes. "I do not
know who did it. but whoever he was
he. can put the shoe on and wear it."
Quinn took the floor in his own de
fepse and declared that the statement
which had been made by the contest
ants, that the list of delegates from
the Sixteenth District had been read
to the convention, were absolutely false.
The scenes in tjiese contests were
practically repeated^ all of the oth
ers, and both sides were determined to
carry the fight to the court of last re
sort.
been selected by a regular and a bolt
ing caucus as well, and that later his
name was removed and that of Dun
can C. Best substituted. Best insisted
upon the regularity of the proceedings.
"It is perfectly evident that Senator
Hill and his following do not intend to
take a definite stand on the money
question. They are going to take a
half-way course, so as not thoroughly
to displease Mr. Bryan and his small
following."
The Tammany people are so confident
that things are going to run smoothly
that they have practically decided to
order their special train to leave on
Friday afternoon, expecting that the
convention will be over at that time.
The committee then adjourned, sub
ject to the call of the chairman. Af
ter adjournment Delegate Bird S. Coler
said:
'Â¦; ST. LOUIS, July 5.â The meeting of
the New York State delegation to-day
was marked by a degree of harmony
such as has not prevailed In this dele
gation at several Presidential conven
tions. It was rumored prior to thÂ»
meeting that Tammany had practical
ly decided to retire gracefully from Its
heretofore emphatic opposition to
Judge Parker and this was seemingly
confirmed by what took place at the
delegation meeting. '
In the first place, there was no ob
jection to the selection of David B.
Hill as a member of the committee on
resolutions, and this harmonious ac
tion was repeated when State Chair
man Thomas F. Grady of Tammany
Hall was selected as the member of
the committee on rules and order of
business. Former United States Sena
tor Edward Murphy Jr. of Troy was
made chairman of the delegation and
Norman E. Mack of Buffalo was re
elected as national committeexnan.
James W. Ridgeway of Brooklyn, a
McCaren adherent, was unanimously
selected to represent the State on the
committee on credentials. Â»
COCKRAN'S FINANCIAL PLANK.
The only spice injected into the
meeting was the offering of a resolu
tion by Bourke Cockran, providing
that "in the opinion of this delegation
a plain statement should be included
in the platform that the decision of
the people on the money issue, as twice
exemplified in two elections, should be
the final settlement of the financial
question and of vital importance in the
next general election."
Cockran, in speaking of his resolu
tion and urging its adoption, said that
the financial scheme as presented in
the two last political platforms had
been discarded by the people and that
this decision should be the basis of fhe
financial plank in the new platform.
George Raines of Rochester opposed
Cockran's motion. He arguÂ«d that
there was no reason for an extremely
radical course on the plank and be
lieved that the question could be safely
left In the hands of Senator Hill. He
moved that It be referred to- Senator
Hill, with power. This was adopted
by a vote of 50 to 26.
Senator Grady suggested that, should
a resolution be introduced into the
convention proposing an abrogation of
the two-thirds rule and the adoption
of- a majority rule. New York should
oppose it. Senator Hill remarked that
he thought that the- matter could be
intelligently acted upon by Senator
Grady in the committee on rules. Â¦ and
it was unanimously referred to him.

and submitted it to the committee This
brought Brennan to his feet with an
impassioned denial, closing- with the
declaration; "Everybody knows that I
would not do such a thing." This called
forth Jeers from the contestants and
Brennan took his seat in silence.'
BARNES ASSAILS QVISS.
Several times last night the retorts
between the contesting: factions were of
bo heated a nature that Chairman Stone
of the Bub-committee was compelled to
rer>eatedly call for order, and once sug
prsted that the gentlemen from Illinois
woulU find the outride of the hotel a
proper place to conduct their argu
ments, if "their minds were made up
for a bullfight."
The fight in the' Illinois delegation in
volved thirteen districts and two of
the delegates at large, and was one of
the most bitter 'ever contested before
any convention. The hearing yesterday
and last night before the sub-commit
tee of the National Committee was only
preliminary for both sides. The bitter
v.ork will come later before the com
mittee on credentials, and it is almost
certain at this time that if there is any
chance to Bet the contest to the floor of
the convention it will go here and be
waged with energy.
The contests In the other States were
reported by the various sub-committees
as previously announced, and their
action was approved by the National
Committee, which then, adjourned.
DISPLAYS OF RANCOR.
â¢'The action of the committee is far
reaching." he said, "and means that
the work of a few men is to stand be
fore the wishes of the majority of the
delegates. I hope the credentials com
mittee will 6ee the question In a differ
ent light."
"It is all over." said John P. Hop
kins. "We won, as I knew we would.
There was, in fact, nothing else for the
committee to do. What steps may be
taken later will have no effect. Our
delegates will remain Just where the
Btate convention seated them."
The victors' of the Hopkins faction
Â¦w as also a defeat for W. J. Bryan, who
has made the fight almost a personal
one. He yesterday attended the hear
ing in the greater part of the contests
and showed his anxiety in every way
to win the seats for Harrison and
Hearst.
The sub-committee of the national
committee, which yesterday and last
night heard the evidence in the four
teen districts of Illinois, to-day re
ported to the national committee that
it was the unanimous opinion of the
members of the cub-committee that
the Hopkins delegates be allowed to
retain their seats. The report was
concurred in and the Hopkins men
will hold their seats unless ousted by
the action of the committee on creden
tials.
The decision of the sub-committee
Â¦" us based on the ground that the State
<Â¦Â« >rivention was supreme, that fights
in the district caucuses are not proper
matter for adjudication by the national
committee and that it is not the busi
aesu of the national committee to go
behind the records of the convention,
fis submitted. These records show that
the Hopkins men are regularly ac
Â« r^dited delegates and because of this
fart the sub-committee gave its ver
dict for them. The fight. 1 in the opin
ion cf the committee, should have been
made in the State.
HEARST MEN DISHEARTENED:
The Harrison and Hearst men were
greatly disheartened by their defeat
and announced their intention of
earning the fight before the committee
on credentials and, if beaten there, be
fore the convention itself. This threat
did not alarm the Hopkins faction,
which said that the argument that won
bffore the national committee would
hold good before the committee on cre
dentials and before the convention.

9T. PETERSBURG, July 5.â In con
firming the appointment of Prince John
Obolensky as Governor General of Fin
land, the Emperor 6ent an autograph
letter to the Prince relative to thÂ« situ
ation there. This letter, which is in the
nature of an imperial rescript, was pub
liEhed to-day. The Emperor therein ex
presses his conviction that it will be
possible to maintain the local autonomy
and the privilege of legislating for her
self enjoyed by Finland since thÂ© un
ion with Russia.
The appointment of Princ* Obolenaky
does not carry with it the command of
the army. It is believed on good au
thority that this omission is prelim
inary to the incorporation of the dis
trict of Finland into the St. Petersburg
district, the commander In chief of
which is Grand Duke Vladimir, the un
cle of the Emperor.
Prince Obolensky is an ablÂ« admln
iBtrator. He displayed great energy aa
Governor of Kharkoff and effectively
suppressed the labor troubles in that
government. Several attempts were
made on his life while he was Governor
of Kharkoff. He began his career in
the navy and retired with the rank of
lieutenant, afterward entering the civil
service.
The Emperor rewarded Obolensky's
services at Kharkoff by conferring upon
him the rank of lieutenant general of
marines in 1903. The appointment of
Prince Obolensky and the imperial re
script are dated June 30, but they were
rigorously kept secret.

Tobin and taken to the Central sta
tion, where he was found to be but
little the worse for his ducking, l^n
his pocket was found a note, reading
as follows:
"Molly â You are the cause of my
downfall. Forgive me and remember
the children. Don't forget llasie. Re

TOKIO, Monday, July 4.â General
Kuroki reports that two battalions of
Russians attacked the Japanese out
posts at Motien Pass at dawn on July
4, under cover of a dense fog. The
Russians were repulsed, but they re
turned and charged three times before
they were finally driven off. The Jap
anese pursued them for three miles to
the westward of Motien Pass. The
Russians left thirty dead and fifty
wounded on the field. The Japanese
lost fifteen killed and thirty wounded.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 5.â Thirteen
companies of Russian troops sent out
by Lieutenant General Count Keller in
a reconnaissance in force to ascertain
the strength of the Japanese column's
advance force moving on Liaoyang
came into collision with the Japanese
between Motien and Fenshui passes
yesterday. Sharp fighting resulted and
the Russians retired before overwhelm
ing numbers, after ascertaining the ex
act strength of the Japanese forces.
The Russian losses are officially stated
to have been 200.
In case the Information obtained by
General Keller leads General Kuropat
kin to consider that Liaoyang is se
riously threatened, it is probable that
some of the troops will return north
from Tatchekiao. Then the Japanese
are likely to repeat their attempt to
capture Newchwang.
REPORT OF SAKHAROFF.
The general staff has received the
following dispatch from Lieutenant
General Sakharoff, the chief of staff of
General Kuropatkin, dated July 4:
"On July 3 the advance guard of fhe
Russian force operating east of Liao
yang occupied a position at Yangtse
Pass. Toward evening the same day
our scouts ascertained that a detach
ment of the enemy's advance guard.
1500 strong, had occupied the villages
of Ekhavuan and Tchakumenza, on our
front, the main force having remained
in Fenshui and Motien passes. At this
moment we discovered the movement
of a Japanese detachment, consisting
of a battalion of infantry, to turn our
left flank positions In the Yangtse
Pass. In order to check this movement
a force, consisting of five companies of
infantry, two detachments of mounted
Hussars and half a company of Cos
sacks, was sent forward in the direc
tion of this threatened point."
"In order to learn the strength of the
enemy's position In front of Yangtse
Pass, the commander of the detach
ment ordered out a reconnoitering par
ty of ten companies, which was sent in
the direction of Ekhavuan, under the
command of Colonel Letschitsky. With
a view of making a demonstration in
suring the return of Letschitsky's de
tachment, three companies under Lieu
tenant Colonel Gai-\itsky marched to
Mahoumizza, about a mile and a half
south of Ekhavuan, the crossing of the
roads leading to Sinkhi and the Lok
River passes. Firing began about 1:30
p. m. on July 4.
COMPANY ANNIHILATED.
"Garnltsky's column reached the
cross roads and dislodged a company
of the enemy's advance guard, which
was almost annihilated. Simultane
ously Letschitsky's column dislodged
the enemy's advance posts without fir
ing a shot and approached the foot of
the heights, which were surmounted by
a temple. The temple is less than a
mile east of Ekhavuan, where, al
though exposed to a heavy frontal and
flank flre, our troops dashed forward
and dislodged the Japanese from their
entrenchments and occupied the pass.
As the enemy was preparing to deliver
a frontal and flank attack, our column
then retired, as previously Instructed.
Three companies of Garnltsky's force
occupied the position which they had
been ordered to secure.
"When Letschitsky's force began to
withdraw the enemy opened a heavy
flre from the heights. In- spite of this
the column retired in . perfect order.
Brave I^etschittky remained continu
ally on the firing line and directed the
column with remarkable ability and
coolness. He was the last to retire,
with his chief of- staff and adjutant.
Garnitsky's column behaved with equal
brilliancy and coolness, carrying out
its task with no sign of agitation.
"Our casualties were: Letschitsky,
bruised and wounded; Colonel Poppa
low, Lieutenant Colonel Trakhemovsky,
Captain Soloieff, Lieutenants Markoff,
Latklne, Bobroskovsky and Kozine,
Second Captain Palic and several offi
cers wounded and 200 Boldiers killed or
wounded.
"I observed the fighting with my staff
from the Tkhacoun tower, and so can
personally testify to the conduct of the
troops,
PRAISES THE SURGEONS.
"I cannot pass in silence the remark
able devotion of the surgeons and the
chaplain, who attended the wounded
under a hot flre, and even helped to
carry them off the field. All of the
wounded were removed.
"On the morning of July 3 our rein
forcements occupied Liandiansian. One
soldier was killed during the fighting.
"The same afternoon a detachment of
the enemy, consisting of two bat
talions and six 'squadrons, with
six machine guns, advanced and
attacked our outposts lying south
of the valley of. the river" Kho,
who retreated under the vigorous
flre of the enemy. The officer command
ing our advance cavalry advanced at
2:S0 p. m. with a detachment, and at
the same time the enemy placed ma
chine guns on the heights northwest of
Dounachekhedja, and their infantry oc
cupied the outskirts of the forest near
the village. Our horse battery retreated
on the position at Daoasischja, near the
railroad, being covered by mounted
dragoons and. frontier guards.
"Under the fire of our artillery and
rifles the enemy quickly evacuated their
position and retreated toward Senu
chen. Our cavalry pursued them until
fHE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; WEDNE5DAY, JULY 6, 1904.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 5. â The fact that Lieutenant
General Sakharoff, chief of staff of General Kuropatkin,
witnessed the fighting near Motien Pass, is taken here, to
indicate that he is in command of the forces east of Liaoyang 1 ,
which include the army corps under Lieutenant General Count
Keller. The desperate character of the fighting is shown .by
the repeated bayonet charges, the Russians routing the Jap
anese from their trenches. The fighting around Senuchen shows
that the Japanese are* determinedvto hold the ; ground to the
south, as well as Dalin Pass, until a favorable opportunity pre
sents itself for , an advance upon Yinkow (the port of
Newchwang).

when the fleet engaged the Japanese
squadron outside Port Arthur harbor,
it consisted of eleven of the larger
ships.
On July 3 the Russian and Japanese
armies outside of Port Arthur, accord
ing to report, were separated by only a
mile, the Japanese advancing steadily
from hill to hill, on all of which they
are placing big guns. It is said they
landed 150 of these guns at Dalny.

The wounded Japanese are recover

Koreans coming to the Russian fron
tier say there are 6000 Japanese at
Seoul, but by marching and counter
marching in and out of the town they
are attempting to create the impression
that there are 20,000 men there. The
Japanese, the Koreans add, are circu
lating stories of great victories, that
I'ort Arthur has fallen and that the
Russian fleet has been destroyed.
The Emperor of Korea, It is further
asserted, is held under guard and the
heir-apparent has been taken to Japan.
The Koreans say they hate their op
pressors, and add that they will rise on
the appearance of the Russians.

"The enemy's principal forces are at

connoissance on July 3 discovered that
the enemy was fortifying in Tai Pass."

LOS ANGELES, July 5.â A well
dressed handsome young Mexican wo
man entered the historic plaza church
this morning during early mass and
advancing to the altar attacked one of
the priests viciously, at the same time
screaming at the top of her voice. The
attack almost caused a panic among
the worshipers, but when it was seen
that the woman was violently insane
several male members of the congrega
tion assisted the priests in controlling
her.
The police ambulance was summoned
and she was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where she became so violent
that she had to be tied. Until to-nigfU
it was not known who she was. but
It was finally learned that she is Miss
Jennie Contreras. She left her home
in Mexico several months ago. having
been induced to come here by a Max
ican family, who held out to her prom
ises of steady employment. Being.un
familiar with the customs of the coun
try she could nnt secure a position and
finally began to want for food. " â¢
. For two days she had had nothing to
cat and as a result of brooding over
her troubles her reason became de
throned. Wealthy Mexican families
here have taken charge of her and she
will be sent back to her relatives in
Mexico. The doctors say she i3 hope

SAN BERNARDINO, .ruly 5.â There
is consternation in police circles here
over the discovery by the County Jail
physician that Jacob Wold, an old man
serving thirty days for habitual drunk
enness, was suffering with a fractured
skull. Wold came here as a strike
breaker, being a machinist, hired by
the Santa Fe Company in Chicago.
When the company, paid off its men
on the 15th of last month. Wold went
on a spree and was arrested. He seem
ed unable to sober up, although his
fines aggregated some $50, besides sev
eral days served in the City Jail. He
was arrested ten times for drunkenness
and. finally was sent to the county rock
pile as an habitual drunkard. Through
out it all the poor fellow would pro
test that he wr sick and wanted to
go home. When leaving the station or
the jail he would walk steadily enough,
but in the afternoon policemen would
meet him staggering. Little heed was
give'n to his plea, "I am sick in my
head," until T>r. Aldridge examined
him to-day.
Wold was struck Just above the right
temple by a falling piece of pipe while
at Work in the shops and the Jagged
edges of the bone could easily be felt
through the skin. That the man sur
vived at all and did not become vio
lently insane is a marvel to the County
Physician and to every medical man
who has since seen him. He was taken
to the County Hospital, whe're every
effort will be made to repair the In

The men, whose , name were not

which capsized beyond the breakers.
They clung to the overturned craft
and waved their arms for help. Young
Brainerd dispatched several men and
women to nearby qottages for cjothes

The City Council to-day took action
on the petition, calling a special elec
tion for the selection of Councilman
Davenport's successor for August 11.
Davenport was recalled by his con
stituents for having voted, with a ma
jority of the City Council, to let a city
printing contract to a local newspaper
at' an increase over the terms of a pre
vious contract for the same work. It
is said to be the first case of the kind
in this State.
The recall was made under the pro
visions of a recent amendment to the
city, charter, which provided that
whenever 25 per cent of the voters
shall petition the City Clerk for the re
call of. the holder of any elective office
his seat shall be declared vacant and
the City Council shall call a special
election to fill such vacancy. The num
ber of names attached to the petition
which recalled Councilman Davenport
was 932 out of a total of 2864 votes cast
in the Sixth Ward at the last general
election. .
LOS ANGELES, July 5.â A distinct
innovation in municipal government
has Just been made by the citizens of
the Sixth Ward of the city of Los An

Councilman J. P. Davenport of that
ward because he voted contrary, to
their wishes in the matter of a public
contract.
Young Train was for many years
employed by the New York banking
firm of Kountze Bros., against which
he is now preparing to bring, suit. He
is a brother of George 'Francis Train
of this city, and is making, his first
visit to the coast. /
The suit will be brought in the Fed
eral court with a view, to setting aside
a foreclosure, under which Kountze
Bros., the well-known bankers, it is al
leged, fifty years ago gained, a title to
about 500 acres of what is now valua
ble real estate in Omaha. The prop
erty ws formerly known as "Train
tewn," named after George Francis
Train, and was in the southern part of
the present growing and prosperous
city. , In disqussing the proposed suit
last evenins. young Train said:
During: his lifetime my fatfler regarded thÂ«i
property as rightfully his by reason of the fact
that the foreclosure -was effected daring his In
carceration In the Tombs In New York after he
had been pronounced of unsound mind, but
harmless. That judgment etill stands against
my father's name, but the fact also cxtsta
that, notwithstanding his property was taken
away from him. the -court did not appoint a
guardian to protect his Interests In the litiga
tion. When his children later proposed a suit
at' law he refused to carry out their wish or
permit them to bring an action in their own
name. As the American public well knows,
my father was a very erratic man, and all our
efforts to induce him to entertain the sugges
tion of a suit were fruitless.
My father continually contended that the
property, while rightfully his. was really being;
Improved by others who claimed it and that it
was thus growing in value for the- benefit of
his helru Its present value I cannot
estimate, but it would perhaps make about
5000 small - building lots. The plans for the
suit are now entirely with my attorneys In
To have begun the action during his lifetime
would have embarrassed my father exceeding
ly for it would have revived the question of
his sanity. As to his well known eccentricities
I have always believed that they were due to
father's craving for notoriety. He liked to be
talked about and loved to see his name In
print. It was a mania with him and one which
I think he inherited, for T recall a story about
one of his relatives,' of whom it was related
that when a boy he would kneel -before a bar
rel, through the bunghole of which he would
yell his own name and then smilingly listen to
the echo from within.
Elsey McHenry Train of New York,
the youngest son of the late George
Francis Train, whose eccentricities
gave him world wide fame, has
arrived from the East with . his
wife and is staying at the St.
Francis. Although Mr. Train purposes
to establish a residence In California,
one of the principal purposes of his visit
to the. West at. this particular time of
the year was to. take the preliminary
steps in a suit. at Omaha for, the recov
ery of title to a large portion of that
city. On the way to San Francisco he
stopped over in Omaha for the purpose
of conferring with his legal advisers
there and arranging for the civil ac
tion, which will involve many millions
of dollars.

"Baby Peckenpaugh" was known on
the police force of this city for many
years prior to 1894, when he severed
his connection with the department

ST. LOUIS, July 5. â Prices here
have gone skyward. They are robust
normally, but the convention prices on
top of the exposition prices have pro
duced a lofty result.
A California delegate, whose expe
rience carried him to "the summit,
dropped into a barber shop near the
Union station for a haircut and shave,
and he got it.
"How much?" he asked. "Seven
fifty," answered the boss. At first the
victim thought it was a joke. It be
gan to look serious, though, when the
barbers locked the- door and repeated
the demand that he shell out $7 50.
So he paid the highest market price
that has ruled this year for tonsorial
work.
Under heavy anger pressure he sail
ed forth to get revenge. He met a po
liceman and related to him a harrow
ing tale of the outrage. The police
man looked dreamily over the kick
er's head. He said the case would be
investigated. That was the last of it.
The delegate was assessed $1 for
transportation in a cab to a hotel four
blocks from the depot. The hackman
seized the delegate's valise and an
nounced that he would hold it until
$1 had been Daid.
Appeal was made to the hotel pro
prietor. "Oh," he said, "I would con
sider $1 a reasonable charge.
Jn many restaurants the policy is
to lay on all the charges that the trar-
Jic will bear. Proprietors consider not
"how much it is worth," but "how
much has he got?"' .Democracy will
be as a shorn lamb when the conven
tion ends.

If you are cot in a position to avail your
selves of this bond you may be out or In

One reason the court rranted the injunction
waÂ» because there are Â«o many thousands of
you who pay only a small sum each month
that if it should finally be beld that the
company wae entitled to a higher rate than
the Council fixed the company could not col
lect near all It would be entitled to. but by
rteuirlr.g the company to give a bond for
your benefit in case it lost the court thought
no practical harm will be done.
Therefore, we have a right to assume that
re tbe trial the decision will be in favor of

v ;;i be used to postpone a final bearing and
decision. It may he quite a while before that
decision comes, but you have every reason to
expect ft. Therefore keep your water bills

you and the rates fixed by the Council, plus

Hie Honor recites that the rates fixed
hy the Council, enforcement of which
has been temporarily enjoined, are
fiom 20 to 30 per cent lower than the
l&*t fiscal year's rate, upon which the
water company will continue to collect.
The Major adds:
In explanation the Mayor says that
the w ater company has given a bond in
$130,000 to protect rate payers in case
the litigation over the valuation of the
plant shaH ro against the corporation,
and the company shall be compelled to
rebate the amount of difference between
that collected under the old rate and
much a rate as may be allowed by the
court.
Mayor W'arrfn Oiney tn an official
statement made to-day has advised all
water rate payers to save their receipts
for bills pending the decision of the
courts in the water rate suit shortly to
so to trial before Judge Gilbert of the
United States Circuit Court.

When the passengers learned that
the man was dead, several of them at
once left the car, preferring to walk
or wait for another car rather than
continue the trip to Oakland in com
pany with the corpse. When the car
reached the corner of Fourteenth street
and Broadway the body was carried
to a drug store and a physician was
called, but it was found that life (was
already extinct. The body, was then
removed to the Morgue.
Judson was returning from work in
Piedmont when he was stricken by
death. The deceased was married and
resided with his family at 573 Minna
street, San Francisco. He was 56 years
of age. It is supposed that death was
caused by heart-disease.
W. F. Judson, a San Francisco car
penter, dropped dead on a Piedmont
car at 5:15 o'clock this afternoon. The
passengers, of whom there were a
number on the car at the time, became
geatly excited when the unfortunate
man suddenly pitched from his eeat
and fell to the floor. It was at first
thought that he had fainted, and Con
ductor Woods, who , was in charge of
'the car, attempted to revive him, but
failed, and an examination -revealed
the fact that Judson's heart had ceased
to beat.

Councilman Howard's place in the
City Council was kept vacant by
Mayor- Olney in the hope that he could
be induced to accept the appointment
upon his return to Oakland. Howard
will resume his place as chairman of
the Finance Committee of the Council.
At the fity election in March, 1903,
Howard was elected a Councilman at
large by a large majority. His work
in the Council was characterised by
an aggressive attention to the city's
affairs which put him to the forefront
at once.
John L. Howard, president of the
Western Fuel Company, has been ap
pointed a member of the City Council
to fill the vacancy caused by his own
resignation. Mayor Olney announced
the appointment this afternoon and
Howard said he would resume his
work with the municipal legislative
body. . â¢ r.^' '
Councilman Howard resigned several
months ago because his business in
terests demanded that he should be ab
sent from the State for a considerable
time. During his absence Howard
made a trip to Europe in quest of rest
and recreation. He returned to Oak
land last Saturday, after visiting Na
naimo, B. C, where his extensive coal
interests are located.

Superintendent McClymonds - was
also authorized to ask real estate
agents to submit propositions for
sites for the proposed new â¢ buildings
to be erected according to specifica
tions set forth In the call for a school
bond election.
The Board of Education took offi
cial notice of the sale of the school
bonds to-day, and at its meeting to
night began at once to put into effect
the will of the people as expressed at
the polls. It was decided that the
Franklin School should be the first
to be built. This school was burned
some time ago and the school facili
ties in that district are In a deplor
able condition. Director Isaacs was
authorized to drawlup a notice to ar
chitects for plans for a school build-
Ing, containing from twenty. to twen
ty-two rooms, to be constructed of
brick and stone upon the site of the
old building.
The school bonds voted at a recent
election were sold by the Board of Su
pervisors to-day to the Central Bank
of Oakland and the Oakland Bank of
Savings for $9C0,000. The first named
institution took $500,000 worth and the
latter took the remainder of $460,000.
The bonds sold for par and the money
is to be paid as soon as the bonds can
be issued. The Board of Kducation can
now begin the work ;. .ejected for the
general improvement of the public
school system of the city.
Much satisfaction is felt over the fact
that home concerns showed their con
fidence and ability to take the entire
issue. There was a third bid- before the
Board of Supervisors from E. H. Rol
lins & Sons of New York, who offered
to take the bonds at par and pay a
premium of $7013 50. But the bid was
conditioned upon the favorable report of
their attorneys that the proceedings
were regular. This offer was not con
sidered in tbe light of a bid. It was
rejected and the check of $20,000 accom
panying the bid was ordered returned.
The two home banks that were
awarded the bonds made no conditions.
The bonds were voted at a general elec
tion a few weeks ago held for this pur
pose, and are to bear 4 per cent inter
est. This money is to go for the pur
chase of school lands, for the erection
of new school buildings and the en
largement and renovation of old ones.
It is believed from estimates made prior
to the calling of the election that with
the expediture of this sum the public
school system of this city can be made
second to none in the "State.

There has long been a lack of cor
diality between (prison and the Town
Marshal of Berklley. The feud grew
out of Carlson's refusal to pay for a
peddler's license on the ground that it
is an injustice. Kerns, acting accord
ing to his interpretation of the law,
has arrested Carlson half a dozen
times, but without effect.
Carlson submitted to these arrests
with complacency, but he certainly ob
jects to the Marshal's references to his
nativltly. He says that the last time
Kern arrested him the Marshal called
him "a 'â square head,"
swore that he (Kerns) was running
the town of Berkeley and generally
humiliated the grocer so that he wants
damages in the round sum named.
E. P. Carlson, a West Berkeley
grocer, doesn'i mind being arrested,
but he declines to submit to humilia
tion. Because of attacks on his repu
tation-he began suit to-day
Marshal Charles T. Kerns of Berkeley
for $1000 compensation for his injured
feelings.
Carlson charges that Kerns, while
arresting him for an alleged violation
of the Berkeley license ordinance,
called him a "square head." This he
deems a reflection .on his native land
of Sweden. He says Kerns emitted a
string of other words that would have
burned holes in a wet blanket. v

As It now stands, the specimen con
sists .of a cranium without the Jaw,
from which some of the parts are miss
ing. It lay on the surface of a deposit
of ossiferous clay flooring a deep vault
in the cave and was almost completely
covered with crystalline stalagmite. In
preparing the, specimen Dr. Furlong
and Dr. William J. Sinclair, who as
sisted him,, had great difficulty in keep
ing it Intact, owing to the chalky 1 char
acter and extreme thinness of the bones
of the skull. The nasals were restored
with plaster.
In a bulletin devoted to a description
of this specimen Drs. r'urlong and Sin
clair, who collaborated in the work,
say that the remains are of'a fully de
veloped animal, approximating in size
a small cow and resembling the goat
in the elongated- facial region. The cra
nium is larger than in the big horn
sheep, while the horn cores are smaller
and are situated much farther behind
the orbits and differ greatly in form
and curvature.
In the opinion of the scientists the
animal belongs to a late subdivision *pf
the quaternary, an age that fs probably
anywhere more than a million years
old. They agree that, the age of the
deposit initheSamweLarid Potter Creek
caves is later quaternary, except that
the Potter Creek Cave is probably the
older.
The specimen was found by Dr. B. L.
Furlong of the paleontology depart
ment of the university in the Samwel
Cave in Shasta County. The cave is
situated on the east side of the Mc-
Cloud Itiver, thirteen miles north of
Baird, and is 355 feet above the river.
Remains of the animal have also been
found in the famous Potter Creek Cave,
the material consisting of broken horn
cores, teeth and other elements..
Traces of still another new type of
extinct animal have been found In the
limestone caves of Shasta County by
the scientists of the University of Cali
fornia. This time it is the skeleton of a
large ungulate, "an animal resembling
the present day mountain goat. It dif
fers in many respects from the. modern
beast, however, and has been named
euceratherium, which in Greek means
a beautiful horned wild beast.

those of the battleship Ohio, are the
irreatest in dimensions ever built on

A merry lot of maidens journeyed
home from Del Monte yesterday, some
by the "trams" â "train" having
grown passe since the reappearance of
Talbot Clifton into the smart setâ and
others by the auto. And they returned
with diversified views of the sport they
had. But what could the dear giris
hope for when each bonny maid "was
fully equipped to score, *and the men
so scarce? Not that a plenitude of
men had not registered, but the
wretches made themselves scarce. It
is said that the Capital Club in old
Monterey Is an alluring "tarry a while"
for the men of Del Monte: but let it
be said in defense of the' club
that feminine friends are also wel
come. The club is the rendezvous of
the army officers and a i-oosting place
of many rare raconteurs. Can the' men
of Del Monte be castigated for pre
ferring th* happy hospice to the tab
bies' executive sessions on the porch?
However," enough of the gallant lads
hung about to give a merry time to
Miss Voorhies, Miss Grace Spreckels,
Miss Gertrude Dutton, Miss Margaret
Newhall and Miss Jennie Crocker, a":l
of whom were in the vortex of the-fun
through the busy holidays.

The city board of evangelization
met at 749 Market street last evening
and transacted a good deal of busi
ness. Judge Bridgford presided. Rev.
P. Brett Morgan asked the board for
assistance in building the contemplat
ed Christian church at Twenty-fourth
street, near Diamond. He told of the
necessity for the church Â¦ in the Noe
Valley to take the place of the mission
building and the board promised its
financial support.
It was also resolved that a commit
tee shall take in hand the completion
of the Tenth-avenue Christian
Church.
Dr. W. Macklin, from Nankin, Chi
na, gave some Interesting news of
missionaries and their work in the

The officers appointed to act on the

Robert Williams testified that he,
with Detective O'Connell of Morse's
agency, had found a number of let
ters in the Pacific' Coast Warehouse
in August. 1903. and Calvin Langton, a
clerk employed by the Eppingers,
identified the signatures on a number
offered in evidence.
The battle for the possession of the
books has been temporarily postponed
anl argument will be made before Mil
ton J. Green, referee in bankruptcy,
asking that his order that Receiver
Wadsworth recover possession of the
books be revoked.
The argument before Green will be
heard at 9:30 and the hearing of the
case will be resumed at 10 o'clock this
morning.
Augustus B. Costigan, a grain mer
chant, testified to having grain shipped
through the Eppingers and that he
knew a certain lot of wheat had been
exchanged for another of similar qual
.My. x
LOTS EXCHANGED.
The witness further testified that it
was the custom of Jacob Eppinger to
sign checks made out by Mitchell or
Joseph Eppinger without making a
close examination of them. In July,
1902, a vear before the failure, the
witness had added 900 tons to force a
balance of his books, -which/ was at
tributed to "gain." He admitted that
during the last year these "gains" had
been much greater than in previous
years.
When the case opened Topping re r
sumed the stand and in response to a
question by Attorney Campbeil said
that he never knew what grain was
stored in the warehouse at Crockett,
but was in the habit of making entries
from the inventories sent" down from
Crockett to make his books balance.
The attention of the witness was
then called to two entries in. his books,
one of 12,000 pounds and the other of
20,000 pounds, to force a balance for
the- year ending June 1, 1903, and tie
was asked If he ever showed the book
with these, forced balances to any of
the creditors of the firm, to which he
replied that he did not.
"Do your books show that lots 706;
707, 708 or 710 were shipped on the
Pierre Loti in December, 1902?"
"They do not." Â«
"Do they show a substitution of 709
for 710?"
"No."
The greater portion of the day was
spent in the. examination of checks is
sued by the firm just before the crash
came. Attorney Ach sought to / show
by theÂ»e checks that the firm was act
ing in good faith or it would not have
made large payments on outstanding
notes just before the failure. To offset
this the prosecution called witnesses
to show that the payments made were
trifling compared with the amounts
owed. During the examination Attor
ney Ach accused District Attorney
Byington of having abstracted certain
checks from those secured. Byington
replied there were some checks
still in the vault and at the disposal
of the defense to examine freely.
UNAWARE OF QUANTITIES.
Late yesterday afternoon the pri- i
vate letters of the \firm of Eppinger
& Co. to the Pacific Warehouse Com
pany <et Crockett were admitted in evi
dence -as a part - of the proceedings
against Jacob Eppinger, charged with
"obtaining money under false pretenses.
Attorney Ach for the defense made a
strong objection to their admission,
but Judge Lawlor permitted them to
be marked as exhibits for identifica
tion and they will be read ati this
morning's session.
One of the features of the day was
the testimony of W. W. Topping for
merly bookkeeper for -the fltro, who
testified that for .years it had been
his custom to balance the accounts
by adding the necessary amounts of
tons of grain as gains. That Jacob
Eppinger was or at least should have
been thoroughly- cognizant of condi
tions at the warehouse was also
brought out in the testimony of Top
ping, who said, that the warehouse re
ports were daily laid on the desk of
Jacob Eppinger and .later taken to
him. Monthly reports were also avail
able to the head of the now defunct
firm.

Thlf is a very pood picture of Mrs.
Mary Rlvest. who lives at 622 Forty-
fourth street. Oakland. Mrs. Rlvest suf-
fered many years with rheumatism. Fi-
nally the left knee became stiffened,
swollen and painful, and at last the left
l^i? became paralyzed. The home phy-
sician feared gangrene at the knee and
advised amputation of the leg. Mrs.
Rtvest objected to amputation and on ad-
vice from a friend she had her relatives
take her to the Electro-Chemic Insti-
tute. 318 Grant avenue. San Francisco
The Electro-Chemic treatment cured
Mrs. Rlvest quickly. There was no cut-
ting. There was no pain. In a short
time she threw away her crutches. Her
left ltg is now as good as Ihe other and
Electro-Cheaistry did the work whetfaJl
other treatments had failed. Should any
one interested doubt the whole truth of
this most wonderful cure they should go
and see the happy, cured patient. She
would be only too j?lad to vouch for Its
truth. The Electro-Chemic cures of- Can-
cer. Tumors, Consumption, Catarrh
Asthma. Bronchitis. Deafness. Hinging
Ears. Rheumatism, Paralysis. Locomotor
Ataxia, Neuralgia, Dyspepsia, Liver
Trouble. Kidney and Bladder Troubles
TMlea, Fistula, Constipation. Headache'
TMzzlness. Insomnia, Epilepsy. Stricture'
Prost&titis, Blood Poison. Female Ir-
regularities and Misplacements, etc.. etc
are just as wonderful as the cure of Mrs'
Rlvest. and upon application the testi-
monials of hundreds of cured patients
living right here In San Francisco will
be cheerfully piven. These wonderful
cures are quick, permanent and inex-
pensive and. no matter how many other
treatments have failed. Electro-Chemls-
try would In all probability prove cura-
tive. The Electro-Cbemic X-ray exam-
ination Is the most reliable examination
that any sufferer can have. Such an 1 ex-
amination will quickly show whether a
case Is curable or not, and this examin-
ation is now absolutely free to any suf-
ferer applying at the Institute for it.
Don t mistake the place The success
of- the Electro-Chemic practice has
caused other physicians to try to imJtate
It The Electro-Chemic Institute occu-
pies nearly the whole first floor of the
large building. 118 Grant avenue, corner
of Post street. Tie office hours are from
9 to 5 and j to 8 daily and from 10 to 1
on Sundays. Consultation, examination
and advice Is free to all and patients liv-
ing at a distance are furnished a home
treatment that is most successful and
are loaned, free of charge until cured, a
complete Electro-Chemic â¢ apparatus.
From a wide experience, the physicians
pf the Elcctro-Chemic Institute, have
learned that the very best advertising
comos from patients who liave been
quickly, thoroughly and cheaply cured,
and while Mrs. Rivest only paid a few
dollars for her wonderful cure, she has
been the means of sending many other
sufferers to the Institute for treatment.

literature-laden vehicles, bearing con

treatises on how to tell the wild flowers,

sils, and all the rest, will make their
rounds much as the Yankee peddler
made his in the old days. In cities and
their suburbs the bobk lover must still
go to the library or the drug store for
his books; in the rural districts the
books will henceforth come to the
lover of them.

General Leonard Wood's amazing jump
doesn't hold a candle to the leap made

At the second battle of Mariassas "Mis

of transportation. He rescued Pope.
When he returned to Washington the
Cabinet was in session in the war of

retary Stanton. As he entered Stan

AN Examiner correspondent at the frontâ the front
meaning St. Louis in all matters hereinâ wires his
paper at length and breadth in regard to the ill
suppressed excitement caused by the advent on the fir
ing line of our talented fellow citizen, Mr. Delmas. The
interest that goeÂ« around stare-eyed and with breath
bated in various headquarters and with various kinds of
bait, but all liquid, iÂ» not aroused, so the correspondent
leaves ub to infer, by the personality of Mr. Delmas, but
because he i* to nominate Mr. Hearst in the convention.
So we read in the Examiner: "Because of the cries
and wails of the Republican and disloyal Democratic
press it was expected that the man who was to nomi
nate Hearst would be a wild man of the West a sort of
woolly aphis of oratory. So there was great surprise
when -it was found that the foremost orator of California
was a carefully groomed epitome of resonant courtesy."
There now 1 The sordid and effete East, led on and in
stigated by the devil and "the disloyal Democratic press,"
expected to see "a woolly aphis," and are presented in
stead with a "carefully groomed epitome of resonant
courtesy!" The sire of the 'show may be estimated
when it is known that in the said East "epitomes of re
sonant courtesy" are as extinct as the dodo. Epitomes
are there and possibly of courtesy, but the "resonant"
kind has gone with the mastodon and the moa. It was
left to Mr. Hearst to introduce the real article under the
eye . of the world at St. Louis^
Even the friends of this epitome in California had not
suspected him. Mr.^ Delmas has carried "resonance" as
a tail -to his courtesy like a concealed weapon, and draws
it and flashes it like a falchion for the first time before an
alien people. â .

staff with a piece of chalk on the iron.
He had also marked the notes of the
first few bars of the funeral march In
"Saul" on the staff.
Callaghan was whistling the air and
at the same time kept up a slow ac
companiment with his chisel, with
which he was chipping off the metal.
Callaghan was not making much
headway when his foreman came
around to see what progress he was
making. The foreman, who was of a
musical turn of mind himself, thus
addressed Callaghan:
"That is a beautiful piece of music,
but I see you are playing it In adagio,
which is the slowest time possible."
"Yes, that's right," said Callaghan.
"It's a beautiful aria." and he contin
ued to whistle as he slowly chipped
off the iron.
"Well," said the foreman, who re
alized that at the rate Callaghan was
working the job would never be fin
ished, "suppose you change the piece
to 'There'll Be a Hot Time,' and just
make the time presto, or as fast as
you are able."
THIS being the vacation season, when all classes of
citizens who have any leisure to devote to seeing
the picturesque sights of California find representa
tion in mountain climbing parties on a greater or less
ambitious scale, the popular mind turns naturally to the
subject of trails and to the charms of nature made ac
cessible thereby.
The mountain climbers may be divided into two
classes â those who seek diversion purely and those who
desire at once to enjoy and to overcome difficulties.
Mount Tamalpais is the nearest accessible mountain to
San Francisco, and thousands of citizens are now roam
ing over its slopes every week. Mount Diablo is a little
more remote, but not so far as to be out of the track
of popular tours, especially on the part of strong and
active young men, who think it no discomfort to sleep
on the summit and for whom there is a reward in the
sunrise outlook that comes as the fruit of their indus
try, a great view that is truly grand under favorable
circumstances, with the Sierra serrating the eastern
horizon and the vast extent of the San Joaquin Valley
in the vista and the immediate western aspect embrac
ing all the intervening hills of the Coast Range Moun
tains, the bay of San Francisco, Tamalpais looming up
in tent shape like a great lodgment for a mountain
spirit and the immense width of the Pacific beyond.
Going up Mount Hamilton there are various points of
vantage from which the Santa Clara Valley may be
seen in almost its entire extent, and a remarkable pano
rama it is indeed. Los Angeles has Mount Lowe. The
north looks up to Mount Shasta and to the Lassen Butte,
with their crowns of snow. These mountains are all pro
vided with trails that the ordinarily vigorous man or
woman may safely attempt to traverse without mis
giving as to; ability to continue to the end.
Mount Whitney has so many devotees that the sea
son is marked by the issuance of a. Mount Whitney Club
Journal. From that veracious publication glimpses of
the enlargement of means to reach the Mount Whitney
scenery are obtained. The Government road to the
Sequoia National Park has been completed to the Giant
Forest. A road of reasonable grades and evading the
dangerous Stevens grade extends from Happy Gap on
the old Visalia road to the west line of the .General
Grant National Park. Boulder Creek, on the^route to
the General Grant Park, has been spanned' by a bridge.
The way to. the Big Meadows, the shortest ? line to the
Kings River Canyon, has been improved.. the Tehipite
trail has been made safe for riding and pack animals,
whereby, in conjunction with the Copper Creek trail, the
Simpson Meadow, Granite Basin and Sheepshead Basin
are made more easy of ; access. -With some additional
changes, now in contemplation, one may travel by way
of Copper Creek to Tehipite, thence down the Middle
Fork and out via Millwood or the General Grant Park.
There have been many accidents at the place known for
some years as "the stairs," on the Stubbs : Creek trail to
Kearsarge Pass, leading to the summit of the canyon
of the Kings River. Pack animals and horses have been
killed there. The '/stairs" are reported to have;lost
PATHS TO PICTURESQUENESS.
Death's Strange Distinction.
"A corpse was floating on the water."
a reporter said. "I saw it first and my
longshoreman stopped rowing to peer
at it through the dusk.
" 'It is a man,' he said. 'I bet you it
Is a man.'
" 'How can you tell?' said I.
" 'Because it is floating on its stom
ach." the longshoreman answered. 'Male
corpses float on their stomachs always.
Female corpses always float on their
backs.'
"A moment later we were beside the
corpse. It floated face downward and
It was, sure enough, a man.
" 'You see,* said the longshoreman,
'the two sexes are built differently.
There's a group of bones called the
pelvic bones that are lighter in men
than In women. It is these pelvic
bones that cause men to float face
down and women face up.'
"â¢You might have divined this fact
for yourself by watching the bathers
at the seashore. Didn't you ever no
tice, among bathers, how easy it is for
women to float on their backs? But
men, when they try to float in this
Â¦way, gradually turn over on their stom
achs.' "âNew York Telegram.

Russia's Gold Rcserz'e
Henry Norman, a Russian traveler
and member of the British Parliament,
describes in the World's Work a visit
to the Imperial Bank at St. Peters
burg, where there is $313,830,000 worth
of gold. The walls of the treasure
chamber are literally lined with gold.
Mr. Norman describes the room as fol
lows: The walls of the apartment were
completely covered up to a height of
about eight feet with shallow cup
boards with doors of strong wire net
ting, leaving their contents plainly vis
ible, each door being both padlocked
and sealed.
About five-sixths of these cupboards
were completely filled on narrow
shelves, with ingots. of gold, the ends
of which made a lining of gold for
nearly the length of the room, j The
light was reflected brightly from the
shining metal, and the effect, needless
to say, was highly Impressive. I felt
as if some fairy had conducted me to
one of the caves cf gold I used to read
about with awe as a child. The bal
ance sheet of the Bank of Russia for
March 29 stated the total gold reserve
in the bank to be as follows:
Rubles.
Russian gold coin '..... 2:{S,0<)0,000
Foreign gold coin 142,000.<mO
Bullion gold co!b 204,000,000
Total 5.S4.00O.0O0
Or 1313,830,000. The gold reserve of the
Bank of England is $140,000,000.
The total gold reserve of Russia
reaches the imposing sum of 1,000,000,
000 rubles, or more than $550,000,000.
It Is, of course, only a comparatively
small part of this vast stock of the
precious metal that would be available
under any circumstances for a war
fund. This fund would come, in the
first place, from the reserve of gold I
saw. The currency law of Russia of
1S97 prescribes that, up to 600,000,000
rubles, paper money may be issued
with a gold reserve of only one-half
its face value, but that all subsequent
issues must be covered, ruble for ruble,
by a gold reserve. *
Now, there is a nominal circulation,
of paper money to the value of 6S0,
000.000 rubles, but of this there are
always at least 30,000,000 to 50,000.000
in the bank; therefore the effective
circulation of paper money is not more
than 650,000.000. and of this, according
to law, 350,000,000 must be redeemable
by fixed' gold deposit.
Deducting this sum from hte 6S4.
000,000 of the fixed gold deposit, we
have 234.000,000 rubles immediately
available as a war fund, and to this
can certainly be added a large part of
the gold on deposit abroad, belonging,
as exnlained above, both to the state
and to, the Bank of Russia, the total
being, say. 225,000,000â say, an availa
ble sum of 200,000,000, making a total
war fund immediately available of
484,000,000 rubles, or $225,000,000.
REPORTS from St. Louis are to the effect that no
feature of the great fair has proven to be more,
popular than the daily demonstrations of the ej
fects of radium, given every day at the United States
Government building. No novelty or wonder show on
the Pike is more attractive than these scientific lectures.
The room where they are given is always crowded and,
after the lecture is over, many persons remain to ask
questions and get a sight of the marvelous element.
The popular interest taken in the demonstrations is. not
strictly speaking a scientific dne. At present radium is
a curiosity which every one is eager to see and to learn
as much about as possible. Moreover, it is a curiosity
around which there have been developed some most ex
traordinary expectations. Science knows hardly any
thing about radium except that it exists and that it
possesses a radiant energy so great as to be virtually
incalculable. If it could be obtained in considerable
quantities and applied to use it would place at the dis
posal of man a force so enormous that the civilization
of the future would exceed thafof to-day to a greater
degree than our, civilization exceeds savagery.
According to some authorities, however, the quantity
of radium is so small we can hardly hope to make use
of it for industrial purposes. It is said to be so rare
that a pound of it is estimated to be worth $8,000,000.
Professor Kunz of the United States Geological Survey
is quoted as saying:
"There is so little radium in the world that if it was all
crystallized together it would have no more effect in
heating or lighting the . earth than would one incan
descent electric light upon the 1240 acres of ground
comprising this World's Fair. There is so little radium
in the world that it can hardly change our present sys
tems, but, like other discoveries, it may have* an appre
ciable influence upon, the scientific world."
A report of the demonstrations given at the fair says:
"There is no pure radium shown. It is a dirty-looking
little powder and the demonstrator used a speck about
the size of a cambric needle point on a little instru
ment called the spinthariscope. This is a small metal
tube, two inches long, having magnifying lenses at one
end and being closed at the other. In the closed end
there are tiny yellow crystals of zinc sulphide stuck on
a disk of paper, before which stands a pointer like the
hand of a watch. On the tip of this is the speck of
radium. Watching the spinthariscope one can see a
constant flow of points of light" which come from the
*inc sulphide paper. The demonstrator says that these
radiations would go on for thousands of years without
lessening the energy of the radium."
Such is the show that is now most attractive to the
American people, and it is difficult to avoid speculation as
to what kind of radium exhibits will be made at the next
World's Fair. That there will be something much more
notable than a dirty-looking powder goes without saying.
It is even possible fliat there may be shown exhibits of'
a means of using it in art and medicine, if not in industry.
There was a time when electrical energy was as mar
velous to man as radium energy is now, and perhaps in
the future we shall find a means of using the one almost
as effectively as we use the other.
RADIUM AT THE FAIR.
Fighting Sand Dunes.
This Government is making- a study
of the sand dune question, with a view
to putting up a fight against the en
croachments of a relentless enemy
which, in some parts of this country â ;
notably on the coast of North Caro
lina and along the shores of the Great
Lakes â -does an immense amount of
damage, destroying farms, swallowing
villages and even overwhelming: rail
roads on occasions, says the Phila
delphia Saturday Evening Post.
When dry land takes a notion to
flow like water, trouble is pretty sure
to follow. Sometimes the dunes as
sume the proportions of great hills,
200 or 300 feet high, and, aided by the
wind, wander about, overwhelming
everything in their paths. By and by
such a wandering dune is likely to
get far enough away from the shore
to be sheltered to some extent from
the wind, and then it transforms it
self into a fixed dune, grasses and
eventually trees growing upon it.
The only way to deal with' the sand
dunes is to sow them with sand-bind
ing grasses, the interlacing roots of
which hold the' sand together and pre
vent the wind from blowing it away.
For this purpose the plant chiefly used
is the so-called "beach grass," which
is common all along our Atlantic coast
as far south as North Carolina. It is
dug up with spades and regularly set
out in rows a foot apart on the bare
dunes. One odd thing about it is that
it grows .most luxuriantly upon drift
ing sands; when the sand is quiet it
dies out after a while.
The planting of the grass, however,
is merely a preliminary step. When
a dune has by this means been made
stationary young pine trees are set
out on it and after a few years it is
covered with forest. Thus the mis
chievous and tramplike sand hill is
converted to usefulness, the timber
which it bears being a source of reg
ular income.
Losses in Great Battles.
Modern warfare differs from ancient
and medieval conflicts not only In the
veapons used, but in the percentage of
the wounded who survive a battle. In
the days of hand-to-hand fighting with
jiike and sword, battleax and dagger,
the casualties of a beaten army in a
hotly contested battle were apt to be
the final losses. The wounded were usu
ally taken prisoners or slain. Few men
hurt seriously escaped the fierce and
tiose pursuit of the victors.
Even the winning side had a far
smaller proportion of losses which were
merely temporary or technical than
armies suffer in these times, when
Â«-very man hit by a rifle ball figures in
the list of casualties, and nine out of
terf reported wounded recover soon and
rejoin their commands. In modern war
the so-called losses published after a
battle ran be cut down' to 25 or 30 per
cent of the official numbers In ascer
taining the permanent diminution of
the forces engaged.
In this respect, however, battles dif
fer widely. Sometimes actions fought
at close quarters under peculiar condi
tions, aÂ«, for instance, in cases which
involve the storming of strong works
defended by heavy artillery, the propor
tion of casualties which mean death
may rise to {something like the terrible
mortality rate of medieval wars.
When the Russians fiung themselves
upon the French and Sardinian lines
at the Tehernaya River before Sevas
topol in the summer of 1855 they left
about 3300 dead upon the field, and their
wounded seemed to number only about
half that number. But these propor
tions are so remarkable that it must be
taken for granted that many slightly
wounded Russians were sent to the
rear and never reported as hurt in rec
ords which the allies had the means of
comparing with their own casualties.
Keeping in mind, then, the broad
fact that losses in battle may mean
anything, from death to slight hurts,
and the temporary absence from roll
call of troops which rejoin their colors
later, and remembering that all rec
ords of casualties in war are disputed
by opposite sides and open to more or
less doubt, it is extremely interesting
at this time to look over a list of
losses, as the figures have gone into
history, in some of the more 'famous
battles of modern wars.

Our Accidental Presidents,
Every one of the Vice Presidents of
the United States who succeeded to the
Presidency through the death of a Pres
ident was an aspirant for the next nom
ination for Presidentâ but not one suc
ceeded.
John Tyler after the death of Presi
dent William Henry Harrison began to
realize the waning power of the Whig
party, and consequently abandoned the
party that had elected him on its na
tional ticket and strove to obtain the
next Democratic Presidential nomina
tion. That party, however, scouted his
candidacy and nominated Polk, who
was sneered at by Clay as the "Duck
River. coloneL" General Zachary Tay
lor, who was really without party poli
tics, was nominated for President by
the Whigs in 1S43 and was elected only
because of his Mexican war record
and the defection In New York of the
Van Buren faction, who would not sup
port General Cass, the Democratic
nominee. Taylor was in office only a
month when he died and was succeeded
by Millard Fillmore, a mediocre man.
But he had followers who stimulated
his ambition, and he soon began to lay
plans' for the Whig nomination in 1852.
But his claims were ignored and the
Whig party, with General Wlnfleld
Scott as its candidate, made its last
rally for the Presidency.
Fillmore in his disappointment was
persuaded to abandon his party,, and in
1856 ran as the Presidential candidate
of the Know Nothing or American
party, and he received only the eight
electoral votes of Maryland.
Andrew Johnson, seeing no prospect
of a nomination from the Republicans,
followed the example of Tyler and Fill
more and deserted the party that placed
him in power. He planned and dickered
for the Democratic nomination of 1863,
but his strength in the convention of
that party was hardly worth consid
ering.
Arthur followed Garfleld, and through
a skillful and prudent use of the Fed
eral patronage built up In his party an
apparently strong faction in favor of
continuing him in the Presidency, but
before the Republican National Con
vention of 1884 convened his strength
as a candidate had so melted away as
to leave him no chance of success.
Thus it will be seen - that what are
called "accidental" Presidents have all
aspired to succeed themselves and all
have signally failed, and with the ex
ception of Johnson their failure has
been followed by. obscurity. Roosevelt
is reputed to be a lucky man, and it
remains to be seen if he will be more
lucky than any of his accidental pre
decessors.âNew York Commercial.
AT the Alhambra Theater there will be held this
evening one of the most important as well as
one of the most interesting, political meetings of
the year. It is to serve as a ratification of the Chicago
ticket and platform, and at the same time commemorate
the anniversary of the original organization of the Re
publican party on July 6, 1854. The speakers of the
evening will be among the foremost of the State and it
goes without saying that the audience will be sufficient
ly large in numbers and sufficiently enthusiastic in spirit
to rouse them to their finest and most eloquent efforts.
The fifty years that have passed since the Republican
party was organized have been among the most .mo
mentous of the history of the country. In 1854 it was
still doubtful whether the United States was a nation or
a confederacyj.it was not known whether all the States
were to remain united or be divided; it was uncertain
whether an aristocracy, based upon slavery-was to rule
the Union or whether slavery was to be overthrown and
the aristocracy based upon it was to fall with it; and
finally it was as yet a matter of speculation whether we
were to become a great industrial people ranking above
all others in manufactures and in arts or were to remain
a race of agriculturists selling the products of our 'farms
for little or nothing and dependent upon Europe for al
most every form of manufactured goods except those of
the crudest kind. 4
Not one of those questions remains to perplex us.
They have all been settled. This js a nation, its vari
ous States and Territories will remain united as insepa
rable parts of a' mighty republic, there is to be no form
of slavery in the country, nor will the Government fall
under the control of an aristocracy of any kind; and
finally, American industries are to be protected for all
time against the ruinous competition of pauper labor in
foreign lands so that the American workingman may be
assured of abundant employment at good wages.
For the settlement of each and of all of these ques
tions the country is indebted primarily and directly to
the political organization formed on July 6, 1854, and
named "the Republican party." During its fifty years
of history it has elevated to the Presidency men who
will be held in honor by patriotic Americans for all gen
erations to come. Uuder their guidance the party has
held control of Government almost continuously since
t86o, and so wisely as well as so patriotically have Re
publican statesmen and representatives solved each suc
ceeding political problem as it arose that the most vio
lent of opposing partisans have in the end been forced to
abandon opposition and accept the solutions as definite
and final settlements of the issues at stake.
By reason of its illustrious history the Republican or
ganization has long since become familiarly known as
"The Grand Old Party." It has deserved the title by
reason of the grandeur of its past services in war and
in peace, and continues to deserve it by the fidelity with
which it holds to its fundamental principles and its great
policies. It now enters upon a new campaign under
leaders well worthy to uphold the high traditions of the
past. The celebration of its fiftieth anniversary is,
therefore, a matter of considerable moment in our polit
ical history and the meeting at the Alhambra should be
made memorable in the annals of the city.
single day's battle in modern times.
The fighting at Liepslc lasted more
than three days. In the "latter battle
the French lost about 25,000 sick and
wounded men, whom they had to aban
don in hospitals as they retreated.
These are not included in the figures
given. At Borodino, Liepsic and other
battles or Napoleon's later wars the
French included many nationalities,
such as Poles, Italians, Belgians, etc.
At Blenheim the French, who fought
and lost against Marlborough and
Prince Eugene, had Bavarian allies.
In the wars of Frederick the Great
the army he defeated, at Rossbach was
mainly French. At Kunerdorf the
force which routed him was chiefly
Russian. The French defeat at Sedan
was followed immediately by the sur
render of an army of 86,000 men. The
losses at Plevna cover a siege of
months, but the Russians and their
Roumanian allies lost 16,000 in four
days of fighting. The Turkish losses
were chiefly in the surrender of 40,000
men with the fortress.
The bloodiest ten minutes of the
Civil War was the first rush of the
Union army against Lee's impregnable
works at Cold Harbor. In half an hour"
the Federal loss was about 7000 and
probably 3500 fell in ten minutes. At
that rate 21,000 men would be put out
of action in an hour, or 250.000 in a
summer day, such as the struggle at
Waterloo covered. But no men that
ever wore uniforms could stand such
slaughter long.
It will be seen that in many cases
troops fighting behind intrenchments
suffered much less than those attack
ing such works. That is a rule of
modern war. It enabled the Boers
kÂ»'s inflict losses on the British which
were often ten times their own cas
ualties. But in South Africa, as at
Santiago, the numbers engaged on
berth sides were so small that the
losses of fights famous in their day
will attract little notice in the far view
of history.

An elaborate programme for this year includes trails
along the canyons of the Roaring River and Cloudy

she is an old maid, secured a wtxrant
from Police Judge Conlan yesterday
for the arrest of John Tooker, her next

that because she remonstrated with
boys for throwing firecrackers into her

Thus building is encouraged and the holding
of high-priced unimproved or poorly, improved
realty discouraged. - I believe that in assess
ing buildings they should be valued solely on
thÂ« basis of that value which. they add to the
realty on which they stand, and not necessa
rily â¢ on ,the basis of their cost, . This applies
particularly to old buildings. , r It Is in , this
connection that I feel that.Â»ome property own
ers'mayhave a just cause for asklngta revis
ion of - their - assessment. There has been Â¦ no
To the Owners of San Francisco Real Estate:
The assessment of real estate has been raised
$87,000,000. This is an unprecedented increase.
It has been my endeavor to make the asttess
ment of real estate this year, however, as near
uniform as it is possible to make It. The
immense amount of revisionary work which
was required and the short ppace of time
available for this work have made It impos
sible to prepare a perfect assessment roll pre
senting no inequalitleti. It is with a view of
affording relief to any owner who may feel
that his property is overaseesised that the
suggestions contained in this letter are made.
The assessment rolls will be opened for in
spection of property owners to-morrow morn
ing (Wednesday) in the chambers of the Board
of Supervisors. During the ensuing two weeks
thft board will sit daily as a board of equal
ization with j the object of reviewing the as
sessment of any property owner who may
petition to have the game reconsidered. I
will be pleased to meet any property owner
who may feel aggrieved at hiÂ« assessment
before the board and there take up the ques
tion solely on its merits.
j I nwy here state that, while I am respon
sible for the valuations placed upon real es
tate and believe thorn to be more Just and ac
curate than' they ever have bÂ»>en before in this
city, yot thÂ«He valuations are in the main based
upon an appraisement made by a board of thrrc
Â¦ professional appraisers of real estate, not con
; nected with this office, who were employed by*
; me for this purpose. Th*se appraisers were un
i known to each other and each made a separate
estimate of the value by the front foot of each
block of city property, which was reappraised.
In most instances their valuations closely
agreed. Where they did not an average was
I struck of the valuations determined upon by
th?m. The result has been an increase, in the
assessed value of real estate of $S7,000,000.
There has not, however, been a uniform in
crease In the assessed valuation of all real es
tate, which would have been unjustifiable, but
such real estate as had In the past few years
shown a marked increase in valuation was
raised up to the same basis of valuation as
property in less desirable Â»?ct!ons has been as-
Besfted at. In many cases the result has been
that real estate has had the assessment thereon
doubled, and in a great many Instances even
trebled. I would have oreferred to distribute
this immense increase over two or three years,
but certain reasons made this inadvisable, to
my mind In the first placÂ«Â». there was the
action of the State Board of Equalisation to be
considered. This board * last year raised all
property 30 per cent. This raise fell on such
property as was fully aese*eed as well as on
that which was underassessed. The result was
a creat wrong to thousands of our taxpayers.
The beard threatened to take similar action this
year. To protect those entitled to protection
' it v/as necessary to make an immediate equali
' zation of values, although this action will be
' a drastic one in many instances. The result,
however will, â¢ In my opinion, protect San
' Francisco from any increase by the State
! Board.
! In the second place, there is the question
'of equity to those taxpayers whose property
has not increased in value to any such extent,
. vet who have practically been paying taxes for
more favored owners, assessed at a much
lower rate. These latter owners have real lied
in many instances large promts on increas
ing values and should pay at once at the same
ratio as others in Ipss favored sections, I
know the result will be to force many to im
prove their property or sell In those Instances
where poor improvements cover very valuable
' realty. My Idea of assessments is to have. the
land bear the greater burden of the taxes and
j assess the new improvements as leniently as is
I possible. Â¦
JTO ENCOURAGE IMPROVEMENTS.

John Day, bartender in a saloon at
Powell and Ellis streets, was arrested
yesterday on a warrant charging him
with petty larceny. He was released
on $10 cash bail. The complaining
witness against him is Mrs. Edith

She alleges that she bought a fox-ter
rier from the pound for $3 and while
she and her husband were walking
past the saloon where Day is a bar
tender on Monday Day .grabbed the
fox-terrier. When remonstrated with
and asked to return it he refused,

Fire Commissioner Boyne asked the
committee to contribute $1368 14 to the
deficit of $3268 14 in the firemen's pen
sion fund. Boyne said the sum of $1900
had been Baved in salaries of firemen
and this would go toward paying the
pensions. The committee answered
that there is but $46 left in the urgent
necessity fund, but promised to ascer
tain if there were any other funds from
which the remainder of the pensions
may be paid.
The ordinance limiting the height of
all frame buildings to forty-five feet
was finally passed by the Board of Su
pervisors. The former limit was fifty
feet, but It was reduced in compliance
with the recommendation of the Fire
Department officials and insurance
men generally, in order to afford fire
protection, especially in .the lodging
house districts.
The. Supervisors' Finance Committee
decided yesterday to begin a crusade
against the owners of sidewalk eleva
tors not complying with the new ordi
nance requiring safety devices to be af
fixed to the elevators. A complaint had
been received from citizens that In
spector Ilolman was not enforcing the
law and that owners construed It to
suit themselves. Holman appeared be
fore the committee and reported that
he had inspected 116 sidewalk eleva
tors and that only 50 or 60 were com
plying with the ordinance. This state
ment seemed to surprise the committee
and Brandenstein declared that all
must be made to obey the law. :
"I have not inspected them all," said
Holman, "because I am obliged to walk
in the discharge of my duties."
"Walk!" cried Brandenstein. "You
must see that the law is obeyed If you
have to take a car."
J. P. Martin was cited to appear be
fore the committee next Monday and

vices of a battalion chief, at $175 per
month, and a fireman, detailed as fore
man, at $100 per month, whereas the
work was once done by one O'Connell
for $100 per month.

Police Officer Suttman was arresting
John Leishmann for exploding bombs
at Twenty-fourth and Castro streets
when A. J. Walsh and two unknown
men attempted to rescue the prisoner
by pelting the policeman with rocks.
Walsh was captured and warrants are
out for the pair of unknowns.
i
James Covington, accused of forgery,
tftid William Young, charged with
petty larceny, will be tried before
Judge Mogan to-morrow. The com
plainant is H. Freeman, residing at 11
Eddy street, who alleges that his name
was signed to an order by Covington
instructing Freeman's landlady, Mrs.
Jane Naughton, to permit the bearer
to obtain a razor from his trunk. The
order was presented by Young, who
was allowed to search the trunk, and
took therefrom a razor and a valuable
Bcarfpin.
Innocente Zeanani was arrested for
passing a fictitious check and when he
was searched at the Central police sta
tion several lottery tickets were found
in one of his pockets, so an additional
charge was booked against him. Judge
Mogan gave him twenty-four hours for
the tickets and will try him next Sat
urday on the check charge. The com
plainant is Louis Locatelli, 814 Mont
gomery street, who alleges that Zean
ani gave him a check for $20, purport
ing to be drawn on the Swiss-Ameri
can Bank by D. Bernard! and indorsed
by J. Madeline, both of which signa
tures were fictitious.
Oscar Ross will be sentenced to-mor
row for failing to provide for his fam
ily, consisting of an invalid wife and
seven helpless children. Instead of
contributing to the support of the
household, he spent for drink all the
money he could beg or steal from his
sick helpmate.
The Insanity Commissioners will ex
amine Alex Hennessey, who was ar
rested Saturday night for deliberately
cutting some ornamental screens in an
O'Farrell-street music hall. When ar
raigned before Judge Mogan the man
turned his back to the bench and be
gan delivering an incoherent address
to the spectators and he did other
things so indicative of lunacy that he
was hurriedly removed. Hennessey is
also known as Frederick Alexander H.
Burton and has been twice, committed
to the State Hospital for Insane. His
wife got divorced from him about a
year ago on the allegation that he
was of unsou: I mind at the time she
was married to him. He Is now con
fined in a cell at the Emergency Hos
pital pending his removal to the'asy
lum from which he was lately released
on the supposition that his reason was
restored.
August Rauch and Charles Rathwell
were riding on a Devisadero-street car,
j when August spat tobacco Juice on
Charles' holiday trousers and was
promptly rebuked. In the ensuing
fight the honors were about even, when
both combatants were arrested. Judge
Mogan discharged Charles and issued
a bench warrant for the arrest of
August, who forfeited his bail by fail
ing to appear for trial.
I F. S. Martin of San Rafael was
asleep in a Kearny-street saloon, when
Henry Brandt robbed him of $80 and
ran away, closely pursued by P. Duffy,
who caught him after a long chase.
Brandt offered to divide the spoils with
Duffy if the latter would attend to his
own business, but the proposal was
spurned and the thief turned over to
a policeman. Judge Mogan will hear
the case next Monday.
George HaveabuttOn and I^ena
Travera were treating a mutual friend
to dinner in a Chinese restaurant at
Jackson street and Bartlett alley, when
George became engaged in an alterca
tion with a waiter over the quality of
the third course, which was scrambled
swine-brains. . Words led to blows
and ere the police arrived on the scene
George had transformed the interior of
the cafe Into a total wreck. He will
be sentenced to-day by Judge Mogan.
"By George, that joke's worth five
dollars of any man's money," exclaimed
the defendant. "Best I've heard since
I came to town last Friday." And his
laugh was loud and lasting.
"Five dollars or five days," said
Judge Mogan.
"If you give me time I'll get the five
dollars," said Graham.
"I'll give you time to get the money
and I'll give you time if you don't get
the money," said the Judge.
Alexander Graham was hurling
anathemas at the Ferry clock, when he
was arrested for disturbing the peace
at Market and East streets. He ac
cuiied the big timepiece of unreliability,
and averred that it was the means of
causing him to miss a river steamboat
on which he Intended to leave the city.
"There's a story behind this case,"
said Joseph A. Carter, charged with
bcttery on Edward Jones, farmer, of
Bradford Island, "but I see you're
rushed and I won't take up time by
telling it."
"Oh, don't mind our rush," cheer
fully responded Judge Mogan. "The
city pays us handsomely for listening
to other people's troubles."
"With your permission I'll hold it
over till to-morrow," suggested the de
fendant, "as it's quite a serious matter."
"Your convenience is my pleasure.
Continued till to-morrow."
Farmer Jones informed the court that
he was battered by Carter because he
diEputed Carter's salary claim.
Judge Conlan dismissed seven per
sons who were arrested for celebrating
the Fourth by discharging firearms
within the city limits, and the bail of
three similar misdemeanants who failed
to appÂ«ar in court was declared for
feited. Fifteen others tried on the
same charge before Judge Mogan were
find $5 apiece and warned to confine
their patriotic powder-burning In the
future to the comparatively innocuous
toy bomb.
"How about that?" asked the Judge.
'â¢Mus' be anudder case ob mistaken
identerty," murmured the defendant.
"Disremembah havin' ebbah Been dat
yah lady befo'. Howsumdebbah, I'll gib
her de five ef she waits till Friday."
"If you don't return it to her to-mor
row I'll add its worth of imprisonment
to the nice long term I've already fig
ured out for you." said the Judge.
"The best thing you can do, doctor,"
whispered Bailiff Hickey. "is to take
your medicine at once, for the longer
you put it off the heavier the dose Is
sure to become. The woods seem to be
full of people that you've 'conned.' "
The defendant sadly shook his head
as he returned to the prison that has
been his home ever since he obtained
$10 from a credulous French governess
by telling her that he had dreamed of
a winning horse. And that occurred
several weeks ago.
"Dr." Samuel Waltes, colored phren
ologist, chiropodist, manicurist, palm
ist, mind-reader and general occult
scientist, was again called up for sen
tence by Judge Mogan, but as he ap
proached the bench so did another com
plainant with another charge of obtain
ing money by false pretense. Miss Sa
die Johnson, an olive complexioned per
pon, residing at 235 Kearny street, was
the mystic's latest accuser, and when
he saw her ascend the witness stand
his eyes protruded like hat pegs and he
proaned with trepidation. She testified
that after telling her fortune he
5 windled her out of $5 by professing
ability to pick the winning horse of a
race then pending, and that her share
of the income would amount away up
in three figures.
Judge Conlan sentenced Delia Walsh,
an apparently incurable vagrant, to six
months' imprisonment. During the
twelve years she has been known to
the police several futile efforts have
tÂ»een made to reform her. A philan
thropic woman at San Leandro took
her home and treated her more like a
companion than a dependent, but after
several months of respectable living
Delia returned to the city and resumed
her vagabondage. Police Captain Spll
lane, out of sheer sympathy for the
lady whose experiment had failed, tried
to induce Delia to return to the home
that awaited her, but his endeavor
failed.
"Then," said his Honor, "I'll continue
the case two weeks and allow the de
fendant her liberty on probation. If
Fhe is brought before me again on com
plaint of her pa*~ents I will send her to
an institution v. here wayward girls are
kept in restraint."
Eva Powers, 16 years old and pretty,
Ftood before Police Judge Mogan yes
terday and sullenly denied her mother's
accusation of battery, but reluctantly
admitted that she had resisted parental
control without resorting to actual vio
lence. As she pleaded she wept, but
her tears were not prompted by peni
tence, for her answers to the court's
kindly inquiries were both defiant and
Impudent.
Mrs. Powers, who lives at 1215 Valen
cia street, testified that last Friday
evening her daughter and another girl,
Alice Tillotson of Alameda, went to tha
Chutes and there met two young men
vrhom the witness had warned Eva to
avoid. When taxed by her mother with
having systematically deceived her the
girl had struck her on the face. Police
man Dennan took the girl into cus
tody, and her father, who is a shoe
maker, refused to bail her out of pris
on, so she spent the holidays in a cell,
and ithe Incarceration apparently did
not mellow her temper.
In support of her charge that the girl
was disobedient and inclined to way
wardness Mrs. Powers produced a let
ter which she said had been written to
Eva by Mies Tillotson. and the Judge
pronounced the missive sufficient of
Itself to prove the writer a dangerous
companion for any well-meaning young
girl. It was an effusive epistle, ad
dressing Eva repeatedly as "darling
sweetheart" and "dearest honey," com
miserating her on the maternal re
straint that prevented her doing as she
desired and solacing her with the in
formation that in two years she would
be a free agent to act as she likes.
"Only two more years, dearest sweet
heart," wrote the comforter, "and Just
think of the fun and the swell dressing
we will have then."
Not until her father coaxed and
pleaded with her for several minutes
would Eva promise to relinquish com
panionship with the Tillotson girl, and
then the promise was given in a way
that did not -indicate sincerity. The
Judge asked the mother if she wanted
to have the girl sent to the Magdalen
Asylum, and was answered In the nega
tive.
The Assessor also turned over to the
Board of Supervisors the military roll
containing the names of those subject
to military duty.

ARBITRARY ASSESSMENTS.
-The ordinance fixing: the municipal
tax rate for the ensuing fiscal year at
$1 12 on every $100 of assessed valua
tion was finally passed. Of this rate
92.46 cents is for the expenditures of
the city government, 7 cents for the
park and 12.54 cents lor redemption
of and interest on bonds. As the rate
was based on an assessed valuation of
$500,000,000, when in fact it is
$511,000,000, there will be a surplus
of $123,200 collected. Of this amount
$7700 will be added to the park fund
of $350,000; the library fund will se
cure $1650 additional to its $75,000 as
estimated in the budget and the bond
interest and sinking fund will receive
$13,794 in addition to the $628,336 al
ready voted. The remainder of the
surplus, $100,056, cannot be. used dur
ing the present fiscal year, as it was
not apportioned, but must Ue carried
over into the funds of the next year
and then used for municipal â¢ better
ments.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
resolved to sit as a Board^of Equaliza
tion on Tuesday next at 2:30 p. m.
for the purpose of hearing verified ap
plications for the reduction of assess
ments. The assessment books of real
and personal property were returned
by Assessor Dodge, showing Â¦ that
the aggregate assessed valuation is
$511,000,000.'
The board adopted a rule that no
tices shall be delivered to persons,
firms and corporations at least twelve
hours prior to the time set for hear
ing their applications for reductions.
It was resolved that all assessments
arbitrarily fixed by the Assessor will
be Increased unless the persons as
sessed nle" with the board a statement
of their personal property. The As
sessor was authorized to add to the
assessment books all property which
may have escaped taxation and also to

In the assessments.
possibility of reviewing the assessment 4>t
buildings this year in connection with the
marked Increase made in the assessment of
the land on which they stand. The result fs
that In some instances the total assessment
(the land as raised, plus, the assessment of
the building:) is higher than it should be,
when compared with the actual value of the
property. In these cases,* which, however, are
not great in number, the owner would be
justified In asking and entitled .to receive a
reduction, on the assessment of Improvements.
Land in all Instances is assessed at a uni
form rate I per front foot in each locality, and
unless the entire district * is rated too high,
which in no Instance is the case, in my opin
ion, the assessment on the land should stand.
With a building; it may be different. If an
unimproved lot sells for as much within $10.
000 as an adjoining improved lot with a build
in? thereon, which building may have cost
originally much more, then the value of that
building is not greater than $10,000, and I be
lieve it an Injustice to asses* it for any more,
even though it may have cost years before
$50,000. Through the fact that it is out of
date and not adapted to the requirements of
modern business, its value has depreciated.
In conclusion, I desire to say that it has
ever been my purpose, slnqe occupying the of
fice of Assessor, to prevent an unjust discrim
ination In the taxation of real estate. It will
take a year or two, however, completely to
equalize and adjust the roU on its present
basis. -It is my desire to 'do this work as
speedily as possible, and it is with the view
of inviting the co-operation of property owners
during the present session of the Board of
Equalization that this letter is written.

When Frisk doea not drop the ball

Ettoceeds in defeating Battling Nelson
wfcÂ«a they meet on the 29th of this
month and he will take no steps to
force matters until after that event Is
decided.
Hanloa is confident of beating Nel
Â¦on, however, and if he should suc
ceed he will at once begin negojlations
tor a match with the winner of the
Brttt-Corbett bout.
Kanlon has met Young Corbett twice.
The first time it was thought by many
that he should have had the decision;
the second time Eddie wae defeated by
the then champion lightweight. If
Young Corbett should beat Britt a third
contest with Hanlon would park the
Pavilion. If Britt should defeat Cor
bett and then consent to meet Hanlon
the interest in the contest would be
even greater, as both are native sons
and each has a large following In this
city.
Hanlon and his brother Dan returned
from the East the other day after a
four fnonths' stay. While he was away
Eddie won three fights and fought one
draw. He will go to Croll's Gardens
next Monday to begin active training
for his fight with Nelson. Nelson is
already training at Larkspur.
Articles were signed last night at Sol
Levinson's for a match between Dave
Barry and Harry Foley at the Century
Club, Los Angeles. The fight is to take
place on July 29. Each of the men
have posted 5200 as forfeit. Foley leaves
Thursday for his training quarters.
They will be located either at Santa
Monica or Long Beach.

HASTINGS' GOOD WORK.
Pitches Winning Ball at Portland, but
Receives Poor Support."
PORTLAND, Or., July 6. â Ira Hast
ings, the Browns' new twirler, made his
appearance for the first time to-day.
He pitched winning ball and with any
sort of support should have won his
game. As it was the Loo Loo's had
the big end of the 5 to 2 score. Beck,
Castro and Steelman made errors that
counted for runs each time. Hastings
seemed to realize that the poor work
was not intentional, for he kept his
head and allowed the visitors but six
scattering hits*.
The Angels scored twice in the sec
ond inning on two single and two
errors. In the next inning a two
bagger and an error counted two more
for them. The fifth tally was made in
the sixth on a single and an error.
Hall-was touched up for ten singles,
but it was not until the eighth that
the Browns combined their efforts.
With two out, Beck, Raymond, Castro
and Francis lined out singles. Two
runs were scored before Steelman
forced Francis at second. The score:

day of the summer meeting at Haw

while the attendance was good.
Creolin and Sohwarzwald, coupled as
the Corrigan entry, and held favorites
at 9 to 5, backed from 2 to 1, ran one,

probably the best race of the afternoon.

BHEKPSHEAD BAY, July 5.â What
many consider the greatest race meet
ing ever held at the course of the
Coney Island Jockey Club was brought
to a close to-day with two valuable
stakes and four other events or attrac
tions.
John A. Drake's three-year-old colt
Ort Wells fulfilled the expectations of
his owner and the great body of racing
experts by winning the valuable Law
rence, Realization stake, worth to the
winner $21,445, and placing Drake at the
head of the list of winning owners at
this meeting,* there being to his credit
in the books <ff the Coney Island Jockey
Club the sum of $57,265, which is largely
the earnings of the one colt, Ort Wells.
Song and Wine, by his frequent vic
tories this year against ordinary colts
and fillies, had incurred the limit of
penalty and had up 129 pounds in the
second part of the Double Event. His
stable companion, Blandy, had 122
pounds. The same weights were carried
by Councilman and Sparkling Star.
James R. Keene's Veto was entitled to
a maiden allowance of seven pounds
and this Is what won the race for him.
H. B. Duryea's three-year-old filly,
Mineola, by Meddler-Hurlyburly, now
holds the best record at six and a half
furlongs, defeating a large field in the
second race in 1:18 2-5. The former
best record, 1:18 3-5 was Jointly held by
Jane Holly and Ancestor. The latter
filly was beaten by a small margin by
Mineola to-day. Results:

EL PASO, Tex., July 5.â County
Auditor Murphy of Santa Clara Coun

face a charge of embezzling the funds

from San Jose some time ago and came

here, however, and went to Mexico,
stopping at Jimulco. The California
officers located him and prepared to
extradite him. Murphy, learning of

SAVES STATE TROUBLE
BY GIVING HIMSELF UP
Attorney Leon Samuels, for Mrs.
Layngr, filed the attachment on thÂ»
Third street property and a deputy?
sheriff visited the place during the af
ternoon. Mrs. Layng explained thaS
the action is not with hostile intent,
being in no way caused by any domes*
tic disagreement and she insists that
life with her husband has always been
happy. Why he left her without a word
on Saturday she does not know. In
quiry has failed to reveal his destina
tion and while she does not fear deser
tion she is apprehensive of injury t0
his property interests during his ab
sence. Samuels says that, in the event
of other creditors pressing claims, Mrs.
Layng desires to be heard. She has
money invested in the business ani
wants to realize from It. Another rea
son for securing the attachment is that
the business may go on without inter*
ruption from outside sources until
something is heard of the missing man.
In discussing the matter, with her at
torney, Mrs. Layng says that she has
not the slightest idea where her hus
band is. She says that he had always
been extremely kind to her and gava
no hint of any sort that he was about
to decamp.
Layng is well known in this
city and has been here for a number
of years. He has been heavily inter
ested in turf affairs and has owned
several famous horses. At one time hÂ«
was connected with the Breeder and
Sportsman, a turf publication. In an
editorial capacity. The Occidental
Horse Exchange, of which he Is now
proprietor, is considered a valuable
piece of property and has been the
scene of many horse auction sales
within the last few years.
William G. Layng. a well-known turf
man and proprietor of the Occidental
Horse Exchange, at 246 Third street,
mysteriously disappeared on Saturday
and yesterday his wife placed a $10,000
attachment on his property to secure
her interests In the concern. "Where
Layng went is a matter of conjecture.
His domestic affairs are reported har
monious, his business in a fair vMy and
he had no trouble, so far as is known,
that would cause him to desert the city,
in the manner that he did.

The steel ship Celtic Monarch, a
many-times visitor in this harbor, is
another tardy windjammer. She is 171
days out from London to Victoria. She
was driven into Queenstown by an
Atlantic gale that had pulled out the
foretopgallant mast and carried away
some sails and several boats. She sail
ed January 16.
.Being bound for this port the greater
interest centers on -the Montebello,
which is posted at 15 per cent reinsur
ance. As she is . considered to be a
fast ship, fears are entertained for her
safety. The Montebello is a steel bark
of 22S4 tons and owned In France. She
was built at Nantes m 1900 and has
been running out of English ports coal
laden ever since she was launched.
The only casualty charged against her
name was her entrance into Sydney on
January 16. 1902, leaking, during a run
from Cardiff to Honolulu.- She is com
manded by Captain Marchendeau and
her cargo is consigned to E. C. Evans,
308 California street.
Another long overdue but not yet
posted for reinsurance is the big steel
ship Holt Hill. She is 200 days out
from Hamburg to Portland. April 23
she put into Montevideo with decks
swept by the t-eas that had boarded
her and carried everything movable
overboard. Much of her cargo was
damaged and more than 200 tons was
jettisoned. The American bark Wlll
scott from Philadelphia to San Diego
is now 343 days out. December 7 she
put back into Port Stanley with the
It/sp of the foretopsall yard, with the
rudder-head sprung and the 1856 tons
of coal on board growing hot. She dis
charged 300 tons, extinguished the fire
and sailed June 26.
The overdue list of eight vessels
which have been posted for reinsur
ance of from T to 40 per cent has been
cut down to six. Yesterday the Largo
Law, now 71 days out from Philadel
phia bound for Fremantle, w-as re
ported spoken May '20 in 2 north and
25 west. The Juteopolis, 71 days from
New York bound for Penang, was
spoken June 4 in 16 north and 36 'vest.
Both vessels had been posted at 7 per
cent reinsurance. The other overdues
still out are the ship Sierra Miranda,
125 days from Rangoon for_ Una
.Grande; Wynford. 66 days from New
York for Shanghai: Queen Elizabeth,
77 days from New YÂ«.-rk for Hongkong;

Fortunately the young ladies re
mained cool and Ferrari, who is small
jn stature, but a good swimmer, struck
cut for the shore about twenty yards
distant. H? reached it in safety with
h:s precious charges, irho had clung
to him desperately. They look upon
him as the bravest of the brave. The
pirls are none the worse for their sub
mersion.
On the return trip they had reached
the Santa Cruz River and while wait
ing for a chance to cress the bar a big
vave struck the frail craft and cap
e:zed it. They were thrown into. the
yatcr and Â«hen Ferrari looked around
he could only see the dresses of his
companions. He seized one of the
pirls and mad? her ho!d to his shoul
der. He then swam toward the other,
who was in the art of sinking, and
catching hold <>f htr dress pulled her
t'> the surface and got her to- keep
herself afloat by holding his other
fchouldVr.
Ferrari and the two girls, one of
v.hom is Miss Anna ScMeef, 1418 Jack
fm street, this city, and the oiher a
friend who is visiting her, left Santa
Cruz on Monday morning Jn a row
boat for Capilvla. about eight miles
distant. The wind was against them,
but as they were all familiar with the
use of the oars tbeyj enjoyed the ex
perience.
1-ouis Ferrari, assistant In the Dis
trict Attorney's office, is the pride of
the Hall of Justice. It became known
yesterday that he saved two young
women from a watery grave at Santa
Â«'ruz on Monday. He was showered
Â» ith congratulations.
At the outbreak of the war with
Spain Wolff enlisted in Wyoming in
the Rough Riders and was quartered at
Tampa, Fla. He resided with his wife
at 402!* Grove street.
Julius Wolff, secretary of the House
smiths' and Arch Iron Workers' Union
No. 78, died at the Harbor Hospital at
half-past 3 o'clock yesterday morn
inj?, from injuries received on the pre
ceding day in a free-for-all fight at a
Shell Mound picnic. His rriend, Frank
Kelly, informed the authorities that a
general fight, drunken men and women
participating, took place in the danc
ing pavilion, and that he and Wolff
went to' the pavilion to see what was
the matter. There was much confu
sion for a minute or two, and when
the smoke of battle cleared away he
saw Wolff lying on the ground with
both eyes blackened. He took his
friend to the ferry-boat and on the
boat Wolff lost consciousness. The in
jured man was taken to the Harbor
Hospital when the boat landed af. the
foot of Market street, and Dr. JBosco
witz diagnosed the case as one of
drunkenness.
Autopsy Surgeon Baclgalupl found
the base of the skull badly fractured.
One of the. arteries was severed and a
large clot of blood had formed In the
brain. Detectives Mulcahy and Cole
man were detailed upon the case.
Mrs. Celia Wolff, the widow of the
dead man, stated to the Coroner yes
terday that she and Wolff had been
married only 10 months.

NESS THE WONDERFUL DEMONSTRA-
TIONS OF THE NOTED LIVINGSTONE.
He Is no Imitator. His work is upon original
lines: Pure thought, clear vision. He tells
you what you desire to know and works In the
open light.
( He Is as conspicuous for bis wonderful occult
analysis as he in Â¦ for Â¦ his original expression
and vivid truthfulness. â¢ .-
A test reading Is not a life reading; when
you cull on Prof. Livingstone he will give you
a full life reading for $1; a test Is of little
value; when the mind Is troubled you. need
more substantial aid and advice; this Is just
what Prof. Livingstone gives you when you call
on him for a first-class clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you what
you wish to know.
Would It not be a relief to know how you
wili succeed, to be relieved of the matters
that are you, and of . the echemes of
your enemies, that you may meet with better
success?
He 'does not mention all the Ills and misfor-
tunes you are-toeir to; you are acquainted with
the facts in your case: let Prof. Livingstone
analyze the matters that are troubling you,
find the cauee of the trouble and suggest the
remedy."- '
His only reason for giving your name In full
or any Important information Â¦ you may desire
is that he does this incidentally as a chain to
read by.

The result has been the development
of the dog barber as an artist. He
clips and shaves his customers' doga
In most elaborate fashion. Some are
left' with shaggy manes, with a tuft at
the end of their tail, to imitate a lion.
Others, again, are clipped in stripes,
making: them look like black zebraa.
and others have their faces clipped and
nothing but a pair of fierce mustache3
left with fluffy bracelets of hair round
each foot. At any time of the day,
as long as daylight lasts, the'dog bar
ber will be found at work on the Seine
embankment. Seated on a curnpstooJ.
and generally surrounded by an ad
miring crowd, he clips and shaves ac
cording to the directions given him by
the owner. The banks of the Seine
have been selected for his operations
because the river is handy to bathe
the animal" after he has been clipped
and combed. â Golden Penny.
One of the most characteristics of
these strange tradesmen is the dog
barber. The favorite dog of the
Parisian is the French poodle, or
"mouton," as he is popularly called.
It is chiefly for his benefit that the
dog barber exists. His -headquarters
are the banks of the Seine. Here the
main body can be found at all times,
though in the summer some go about
the city carrying on their occupation
from house to house. In the hot day3
one continually hears the long-drawn
out cry, "To-o-odeur de chien!" and
meets the familiar figure of the dojj
barber, with his box of instruments
slung over his shoulder. Many of them
have their regular cusfpmers, whose
houses they visit at stated intervals to
make the toilet of these privileged
poodlesi â for the Paris mouton is thÂ«
â¢'spoiled child" among dogs- Ho in
clipped, brushed, combed, perfumed
and generally has his "topknot" fas
tened with a pink or blue ribbon.
Some even wear gold or silver brace
lets round one paw. , .'. '\
It is astonishing with v.hat zeal
every means of. earning an * onest
penny is plied in Paris. No city in
the world has so many queer little
trades by which those practicing them
scrape together enough sous to make
a living:. The king of thi3 clas3 Is,
of course, the ragpicker. He staru
out before the dawn armed with a
lantern and a long hooked piece of
iron and explores the rubbish boxes
placed outside every door in the capi
tal before the municipal carts .corns
to carry off their contents. Then
there is the man who goes around
with the spiked stick picking up the
cigar and cigarette stumps which lie
around the Paris cafes. There are
men. too, who search the streets for
fallen money, and who generally find
enough to keep them from starvation.

SO3IE STRANGE TRADES
FOLLOWED IN PARIS
One of the foremost authorities on
gunmakingr. John F. Meigs, tells much
that is of interest in the Iron and Steel
Number of the Scientific American.
Among other things Mr. Meigs says:
"Six-inch guns, which used to weigh
11,000 . pounds, now weigh 18,000 to
20,000 pounds. The weight of the
projectile of these guns has not in
creased and has remained always 100
pounds, but the velocity at which the
projectile leaves the gun has increased
from about 2000 feet per second to
from 3000 to 3500 feet per second, in
consequence of a three or four fold in
crease in the charge of powder. It
may be arsued that this change â that
is, the constantly increasing weight of
guns of a given caliber â is not a wise
one. The great care and attention be
stowed upon the convenient and accu-
Tate moving of the gun, however, can
be nothing but an improvement. The
growth and progress of change in ar
tillery construction sometimes seems
arbitrary â seems sometimes to be as
arbitrary as the fashion of clothes.
Old guns made three hundred years
ago, which may be. seen in the
arsenals of this country and in
Europe, had about the same shape
and were in many respects similar to
the guns of to-day." In the inter
mediate period, say about one hun
dred years ago, the guns ha N d shrunken
up and become shorter and larger in
diameter, with larger bores. We are
now returning, or perhaps, more cor- i
rectly, it should be said we have re-'
turned to the fashions in artillery of
three hundred years ago.
"There are, of course, many respects
in which the modern weapon has a
great advantage over the earlier one.
It is made of stronger steel, and con
centric hoops are shrunken together,
whereby the power of the gun to re
sist internal pressure is materially in
creased. But perhaps in no place is
the advantage more marked than in
the better mount or carriage of the
present time. These are far better
arrayed than they usedflo be, anfl the
consequence is that the guns may be
much more rapidly and safely fired."
Weight of Projectile Remains Same,
but Striking Force Vastly
Greater.

LOS ANGELES. July 5.â The Coro
ner's Jury which to-day investigated
the killing of Thomas Kearns, who was
shot to death Saturday night by J. W.
Heart during a quarrel over 50 cents,
returned a verdict accusing Heart of
willful murder. William Kearns, son of
the murdered man, created a sensation
by trying to force his way into the
room in "which the inquest was being
held, declaring he would kill Heart on
sight. He had been told that Heart
was attending the inquest, and, arming
himself, he went to the place and de
manded to be admitted. Persons at the
door held him in check by telling him
that his father's slayer was not there,
and others summoned a policeman.

London Closing Stocks.
NEW YORK. July; 6. â Operators in stocks
demonstrated with more confidence and effect
In to-day's stock market than for a long time
past. The market w*s still a dull and narrow j
one. Judged by old standards, but it was lifted !
quite decisively from the profound lethargy :
which has been its recent characteristic* The >
obstinate resistance cf the market for some
time past to news of an unfavorable kind has
carried a suggestion that selling has been |
largely accomplished already in anticipation of
these evils and that the market was ottering an .
unyielding surface which would afford an ad
vantage and basis for bolder operations for a i
rise. Bolder and more powerful to-day's oper- |
atlons unquestionably were, arousing the usual
surmise* as to their origin, with nothing to af
ford a reliable answer to the question. Strength
at the outset was largely confined to the local
group. it was after the reaction in these
stocks and the effect of nome selling for Lon- ]
don account that the buying which Impressed
sentiment developed in Union Pacific and
spread to other portions of. the railroad list,
resulting in a fairly general uplift of prices to
the extent of 1 to 1 Vi points. Union Pacific
Itself rose 2%. The clew to the movement
could hardly be found in the crop news, as
the wheat market was more or leÂ«s disturbed
by damage rumors and by a mixed Interpreta
tion of the weekly bulletin of the Weather
Bureau. The small reaction on profit taking
in the last hour, when the buying was tempo
rarily discontinued, increased the confidence In
the movement and the closing was active and
fairly buoyant.
Bonds were firm. Total sales, par value,
$2,ft5O.C0O.

showed a falling off of over * million bushels
in the shipments for the week and those from
the Danube . country were reduced by a half.
The amount on passage. was nearly four mil
lion bushels less than a week. ago. A re
vised estimate of the French crop made a
creditable reaction In the total yield. Foreign
grain markets were affected by the bullish
statistics, prices at Liverpool being tip nearly
a cent. Under these Influences there was an
active demand for wheat here, small shorts
being the principal buyers. As th* session ad
vanced the ltlarket gained additional strength.
An official forecast of rain in tho Southwest
caused fresh anxiety to shorts In view of a
strong market at Kansas City. At times tha
market was almost bare of offerings, and buy
era had to materially bid up prices before
orders could be filled. The high point in Sep
tember was reached at 83@S3#c Notwith
standing the fact that there was considerable
liquidation going on during the last half hour
the market closed strong, with September at
82?ic.
The strength In wheat caused some firmness
in corn, but there was no great amount of
bull enthusiasm manifested. September opened
i{,c higher at\83%c. sold between 48?Â»c and
4!)i^@4 f j'4c anfl closed at 48!iÂ©49c.
- In oatÂ» the volume of trading was ex
tremely small. After opening %9Uo higher
at 32&-32%c, September ranged between 31%o
and 324&c and closed at 32c.
Provisions were Arm early on a good de
mand from packers. Later packers were lib
eral . sellers, causing a reduction. Late in the
day a rally occurred on the strength of grains.
The market closed steady with September
pork a shade lower at $13 22<i- September

The Investigating committee is Â¦.try
ing to discover the use to which the
Southern Pacific Company puts the
money collected as a State toll on the
coast line. It is not received by \the
Poard of I Harbor Commissioners, and
there Is no present public knowledge
.concerning Its destination. But it is be
ing paid -by San Francisco merchants
every day, and has been so paid for
many months. .' ' .
If the Southern Pacific Company is
compelled to abandon the toll on the
coast line it will have the tendency to
attract freight to the coast line, which
would be able to make lower rates to
the amount of the toll imposed at pres
ent than the Santa Fe or the {Central
Pacific.
The Santa Fe system is interested as
an observer. The toll that is assessed
by way of the Southern Pacific Com
pany's coast route gives the Santa- Fe,
which ferries its freights into this city,
an even chance with the Southern Pa
cific in the matter of volume of busi

is final the matter will be brought be
fore the Interstate Commerce Commis-
Many bills inspected show that on
goods shipped entirely by land the
charge for State toll has been made.
Representations have been made to the
Southern Pacific officials concerning the
opinions of the merchants of San F*ran
cisco relative to this charge, for which,
so the merchants 6ay, there is no war
rant in law. These representations have
been without effect.
The Interstate Commerce Commission
may be called upon to take cognizance
of a practice of the' Southern Pacific
Company concerning which a commit
tee of wholesale merchants and jobbers
of San Francisco is preparing to report.
The law of California provides for the
payment of a State toll on every pack
age that passes over the State's
wharves in this city, the money so col
lected being for the maintenance and
improvement of the water front. The
Southern Pacific Company is making
this toll collectible on goods that do not
pass over the property of the State,
namely, those on the coast division,
that go in and out of the city entirely
by land. A committee has been inves
tigating this matter.

For this woman the prophecy, like
the oracles of old, held a double mean
ing. . '
Detectives Bunner, Freel and Gibson
took Curry to the Hall of Justice, where
he was held on a charge of murder. He
appeared unconcerned, saying that he 1
had shot the. woman because she was
unfaithful. He had thought he would
reclaim her by marriage, but found that
to be Impossible. When he learned that
she was in company with, another man
he had become crazy with rage and did
not know what he was doing.
â¢A 1 letter was found in his possession
addressed to his wife; In which he said
he was going away, he did not know
where. , Â¦ Â¦ " : ' â¢ Â¦ : *'â¢ ,â¢ Â¦
Curry is 23 years. old. He came to
California six months ago from Coffey
County, Georgia, and has been em
ployed since 'April, last on the Powell
street line. Currv was arrested two
months 'ago for- shooting at an Italian
at the ferry 'building.. Ha claimed that
the man ? had insulted his wife. \The
charge was dismissed.
{ The woman's maiden name was Daisy
Jones.* Her father, George E. Jones, is
a minister in Corona, Riverside County.
She was formerly the wife of a man
named Pechner and had one child, a lit
tle girl. She was- 32 years of age, a
brunette and of good face and figure.
Among the dead woman's effects was
found a card from" a fortune-telling ma
chine. It bore the following predic
tion: â¢ ; =
At l<30 p. m. Curry visited the house
on Turk street. On asking for "Miss
Tripp" ne was brought face to face
with his wife. He went to her room
and found a man's hat there. He asked
her whose it was, and she said it was
"Fred's" and that "Fred" had gone to
get her some breakfast.
Shortly afterward the woman went
downstairs and told the landlady, Mrs.
L. Young, that her husband was with
her. She said he demanded her mar
riage certificate, wedding ring and the
sum of $120 which he had given her.
She added that he had a pistol, but de
clared she was not frightened, as her
husband would not dare to shoot her.
The landlady advised her to comply
with her husband's demands and avoid
trouble.
After she went back to the room the
husband attempted to persuade his wife
to. return to him. While talking to her
he kissed her. She drew back and
slapped his face. Mad with jealousy,
the man sprang back, drew his pistol
and fired four shots. The woman arose
from the chair in which she had been
sitting, started toward him and fell at
his feet dead. iThree bullets had lodged
in vital parts. Curry stepped over his
wife's body, walked to the City Hall
station and surrendered.
A FALSE PROPHET.
Yesterday morning Curry determined
to find his wife. Before starting he
purchased a revolver, because, as he
claims, his wife had threatened his life
Jf he should follow her.
FINDS ANOTHER MAX'S HAT.
Because of her ' refusal to return to
their home at 913 Powell street, George
Curry, a car conductor on the Powell
street line, shot and instantly killed
his wife, Daisy Curry, yesterday after
noon in a room oq the third floor at 35
Turk street.
Last May Curry married Miss Daisy
Jones in Oakland. Previous to that
time they had been living together as
husband and wife. Soon, however, the
wife grew tired of the married state
and left him to return to her old haunts
and a life that pleased her better. She
came back to their' home last Sunday
nteht to get some clothing, but would
not tell him where she was living.
Monday morning she again came to the
house, and left her purse lyinpr on the
bed. Unobserved by her, the husband
opened it and found the name Josie
Tripp, 35 Turk street, on a piece of
paper. Another piece of paper bore the
memoranda :'Ed"_or "Fred," and '.'room
