WASHINGTON. May 12. A. B.
Etickney. president of the Chicago-
Great Northern Railway, has filed
with the Senate Committee on Inter
state Commerce a statement in favor
of giving the Interstate Commerce
Commission power to 'fix rates. He
Kays that the commission would be the
most satisfactory arbitrator possible
Speaking of rebates, he says that
"since the injunctions- the traffic di
rectors have stopped paying rebates
on grain shipments, but in lieu there
of have paid elevator fees,- which' ls
iinother way of giving rebates." -. J .
A Government commission, he de
clared, would ' be" untrammeled ' by
competition or a desire. to secure ton
nage for any particular line and
could frame an equitable schedule *
Stickney thought that the commis
tion should be allowed to fix mini
mum as well as maximum rates or dis
criminations could not be prevented
Ue criticized the free pass system
"As an individual rule of action the
law against free passes," he said, "was
Ignored by the Congressmen ~ who
passed it and by, the President who
approved it. and subsequent Congress
men and Presidents, with rare â¢ excep
tions, *have ignored its provisions.

he offered testimony to the ' Govern

"Four weeks ago," said Cassiday to
day, "I went to Mr. Baxter's office and
filed . with/ him two affidavits showing
violations of the interstate commerce
law by the packers. Notwithstanding
that he had instructions from Wash
ington to get what evidence I had, Mr!"
Baxter told me I would not be want
ed. I had positive evidence of 'illegal
acts committed within a year. This
evidence I had secured while working
at Armour's plant. A portion of it
was in the form of labels used by < the
packers to destroy the identity of the
packer sending out meat. Meat which
has been spoiled and returned' to. the
plant without the knowledge of the
Government inspectors is
sent out/under -these labels, . which
bear the name of some firm which has'
no existence. Much of it is rotten and

ing rebates was given to-day before
the Interstate Commerce Commission
here. The testimony was given by H.
Streyckmans. formerly employed by

code words and their meaning, as fol
lows:
La URhsoiceâ Rebate.

Launching â Can make rebate.
La :r3 â Handle rebate matters very carefully.
L&veda â Pay rebates from cash on hand.
Lave&Hc â Rebate must be confidential.
â Interstate Commtrce Commission.
Here there was a ripple of laughter
among the shippers present. The
Interstate Commerce Commissioners
emfled. Streyckmans continued:
Woodprintâ Avoid 'service* of \u25a0 summons from
Jr.'trtiate Commerce Commisdoa.
The laughter grew more audible:'

caused Chairman Clements to rap for

various railroads for icing cars, Mr.
Etreyckmans replied:
"7"ie Northwestern billed ice at Jl
a. ton. That furnished by the Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul was billed at
52 50. with a rebate of $1 being
granted on a counter claim. In the
case of the Erie it was %1 25. This
gave large profits to the Armour
lines."
Showing what he claimed to be dis
crimination among shippers, Streyck
mans declared that Lieutenant Gov
ernor Alden Anderson of California
paid 55 per cent of the tariff rate on
his shipments.
"Among: those who received more
than a 50 per cent rebate." said the
witness, "were Frank H. Buck of San
Francisco, the Erie Fruit Company,
the Porter Bros. Company," the Pro
ducers' F-ruit Company and others.
Those who paid and received less than
a 50 cer cent rebate were Stephens &
Humphreys. S. R. Roper, Schnadel
Bros.. George D. Kellog and others."
He said the net cost of ice to the
Armour car line on the New York Cen-
trai was $2 a ton; on the West Shore
roads 12 50 a ton; on the Baltimore ;
and Ohio $2 50 a. ton; on the Penn
eylvania lines 52 and 12 50 a ton.
Etreyckmans declared that the profits
to the Armour lines on the icings ran
as high as 500 to 600 per cent
"The profits per car on shipments
from California to New York," said
the witness, "were, on an average.

man narÂ«-..d Anderson about an alleged
trespass by the latter, when Sackett
remarked that the land belonged to
him and if any one gave orders as to
who should pass over, it- It should be
himsc-lf. This thoroughly aroused
"White and he drew the same pistol
with which he afterward killed him
self and shot Sackett. Anderson re
moved Saekett to a neighboring house
end notified the authorities.
In the meantime White went home
and began his preparations for. death.
He would have been arrested to-day
had he not taken his own life.
Both men were highly respected and
the community is greatly shocked over
the affair. White left a young wife
tind two children, while Sackett la sur
vived by a widow and several children.
While It is not officially admitted at
the War. Department, the report re
ceived here by telegraph is that the
transport service at San Francisco has
tried to make the Washington head
quarters responsible for the abuses that
\u25a0%re known to have existed. This has
created some feeling. At the War De
partment It' is said, that if specific
charges be filed against the manage
ment of the transport service a
fpecjal investigation will be ordered.
The cost of operating the transports,
while greatly, reduced as. compared
with Spanish-American war times, is
known. to be much greater than was
expected; and. the. reform or abolition
of the service may follow:
WASHINGTON, May 12.â A rule is
about to be adopted by the War De
partment that none but civilian clerks
in the eniplny of the Government and
the wives and children of army ; officers
will be allowed to travel on army trans
ports to aad from the Philippines, as
a result of the abuse of transport priv
ileges resultant from influence brought
to bear on the quartermaster general
here.

climbing a ladder to Join his compan

ing in the Emergency Hospital. As
i soon as daylight " came people were at,
: work setting ready to perform the last

] .Three carloads of coffins arrived duf
! ing the night from Oklahoma City, to
gether with a dozen undertakers from
the convention of undertakers In ;
session there. Workmen also came In
on a special train . furnished by tlie
Frisco Railroad, and the work of burial .
was carried on with the"- utmost dis-'
! Patch. '- ,\u25a0 \u25a0 ,
I During \u25a0. the morning, a heavy â¢ rain
came up and rendered operations dif- '
Hcult. The floor, of the morgue was
covered with water. .Most of the-build-'
ings that remained -standing admitted'
streams of water through the roofs,!
and the temporary* hospital, where the ;
| injured remained, leaked, like a sieve. :
wetting a number of the patients.- The 1
[ rain, which was accompanied by \u25a0\u25a0 some
wind and hail, served to frighten the;
residents, but those Who were able keot;
bravely at work throqgh the' water
â¢and mud, caring for their suffering in-*
t jured and burying their dead.':.* Several \
fof the newly made graves: were 'filled
I with waier.
j :Two more injured were discovered
j under some debris early .in ' the morn
j ing, but neither was idehtifled. ..They
jwere pinioned under a '.house, beam.
I One, a man, was delirious, arid the
(other, a boy,, was unconscious.
I Owing to the failure to keep any
! records at the outset, there haS been
great difficulty In securing an accurate i
, list of the number of dead. In the list j
furnished on Thursday; afternoon but
few alterations have been ; made. The;
two or three bodies that have been ,
found since have hot been identified. :
Responses of a generous nature have
i been made by many cities and towns
in the Territory, several thousand dol
lars' worth of food and clothing;hav
ing been sent in and placed in charge
of the local committee for distribu
tion.
\u25a0 /During the day complaints were
-made to the City Marshal that bodies
of the dead had been robbed by ..van
dals and he issued an ~ order that
badges must be worn ; by every per-
Ison in town. The .order .. was accom
panied by a warning that those who
refused to wear the badges must .go
i to jfi.il or leave. on ;the: first' train. : j
1' The engineering corps, a division, of '
\ the, 'Oklahoma National Guard, V arrived '
r-from La wton during the afternoon and ;
into camp. It is presumed that ;
', the mission of the company -is. to. as
â¢ sist in preserving order,, and protect
j ing property. ; ;.
One of the most remarkable phases
of the disaster is the great percentage :
;of killed or seriously .wounded. There
'were remarkably few minor injuries in
j proportion to the dead, and the killed
j exceed 10 per cent of the total popula
. tion of the town. /The number of dead
; as near as can be ascertained is nine- ',

will then turn their attention .to the
' erection of suitable habitations for the
living, many of ;. whom are now com
pelled to " live practically, with no ' shel
, ter, while buildings that' arer habitable'
j are filled to overflowing. A second-apr
; peal has been sent out by i the local
committee stating that food and; cloth-'
have been received 'in ; abundance,'

; LONDON. May 10.â From Spain !â¢
comes the story of a quaint little liter- j
ary discussion which the Spanish Gov- 1
ernment has been having with 900 cbn- !
victs at Ocana. It has all been apropos
of the celebration in Spain of the ter
centenary of Cervantes, the author of
"Don Quixote." The 900 convicts, who
are inmates of the house of detention
at Ocana. evidently know their- "Don
Quixote" by heart, for they recently
suggested to the Government that it"
would be an appropriate act of clem
ency to mark the tercentenary by giv
ing them their freedom, and quoted a t
passage from Cervantes' masterpiece
in support of their argument. This
passage was that which relates how ;
the Don himself delivered a number of'"
galley-slaves from custody because, as
he remarked to Sancho Panza, "It
seemed to him an act of cruelty to en- ,
slave those whom God and nature had [
made free, and he did' not think it right
that honorable men should be the ex
ecutioners of- their fellow creatures." i
But it the convicts showed : them- i
selves well up In their "Quixote," the .
'authorities proved themselves not less r :
I familiar with. ..the romance. They de- .
I nied the ingenuous request and called.
; the petitioners' attention to the sequel j
of the story, which relates that the j
convicts had no sooner got their liberty
than they turned upon their benefactor
and, to his-great astonishment, robbed
him of all his valuables.
\u25a0ENRICHED BY NOVEL. j
From "Jorn Uhl," the novel which :
has made so great a sensation in Ger- ';
many and which has just been trans- j
lated into English, its author, Gustave !
Frenssen, has received $62,500, which is ;
a record in the Fatherland. Over 180,- '
000 copies of the romance have been ;
sold, and Frenssen is at work on a new i
j novel." which he expects to finish in the
course of the year. Its scene, like that
i of "Jorn Uhl," is laid in its author's
â¢ native Schleswig-Holatein, and the title
I will be "Aus ElnerKleinen StadL" !
After publishing "The Marriage of
1 William Ashe" Mrs. Humphry | Ward
remained in England just long enough '
to see what the reviewers thought of j
her work, and jto attena the rehearsals j
I of her play "Agatha," which Beerbohm j
I Tree produced at a matinee, and then j
i left for Florence with â¢\u25a0 her husband.
j The Wards have now taken a villa,
i called "La Fonteneile," at Careggi,
\u25a0 close to the city of the Medlcis, and
! are planning to live there for several
â¢ months.
WHERE AIiFRED^ IS BURIED.
Americans are to be afforded an op
portunity to contribute to a fund be
ing raised for the preservation and ex
cavation of the site of th 6 ancient j
Hyde Abbey, where the bones of Alfred 1
the Great were interred. The property
has recently been acquired by the city
of Winchester, and a committee, which
Includes the Marquis or Winchester,
has beeni- formed :to . push forward * a
I work ' which, . it is " expected, \ will - bring
to light many- precious relics of the lat
j ter Saxon period.
j The abbey owed its foundation to
(Alfred. He purchased the site with
: the intention of, erecting a monastery
I there, but death overtook him before
. he had time to carry out the work, and
lit was left ito his son, > Edward the
I Elder, to fulfill his wish. Shortly after
j the consecration of the church Alfred's
I remains, which had been given a'tem
porary . resting place at the old church
of St. Swithin, were buried there. Soon
I afterward the body of his wife, Queen
J Aelswith," was interred there. . His two
! sons were also burled there and in sub-
I sequent* years several members of the
! Saxon royal house.
In 1109 the 'site of the abbey was
changed and most of . the royal bones
were transferred /to the- new edifice.
After that the old abbey had a check
ered career. It was finally destroyed'
by King Henry VIII, and over the old
foundations . the county authorities
/erected a Jail in 1788. Now it ' is : pro
j posed to restore these 'foundations in
! as perfect. a. way as possible. .

Albert F. Clarke, an inmate of the
State Insane Asylum at Agnew, ap
plied by mail to United States District
Judge de Haven for a writ of habeas
corpus and the Judge yesterday denied
thse request, giving as a reason that
Clarke had not made the proper show
ing to entitle him to such a writ-
Clarke set forth that he - had never
been produced before any court in the
United States before having been ad
judged insane and committed and he
appealed to the United States court,
believing that he could receive there
the hearing which he had not had in
the State courts.
The handwriting, spelling, wording
and punctuation in the letter show
Clarke to be a man of education, with
a knowledge of legal forma, and to be
entirely sane, so far as . the subject
matter of the letter Is concerned. It
Is believed that Judge de Haven de
nied the application because At: ap
peared that Clarke had not applied to
a State court for a writ and there been
denied.

While the British steamship Heath
dene, Captain W. J. Milburn, was tak
ing on cargo at Long Wharf on the
Oakland side yesterday the careless
handling by a stevedore resulted in
the breaking open of a case of shells
for rapid-fire guns, which are sup
posed to be destined for the Japanese
navy. There were 2500 of these cases
to ba taken aboard and the invoice
bore the designation, "Manufactured
of Metal." It also appeared that the
shipment came from Hamburg.
The crew which had signed for the
voyage was soon muttering, for the
prospect of sailing a contraband car
go through seas bristling with Rus
sian warships was. not to their liking.
The condition of affairs became bo se
rious that Captain Milburn stopped
the loading and came Immediately to
San Francisco to consult with the of
ficials of the Occidental and* Oriental
! Steamship Company, which has char
tered the ship from her owners, J. T.
Lunn &\u25a0 Sons of Newcastle-on-Tyne.
Before leaving the vessel a spokes
man for the crew was appointed, who
waited on and informed the captain
that the seamen would refuse to do
further duty unless some new ar-"
rangements were made. To run the
risk of -Russian capture and the re
; suiting loss of all their personal ef
! tects without any probability of extra
compensation was more than they
cared to stand.
The matter was communicated to
I Joseph S. Spear Jr., surveyor of cus-
I torus, who in turn notified Collector
I Stratton. Investigation was at once ;
! made and it was learned that at the
; same pier, near the Heathdene, anoth-
I er vessel, the Volga, was being loaded
with similar munitions of war ; for the
: use of the Japanese Government.* The
Heathdene came to this port in ballast
from Honolulu. - - ;â¢- -j
DYNAMITE SHELLS, SAYS SPEAR. !
Surveyor Spear made the folio wine
official report to Collector Stratton:
< I have to report Umt there are now being
laden on board the Heathdene, under trans
portation and exportation entry No. â CD, per
railway via New York from Hamburg, tor
KolÂ«. Japan, marked K. M. E. H. H.; 2527

It is very evident that they are no part of
electrical machinery, but the sample is un
questionably a contact explosive dynamite

which may be In some of the aforesaid cases on
board.
' In view of the facts presented, the shipment
I being evidently ammunition apparatus, not
: specifically desisnatsd in . such terms as will j
1 absolutely determine the exact character of .
the - conslgnmtnt, it is deemed that the - ship- I
merit may be in violation of Department of
< Commerce and Labor circular Xo. 30, Bureau
1 of Navigation, of March 26. 1904, as to the ac
; quiescence in the definitions of what may be
! construed to be contraband of war. Respect
i fully, JOSEPH S. SPEAR Jr..
Surveyor of Customs.
One sample accompany inc.
The "one sample accompanying" was
an unloaded shell, brand new, of four j
! inches diameter and about nine inches
I in_length. It was covered with black
j varniEh and was encircled near the
base with a bright copper ring of a
half-inch in width. _
The shells and other munitions were;
manufactured, presumably, at the }
i Krupp' "Works in Germany, and 'were '
j shipped from -Hamburg, thence to New j
York and thence across the Continent â¢
to : San : Francisco "in bond " for im
mediate exportationl
After -refreshing -his ' memory on. in
ternational law, the Collector , an
nounced that. although; the cargo' was
contraband, he was powerless to stop
its exploitation. Belligerents, he:ex
plained, had a right to buy, and neutral
or friendly nations had a right to- sell
munitions of- war and other contra
band. The fitting out of an expedition
or the replenishing of a war vessel was
prohibited, but the mere commercial
handling of contraband of war could
not be interfered with. Of course.
Stratton added, the vessels and ; car
goes are liable to confiscation by either
one of the", belligerents. ,
y CAPTAIX IS 'WORRIED.
The prospect of being captured and
perhaps executed by the Russians was .
very displeasing to the captain" of the
Heathdene, " and he begged 'Collector
1 Stratton. yesterday to make some order
j that might* afford him an' excuse- to
; decline the cargo, but the Collector
was unable to grant the request, and
the captain, with shivering, timbers,
wobbled his way back to the ; Oakland

result, the governing body of the or
ganization, the Teamsters' Joint Coun
cil, will meet to-morrow night to de
cide whether or not the strike shall bÂ«
declared off.
- The decision to call this meeting of
the council followed a two hours* ses
sion between the'offlcials of the Team
sters'TJn'on and the Team Owners*
Association. The, members of the lat
ter" body have all through the present
strike been favorable to the teamsters
rather than to the Employers' Asso
ciation. To-night, however, the team
owners : informed' the teamsters that'
their cause was lost and that the' best
thing they could do was to call off the
strike, and do it at once. The team
sters I demurred, .but' the" team owners
were obdurate, and the meeting of the
council was* set for to-morrow night.
The second ; blow also came, from ths
Teamowners* Association when the res
ignation of John , C Driscoll. Its.
secretary, was tendered and accepted.
Secretary Driscoll has been an official
of the association ' since ! Its inception
several years ago and during the pres
ent strike, has been a potent factor on
the side of the teamsters. .
The third blow. was administered at.
the meeting of the Illinois Manufactur-'
era' Association, which is made up'
from business * men from all parts of
the State. At a secret meeting held
to-night the members of the associa
tion decided that - they would uphold
the cause of the Employers* Associa
tion, which has been conducting '-the
fight against the. strikers, .-and . that
they would do all in their power to
mako the Employers* Association a
permanent institution.

Bylngton Wants to Serre
Grand Jmy Subpena on
Mrs. McCnrfly.
DV*MATE OF AGXEW IS
DENTED HABEAS CORPUS
For several days the mother-in-law
lias been living in seclusion in Marin
County and during that time her.
movements were closely watched by
the authorities. Mrs. McCurdy be
came distressed by their actions, as
she had originally left the Palace to
free herself and daughter from es
pionage. "With great caution and
eecretlveness she returned to San
Francisco again in search of a refuge
place.
No saoner were her plans being car
ried into operation than the Grand
Jury detectives knew . of it and she
\u25a0was traced to her present hiding place
the first day. Collins' presence in the
house and refusal to let Mrs. Mc-
Curdy be seen at the time of District
Attorney Byington's attempt to see
her, only shrnvs the determination â¢with
vhich he intends to fight the case.
It is thought that Collins selected
this Sacramento-street house with es
pecial care, in the hope that it would
afford absolute concealment. He
showed much surprise when he met the
District Attorney, who called there
with a suboesia.
Collins answered the bell yesterday
and asserted on inquiry of Attorney
.Byingron that Mrs. McCurdy â¢was not
staying there. Byington displayed the
eubpena for her to appear in court,
but Collins would not permit him to
enter the house and 6erve it. Collins
finally admitted that Mrs. McCurdy
was in the house, but only agreed
to produce her on condition, that By- |
ington would give his word of honor]
that no attempt would be made jto '
subpena her. This Byington refused
to do and he failed to see Mrs. Mc-
Curdy.
The house at 1118 Sacramento
Ftreet is assessed to D. H- Bidd and he
Esserts that Collins leased it from him
three cays ago. This statement is de
nied by Collins. At a late hour De
tecti\-e Tom Gibson and two - patrol
men "were guarding the liouse to pre
vent the escape of Mrs. McCurdy.
Drastic measures will be resorted to
this morning to serve the subpena on
her.
It is the purpose of District Attor
ney Byir.grton to get an order from
Judge Lewlor this morning authoriz
ing him to force an entrance to
th* hoitse and serve the subpena de
spite the objections that Collins or
JVirs. McCurdy may make-
Full evidence of the case against
Collins is in the hands of the District
Attorney and will be presented to the
â¢ iriiud Jury with s. view to the find
ing of an indictment for bigamy.
Collins has previously stated that
his new mother-in-law would appear
and gH-e her testimony at the trial,
but his reluctance to let her do so
makes the District Attorney think she
may have some valuable and import
ant testimony to impart. Mrs. Char
lotte Collins, the wife whom Collins
now repudiates, will relate her pitiful
story to the. grand jurors and the tes
timony of the remainder: of TthÂ»Â» family
\u25a0will be heard. District Attorney By-
ington declares that he can produce at
least six persons who were - present
\u25a0when George D. Collins married Char
lotte Newman. He has been trying to
locate Father Connolly, the priest who
performed the ceremony, and expects
to have him present when the case Is
taken up..
UÂ£m %Ktmt x^ibearable for Mrs.
ilcCurir. mother-in-law of A-ttomey
GeorÂ»re D. Collins, at her Mill Valley^
residence and, as District Attorney
Byington discovered yesterday after
noon, Â«he has taken ux> her abode in
this city. The District Attorney is try
ins to serve her with a subpena to ap
pear before the Grand Jury this morn-
Ing to testify in the investigation of
the bigamy charge against Collins.
Persevering effort on the part of de
tectives finally resulted in locating
Mrs. McCurdy In a house at 111S Sac
ranerito street.

The largest mining deal in Nevada
County that has recently taken place,
as reported by the local papers, is the
transfer under bond to an Eastern
company of the Erie, Dublin Bay, Mc-
Carthy and Holland Oliver mines. The
purchaser is L. D. Sovereign. The Ne
vada City Union says that the pur
chase price amounts to several hun
dred thousand dollars. Of the Erie,
the Union says:
The Erie is one of the oldest mines in 'the
Granlte%-Me district It lies two miles and a
half from the town and adjoins the California.
On the property are $40.W0 worth of improve
ments, consisting o"f a thirty-btamp mill, large
air compressor, machine drills and other nec
essaries. The North Blooinfleld ditch runs
through the property. .._Â»
The mine ha* betn worked much at odd times
"â¢The rnafn' work has been conducted through
two tunnels. Good milling ore was taken out
of the upper tunnel, hauled by vagon to a
chute and thence run to the mill. This pro-ved
to be too expense and had considerable to ao
with finally closing the mine. The lower tun
nel is in 1400 feet, and along its course much
milling ore has been extracted. Mott of tne
work has been done south of the mam tunnel
in the lower workings. There a drift
some time ago for 600 feet, striking the Erie
chute of ore. At the rat* which the chute Is
running across the country it will be neces
sary to drive the main tunnel a distance or
feet farther before Intersecting this chute.
A raise of 300 feet will then be. run on the
chute to connect with the upper runnel. Tnis
will open up a big section of oew country.
DEVELOPMENTS OX COAST.
The Copper Outlook, in its first
number, tells something about the
size of the Kennett mining camp In
Shasta County. About a year ago the
Mammoth mine, a copper property,
waÂ« sold to an Eastern firm. Since
then $1,000,000 has been expended in
a smelter and other permanent im
provements in the camp. The Outlook
asserts that there are forty business
places at Kennett. These include large
merchandise stores, two hotels and the
usual assortment of other concerns.
In part the story of the growth is as
follow*:
After the discovery of the Uncle Bam Mine,
which flrtt attracted the attention of the out
aide world by its yield of millions of dollars in
gold, came the greater and more permanent
attraction for the Investment of capital, that
of the great copper mine* In thia vicinity,
namely: thÂ« Trinity Copper, Gollnaky. Windy
Camp and B&laklala. Fridar-lÂ»wden, Great
Verde and the Mammoth, all of which, are well
developed mine* with Immense and valuable
ore bodies; one, the Mammoth, now has a
smelter going up. The Trinity and Balaklala
will no doubt commence breaking ground for
smelter sites within the present year; at least
the operations of the owners or managers hÂ«re
indicate as much.
The capital invested by the Mammoth com
pany alone can safely be estimated at a mil
lion and a half of dollars, while that of the
Trinity Copper and Balaklala companies run
up Into the thousands of dollars; then, too,
there is the Investment of Charles Butters in
a large eight-mile canal, which alone can be
estimated at $30,000. and his large two-story
crick building, which coet In the neighborhood
of 515.000. Outside of this the amount ln
vÂ»*ted In thirty-three new residences and buel
nece houses can be put down at a cool $50,000.
Thus within a few months Kennett's .boom
shows upon its face the permanency of a well
built and prosperous town, with a- capital in
vestment therein and In the nearby vicinity of
over two millions of dollars.
The prospect of a stamp mill to
be erected by the Alaska-Perseverance
Company in the Silver Bow. Basin dis
trict, Alaska, has stimulated interest
The plan is to put up 100 stamps at
once and to add 200 stamps later to
the plant. A crosscut has been driven
2500 feet from a level below the sea
and three and a half miles from
the shore, attaining a vertical depth
of 1600 feet. On Douglas Island the
lode has been opened' to a depth of
more than 1000 feet and his been
mined some distance. One block of
ore is reported to have beer* removed
that was 1500 feet long by 600 feet
wide.
One mile north of Yreka the Treka
Basin Gold Mining Company has be
gun to djlg a basin for a dredger.
Operators are opening up the Eel
River coal mine in Mendocino County,
six miles from Covelo.
Reno parties have bought the
Golden Gate mines in Antelope Valley,
Mono County, and will develop, the
property."
A dredger will probably be placed
in the Calaveras River, near Jenny
Lind, by the Turkey Gulch Mining
Company.
Work has been begun by J. H. Lid

The arrival of the railroad was signalised
by. active operations at Bisbee In July, 1880,
and by Increased activity In the Clifton dis
trict, where the Detrort rroup of mines had al
ready been partially developed. The \flrst fur
naces, however, for the treatment of Detroit
company ores were not i blown in I until the
winter of lbSl, tinder William Church's man
agement. Globe also felt the stimulus, the
Old Dominion Company opening up . the . New
York and Chicago mines near the base, of
the Pinal mountains. It was several year*
subsequently before the same company secured
and operated tb/e mines in the immediate
neighborhood of the town of Globe, which since
then have become prominent producers. Tha
United Verde mines at that time were known
to Â«cist, but the nearest railroad station.
Marlcopa, being ISO miles distant, their ac
tive life dates only from the building of the
Atlantic and Pacific across the northern sec

active copper making still represent the only
permanent producers, but air have grown In

period to deprive Montana of the first place,

in 1870, and assumed editorial- control
of the Dally News, which he held about
a year, when he was appointed

VANCOUVER. B. C., May 12â Two
prospectors, brothers, named Kulings,
have been found dead in their cabin
near Three Forks, B. C, under cir
cumstances which point to either mur
der and suicide, or double murder.
One of the bodies lay on the bed with
two terrible gashes in â¢ the head, the
other on the floor with a shotgun
grasped in one hand, the gun being
partly under the body. The door of
the cabin was locked and the glass in
one window was broken. Nothing is
known of any trouble between the
brothers. They were working a claim
in the vicinity of the cabin.

. James Snow,' tall,-, slim,: shaky-kneed
and sable of skin, ascribed i his . unen
viable situation to ; the love god's per
verse tyranny. For while he sighed his |
heart . out in = unrequited adoration of |
one dusky belle another colored maiden
was 'just as vainly angling or re
sponsive soul-thrill on his part.
"Et am eh mos' distressln* kindishuri

"It Is a rather unfprtunate, but by

to appear here next Tuesday, ' t-dld
the Judge, "and then a way out of
your predicament may suggest ! it
self."
"Thank yo* Honnah," i gratefully
murmured Mr. Snow. ;
He was arrested by Patrolman T.

SAN JOSE, May 12. â Albert Bright
man, who shot and killed Mrs.
Charles H. Gurney and then commit
ted suicide at Los Angeles to-day, for
the last two months, was employed in
this city: as a job printer by the firm
of Muirson & Wright. He came here
from San Francisco. Monday he
asked for a vacation to make a trip
to Los Angeles. Brightman frequent
ly spoke of his love affair .to Theodor.e
M. Wright, one of his employers. He
told Wright he was practically en
gaged to Mrs. Gurney when she was
Miss Donna Vincent -and was prepar
ing to wed her and make a home*here.
The first Brightman knew of the girl
breaking the j engagement was when
he received a letter from her mother
saying she had married Gurney. He
took the matter to heart, and de
clared he would go to Los Angeles and
see her, but was persuaded from do
ing so. About a week*ago Brightman
told his employer that he had re
ceived a letter from Mrs. Gurney, in
which she said she was. tired of her
marriage to Gurney. She said, ac
cording to his story, that she still
loved him and asked him to come to
see her. . Brightman was \u25a0of a very
quiet disposition and was well liked
by those who knew him here.
Since Brlghtman'B first proposal of
marriage he had repeatedly urged the
girl to marry him. The mother of
Mrs. Gurney favored the suit of
Brightman, and. It is said, encouraged
him in his attentions prior to the girl's
marriage to Gurney. .
Brightman was 32 years of age and
came to this city from San Jose Thurs
day. In the pockets of Brightman
were found two letters, one addressed
to Charles H. Gurney and the other to
Mrs. Gurney.
KNOWN IN SAN JOSE.
The women arose to their feet as
Brightman reached the steps of the
house. A few words were spoken and
Brightman suddenly drew a revolver
from his pocket and fired point-blank
in Mrs. Gurney's face. The bullet
struck her In the left temple and she
sank to the floor. Brightman then ran
up the street a short distance and
turned into the yard of a house, where,
placing the pistol to his forehead, he
fired another shot, which tore a great
hole in his head and killed him in
stantly. Mrs. Gurney was removed to
the Receiving Hospital, where she died
an hour later. >Â«.;
The killing took place on the front
steps of the residence of Mrs. York at
619 Loomis street, where Mrs. Gurney
was temporarily staying. Brightman
had called at the house yesterday to
see Mrs. Gurney and was informed by
her that she was now married and
that he must desist in his attentions
to her. He left at that time without
any exhibition of malice. While Mrs.
Gurney and Miss York were seated on
the front porch of the house to-day
Brightman came down the street and
approached them. He was seen by
the woman and Mrs. Gurney re
marked, "I must tell him that he must
not come here any more."
SHOT WITHOUT WARNING.
Mrs. Gurney, who was 19" years of
age, was formerly Miss Donna Vin
cent and came here with; her mother
from Minneapolis, Minn., about a year
ago. She became acquainted with
Brightman, who proposed marriage.
Mrs. Vincent declined his offer of mar
riage and six weeks ago married Gur
ney In San Jose.
LOS ANGELES, May 12.â Albert
Brightman, formerly a resident of San
Jose, shot and killed Mrs. Charles H.
Gurney and then committed suicide
here shortly before noon to-day. Un
requited love was the motive for the
deed. Mrs. Gurney was the wife of
Charles H. Gurney, a newspaper . re
porter, who la at present in San Fran
cisco. *
SANTA BARBARA, May 12.â Dr. H.
C. Oatman of San Diego delivered the
principal address at to-day's session of
the California State Homeopathic Med-"
ical Society. He spoke upon the sub
ject of VHyglene and Sanitary Science"
and advocated a more general resort to
cremation as a means of preventing ths
spread of Infectious diseases. Regard-
Ins the possibilities of epidemics from
burial, he referred to the discovery
made at Rio Janeiro, that the soil in
which victims of yellow fevÂ«r had.been
burled for year a was impregnated with
germs apparently Identical with those
of the disease. Th* epidemic of plagua
in Modena In 1323, when .thousands
were stricken, waa the direct result of
opening trenches In which had been.*
burled victims of a scourge occurring
more than a hundred years before.
Dr. Mary A- Stolz of Redlands, Dr.
Guy E. Manning of San Francisco and
William Simpson. Health Officer of
Santa Clara County, also spoke. on the
same subject.
The topic of "Surgery** was discussed
by Drs. E. R. Bryant of San Francisco,
and S. F. Bernard of Los Angeles. -
"Epilepsy" was handled In four pa
pers read by physicians. *
The delegates will remain In Santa
Barbara over to-morrow, visiting the
various places of interest in this sec
tion before returnlngto their homes.
The convention decided to invite the
American Institute to meet In South
ern California In 1907.
San Jose was decided on as the next
place of meeting of the State society.

Early this morning a negro said to

turned from the Missouri penitentiary,
vent to the home of Fred Hess, three
miles below Belmont, and at the point
of a rifle demanded $600. Hess, who

ture, told the negro he did not have
that much money in the house. The
negro ordered him to go to Belmont
and get the money. He compelled Hess
to hitch up a horse and buggy and or
dered him to get in with his wife and
child. The negro then saddled another
horse and mounting it told Hess to
drive toward Belmont, and when near
that place the negro forced Mrs. Hess
and the child to get out of the buggy
end then entered a deserted shanty.
The negro then told Hess to drive to
Belmont and to send the money back
by a negro preacher inside of one hour
or he would kill hie wife and child.
Hess hurried to Belmont and got the
money and Bent it back by a negro
preacher. The desperado immediately
mounted the horse and rode up the
Iron Mountain tracks.

citizens was organized at ones and a
small party followed the negro in a
ewitch engine and discovered that he
had taken refuge in the ewamps
around First Lake. Bloodhounds were

Tvas found in a deserted shanty. He
Teas captured and taken to Belmont by

i BERKELEY, May 13. â Just 'to show
; that theatrical managers and band
directors may not irllle with the Uni
versity of California in the matter of
contracts and go unpunished, the col
>ge anthojities are planning to brim?
suit nirainst Bandmaster Daniel Innes,
the veteran musician, who deliberately
violated his contract to appear in the
Greek Theater yesterday afternoon and
there give a concert in which he had
been advertised to appear.
Three weeks ago the university peo
ple beyan to announce lnnes* forthcom
ing appearance In the Greek Theater,
f ollGTTics action taken by , Professor
William Dallam Armes and limes'
business manager. These two '"men,
representing respectively the uni
versity and - the bandmaster, drew up
and sigied a contract, by the terms cf
which the Innes band, with lnnes at
its head, vras to appear here on May
U. Then the announcements were made
at the university and the advertise
ments appeared in various quarters.
TTnen lnnes came to town, however,
to conduct band concerts at the festival
of song in San Francisco, he gazed at
the contract his manager had signed
with the university men and promptly
ran a line through it, canceling the
document. The university folk were
notified of the bandmaster's act and
informed that there was nothing to do
but accept the bandmaster's regrets.
It arpeared that the college men were
being treated with scant courtesy, and
tha matter was promptly referred \u25a0 to
Chaxlzi E. Snook, attorney for "the
Board of Tiegents, in Oakland, his ad
vice being desired before action was
taken against Bandmaster lnnes to
compel him to pay damages sustained
by the university because of his fail
tire to appear here.
It is said the t Lnnes was piqued be
cause he was to receive only a $200
guarantee, instead of the J9OO that was
paid Sousa when .the "march king"
played at the university, although the
reason he gave for canceling the con
tract was Inability to make. the date."

Are lawyers more. moral than busi
ness men; ordinary men of affairs
than trust magnates; Journalists than
politicians; and so on through the
grades and divisions of so
ciety? asks Collier's. Such ques
tions arise constantly In discus
sion. Formerly the politicians were
blamed exclusively for much bad legis
lation that is now charged in part to
the' business men who influence legis
lation. The role taken by the ablest
lawyers in making legislation ineffec
tive is being more vividly, expounded
than it ever has been before. Our laws
âto take an exampleâ forbid rebates
and. all kinds of discrimination be
tween shippers. The railway men in
general admit the desirability of 'such
law: Yet they, and the shippers, and
the attorneys for both, devote them
selves to discovering devices for out
witting the law. There Is no moral
standard which restrains either law
yers or business men from any secret
practice Intended to help them escape
from laws the passage of which they
favor. The public faces the necessity
of contriving laws so drawn that the
very ablest minds In the country can
invent no trickery to beat them, but
probably public opinion on such mat
ters is being educated by all the ex
periments now being made. The strug
gle for money is losing something rela
tively. and moral standards slowly
make a coresponding gain.

/COMMENT upon the railroad problems of the United States
r may be expected soon from the experts who are attending the
seventh of the international congresses and the first ever held
in America. Some of the most competent and interested of these
men are likely to travel over our country and make a comparative
study of our systems. When they return home they may prepare
papers for publication, or at least crystallize some opinions, which
they will give out to the world. It may be well for us if they are
urged to do so, for our railroad problem is at a crucial staged and
all the light we can get thrown on the subject by comparative
studies will be valuable.
It is also well to see ourselves sometimes as others see us.
We have that most notable example of Bryce making such a good
study of the American commonwealth that it is more read than
any study made by our own statesmen. So among these over
sea railroad managers there may be a man who will get a point of
view of conditions here which will be very impartial and interesting
and help make clear to us how to achieve best progress in changes,
as change we must both in mechanical improvements of railroading
and in the roads' economic relations to the people.
One point on which the comments of these Europeans might be
specially useful is the question of Government control. Foreigners
are more familiar with that phase of railroading than we are. :We
have only one bit of railroad under complete Government control,
namely, the Panama, and that is too young to yield the lessons of
experience. This point, too, is the chiefest of our time, not only
as concerns railroad development, but as to our whole national
polity. It will probably be the next national issue in politics. To
what extent we are to have Government control is undecided, but
it seems the united will of the country that there must be: some
larger amount of regulation than now is. There is a big demand for
the Government to do the rate making and it will be profitable to
the country to have the problem thoroughly discussed by experts
before it passes before the people for discussion on the stump.

But that sort of thing is so much easier than the use of reason
and telling the truth that the newspaper that does it is only one
of a company that abuses the freedom of the press.
A CALIFORNIA paper has found a reason for condemning
the President. After a brief lecture on the equality of all
before the law, it announces that "we have just found out
that the laws of our country are not made for all alike." The paper
then passes to specifications, to this effect: "We see the President
touring in Colorado. We also know that this is the close season
on various kinds of game in that State. We see the President, the
highest in the land, the one supposed to see that the laws arc
obeyed, hunting and killing the game. Let you or I go to Colorado
and kill one bird or animal and we would be arrested and con
victed. Thus you see the law is not made for all alike. The law
is severe on the wrongdoer of the common ranks, but those who
have been called to sit in the place of the high and mighty turn
the law aside with a laugh."
All of this because the President has been hunting only pre
datory animals in Colorado, for which there is no close season there
or anywhere else. The attack on the President is only a manifesta
tion of partisan malevolence. But it has an evil effect reaching as
far as it is read and remains unexplained. It strengthens the evil
purpose of every criminal. It makes criminals of the weak-willed
who may have resisted temptation until .they read that the Presi
dent violates the law at will, then why should not they? It aids
the purpose of every anarchist in the land and nerves the arm of
every murderer of that strange company of assassins. The fact
that it is a lie makes no difference to these, even if they knew it to be
a lie. The man that wrote it has succeeded at one effort in libeling
the President, slandering his country, reducing the respect for law,
encouraging crime and increasing the number of -criminals. He
has made life and property less safe, has given weak-minded juries
an excuse for letting criminals go free, and has weakened moral
restraint. All this to get a very false and contemptible fling at the
President.

*Tr*HE prevalence of cyclones in the East furnishes an almos-
I daily record of death and devastation.- Already the killed
L from Kansas south to the Texas line and east to the Missouri
Kiver number more than 250. The coming of spring in all that
region is full of terror because of these fearful storms. They come
and slay and spend themselves in all the vast area between the
Rocky .Mountains and the Great- Lakes. In the last twenty-five
years several thousand people have been destroyed by them: Their
march is so rapid and their force so awful that nothing can evade
or resist them. The cyclone cellar is common there, but often the
twisting force falls so" suddenly that the people have '. no time to
burrow for protection.
Fires and panics in theaters are awful, and such railrqad wrecks
as that on the Pennsylvania at Harrisburg have a terror of their
own, but there is no scene of death or means of slaughter that ap
proaches in every terrible and appalling feature the path left by
one of these storms. Men and beasts are lifted into the air and
in flight arc impaled by flying boards, to be dropped miles away
from where their flight began. No building has yet been found
strong enough to resist the full force of this kind of storm. As the
country that is infested by cyclones is more densely settled and the
towns increase in population, the risk increases. Great cities like
Chicago and St. Louis are apt any spring or summer day to lie in
the track of these monsters of the air. Should this happen there is
not a skyscraper in Chicago that could stand against the storm. The
soiid foundation and steel skeleton of our tall buildings here resist
any earthquake- There is no known displacement of the surface of
the earth that can topple them over. But a cyclone in, full career
that can impinge upon a round telegraph pole and twist it off, if
given a skyscraper to operate on will reduce it to a heap of dust.
These storms are the despair of science. Nothing can stop
them until their sinister force is spent. They travel from and
toward all points of the compass and nothing can prevail against
them. California is happy in her straight winds and their frequent
diversion by interposing mountain ranges. As for our earthquakes,
they are so insignificant when compared to the airquakes of the
East as to lose interest.
We would advise several hundred thousand of people in the
middle West who are exposed to death by the spring 'airs in their
country to blow this way and enter an atmosphere that does not
commit murder.

when he 'set out

that was before
he took the part

"Why don't you

asked . them on
their last morning
in Havana. ,
"We haven't
any brothers,"
they replied.. .â¢
"Then take
them to the other

said he.

of the girls, "we
wouldn't k n o w
whether the cigars
were good or not.

pick out the

"I'll pick them
out for you," vol
unteered the man.
"I am going to
get my own this
morning. Now.
how many do you

"Oh, fifty for

they ,said as they
gave him . \u25a0 the

quired, "carrying

believed in his superior knowledge. â¢..

violins, in D minor,: with ,'- piano - ac
companiment. It is Bach in his best
mood. It begins in : the \u25a0 usual fugue
form with stately,- almost, pompous
regularity. The andante second'move
ment of elegant limpid J periods was
encored almost to the point of a repeti
tion. The finale is interesting In; Its
variety. It begins with ensemble play
ing with a trick I <&. heightening the
speed in a' passage' already: almost at
the speed, limit, by. a curious introduc
tion of triplets in two-four tempo, then
comes a duo for the two viallns alone,
ending Â»' ln the moet fanciful . legato
arpeggios, followed by a song â¢of ex
quisite beauty for the first violin with
pizzicatti , accompaniment., \ The^ j Bach
number was. so well received that Mr.

The troubles; of Dr. G. R. Hubbell
as the husband of Dr. Harriet H. Hub
bell are at anenrt, for he was granted a
divorce yesterday on the ground of ex
treme cruelty. Judge Hebbard granted
the decree and found that Mrs. Hub
bell had been guilty of unreasonable
espionage upon her husband and her
great Jealousy caused him much men
tal suffering.
Maud C. Potter, whose' husband,
George H. Potter, contested her suit
for divorce, established to the satis
faction of Judge Troutt that he struck
her and otherwise mistreated her â¢ and
6he was granted a decree. Potter was
ordered to pay her $15 a month. The
Potters formerly resided in Hawaii.
Suits for divorce were flled by Grace
Twombly against Ray Twombly for
cruelty and Mabel V. Ware against
Charles R. Ware for willful neglect.
William Heyden, gripman on a Mc-
Allister-street car, who was committed
to Jail by Judge Troutt for refusing
to pay alimony to his wife, Marie Hey
den, pending the determination of her
suit for divorce, made an attempt
yesterday to get out of Jail on a writ
of habeas corpus. Judge Hebbard
heard the writ and promptly denied it,
remanding the delinquent spouse to
the custody of the Sheriff.
Because, she alleges, her husband
hit her on the head with a can of cin
namon, Mrs. Elizabeth Filipelll sued
for divorce yesterday. She says this
assault on the part of her husband,
Giacoma, was accompanied by the
bravado statement on his part that he
was immune from punishment fOT his
act because "a woman cannot be a
witness against her husband." Mrs.
Filipelll further says that on several
occasions her husband threw their sup
per out of the window and otherwise
acted In ah inhuman manner. The
couple have several grown children.
The wife asks for $75 a month ali
mony.
Alleging that her husband was in
sane at the time she married him, Mrs.
V. Hass filed suit yesterday to annul
and* make of no effect the ceremony
that Joined her to E. Hass on Novem
ber 28, 1903. Mrs. Hass says that while
her husband was insane ' at the time
she married him he concealed It so
well that she did not discover his con
dition until some time later.

;; opening night was a success, last
right was a sweep, and to-night â well,
to-night will be a fit climax to the big
gest. ufVair ever attempted by women
In Fan Francisco. Â«

As for the special features of the
night, there was the Egyptian booth,
vlih Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Schroeder,
Mr?. A. \Y. Scott. Miss Evelyn With
rcw, Mrs. Florence Richmond, Mrs. L.
R. Ellen. C. H. Lombard. Jules Mers
felder and Mrs. L.. B. Powers in charge.
Here Delroy and Dr. Betlero, the
pey chics, held forth in the shadow of
th" Sphinx, while sinuous maidens
from the Kile danced the weird dances
of the temple.
Now. &s an antidote to the solemnity
of the mysteries of the Nile was Mrs
Jarley's waxworks, represented by the
following: Miss Bumstad; musician:
Mies Fremstadt, giggling girl; Mrs.
McMasters, Joan of Arc; Mrs. C. Riedy,
"Widow Bedott; "Tat" Riordan of the
Olympic Club, boxer; Eugene Fritz,
Simple Simon; Albert Peters, Sandow;
Miss Alice May. French doll; Miss
Graham, Patti; Nina Frellesem, danc
ing girl; Miss Agnes Marie Xoonan,
Topsy. All the characters were admir
able and sustained with a necessary
painful \u25a0tiffness. The boxer, Sandow
and Topsy were particularly notice
able for their adaptability of delinea
tion. This concession was under the
supervision of the Outdoor. League,
Mrs. Jarley, represented by Miss Whit
aker. and the "property man," by
Dodge Riedy, conducting their puppets
In excellent style.
The daintiness of the ice cream
booth enticed many a stroller by rea
son of its attractiveness, as well as the
lightened temperature and a laudable
desire to help place bricks in the new
clubhouse.
The cardroom. filled with tables, was
tested to its capacity, prizes for bridge
\u25a0whist going to Mrs. Rldeout. Mrs.
Myer, Mrs. Leap and Mr. Harbour.
The five-hundred trophies were borne
away by Mrs. Schwarz, Mrs. "Wolf and
Dr. Wier. ,
The men sought out the Turkish
booth, under the supervision of Mrs.
"VTashington Irving Marion, and â
shocking:â played the machine for
cigars.
Here Fossell. the palmist, revealed
much of hidden lore, under the luring
light, of a ruby lamp. And what think
you? â the men were the heaviest pa
trons.
To-night promises the greatest stunts
of the great three days* festivalâ a
baby show in the afternoon, a baby
show at night, where the babies will
come from grown-up land, and a thou
sand and one things that will make
history for many days to come.
You'd better drop inâ 2s cents to get
in and whatever you please to get out.
The matinee promises a lurid lot of
beautiful stunts for the little ones â
bring them, every one.
And come yourself, good friend, to
night.

COFFEE HEART
Very Plain In Some People.
A rr*at many people go on suffering
from annoying ailments for a long time
before they can get their own consent
to give up the Indulgence from which
their trouble arises.
A gentleman In Brooklyn describes
fcia experience as follows: \u25a0
"I became satisfied some months ago
tbat I owed the palpitation of the
heart, from which I suffered almost
dally, to the use of coffee (I had been
a coffee drinker for thirty yeara), but I
found it very hard to give up the bev-
erage.
"I realized that I must give up the
. harmful indulgence in coffee, but I felt
the necessity for a hot table drink, and
as tea is not to my liking I was at a
loss for a while what to do.
"One day I ran across a very sensible
and straightforward presentation of the
claims of Postum Food Coffee and was
so impressed thereby. that I concluded
to give it a trial. My experience with It
was unsatisfactory till I learned how It
ought to be preparedâ by thorough
boiling: for not less than fifteen or
twenty minutes. After I learneif- that
lesson there was no trouble.^ Poetum
Food Coffee proved to be a most pala-
table and" satisfactory hot beverage,
and I have used It ever since.
"The effect on my health has been
most salutary. It has completely cured
the heart palpitation from which I used
to suffer bo much, particularly 1 after
breakfast, and I never have a return of
It except when I dine or lunch* away
from hom<? and am compelled to drink
the old kind of coffee because 1 Postum
is not served. I find that Postum Food
Coffee cheers and Invigorates, while It
produces no harmful stimulation."
Name given by Postum Co., Battle
Creek, Mich.
There's a reason.
, Ten days' trial proves an eye-opener
to many.

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
In some instances tne seven purvey
ors in prices at Kenilworth Park, Peta
luma, give a display of generosity ob
served on no other track in the coun
try. Three favorites stepped over the
line. first yesterday and. the odds laid
about Freesias, winner of the closing
event, were .ridiculously extravagant.
The mare figured a legitimate 8 to 5
chance on paper, and the layers hung
out 6 to 1. It looked such an absurdly
long quotation that many a person in
the big crowd with only enough in
his pantaloons to purchase a i yellow
legged* chicken sandwich, defied starv
ation and separated -himself from the
coin. Played down to 12 to 5,' Freesias,
well ridden by Frank Sullivan, -beat
Crigli out in a mild drive.
Just enough long shots came home
first to lend a' ripe, mellow flavor to
the sport. Old Joe Frey went from 3
to 2 to 4 and' skylarked with his com
pany in the curtain-raiser. Utterly
despised and neglected, Miss Powell
sneaked up and defeated the heavily
supported Rubiana in the fourth, with
30 to 1 chalked against her. Willie
Holmes dropped down unexpectedly
with the 6 to 1 chance. Col. Van, in
the first mile selling affair. I
Philosopher Harry Stover, ' proprietor
of Kenilworth Park, was a very busy
man during- the earlier days of the
meet. He was here," there and every
where. Now tacking on a loose fence
board, then handling a harrow team
with a jerk line, a second later stalling
off a delegation of bidders for the
frisking privilege; next busily engaged
writing out conditions for a $100 top
and bottom selling race for horses that
had never been given a' dynamite cap
sule, only to "be interrupted ' to make
short change for the crap game or open
a can of peas for the clubhouse res
taurant. Harry now has a bit of leis
ure time and his horses are rounding
to, Joe Frey being the -first to capture
a. purse with his colors up.

ST. LrOUIS, May 12.â Although two
favorites "\u25a0\u25a0 and well-played second
choices were numbered among - the
winners to-day at the B*alr Grounds,
the day was one of disaster, save for
the wise men of thÂ« game. Starting
with the victory of \u25a0 a 30 to 1 shot in
the opening race "and closing with a
terrific finish .in. "the last, when "Jockey
Cochran fought off a challenging horse
with his whip, 'the day was" tilled with
incidents. The feature : race, a 'six
furlong dash, resulted in a victory for
Otto Stifel, which wagfavorlte for* the
race part of the time. He divided hon
ors with Fireball the remainder, of the
betting period. .Summary: .\u25a0â¢..\u25a0 ;.
BBLMONT PARK. May 12.â
JacQuln. at 6 to 1. backed down to
2 to 1, barely, lasted lons enough
to-day to defeat the 20 to 1 shot.
Buttling, -with Race King and Spark
ling Star close up. The latter were
co nearly on even terms It was difficult
to separate them.
It was the New Rochelle handicap
Jacquin won for his owner, whose
pleasure was shared by a notable
group of sporting . politicians, led by
Congressman Timothy D. SulUvan.
The stake was worth $1700 to the
\u25a0winner. Jacquin Is trained by Frank
"Weir tor David Johnson. William
Lakeland formerly trained the colt,
but asked Johnson as a favor to put
him in some other stable. "He's not
much of a horse," said his owner, who
possibly thinks different now. Sum

said : "Complaints are , still ; - coming in,

to have played havoc with the crop.- The feel

BRIEF CITY NEWS.
GAELIC CHORAIi SOCIETY
WILL GIVE A MUSICAL
The Finance Committee of the San
Francisco Republican League met ' at
636 Market street Thursday evening and
elected William R. Wheeler chairman.
Day before yesterday . George D. Clark,
president -of the, league, . appointed -a
committee of forty citizens. He is grat
ified by the number of acceptances re-;
ceived. It j was said at headquarters
last night that only L three declinations
had been received. The ability of the
organization to raise all the ( money
necessary , for an efficient and active
campaign is not doubted.
A meeting of the executive committee
last night was attended ' by,. George D.
Clark, D. A; Ryan, Fairfax ; H.:.Whee
lan, Richard J. Welch, John D. Daly,
John Lackmann and E. -J. Bowes.
The most important work on the
league's calendar is the selection of
Assembly District committees. Next
Monday evening representative citizens
of the Twenty-eighth and: Twenty
ninth districts will visit; headquarters
of the league to discuss proposed ap
pointments. Efforts will be made 'to
harmonize conflicting elements in ; the
various districts to the end of bringing
all good citizens into line to reinforce
the movement \u25a0 for better = and cleaner
government of "the city. Many acces
sions to the league membership .are
daily registered. Two or. three weeks'
time may be required. to. complete the
detail work of district organization. I .
United States Senator Frank P.
Flint arrived in the metropolis yes
terday from Los Angeles and regis
tered at the Palace Hotel. He has ac
cepted an invitation of the Chamber
of Commerce of Eureka to visit Hum
boldt County and will leave for the
north to-morrow. All the members
of the California Congressional dele
gation were invited. . Senator Perkins
was impelled to decline on the
ground that he had made an engage
ment previously to address a body, of
Knights Templar in this region of the
State. Representatives Needham,
Kahn, Hayes and McKinlay may be
able to accompany Senator Flint. Rep
resentative - Knowland cannot adjust
his engagements here in order to visit
Eureka at the time designated.
It is probable that Senators Per
kins and Flint will exchange views
touching Federal patronage before the
latter returns to his home in Los An
geles. It Is common gossip in politi
cal circles that the present regime of
Federal office holders in San Fran
cisco will serve for a considerable
length of time.
The friends of General George
Stone were gratified yesterday to hear
that the Department Encampment of
the Grand Army of the Republic had
indorsed him for the high honor of
national commander in chief. There
are indications that the Pacific Coast
representatives in the next National
Encampment at Denver will line up
for Stone. .-Â«.;

he an excellent object lesson for others
who are being watched on suspicion of
committing similar offenses. Judge
Strong .of Calpella has fined John Day
$25 for having deer meat in his pos
session. Joseph Poma has been fined
$25 by Judge Magee of San Rafael for
