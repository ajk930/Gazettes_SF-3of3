DENVER. Dec, 10.â Too proud to accept
%. position" on the Santa Fe Railroad,
where his brother. A- E. Kenna, is first
vice president, John Kenna was seriously
hurt at Burnham yesterday while work-
Ing with a section gang on the Denver
&nd Rio Grande. When removed to St.
Joseph's Hospital an examination of his
terribly crushed left foot and leg led the ,
eurgeons to believe that the accident, be- ;
cause of his age, M years, will result
fatally.
For several months Kenna has been as
cistant foreman of a section crew > work
ing on the Denver and Rio Grande Rail
road near Burnham. He attempted to
cross the tracks in front of a switch en-
Cine yesterday, but was run down,* and
his left foot and leg were crushed be
neath the wheels.
Kenna came to Colorado several â¢ years
aÂ«o from Holyoke, Mass., the family
home, and engaged in mining. He was
well-to-do, but lost his fortune, and since
then has been working as a day laborer.
He is sale* to have declined all offers of
help from wealthy and Influential mem
bers of his family and to have started at
the bottom of railroad work, hoping to
recover his lest social position through \u25a0
his own efforts. I

DARK OUTLOOK
FOR BUILDING
FOR NEXT YEAR
Big Strike May Chepk
the Industry in
Many Cities.
Special- Dispatch to ThÂ£ Call
NEW YORK. Dec. 10.â Real estate men
and contractors are much worried over
the present trouble In.' the building in
dustry. These men have planned a pros
perous building season for 1906. Trouble
during the last month In the trade, how
ever, has made them believe that unless
the matter is speedily settled 'the coming
year will be more disastrous than that
of three years ago. Then building was
tied up during the entire summer which
involved a loss of $70,000,000 to employers
and *30,000,000 in wages to workers. ,
The present trouble Is, due to the fact
that twenty-five non-union men are em
ployed by the Empire Company, which
Is connected with the American Bridge
Company at McKeesport, Pa. Because
these men were, not discharged, members
of the - International Bridge and Struc
tural 'Iron Workers through their: presi
dent, Frank M. Ryan,' ordered strikes
throughout the county on every building
in which the American Bridge Company
was in any way interested. This failed
to bring the : American Bridge Company
â¢to terms, whereupon Ryan ordered
strikes against all Post and McCord con
tracts, claiming that they were connected
with the American Bridge Company, and
as a result every structural Iron worker
quit, work, thus tying up more than
thirty buildings in the course of con
struction by Post and McCord, who deny
any connection with the American Bridge
Company. \
The strikers were ordered to return to
work and lay. their grievances -before the
board. ; but they declined to do so. * They,
were then read out of s the: arbitration
board ' and will . no longer be \u25a0 recognized
by the employers as a 1a 1 union. Hereafter
when they seek, employment they must
do so tinder the "open shop", plan.
A/general .strike; against -the Building'
Trades Employers'" Association, would
affect many cities. It would throw; 30,000
iron .workers out -of employment and in- ;
directly more than 200,000 workers . . in
other, trades. ?Â§&&!$&Â£&

the effect . that .Mrs. iGurnett, whose sis
ter he; bad . frequently v employed^. as a
seamstress; -came to his shop .last night,
shortly after, B o'clock,; slightly- under the
Influence of :,. liquor,-- and, after. - talking
with him for some -time,' suddenly, fell
from her chair to the. floor,' insensible."
The negro -said Ihe had tried : \ to re
vive her, but failing:,. had placed a coat
under her head and waited for her; to
regain consciousness. ' When asked by
Detective Frank : Lynch,' .who was de
tailed on the case, why .he,; had not
called a doctor. Morton said he-feared
the notoriety if the woman -were taken
from his place to the \u25a0hospit.il, and; had
supposed that she was simply in stupor
and would become all-right in: a. short
time. Asked why he had refused .to
allow his sister to enter the. shop when
she came to the place in the morning'
he hesitated, and then declared that he
did not . want " her to find, th*;- body of
the woman there.'
-Officer McSorley: when he arrived at the
tailor shop found the body of I Mrs. Gur
nett stretched on the ; floor, in a position
that indicated she hadneither^fallen from
a chair nor been laid down in -a; gentle
manner. Mrs. Gurnett, who was divorced
from her husband, Byron Gurnett, last
April, was 1 the daughter of" Mrs. \u25a0 Julia
Donohue, , who . resides at 1261_Kirkham
street. Mrs. . Gurnett had been' living with
her mother and sisters. When the detec
tives went .to the \u0084Donohue- home ::this
morning' they were, informed -that {Mrs.
Gurnett had for some time been a victim
of heart trouble, and as this seemed to
bear out .the story of the negro his^ex
planation was accepted by the police, but,
he was held : pending the' autopsy. - It was
performed to-night' by Drs. O. D. ' Hamlin,
George Relnle and Carl Curdts. \u25a0.
; The surgeons declared '\u25a0 ., that -death
was undoubtedly ".due to - asphyxia
tion, but- just .what method was
used- to -: cause her death; the
surgeons were ' unable .to i stated. They said

Special Dissatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Dec. 10.â Thousands of
people who visited the New York Zoologi
cal Park to-day were saddened 'by the
death of little -Zalo, the young and am
bitious pup . of the sea lion tank. Pinni-'
pedia, the boss and chief bull of the herd,
lay in the sun and nursed ugly _wounds
on . his : scarred old neck. He seemed to
take special delight in the knowledge that
another young; pdp had come up against
him, '; challenged him to mortal combat,
and. had died like a fichter. /,
The story of Zalo, whose limp body was
fished out of the sea lion tank. Is a
common demonstration of tha survival of
the strongest, " Zalo was born on San
Miguel 'Island in the Pacific and was
brought to the Zoo while still too young
to attract : tha attention of the old bull
of the : herd.'
s ; Zalo, grown to ; a . husky lion of 170
pounds, "came, out of "the stone house on
Saturday, morning as sleek and agile as
a young warrior going to his first joust.
Old "Pinni," - blinking . and , showing his
teeth, lay. on the stone "coping across the
pool. The* whole* herd came out; to see.
the fight. With one look at his old moth
er huddled against the fence, Zalo went
boldly to the f ray.' . ; His . first onslaught
tore the veteran of a hundred ibattles"
from the' : coping and flung, him ignomi
niously Into the water. Zalo was more
active, but old "Pinni" had longer teeth.
j For^hours" the .battle raged.. The water
was " colored crimson. The females barked. .
Once or twice" Zalo's mother essayed to
join in the battle. â¢ but she was too . old
and* she- slunk backv whining. . _
\u25a0 = Once Zalo got ; his , firm ] young teeth
deeply : fixed , in . the neck fof ' the . old bull
and , would; have \"strangled : him, : j but his
teeth .were short . arid his strength in
adequate. < "Pinni" fixed . his '=, teeth , in the
neck of - the youngster^ and it was all
over. : There was one spasmodic -tussle,
and : the ! . lithe :* young " fighter : ", fell ' away
weak -arid "bleeding. He ; swam., to the
farther; side": of; the pool," .where he tiied
desperately to climb (out to " the coping.
His - mother,- swam.around. around â¢\u25a0 him, '^barking
frantically, . but . Zalo sank , to \ the bottom,
a dead ; and V beaten j warrior.

leading to the beadauarters of the Coun
cil, in Largo via street. Having barred the
approaches.' a force of troops and polieu
surrounded the building, after.. which se-
I cret service listen rushed in and seised
i Krustaleff. The latter made no resist
ance and the affair was conducted quick
ly. It was impossible for Krustaleff to
I conceal the papers of the organization.
in which the police evidently expected
to find evidence proving the ultimate ob
ject to be an armed rising against the
Government.
TWO STRIKERS KILLED.
A disturbance in which two strikers
were killed and a policeman and several
others wounded occurred at the same
hour. Immediately in front of the general
postofflce. The strikers for two days have
been seeking to persuade the volunteer
and regular Â» carriers ,to refuse to work.
At the door of the building to-day, tha
strikers, enraged by the refusal of the
volunteers to quit, drew knives, where
upon a carrier attempted to defend him
self with a revolver. Both the carrier
and a companion were killed on the spot.
A squad of policemen was stood off by
the strikers and workmen who sympa
thized with them. Both sides exchanged
a fierce -fusillade, during which a po
â¢ Hceraan and several workmen were
wounded.
As,. the strikers were withdrawing, a
Cossack patrol came* galloping to the
rescue. One of the strikers turned and
threw an Imitation bomb and the Cos
| sacks wheeled, in order to avoid what
they presumed to be a deadly missile.
1 The crowd managed to get into an open
â¢ courtway.' close to the door and escaped.
GENERAL STRIKE PROBABLE.
i The news of the t arrest of Krustaleff
! caused a tremendous sensation among
the workmen. All the Socialist, labor
and kindred organizations held a meet
ing to-night, % at which inflammatory
speeches are, being made in denunciation
of the . Government, and all urged : a gen
eral strike In' order to save their leader.'
Krustaleff,' as he is called, though that
Is not his name. Is regarded as the brain*
of .the revolutionary ..movement. He has
displayed 'genius -, in organizing both the
Industrial and the political strikes which
have terrorized the Government.- His
offer of financial \u25a0 support to the telegra
phers 'yesterday prevented~a collapse, of
their strike. .
In some quarters it i 3 believed that

MORE THAN

IMMIGRANTS
Invasion of Aliens Shown
for the Year by Eeport
of Commissioner General
Sargent of the Bureau
INFLUX PBESENTS
SEKIOUS PKOBLEM
Difficulty Encountered in
the Enforcement of the
. Contract Labor Law by
Officials of Department
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.â In presenting
th<j annual report of the Bureau of Im
migration, Commissioner General Sargent
refers to the magnitude and gravity of
the problems presented by the growth of
the alien population in the United States.
"These problems," he declares, "loom
tip so largely In the prospect of our coun
try -.hat. lt may be said, without giving
just cause to charge exaggeration, that
m. '.'. other Questions of public economy re
lating to ihinfis rather than to human
tteingy shrink into comparative insignili
cancc*"
The total of alien arrivals reported for
the year cf 1/BS.cn represents an increase
over the preceding year of 213.C5. At the
â¢nsu!ar rÂ»orts the increase was 2M9, al
though the arrivals at Porto Rico were
less by ninety-four than in 1&04. There
'also was a large increase in arrivals at
Southern ports, while a decrease Is shown
lor the Pacific ports, which is accounted
for In some measure by the Ru?sian-
Japanese war.
" Of the increased arrivals above referred
to, Austria-Hung-ary sent 05,537 over its
â¢juota of 11)04; Russia. 83,75f>: Italy, 2.5.153,
did the Gutted Kingdom, 49.544. This in
rrp&se from the last mentioned country,
pays the Commissioner, is somewhat off
set by the decreases from Germany, '
Switzerland and Sweden. Notwithstand
ing the Increase from Italy, that country. .
:Â»ays the Commissioner, may be regarded
as having probably reached the high
water mark. From this showing; Com
missioner Sarsent ventures the predic
tion that the chief sources of future in
creases in immigration are those two in
Europe which have the greatest resources j
in population â Russia and Austria-Hun- I
gary.
"With the facts in view," he says, "it
will be possible to calculate with reason
able certainty on the character of immi
gration in its greater bulk for some y^ars
to come â at least of European immigra
tion."
Commissioner Sargent does not lose
?ight of the increased number of immi
grants from European Turkey, a field
which, although practically inexhausti
ble, he 'says, is virgin to the activities of
the transportation agent.
.The importance of a proper understand- <
Ing of the contract labor law is dwelt
jjpon In th^ report. No feature of the
immigration law, he declares, has proved
bo difficult of enforcement as that which
was passed for the protection of labor in
this country from unfair competition by !
aliens. The chief obstacle in the way of i
fuc!i enforcement, he attributes to the
erroneous impression that it is a meas
ure wrung from Congress against its will
by the powers of organized labor exact
j ing all it could obtain, rather than seek
ing simple justice.
This impression is so widely prevalent,
he says, that it produces at least an in
difference to the enforcement of the law.
If not a hostile bias against it, and cred
its the law-makins branch of the Gov
ernment with no worthier motive for
enacting it than selfish fear. Because ot
such impression, he declares, the bureau
finds its efforts to enforce the law either
reluctantly submitted to or resisted, ac
tively or passively, and Itself viewed as In
rome sort a branch or agency of or
panized labor, sensitive to that body's

. vidual members congenial posts. They
'express the conviction s.hat such a
{ Cabinet will inspire confidence, both
'at home and abroad.
The names of Herbert Henry Aequith,
' Sir Edward GXay and Richard Haldane
1 alone, it is held, will give great weight
I to the Ministry .and insure that there
j will be no revival of Gladstonian home
j rule, despite the fact that the Cabinet
i contains a preponderance of those favor
lable to home rule.
The Conservative organs point out that
j the most enthusiastic home ruler, John
Morlcy. has been sent to the Indian Of
j flee, where he will have little influence
! on internal politics.
â¢ The omission of Lord Rosebery is nat-
J urally the subject of much comment and
1 there is considerable curiosity as to what
! attitude he will adopt when he addresses
j the Liberal League \u25a0 to-day. It is notice
] able that his son-in-law, the Earl of
1 Crt-we, is in the Cabinet.
The composition of the Cabinet presents
mo surprising features. It is larger than
was expected, the last Liberal Cabinet
numberhiir only sixteen members. Six
of the new Secretaries, besides Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman, have held Cabinet
rank before," though most of them have
held Ministerial appointments, while three
âDavid Lloyd (leorge, Augustine Birrell
and John Burnsâ have never before held
office of any kind.
The rapid rise of John Burns from the
workshop to the Cabinet, with a salary
j of $10,009 a year, is a unique feature in- i
I dicatin.s: the growing importance of the
I Radical party, and he is being congratu
j lated on all side 3 on winning a weli
1 deserved honor. He will be the first
I labor member of the House of Commons
I to have attained Cabinet rank.
Perhaps the most popular appointment
of all is thai, of Sir Edward Gray, who. j
after Lord Rosebery, has the highest
reputation for statesmanship. He is ex
! pected to hold to the best traditions of
1 Great Britain's foreign policy and to in
spire confidence abroad.
Augustine 'Birrell is not a member of
Parliament, but it is expected that he
will be elected for Bristol almost imme
diately.
*IR CHARLES DILKE OVERLOOKED.
Among the unexpected appointments
are those of John Sinclair and Lewis
Vernon Harcourt. The former has had
much military experience and has been
a parliamentary whip and secretary to
Sir Henry Campbtll-Bannerman. Har
court is very popular in # soc!ety. Baron
Tweedmouth will lead in the House of
Lords, thus succeeding Earl Spencer,
who is ill.
Appointments to minor offices are ex
pected to be announced within a few
days.
The omission of Sir Charles Dilke from
the Ministry is much commented upon \u25a0
by the Daily Telegraph, which says In I
an editorial /that it does not desire to re
open wounds that should have been
healed years ago, but reminds the Lib
erals that they were glad to avail them
selves of the services of Sir, Charles
while they were out of office, inviting
him to lead the debates on Foreign On%ce
questions, eic.
"To have ostracized Sir Charles Dilke
altogether," the Daily Telegraph add?,
"would have been narrow-minded and
bigoted, but to utilize his great services
in the opposition and shut the door of
the Cabinet In his face, is at , once
i cowardly and hypocritical."

Giant Shot-Putter Says His
Present . Predicament Is
Due to Desire to Earn His
Own Living With His Pen
RALPH ROSE
MODESTO, Dec. 10.â My, arrest is all; a
mistake. I went to Portland after I left
the University of Michigan. While there
I made up my mind to make my own
in the world and not depend upon ray
father. I had a little knack for writing,
so 1 corresponded with an Eastern maga
zine, and It commissioned me to write a
series of hobo life in the West if they
were realistic. I expect they counted
upon my name more than the excellence
of anything I would write. The idea
struck me right, und I thought I would
hit the road for a while, so that I would
be able to give the stories the tinge of
realism desired. I came down from Port
land by the boxcar route, chumming with
the regular tramps, putting up at their
camp 3, and learnings their vernacular. It
was a . pretty good lark for me, too. I
know lots of college men who think it no
disgrace to beat their way on" the trains,
in fact, lots of them have done so to'get
home after college.
"Finally I got down into Central Cali
fornia. Here I thought I would go over
into Stanislaus County and work for my
father, who owns some land' there. Tur
lock, I believe the name of the place is.
I took the Owl train at Tracy last'
Wednesday evening, but' instead of going
on tho line for Turlock I tcJok the other
track, and when I arrived at Newman I
got off, not to go farther out of my way.
I had paid my. way and was standing in
the vestibule when the train stopped. I
stepped off the train at once. Just as I
stepped off the train three or four other
fellows came alonsr, and I was arrested
with the bunch. The officer said I .was
"run in" for vagrancy. I guess .. that
officer was thinking about his fee about
that time, for he would not take me to
the conductor to see if I had not been a
passenger on the train. I was put; in
the Newman calaboose with three hobos
and then brought here "to Modesto.-. -;"
Judging from the questions which have
been asked me, the officers here think I
had something to do with the robbery of
a freight car at NewmanTThat could not
be so, for all the time I was at Newman
\I was in Jail. \ ;
\u25a0j I would have been all right at Michi
1 gan University, if that story â¢ that I
wanted to fight Jeffries had; not pot out:
about me. That yarn was made out of :
whole cloth by a Chicago sporting' writer. !
I never even- suggested such a thing to j
my most intimate friends.
Ralph Rose, the California athlete, fa
mous as the holder of the world's shot
put record and for his feats at the Uni
versity of Michigan, who is under arrest
as a common hobo in the. county jail in j
this county, and who will be tried for ;
breaking into a box car, wrote the fore- i
going statement in his cell in the Stanis
laus County Jail for The Call. *
The story of the Stanislaus officers dif
fers slightly from that told by Rose.
According to the officers, Rose and three
other men were arrested Wednesday in
Newman for beating, their way on the
Owl. They were' given a "floater" (an
order to leave town) by Justice Walden
at Newman, but they- did not j leave and
were again arrested. In the; meantime a i
sealed box car , had been broken into !
there, and the four tramps were held on
suspicion of being implicated in the bur- 1
CANAL MEASURE
BEFORE SENATE
Bill Calling for Emergency
Appropriation May Be Put
Through During tlie Week
jqKECAST OF CONGKESS
Not Probable Upper House
Will Adjourn Because of
the Death of Mitchell
WASHINGTON. Dec. -J.â The first im
portant measure which will "receive the
attention of the Senate will be the Pan
ama canal emergency appropriation bill,
and its consideration will begin this week.
Some Senators predict that it will become
a law before the 'close of the week, but
others have . expressed the opinion that
final ' actioy will be deferred until the
week following. There will be no effort to
prevent the passage" of the bill in : some
shape, but there â¢ will : be some opposition
to the proposed restoration of. $5,500,000
subtracted by the' House from the amount
to be appropriated.
The general expectation is there, will
be comparatively little additional, legisla
tion before; the Christmas holidays. .Sev
eral other 'measures will be vigorously
pressed during ; the session, but with the
exception of the merchant marine bill the
sponsors of the 'bills do : not count upon
getting early I consideration. Senator. Gal
llnger ;will': call up the merchant- marine
bill at the first opportunity and is j hope
ful that debate will not be long delayed. |
No one counts upon getting even a re
port from committees on tha railroad
rate bill until some* time" after the holi-;
days. The; three measures mentioned are
considered the' most' Important that;' will
come before the Senate this, session, and
they will . receive much " attention until
they are finally disposed of.
The consideration; by -the Senate of the
joint statehood bill and bill for the
reduction of the duty on Philippine im
â¢portations into the .., United States will
necessarily be postponed until after .the
holidays. No one now expects any effort
to modify the tariff unless in the direc
tion of Senator Lodge's bill providing for
a maximum and, minimum, rate. The
Massachusetts Senator regards the propoi
sition with much favor and will press it
strenuously if he receives any encourage
ment to do so; . \u25a0 . * .'; .
Senator Mitchell's death will be an
nounced by Senator Fulton â¢ to-morrow,
but it is not probable that the announce
ment will causa an adjournment of the
Senate.
Speaker Cannon will announce tho
committees of the House to-morrow. This
will 'practically complete the organization
of the' popular branch of the Fifty-ninth
Congress.- The committees appointed will
meet during the week for organization,'
the appointment of sub-committees and
the assignment to them of pending meas

'While such a programme undoubtedly
would- receive the sympathy of that
section of the population which desires
the restoration of order aboveevery
thing, especially of the business inter
ests, like the manufacturers of St.
Petersburg, who" yesterday passed a
resolution, in; favor of prosecuting \u25a0 the
agitators to the full extent of the law,

such a policy would be -suicidal j and j
would , be sure to bring in its wake re

Many persons believe that Count de

and that -when he goes he will leave

Nevertheless : the. Count's failure to
accomplish something tangible "has
caused him to lose rground steadily in

failure and urging that it will be im
possible to restore; public confidence
until power has paÃsed to the hands of

LIGHTSHIP
HELPLESS
FAR AT SEA
At Mercy of Storm
in a Leaking
Condition.
NEWPORT, R. Li, Dec. 10.â While the
Kantucket South Shoal Lightship No. 53,
chained to a spot far out in the Atlantic,
was plunging about to-day in the se
verest storm so far this season, a leak
was discovered in the fireroom compart
ments which let in the water so steadily
that when wireless communication ceased
at 3:30 o'clock this afternoon the fires
had been extinruished and the vessel
v.as helpless.
As the lightship, which is a relief ves
sel, and which went, on the station only
f.ve days ago. Is equipped with five water
tight compartments, it Is believed to
night by the lighthouse officials that she
will survive the gale. Nevertheless, every
effort was made to go to her assistance.
As the sea was verr heavy off shore and
none but the stoutest vessels could be
used, it was found that the gunboat Hist
v. as the only one available in port here.
Just as she was about to leave the slip
her steerinz gear gave out.
It was learned, however, that the Ught
liouse officials In Boston had arranged
to dispatch the lighthouse tender Azalea
from New Bedford, and it was expected
that she would reach the vicinity of the
iightEhip before morning.
Lighthouse officials, while admitting
that they were somewhat anxious regard
ing the lightship, pointed out that her
compartments should be able to keep the
vessel afloat, even with one of them filled,
for a considerable length of time. It was
also pointed -out that the shift of the
wind fo the northwest usually has the
tendency of smoothing: the sea in the vi
cinity of the lightship.
The Nantucket lightship Is anchored
forty-two miles out. She has for many
years been the turning point of steam
ships bound to Liverpool and New York,
and within the past four or five years has
been equipped with wireless telegraph.
She Is commanded by Captain Gorgispn
and carries a crew consisting of two pn
gireers and elsht men.
She also has on board three wireless
operators attached to the navy. /They
are Russell Fairbanks, chief electrician:
Charles Blankenshlp, electrician of the
first clasp, and William E. Snyder. electri
cian of the second class. Her first officer
is George Acorn of Boston, her engineer

Kmergrency Hospital, Mrs. L,ulu Casey Is

while Jit home on Jessie street is a mass
of smoldering asliâ¬;s, and several houses
in the. neighborhood of Mission and
Seventh ' streets: raise their charred
frame- work toward the sky, the resuft df
a fire full of accidents, rescues and
thrilling: incidents. Mrs. Casey's husband,
Charles Casey, a painter, escaped unin
jured and it_was after a drunken brawl
between tho two that the fire broke out
yesterday afternoon. The husband, not
yet recovered from an all night spree,
was unable to explain his desertion of
the woman. The fire started in a room
occupied by the Caseys at 611% Jessie
street, near Seventh.
Heroic rescues by the lodgers jj in the
house at 611% Jessie street, where t"Ke
Caseys lived, and hard and dangerous
work on the part of the firemen pre
vented greater loss of life and further
spread of the flames. Robert Willis, a
painter, who lives on the floor above the
Caseys. rushed into the latter's apart
ments, then a seething mass of flames,
seized the prostrate woman,. about whom
small tongues of flre were playing, and
bore her to the street. In doing so
Willis himself .was burned and was given
treatment at the hospital.
According to the neighbors, the occu
pants of the lodging house where the
Careys live are frequently engaged in
drunken brawls. Joe Goldblatt of 1063
Howard street said that Casey "came to
hlni early in the morning for money with
which to buy beer, and that all night
and throughout the morning the couple
were drinking heavily.
In the apartment of the. Caseys there
wag a gas stove, about which were piled
a quantity of rags and old 'papers. In
some way these were ignited and the fire
was soon raging through the building.
Thomas Spandaur saw the glare of the
flames and his cries brought Patrolman
H. McMurray, who turned in the alarm.
By that time the flames were shooting,
through the roof and clouds .of smoke
rolled skyward.
MAXWELL ON SCENE.
The first alarm brought Battalion Chief
Maxwell to the scene. Soon after the
first stream was playing on the fire the
flames began to ravage the neighboring
houses ' on Jessie. Seventh and Mission
streets. Maxwell gave the order for a
second alarm. . In reaching the box at
Seventh and Howard, a block and a half
away, he was hampered' by the crowd,
and precious moments elapsed before the
second alarm. Almost before the tap, of
the second alarm Acting Chief Dougherty
arrived and assumed charge of the fire
fighting.
With the arrival of the engines re
sponding to the second. alarm large Sun

gather > about the , conflagration , and . the
streets soon became impassable. ' Cap
tain Spillane assumed ; charge of the, po

of the crowd. .."-'\u25a0'

Men Who Claimed to Hold
Secret .Over His Head
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.â That Robert
D. Ballantine, Princeton graduate and
son of the late John H. Ballantine,
young, wealthy and a member of a
voted New Jersey family. 'was driven to
end his life because he had found him
self .in the toils: of a band of black
mailers, was the undercurrent in con
versation among his friends .in this
city and Newark to-day. Holding over
his head or pretending 1 to have in their
possession a secret which would bring
upon him disgrace, the 'plotters not
only obtained from him large sums of
money, but wrecked his peace of mind
us well.
The ashes of two letters were found
in an open grate in the room in which
Ballantine killed himself. He evidently
had destroyed them just before ending
his life. - What they contained no one
knows. "
In dispatches received .to-day fr6m
Charlotteville, Va., where for ten years
Ballantine lived, this report met with
confirmation, it being asserted that the
blackmailers were tnree In. number and
that $15,000 was their assessment for
November.
After he was graduated from Prince
ton about ten years ago Ballantine,
who never engaged in any business,
adopted. the life of a student. He went
to the University of Virginia at Char
lotteville,â¢".-.where he received^ a degree
in law and thenrhe studied medicine.
The blackmailing story told to-day
was to the effect that, at the beginning
of â¢ November, Ballantine was ap
proached by three persons in Charlotte
ville auite well- known in .the com
munity. These three told him that un
less he gave/them a large sum of
.money a report would be put into circu
lation which would bring disgrace not
alone upon him. but upon his family.
The conspirators demanded at once
$15,000, which, within a week, was paid
to them, and they departed with the
intimation that there. were to be regu
lar demands, in the future.

SEEKS LIFE
OF TYRRELL

but the Latter s Presence
of Mind Saves Him
ESCAPES THROUGH A
DOOR TO BACK ROOM
Kind-Hearted Official Re
fuses to Prosecute His
Cowardly Assailant, Whom
He Was Striving to Aid
The coolness and great presence of mind 'â¢
which Chief Deputy Warflneer John G.
Tyrrell displayed on Saturday afternoon
when "Denny" Coleman held a loaded
revolver at his breast saved his life,
Coleman, for many years known as 'a
bad man with revolver or fist, walked
into Tyrrell's office under the Influence
of liquor and producing a big revolver
held it against Tyrrell's breast. But the
latter instead of trying to grapple with the
infuriated man, persuaded him not to
shoot, and seeing his chance escaped Into
a rear room.
The startling incident was witnessed by
several persons who were in Tyrrell's of
fice at the time. All thought Tyrrell's
hour had come when they saw Coleman
place the weapon asrainst the former's ;
I breast, and their fear was transformed
[ into amazement and admiration as Tyrrell
successfully talked his drunken assailant
out of his purpose, then deftly made his
escape through an adjoining office.
Coleman, whom all the old politicians
will remember) as a rough and ready man
at the polls In the palmy days of Chris
Buckley, has been on the lookout for a
political job of some kind for a lons
time. He frequently appealed to Tyrrell
for aid, and the latter said ho would do
the best he could. But Coleman did not
think his friend was acting with enough
celerity in the matter and on Saturday
afernoon he armed himself with his re
volver and started to find out for him
self.
COI.EMAX KXTERS OFFICE.
' Coleman entered Tyrrell's office while
the latter was talking to some business
friends and without any ceremony walked
right up to the Deputy Wharfinger and,
pulling his ugly looking revolver, , placed
it against TyrreH's breast. In a/ moment
the crowd began to scatter. <l2very one
expected to hear a report and see Tyr
rell's body stretched at full length on the
floor in another instant.
But the would-be victim at this critical
etage demonstrated his ability 'to "keep
his head" when In a tight place. Without
turning a ha'r he looked Coleman square
ly in the eye and said: "Denny, put that
gun away! Don't be a fool! You will
only get yourself into all kinds of trou
ble if j-ou pull that trigger. Be rational,
and we'll talk it over."
The aulet little talk had its effect, for
Coleman involuntarily dropped the weap
on, and as he did so Tyrrell quickly dart
ed through a door and into a rear room.
By this time the witnesses to the excit
ing incident grappled with Coleman. and
in a very few minutes he was disarmed
and in the hands of his captors, who held
him tight, . :
The incident created all kinds of excite
ment around Tyrrell's office, though it
was hushed up and did not get any far
ther. Tyrrell ref u?ed to have his coward
ly assailant arrested, though his friends
i insisted, saying his life would be In dan
ger again if the man were allowed to go
unmolested. But Tyrrell stood firm, and
in the goodness of his heart he allowed
Coleman to go his way without being mo
lested.
TVUKELI^ REFUSES TO PROSECUTE.
After the mixup Coleman seemed to so
ber up to a marked degree and expressed
his -sorrow for what he had done. He
seemed to feel , his position keenly, but
none of the eye-witnesses to the unlooked
for incident would offer him any sym
pathy, and if they had their way Cole
man would be behind orison bars now
Instead of roaming the streets a free
man.
I No one knows better than Tyrrell what
a narrow escape he had. . Coleman always
enjoyed the reputation of being a man
who fought to a finish whenever he start
ed a row of any kind. By the manner in
which he approached Tyrrell he surely
intended to' shoot to kill, for if he had
pulled the trigger there would have been
no escape for his victim, as the weapon
was directly up against his breast.
Tyrrell does not even bear any ill
feeling against the man who sought
-his life in such a cowardly manner.
Instead, he said he felt sorry for the
fellow, and was doin^ all in his power
to get him a position. He pays that
even now he will do Coleman a good
turn if the chance offers itself.
Coleman is one of the political heel
ers and all-around bad men of the old
school. When . Chris Buckley was the
reigning political power here years ago
Coleman enjoyed the distinction of be
ing "close up" and was in the habit
of .turning a few tricks around the bal
lot boxes when a handy man with re
volver or fist was in demand.
He used to be a deputy sheriff under
Pete Hopkins in the old days, and was
well known all over the . city. When
the Buckley gang went down and out
Coleman rlso faded from tne public eye
and ever since that time he has been
doing: the best he could In the way of
g-ettlns a stray political job. . His ef
forts. lately have not been quite so
successful as they used to be, so he
lias been appealing: to Tyrrell for aid.

Miss Bose. Colin Becomes Vi
olently Insane on Night
Engagement Is Announced
SAD END OF A ROMANCE
- +â â -\u25a0â
While Friends Are Congrat
u 1 ating Her She Bursts
- Into Maniacal Laughter
\u25a0 .
Tossing about on a cot at the Simon
Sanitarium, probably hopelessly insane,
is Miss Rose Conn, who .iust two months
aero celebrated her bethrothal feast at the
home of. her father. Solomon Cohn. at
632 Shrader street.
The unfortunate young lady was
stricken with brain fever on the night that
her engagement to Frederick Asch was
to be formally announced. There is noth
ing to account for it. Her relatives ex
plain It by attributlnc it to too much
happiness.
Her fiance is terribly shocked and her
parents are broken-hearted dyer the af
fair. An effort has been made to keep
it secret, as it was thought that the at
tack was only temporary. Now little hope
is expressed for the girl's recovery. .
Miss Cohn is a member of the Ladies'
Auxiliary of j the Young Men's Hebrew
Association and very popular in Jewish
social circles. She is the only daughter
of Solomon Cohn, a capitalist of the
Western Addition. The fiance who was
cheated of his brif'e is Frederick C. Asch,
a clerk in the employ of Charles Brown
& Sons. The young woman is about 22
years old and Mr. Aech is only a few
years her senior.
The young people met at a Jewish so
cial function several months aco. . It ,was
evidently love at first sight, but after
that they manasred to keep the affair
secret. *
Miss Cohn's parents would not approve
of her considering matrimony seriously
for several years. She knew this and
told them nothing of her regard for young
Asch. He was not permitted to call upon
her at her home, but they met often.
When he told her that he loved her
there was only one thing lackingâ she
wanted her mother to know, she wanted
everybody to know, how happy, she was.
But Asch told' her that she must keep
the news of the engagement secret fpr
a while at least.
WORRIES OVER SECRET.
Never before had the young girl kept
anything from her mother. But it was
a command from the man she loved and ,
ehe religiously obeyed, though it cost. her
a bitter struggle and many a sleepless
night. At times she wondered whether it
was right to keep back such an important
secret from the kind mother to whom she
had told her inmost thoughts ever since
she hal been able to. lisp.
But a new power had entered lnts her
life. Though the love of her fiance was
dearer to her than life, she at times felt
lonely because she could- not confide in
her mother. At home she appeared ab
sent and almost sullen under this.pres
sure. She had been a merry and viva-"
clous girl, and her parents began to
worry about her. They would ask if she
were ill, and she would make pathetic
efforts .to be her 01d,. 5e1f.;.. ;
One night about ten ago her
fiance released her from her promise of
secrecy. The young girl immediately
broke the news to her. mother. Her
parents reluctantly submitted to the in
evitable. -\u25a0: They"" agreed to give a little re
ception that the engagement might be
formally announced.
A merry party gathered at . the Cohn
residence one evening to congratulate the
happy young , couple. Miss \u25a0 Cohn was
standing beside her fiance receiving the
good wishes , of her friends- graciously,
and the merriment was at Tfs height.
Suddenly she -burst into a fltlof hys
terical laughter that chilled- the listeners.
There was a wild look in. her eyes, such
as is only seen in those who are Insane.
The laughter vas hushed In an .Instant
and the guests drew back shocked.
The young fiance threw his arms about
the girl and called lier by name. The
only answer was" another outburst of
maniacal laughter and she struggled to
free herself. Her mother and father hur
ried to her side and attempted to soothe
her, but she did not recognize them.
BECOMES RAVING; '.MANIAC.
| The guests hurriedly departed. In vain
the fiance and the girl's parents tried to
bring the girl back to ' her reason. She
struggled violently and her: reply to their
pleadings was an incoherent menace. For
hours they tried both entreaties and ten
derness. They could- not restore her to
sanity. -\u25a0 . - - \ ;*'
Until the gray dawn lighted the room
where the gay party had been they tried
to call back the girl's lost reason. <Tho
light of the early morning, illumined ' the
girl's face and showed the blank expres
sion of a maniac upon It.'; She siezed a, bit
of evergreen that had been used to^dec-
I <Â»Tate the room and tore it to pieces, mut
i terlng unintelligible gibberish. â¢Â«'<â¢ ; *_'
' Sorrowfully the three people'who. loved
her most agreed that she must ber taken
somewhere for a time. On i the. day after
her betrothal feast, she /was; taken to the
German Hospital. Asch 'and the girl's
parents were certain that the illness was
only temporary."^ V; .. ,\u25a0\u25a0".\u25a0 ; â¢'. ;
Asch visited her daily? at the German
Hospital, but she did not recognize him
nor did she know her parents. She grew
worse instead of better. R Finally* she was
removed to Simon's Sahltarium.
Her parents are still confident that their
daughter will be restored to them, but
Asch has resigned' himself to , the inev
itable. He has ! begun to regard her as
one dead and/ should she be; restored to
reason, he says he cannot marry her
now. .. -

Karl yon Holnstein
Happily Ends
Long Chase.
Count Karl yon Holnstein. the Bava
rian nobleman whose ardent love for pret
ty Mildred Harrison, the Philadelphia
heiress and out-pf-dor enthusiast, caused
him to follow her across half a continent
last spring, is at the St. Francis. With
him is his bride of a few months. She is
the Miss Harrison whose charms mag
netized the Bavarian nobleman last May.
He is the triumphant lover, returned to
the State where he first met his newly
made wife. California society laughed
at what it thought was a fruitless chase
by this titled foreigner of the girl whose
entertaining personality had brought
many lovers to her feet. The smart set
laughed again when this man followed
her on to Colorado, after seemingly hav
ing been cast in the debris pile with the
other lovers of this beauty. Now Califor
nia's finest doff their caps in acknowl
edgement of the success of the persistent
efforts of Count yon Holnstein. He may
row laugh at society. He has captured
thp prize which led him such a merry
chase and Is bringing her back with him
In pride of his victory. Not only has he
won this woman, but he seems to havo
made her happy, for she laughed and
talked as gayly yesterday as in the days
when she was the queen of the ballroom
In Santa Barbara.
The romance of Count yon Holnstein
and his bride is a story well known to
the members of thÂ» smart srt In Califor
nia. The Count is a Bavarian and re
ported to be a man of considerable
wealth. He is, best of all, a gentleman,
every inch of him. He is a broad
-shouldered, tall man, handsome, with
black hair and good eyes.
FIKST MEETS HIS BRIDE.
He first came to America several years
ago in company with his mother, who
was one of the ladles in waiting on the
Queen of Bavaria. They traveled in the
Southwest, where Count yon Holnatein in
vested in mining properties. Then they
came on to California for the winter
months.
This year the Count and his mother ar
rived in Santa Barbara early in March.
There was ' a ball at the Hotel Potter,
and there Yon Holnstein met Miss Harri
son. He loved her from the first, and
rumor had it that he offered her his hand
In a very few weeks.
During these weeks the Count was her
constant companion. Then, one day, she
suddenly left. Miss Sibyl Kaye, an inti
mate friend of Miss Harrison, left with
her.
The smart set of Southern California
emiled. They thought Miss Harrison had
run away to avoid the Count. Nothing
daunted, he followed. He reached San
Francisco early in May and made imme
diate Inquiries for Miss Harrison. To his
dismay, he found that she had , left for
the East only the day before his arrival.
Some one confided to him that her mail
was to be forwarded to Colorado Springs,
Thither the Count hastened.
At Colorado Springs he found her. -HÂ«
was there a few days, after which h*
suddenly left for the East. Society
laughed again. The Count was surely
jilted this time.
FOOLS WISE SOCIETY.
But such was not the case. In a short
time he was back. A little later the same
circle of society which had been ready to
laugh at the pursuit of this foreigner was
ready to offer its congratulations. He had
won. A winner is always respected. So
ciety received the couple with open arm*

tramped over the hills with the stride of
a man. At golf and other athletic sporfca

Eails Spread and Two Men
Are Hurt When Engine and
Oil Car Leave the Track
TRAFFIC IS DELAYED
Engineer Is Badly Scalded
and Conductor Drake Re
ceives Internal Injuries
EÂ»Â«cial Dlscatch to The Call.
NAPA, Doc. 10.â A serious wreck oc
curred on the Southern Pacific Railroad
near Napa Junction at noon to-day. An
engine and the oil car of a . large gravel
train was thrown from the track and
hurled into the deep ditch by the track.
Conductor C. Drake of the train was
injured internally and is in a serious
condition to-night.
The trainmen had left the gravel cars
at Flosden station and were taking the
engine, and oil car back to Napa Junc
tion to get a fresh supply of oil. Con
ductor C. Drake, Engineer T. O'Connor,
Fireman Larue and Brakemen Kerrick
and Leggate were riding in the cab of the
engine. Suddenly the rails spread and
the engine and car plowed along the ties,
tearing up about 150 feet of track- before
toppling over into the ditch. None of the
men had an opportunity -to jump' from
the cab. The engine was thrown off on
the'west side and the oil car on the east
side of the track. Conductor Drake re
ceived a deep gash on the head and. his
right hip was injured. He also suffered
severe internal injuries. Engineer O'Con
nor was badly scalded by steam from the
boiler, but probably will recover. - Traffic
was delayed for several hours, as it was
not until late to-night was the track
cleared.

Sr>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 10.â By the arrest
to-day of Frank Weller, -alias Wilder, and
Joseph Castro, alias Lawrence, by United
States Secret Service Agent J. C. Cronln
and a posse of officers from the central
police station, it is believed that one of
the smoothest gangs of counterfeiters
that has operated on the Pacific Coast
for years was broken up. With the pris
oners a quantity of paraphernalia was
confiscated, and sufficient evidence is
possessed by the officers to permit of a
successful prosecution of the charge.
The men have been operating in Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland and a
number of other California cities for sev
eral months past Hooding the coast with
bogus bills. They have been under
surveillance for 'some time, and in sev
eral cities. The raising of $2 bills to the
denominations of So and $10 is said to
have been the principal occupation of the
counterfeiter's,' as well as the coining of
spurious J5 pieces.

British Columbia cities have been ship
ping to- the Orient Canadian flour. Prior
to the inauguration of the boycott the
Chinese merchants made . regular ship

the Canadian millers sent representatives
to Tacoma, Portland and Seattle, where
they obtained a number of large orders.

largest milling concerns Jn Canada con
tracted to sell flour equal to the American
brands at $3 70 f. o. b in Hongkong. He
booked orders for 10,000 barrels, and ex
pects further orders. The Chinese ex
porters claim that at this price they will
make larger profits than If they had
shipped American flour.

WIND DESTROYS
INDIANS' HUTS
Portable Houses Sent to the
Pala Reservation by TJncle
Sam Are Bloa\ti to Ground
REDSKINS FRIGHTENED
Gale Causes Considerable
Damage in Other Parts of
the County of San Diego
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 10.-A high wind
caused considerable damage on the Indian
reservation at Pala to-day. When the
Warner's ranch Indians were settled at
Pala, after they had been ousted from
their old homes on the ranch, a number
of portable houses were brought to their
new settlement and put . up. They were
light affairs, but were supposed to 'be
substantial enough to withstand any wind
storm that might visit that locality. To
day's gale, however, swept away all these
little dwellings, as well aa barns and
the agent's house. The Indians at latest
reports were huddled together in the two
barns that remain standing. They are
completely terrorized by the unusual vis
itation. Resorts from other parts of the
county indicate that the wind did con
siderable damage. The storm was scarce
ly felt in this city and caused no loss
here.
BLOWS A HURRICANE.
Gale of Great Severity Visits Southern
Pnrt of Stnte.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 10.â A severe
desert wind storm, that In localities ap
proached the magnitude of a hurricane,
visited Southern California to-day. Re
ports from various sections around Los
Angeles tell of a gale lasting \u25a0 almost
throughout the day and in places doing
considerable damage. The chief injury
was to the orange and olive crops. It
is stated that probably two per cent
of the crop in portions of Riverside
County was blown from the trees and a
considerable proportion of the fruit that
remained was bruised and crushed.
About Corona the gale was reported
the most severe In years. Trees and
small buildings were blown over and in
one instance a hack loaded with pas

Rheumatism Cure
BEGINS TO-DAY
To-day thÂ« free distribntioa of my
rheumatism cure begins from the office
of the San Francisco Examiner. This
Is the remedy that has attracted 'world-
wide attention and has without doubt
cured more rheumatism than all the
remedies ever combined. It floes not
put the disease to sleep, bat neutralizes
the acids and drives the poison from
the system. This remedy was first dis-
tributed from the Philadelphia Times
twelve year ago, when more than six-
teen hundred people testified within ten
days after taking it that they had been
cured or greatly benefited. I do not
believe there is a rheumatic pain that
these little pellets will not relieve in
from ttvo to six hours. I have seldom
known a case of chronic rheumatism.
no matter in what part of the body
seated, that will not yield to this med-
icine. I want every person who suffers
with rheumatism, lumbago, sciatica, all
who have sharp, shooting pains in any
part of the body, all those who have
lame or weak backs, or stiff joints, to
get a free bottle of this almost Infalli-
ble cure. It is absolutely harmless to
even the most delicate system.
I claim that this remedy will cure
ninety-six out of every hundred, and
the millionaire as well as the laboring
man should bo equally interested to
know whether this 13 a fact or not I
take all the risks and assume all the
responsibility. You have only to call
for a free bottle and find out for your-
self. If you cannot call for a free
sample bottle, you can buy the regular
sized vial from any druggist for 25
cents. If it does not do all I claim for
it. bring the empty bottle to my offlce,
and I will refund your money.

Lad Accused of Murdering
Thomas Cook Is Saved
by His Lawyers Plea
ONE JUHOK HOLDS OUT
Disagreement Results From
Man's Belief That Youth
Is Guilty in Minor Degree
OAKLAND. Dec. 10.â The youthful ap
pearance and straightforward manner of
Percy Pembroke helped to &aye him last
night lrom the sallows or from life im
prisonment, li is known nuw, after the
jury's relt-ase, that the boys appearance
impressed the jurors, and his mother,
weeping and unresiÃntd to her sons fate,
and the plea of All' ncy L. S. Church
aided in convincing eleven of the twelve
jurors that the lad was not guilty..
I'ombroKe will he tri<-d aKuia. but Dis
trict Attorney Alien says thut the com
bination of circumstances that resulted
in dividing the jury last evening may
ajrain prevent a conviction.
Pembroke was one of the "Jim Crow"
gang that operatedMn Fruitvale and was
responsible for the death of Thomas
Cook, a grocery clerk, who was sand
bagrgreil and robbeJ.
Cook died from his wounds, and Pem
broke. John Schneider and George Blaker
were charged with the crime of murder
ing him. r.laker was found guilty of
murdtr in the second degree and was
UL-ntenced to life imprisonment by Judge
Mtlvin. John Schneider's trial begins be
fore Judge Ellsworth to-morrow, and last
evening, after being out for thirteen
hours, the jury in the Pembroke case
disagreed. In the latter case only one of
the jÂ«rors held out for conviction.
Jim Crowhurst, leader of the gang, ana
his brother Elmer have both been found
guilty of highway robbery. Jim has gGne
to San Quentin forjieven years and El
mer has boen sent to the Preston Reform
School until he becomes 21.
The hanging of the Jury in the Pem
broke case Is considered by the legal fra
ternity a great victory for Attorney Lin
S. Church. With confessions of the
clients to ficht and with the boy's own
ackn^vledgmer-t that he had been a
member of the "Jim Crow" gang. Church
Fucceeded in securing a disagreement.
Had it not boen for th<* unwavering opin
ion of one juror, who refused to be moved
by the sympathy plea, one member of the
criminal pant? would have been pet free.
Pembroke's second trial will be set next
Friday.

WITH MAX THELEN
BRILLIANT DEBATER WINS A PRIZE
RISING YOUNG DEBATER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, WHO, BY
HIS BRILLIANT SPEECH FROM THE COLLEGE FORUM SATURDAY
NIGHT WON THE BONNHEIM PRIZE AND FAME AS AN ORATOR.
BERKELEY, Dec. 10. â Daniel Had
sell. a brilliant young student of the
State University, has taken rank .with
such stellar debaters in college as Max
Thelen. Alfred Weller and W. J. Mus
grove by his victory won last night in
the Bonnheim oratorical contest at Stiles
Hall. Iladsell competed with Harry E.
Squire for the glory and gold that goes
with the award of the judges in this
contest.
By his victory Hadsell wins a money
prize of $150, besides a prize of $20,
paid to him when his dissertation, a
preliminary feature of the competition,
was declared by the judges to be. of
such worth as to entitle him to com
pete in the final test of oratory.
Hadsell. discussed, as did his op
ponent. Squire, the dictum of Voltaire
that "International Law is the Juris
prudence of Highway Robery." Hadsell
is a student in the college of social
sciences, while Squire is of the en
gineering college. Both men are sen
iors. They were the only two students
whose dissertations were considered
good enough by the judges to warrant
their selection as competitors in the
verbal discussion of the chosen topic.
Ordinarily live men compete in the final
discussion. Albert Bonnheim of Sacra
mento founded the Bonnheim discussion.
There have been four contests of the
tort, the other three having been won
respectively by Alfred Weller, Max
Thelen and W. J. Musgrove.
SCULPTOR WOULD
COLLECT MONEY
3lakes Charges Against
Asylum Director Concern
ing Financial Deal.
BERKELEY. Dec. 10.â As a result of a
civil suit for $110 which is now pending
against Theodore Grady, an instructor at
the State Institution for the Deaf and
Dumb and the Blind at Berkeley, Doug
las Tilden, the deaf-mute sculptor and
plaintiff in the civil action, has filed
charges against Grady before the board
of directors, alleging the latter has had
ample time to meet his obligation^ but
has failed, and that some action by the
board of the institution should be taken.
Grady is an attorney and has become in
volved in money matters with the sculp
tor, until the two have seen fit to carry
their troubles into court. . â¢
The board of directors received the
charges through A. J. Ralston, a member
of the body, to whom they were ad
dressed. He opened them at the last
meeting and they were referred to Super
intendent Wilkinson. The members of the
board are somewhat of the opinion that
the affair is too personal for official ac
tion on, their part, and as yet no report
has been made by the superintendent. It
is believed a special meeting of the board
may be called, but Director J. W. Rich
ards, says he doubts that this will be
done. ,

FIGHT FOR SIMS'
ESTATE IMPENDS
Trend of Testimony Suggests
That a * -Battle Over the
Property Is Very Probable
WOMEX MAY LITIGATE
Sequel to the Tragic Death of
Capitalist Whom Two Per
sons Claim Married Them
ALAMEDA, Dec. 10.â Mrs. F. M. Wil
liams, who claims that she was married
to the late J. Fletcher Sims, the wealthy
iron manufacturer who lived a dual life,
and who was known here as F. M. Wil
liams, may make a contest for a share
of the, estate' of the capitalist. Sims died
last week at Providence Hospital as
the result of brain injury sustained by
fallings from an automobile. The asser
tion of Mrs. J. Fletcher Sims of Berke
ley that she was the true and lawful
spouse, of the deceased and that they
had never been divorced seems not- to
have deterred "Mrs. Williams" from
planning a contest. Attorney W. H. L..
Hynes has been retained by' Mrs. Wil
liams to guard her interests in the set
tling up of the estate of Sims, and it
is regarded as probable that if no formal
contest is. instituted a compromise may
be reached between the two women who
affirm that Sims was the husband of
each.
Mrs. F. M. Williams, in answer to a
question at the Coroner's inauest into the
death: of Sims, held last evening in
Oakland, Bald that shys had married him
under, the name of Williams in Southern
.California, \but upon the advice of At
torney Hynes refused to tell when or by
whom the alleged ceremony was' per
formed.
Mrs. Williams is still in possession of
the luxuriously furnished bunjralow on
Buena Vista avenue and Stanford street,
where i she and Williams, ; or Sims, re
sided for nearly theree years. ] The realty,
house and contents are assessed at 17600
and the property stands in the name of
F. M. . Williams. It is surrounded by a
high board fence and few besides the inti
mate associates of Sims and the Williams
woman have ever viewed tho interior of
the establishment. -
SAVES GOODLY SUM â¢
FOE- MUNICIPALITY
Local Manufacturer ,of Fire
Gongs and Police Boxes
Eeduces Expense.
OAKLAND, Dec. 10.â The plan of
manufacturing' the police telephone
boxes and fire alarm gongs for the en
gine-houses of the . city JJ in the city
machine shoo. introduced by City
Electrician Babcock, has resulted in
a saving to the city .of $1500 dur
ing the fiscal. year of 1904-5, as shown
by the annual report of the City Elec
trician. When purchased from manu
facturers of Electrical supplies the
telephone boxes cost the city between
$75 and $100, while their construc
tion in the city shop costs but $22 50.
The fire alarm gongs cost^ when
bought from the manufacturers. $150
each. They can be made by the city
for $60 each.
City Electrician Babcock advises in
hla report that the work of putting
the fire alarm and police telegraph
wires underground in the business
center of the city be completed 'as rap
idly as : possible, as the efficiency of
the service will be greatly added to
by this improvement. He also advises
that the city ask the Oakland Gas,
Light and Heat Company for a reduc
tion in the rental for street arc lights.
In this connection the City Electrician
says in his report:
At the close of the fiscal year IDO4-5 the city
had 7.VÂ» arc lamps burning: at a cost of $7 25
per lamp per month. Not including the marsh
lands the city has an area of fourteen square
miles, giving rtf ty-four lights to the square
mile. At the close of the present fiscal year,
endlnsr July, UMjtf, we will have approximately
800 street arc lights, for which we will be pay
ing Â§7 per light per month. This will give us
57.14 lights to the square mile.
As a comparison, it may be stated that the
city of Portland, Or., with an area of forty
square miles,* has 1034 etreet arc lights, for
which they pay ?3 31 per month. At Los An
geles, with an area of 44 square miles, they
have 1510 street arc lights, for which they pay
$0 75 per month. The comparison Is of inter*
est: r Portland, with 28.35 lamps per' square
mile, at a rate of $5 31, pays $150 53 per square
mile per month for its street lighting. Los An
geles, with 34.32 lights per square mile, at
$6 76 per lamp per month, pays $23100 per
square mile per month for Its street lighting-.
Oakland, with. 57.14 lamps per square mile, at
the rats of $7 per lamp per month, pays $300 93
per square mile per month for street lighting:.
It would seem, therefore, that, owing to the
greater income - earned by the Oakland | Gas,
Light and Heat Company t>y its lines, tha city
might reasonably ask a material reduction
from the price now paid for its street lighting.

PIONEEE CATHOLIC
PJRIEST IS YEEY ILL
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 10.â Catholics
throughout all parts of Southern Cali
fornia ' will be grieved to learn of the
serious illness of Bishop Peter Verda
guer DD., Vicar Apostolic of the diocese
of Brownsville, Tex. He is suffering with
pneumonia, and there is little hope of
his recovery. To all old-timers of this
part of California the Bishop is better
known as "Father Peter," and by this fa
miliar name he is known and loved by
thousand?.' For thlrty-flve years he was
a parish priest in Southern California,
and of this period twenty years he spent
as rector of the old Mission Church of
Our Lady of the Angels at the Plaza.
In his religious work "Father Peter**
had gone up and down throughout this
Southern California country, saying mass
in chapel 3 and at various stations, com
forting the sick and dying, and giving
his ministrations to all in need, and there
is probably not a better known member
of the Catholic clergy in this part of the
Southwest.
Ten years ago he was called to Rome
and was then made a Bishop and given
charge of a diocese of which Laredo is
the seat. He "contracted a cold a wee*
ago while returning home from New
York-, having Just completed another
Journey to Rome.
STORM WRECKS BOATS.

Santa Catalica. is cut off from the rest
of the world, as a result of the north
east srale- which for two day 3 ha 3 been
sweeping the channel, making landing
there imoossible. A wireless telegram
received by the Times late to-night
states that great damage has been don&
to the pleasure fleet which i 3 anchored
in t Avalon Bay. The bay forms a good
anchorage except when the wind is from
the northeast and then it is Impossible
to protect the shippings Four glass bot
tom boats are piled up on the beach
totally wrecked, but there has been no
loss of life. To-day the Wilmington
Transportation Company's steamer Ca
brilld tried to entef the harbor but found
it so hazardous that her captain put back
to San Pedro. There has been no steam
er here since Friday and probably none
will enter the bay before Wednesday.
The financial loss to owners of the small
craft will be heavy.

Wears Out the Nerves.
Do you realize that pain is
weakening, and exhausts your
vitality? Don't you remember
how completely worn out you
felt after that last attack of
headache, backache,
periodical or other spell of suf-
fering? Nearly every case of
inflammation, apoplexy, paral-
ysis, epilepsy and insanity is
directly due to the weakening
influence of pain upon the
brain nerves? For this reason
every one who suffers from
pain of any kind should not
fail to get relief as quickly as
possible.
You can do this by taking
Dr. Miles* Anti-Pain* Pills â
others do.
"I have used Dr. lilies' Anti-Fain
Pills for years, and. can say they hay*
never failed. I v always keep them in
the house. In fact I had rather ba -
without sugar than the Pills. Pre-
vlous to usin* them I had always suf-
fered with sick headache. - sometimes
being in bed for three and four days.
I had tried nearly everything I ever
heard of; some would sesm to help
at first, but after a short time the
effect would wear off. It is five years

Railroads have laid a new roadbed, put
Â«n more cars and increased the motive
power to a degree that makes the trip a
short and pltasant one. A special train
Will also leave every day from Third and
Townsend streets at 1:15 p. m., returning
to the city immediately after the last
race.
Some stirring racing: will be witnessed
Curing the week, for the programme calls
for events that will bring: together the
tream of ' the thoroughbreds in training
about the bay tracks.
While some excellent handicap races
%-ill be run. the great attraction of the
â¢wetk will be decided Saturday. It Will
b* an event in California's racing history.
The greatest two-year-olds racing in the
West will be asked to go their first mile.
These youngsters will be rated a3 three
year-olds on January 1, but are classed
as two-year-olds when they face thej>ar
rier in. ihe PaciSc-Union handicap on Sat
urday. It is a new stake, to which the
California Jockey Club has added $2000,
and will be worth about $3000 to the win
ner. That it will result in a horse race is
evident frcm the fact that there are a
dozen or more youngsters thoroughly fit
and ready for the fray. The perform
ances of Confederate and Xagasam are
\u25ba fresh in the memories of racegoers. Con
iederaie downed the mighty Bearcatchtr
at seven furlongs. Xagazam beat a !ot
of the best youngsters racing here. Both
are frcm the V. 13. Jennings stable.
Then there is Barney Schreiber's great
Bannockburn colt. Dr. Gardner. His last
race indicated he is f^ast rounding to
Jcrm. Lucky Baldwin's liey Del Mundo,
which out vp such a sensational finish
with Father Oatchem and Dr. Gardner
Saturday at Oakland, will also try for
the prize. The great Father Catchern is
eligible and there is no reason why he
should not start.
Radtke, McÃride and Knapp are run
ning .i close race for first place honors
in the saddle, with the former heading
tho list.
The standing of the riders to date is

INGLESIDE RACETRACK REOPENS TO-DAY
TENNIS MATCH
IS A SURPRISE
â¢ â
Long- and ' Griffin Defeat
the Guerin Brothers
in Three Straight Sets
WINNERS UNDERRATED
Play Their Cleverest Game
While Their Opponents
Appear Nervous on Courts
The final match of the handicap dou
bles tennis tournament commenced on \
j the Golden Gate Park courts two {
I weeks ago resulted in an easy victory '.
i yesterday for Herbert Lonp: und Clar- j
j ence Griffin., Opposed to them were |
j the Guerin brothers â George and j
i Henry. The latter received odds of 15
j and owe 15 and were beaten in straight
'sets. The score was G-4. C-4. 7-5.
i In both the second and sets,
j the brother team overcame big leads,
I but Long and Griffin won out quite
â¢ handily when the effort became neces
sary. The Guerins won all their other \u25a0
matches so easily that many thought j
they had a good chance against Griffln j
and Long. The latter were underrated |
by the handicapper and the tourna
ment was a gift to -them from the
start. The Guerins were handicapped
j about right and if their opponents had
I owed 3-6 more, as the other lirst-class
! teams did, the match would have been
{closer and the result- less of Â«. fore
gone conclusion.
Long and Griffin were at their best,*
while the Guerin brothers ivere rather
nervous and did not live up to the form
they displayed in the earlier rounds.
Grilfin's smashing and Longs driving
were the features.
A number of good practice matches
were played on the park and Califor
nia Club courts.
George Janes and Charles Foley
joined forces and made a strone com
bination. They first met George Baker
and Charles Dunlap and disposed -of
them easily. The score v. T a3 6-2, 6-3.
Dunlap's place was taken by E. P. Fin
negan and the new combination proved
more formidable. Janes and Foley won
both sets, but they were unusually long;
and close. The score was 12-10. 7-5.
Janes and Foley next took on Griffln
and Long, the tournament winners,
.md, although the former won three
straight sets they had no easy time
doing so. The score was 7-5, 0-2. S-6.
Should Janes and Foley elect to play
together they would make a,n_ excel
lent team. Foley is steady and Janes
is aggressive.
At the California Club the courts
were crowded all morning. Harold
Gabriel and B. F. Nourse played an in
teresting: doubles Vv'ith A. Chesebroug-h
and S. Salisbury. Gabriel was the star
of the four. The score was S-C, C-4 In
favor of Xourse and Gabriel.
In singles George Busch and Frank
Mitchell p!ayed a tie match. Busch
won the first set, (5-2, and Mitchell took
the second. 6-4. '
N'ourse beat Mitchell 7-5; C. Kuehn
beat H. Biddle 7-5, and Blddle and H.
Punnett beat Kuchn and P. D. Kahn.
6-4. 7-5.
The semi-finals and finals of the
boys' handicap doubles tournament
commenced Saturday will be played to
<say. The semi-finals will be Guerin
and Patterson vs. McLou?hl!n ar.d

GARMS MAKES
HIGH AVERAGE
Veteran Eifleman Displays
Great Form on the Kange
at Shell Mound Park
William Garms. the well-known rifle
man, was high man in the Norddeut^bher
Schuetzen Club competition yesterday
at Shell Mound Park. The veteran in
a single entry match scored 60 rings,
being an average of 22 out of a possible
25. He also made several other scores
during the. day, giving him high rank
among the champions. H. Enge of tho
Turners' Schuetzen carried oft! the
medal of his class and also proved the
winner of tbe best bullseye of the
| year.
Otto A. Bremer made a good score of
226 rings in the Germania medal shoot
and was high man in his class. The re
entry match of the Golden Gate Club
was won by C. M. Henderson with 220
and 225 rings. In the same club- J. il.
Trego, with the excellent scores of 97
and 93 rings out of a possible 100. car
ried oft* the prize on the pistol target.
He was closely followed by A. J. Bran-"
nagan, who made 95, 95, 95. This is the
best average "pistol shooting that has
been done for a long time.
F. P. Schuster won the medal in the
champion class of the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein with 222 rings. D. B.
Faktor, with 72 and 71 out of a pos
sible 75, was the winner on the compe
tition target.
The Irish Volunteers includes a num
ber of enthusiastic marksmen, who
spent all day pouring lead into the
targets and made a number of good
scores. Lietuenant T. McNaboe had
command of the company. He intends
to keep it in constant practice. ;
The number of marksmen who took |
part in the various events was larg-e,
| and the light and wind were all that j
could be desired to delight the heart j
of a rifleman.. Competition was keen
during the afternoon/ when the good
shots entered the lists and commenced
to eclipse the already good scores that
i had been made by. their comrades. As
each successful aspirant for honors \
made a good score .he was roundly I
cheered by the spectators. Many of the
records made in the : early part of the
day were completely wiped out during
the latter^part of the afternoon, when
the /soft gray light spread over tho
range and gave each marksman just
the chance he wanted to draw a fine
bead on the bullseye and score a good
shot.
The organizations taking part' in the
different contests were the Nord
deutscher Schuetzen Club, San Fran
cisco Schuetzen Verein, Irish Volun
teers, San Francisco Turner Schuetzen.
Golden Gate Rifle and Pistol Club,
Germania Club and Independent Rifles. ,

Young Chinese, who have some smat-J

Nearly .four hundred persons, at 50
cents per head, witnessed Bob Fitzsim
mons go sixteen' rounds yesterday after
noon at his training camp at Croll's Gar
dens," Alameda. Eight . innings . were
taken up by the next opponent of Jack
O'Brien in walloping the bag, while
eight periods were devoted, to turning
loose punches, swings and jolts at his
sparring mates, Billy Bates and " Harry
Chester. Fitz surprised the majority
of the spectators by his\ agility and
staying power, and many who had
come with the expectation" of seeing the
old man faint from the weight of years
and be ' revived with smelling salts \u25a0 went
away to tell their friends that Bob is
apt to give the 'â¢ wily / ' scrapper â¢ from
Philadelphia something to do when he
puts up his bread-winners on the night
of the 20th inst. Among those who \ ob
served Fitzsimmons go through â¢ hi*
paces . was Joe Gans, the lightweight
champion; . who. exoressed himself 'as
being % favorably ; impressed with Fitz's
present condition. . f-
Weight-pulling, rope-skipping and
wrist-turnjng machines are eschewed
by Fitzsimmons. He does notj [ take
quickly to new-fangled muscle devel
opers for fighters.; He believes that' to
acquire : expertness in giving and re
ceiving knocks .in a real battle it V is
necessary to give and, .receive 'real
knocks in training. Fresh air is looked
upon â¢ by Bob |as the 'most ?healthf ul:pro

\u25a0NEW YORK, <Dec. 10. â Kid McCoy
sent a challenge to-nighf to James J.
Corbett for a fight, tho terms of which
are to be arranged later, it being un
derstood that a new club in Delaware
formed by Tom O'Rourke will offer \
purse' of $20,000. In his letter to Cor
bett McCoy ' says -he has posted $5090
as a guarantee of good faith. McCoy
says ; he is- Induced to t . enter/ the ring
again only because of the unsatisfac
tory termination of his former fight
with Corbett. which he admits left a
cloud on his record as a pugilist. He
declares that under no consideration
will he talk of a match with any
Other man than Corbett. . â¢ â¢
1 James J. Corbett. when asked to
night concerning the challenge, said:
"McCoy made' a great blunder in ask
ing me to fight. I am an actor 'and
my ambition is to become a great
actor. VI have a five-year contract and
I, would not think of breaking it. My
fighting days : are over. , I hate the
fighting game. I made all the money
and got Rll the fame that was coming

The Oakland Hornets defeated the Al

ground at Seventh avenue and California

The score, however, does not fairly in

of the game in both periods-. They wert
unlucky in not being able to score. more

ball out of the net on many occasions.
For the losers, Tierney, Petrie and Lydon
played strongly, while for the winners
Duquesne and Chambers in the forward
line. Yon Helms and Mackenzie in the
back line, rendered excellent set-vice. The
Hornets were â¢ weakened by the absence
of thir captain and fullback, H. R. Elliot,
and of Harry Bird. McLachlan was much
hampered by a sore foot and Christensen
received an awkward knock in the srnsill
of the. back early in the game, which
prevented him from doing as good work

OAKLAND. Dec. 10.-r-If association

differently from the game at Freeman's
Park this afternoon, when the Inde
pendents and the San FranciscoS played
a tie. With* a score of 3 to S.
One feature of the game was fouling.
and several times surgeons were called
to the field to recuscitate the players.
Finnigan of the San Franciscos waa
the principal player at fault. He is*a
good, strong player, but at times be
is nngainly and his knee met the groins
of his opponents oftener than his toe
met the sphere. Had it not been for
Finnigan's fouls the game would have
been a good one â perhaps the best that
has been played at Freeman's Park.
In the first half Peter Fay kicked
a goal for the Independents. Kutledge
scored for the San Franclscos when he
took a cross-field ball from' Grant. In
th*e second half Peter Fay asain kicked
a goal and it looked like San Francisco
until Grant, the central forward of the
Independents, drove the ball into the
net. .
There was no more scoring, bnt in
the second half Rutledge on an off-side,
play placed the ball in the net. The
game was one of team work. There
. was cone of the brilliant individual
plays of Petrle or Ainsworth, and the
game was therefore not so exciting as
those where one man "dribbles" the
ball and takes the consequences. The

MONDAY ....DECEMBER n, 1905
CONDITIONS IN WALL STREET.
IT is now almost the middle of December and the winter lull in
trade which usually appears about the last of November has
not yet appeared, except here and there. On the contrary, the
reports to the different commercial agencies speak of a continually
expanding volume of domestic commerce, with a holiday trade which
bids fair to exceed all previous records. The bank clearings testify
to this, the total in November being the largest ever recorded for
The immediate result of this brilliant exhibit has been to lead
the public into all sorts of speculations, based upon a widespread
optimism which no admonitions appear to shake. This is seen in
continued excitement in Wall street, where the daily sales have run
about on an average of 1,500,000 shares per day, with prices rising
on the whole, and some stocks advancing by leaps and bounds, in
several instances from $5 to $10 per share a day.
The situation in this great mart has become very peculiar. Gen
erally a violent advance in the interest rates for call loans has been
sufficient to check undue speculation, but the rule is no longer work
ing at present. Like a deranged clock, it has stopped. With a
money market ranging from 10 per cent in the morning to 27 per
cent in the afternoon, closing at 4 and 5 per cent, and the same
wild fluctuation repeated on the very next day, speculation in rail
way and industrial shares has gone on with an expansion which
savor 6 of recklessness. In fact, the violent advances in the interest
rates have been received by the street with defiance and incredulity,
and many doubts of their genuineness have been expressed.
Prominent and posted operators have loudly proclaimed that
there is no reason for any such rise in rates, and that they are
merely the manipulation of the money market by financiers who
want to discourage speculation at present. This is as loudly denied
by opposing interests, who assert that the advances are genuine and
caused by an actual scarcity of funds, which are being used to move
the crops, and by the refusal of Secretary Shaw r to come to the re
lief of the market with some $25,000,000 or $30,000,000, as he, was
expected to do several weeks ago. The Secretary in his turn says
that he is willing and ready to relieve the market whenever he finds
:t necessary, but that thus far he does not see that the market ac
tually needs his assistance.
The situation seems to be that large financial interests are ar
tificially advancing the interest rates to restrain the present feverish
speculation, but that they are not succeeding. The cry of continued
prosperity and more to come, with a persistent expansion of-trade
based on large crops and a brilliant statistical situation, is the re
sponse of the speculating public to the warnings of the banks and
financiers, and the long interests have fhe whip in their hands and
are lashing the horse into a gallop. It is remarked in this connec
tion that the very interests who are warning the public not to get
excited into excessive buying are quietly unloading their large hold
ings of securities on every advance, and thus making hay while the
sun shines. At the present pace the public will soon have all the
stocks and incidentally the experience, and the great bankers and
other large holders of stocks, having got rid of them at boom
value?, will sink back in their office chairs and with a broad smile
of satisfaction wait to see what the market will do next. It is not
hard to guess, the result.
Aside from this wave of speculation in Wall street conditions
throughout the country continue encouraging. The bank clearings
still show an increase over corresponding periods last year, and
while the weekly gains of late have been smaller, the volume of *the
clearings has run high, generally over $3,Â©00,000,0003 ,Â©00,000,000 per week.
Those last week were $3,436,575,000, and the net gain in the coun
try was 1.6 per cent, most of the important cities and towns showing"
an increase. The money in circulation is reported at $88,000,000
more than at this time last year. While funds are expected to rule
high the rest of the year, there is a general agreement among posted
observers that relief is in sight: that while speculation has defied
-all rules during this remarkable year the bankers say one precedent
still holds good, and that is the January return of currency from the
interior to New York. But this may be offset by the large demands
upon the market then for the usual January interest and dividend
disbursements.
The staples have been rather more interesting during the week.
Continued estimates by the Government and Southern associations
as to the volume of the cotton crop have kept the cotton market
excited and fluctuating with the general tendency toward advancing
prices. Hides are quieter, as the leading tanners have supplied their
needs for the time being. Wool is also quiet, the high prices check
ing the demand for the raw material. Provisions show no features
worthy of remark. Trading in grain at Chicago has developed no
striking features beyond an immense demand for oats and a good
export movement in corn. Dun's reports an advance in its index
number for commodity prices to $105,312 on December 1, against
8103,858 the preceding month, and the past week has brought still
another advance.
Conditions on this coast at the moment are largely hinging on
the weather. While the recent rains have enabled the plows .to
start in many localities the current cold nights and frosty mornings
have kept green feed and other vegetation back, and the general
desire now is for more rains and softer weather. Otherwise condi
tions are fully as promising as at any time during the past six or
eight years. .
THE CHICAGO RATE CONVENTIONS.
RATE-MAKING is the one clear cut issue which caused a split
among the delegates who went to Chicago to attend the as
sembly called by President Bacon, with an intent to impress
upon Congress the demand of the people of all parts of the country
for legislation outlined in the President's last annual message. So
explicitly did the call make plain that the meeting was to be an
indorsement convention of the President's rate-making. policy that
the break awa3' of a, minority of the delegates to form a non-indors
ing and adverse convention was manifestly absurd.
To make this plain it is necessary only to quote some words,
from the speech of the leader of the dissenters, D.-M. Parry, presi
dent of the National ; Association of Manufacturers, who said :
"Rather do I prefer to believe that this crusade to endow a political
commission with a socialistic and czar-like power to fix transporta
tion prices is what is popularly and very aptly termed a hot-air
movement." "I am more inclined to take the view that Government
rate-making is an impracticable and dangerous scheme." "A propo
sition that is not a whit better than Government ownership." "It is
from the populace 2nd demagogues that we have come to, expect
propositions that the Government shall interfere with the rights of
property." â¢
For a reply to Parry, we get it briefest and best from Governor
Van Sant of Minnesota, who said: "The President is right The
people will not submit to the misuse of the vast powers of corporate
wealth : it will not long submit to the dictation of its creatures. The
great trust corporations exist, in fact their life depends, upon special
privileges granted them in the various . States." He quotes with
approval this: "You cannot disguise the fact that it is to be either
Government ownership or Government control."
Among the Republican statesmen who arc not in favor of a third terra
for President Roosevelt doubtless may be counted Senator. Foraker of
Ohio.â Philadelphia Record.
Tammany is a, pretty bad proposition,' but . nobody has ever claimed
that it was as bad as the Philadelphia "gang."â Chattanooga Times.' ,'
Senator Platt is a horrible example of the man who refuses to let go
until he has to. â Chicago News.

MONKEY SHINES OF MARSELEEN
SIR MOREL MACKENZIE AND THE SHREWD BELGIANS.
Sir Morel Mackenzie once received a
wire from Antwerp asking' him his
charges for a certain operation. He
replied Â£500, and was told to come at
once. When he stepped upon the dock he
was met by three men in mourning, who
informed him sadly that he had come
too late; the patient had died that morn
ing; . . , ''Z^~^mZuÂ± -;.
"But," said the spokesman of the party,
"we know that you did what you could,
and we do not intend that you* shall bo
out of pocket a shilling. v We shall pay you
your full fee." And they did. "And now,"
said the man? "since you are here, what
do you say to visiting: the City Hospital'
and giving a c.inic for the benefit of our
local surgeons? It Is not often they have
an opportunity of benefiting by such
science as yours."
Sir Morel said he would gladly comply.
He went to the hospital and performed
many operations, among which were two
of a similar " nature to that for which
he had been called over. When he finished
all thanked him profusely. On the steam
er going home he met a friend who had
a business house in Antwerp.

LOAN OF A SON.
The monotonous diction of birth no
tices, says the London Express, was
yesterday varied by the following:
"JONESâ On the 2d inst, at Cae-
Cla%vdd, Sanderstead,, Surrey, to Mr. and
Mrs. William Roger Jones, the loan of
a son (Victor Rowlatt)." \V
The proud father explains that he and
his wife resard their children as being
lent to them by God to be educated for
his service as medical missionaries or
in other similar capacities. * ,
POWER KNOWLEDGE REALLY IS.
"As the fellow said, knowledge is
power," I ventured to remark.
"Wind-power," said the old man, kind
of sad. "That's one of the things I found
out while I was acquirln' it. Look at
meâ me who has studied all my life and
learned most everything, gettin' old and
likely' to die most any time, and all I'll
leave behind is my wife, a clearin' and
grandpa's rifle. The facts I've got to
gether won't be of any use to my widder.
Why, if- 1 started to give 'em to her she
just wouldn't listen:"
"You mowt write 'em down, Peter,"
I says. ;
At that old Pottipher laughed like ne
would die. "Write 'em downâ the Idee!"
says he when he could speak audible.
"Don't you understand that if I tried to
write down all I know'd I'd have to live
over a hundred year to finish up?"
"Well, since it won't do you any good,"
I asks, "why are "you botherin' about how
fur you are from that cloud?"
Peter, he smoked quiet like and studied.
Then after a bit, he says, says he:
"Knowin* is a habit. If a man has
brains, the more he puts in 'em the more
they demands. \u25a0 The other day I seen
in the county paper the flggers tellin'
how fur we are from the sun. It didn't
say how it was found out, but I judge
it took a heap of studyin' and squintin'
and sightin* and calculatin*. What good
does it do us to know how many miles
is it to the sun if we ain't intendin' to
walk it? Not a bit; yet it's a nice thing
to know."
"Which goes to prove," says I, "that
knowledge is a luxury.not a ne-cessity."
"Exact," says Peter/
"So the most ignorantest man can get
rich in dollars while the most smartest
is gatherin' only interestin* facts," says I.
"Pre-clse," says Peter; "you've studied
some yourself. .
"Some," I answers, "but not too much,
as I prefer the happy mejum. When I
see you flggerin' over clouds I am more
concided than , ever that ignorance is
bliss, as the fellow ' says."â From "The
Man "Who Studied Cont'nual," by Nelson
Lloyd, in the December Scrlbner's.

The same old 4hing when dying, and the

You'd like a change; then hurry off and

Though oft you think that you'd prefer
to quietly be shot.
The same old lunch at noontime, and the
same old meal at night!
And the same old indigestion, tho same
old dreams to blight!
And then unto the same old bed. to end
the daily ring-.
And put the same old finish on the

The same old actors on the stage! The

The same old oold that brings each fall
the same old tireless cough!
The same worn-out sensations that wÂ©
used to think were new!
The same old pulpit sermons for the
dreamers in the' pew!
Sweet Mary and gay Johnnie think their
love is quite unique,
And that you'd vainly wander, for the
like of it to seek,
And yet their doting parents, if the truth
they cared to- sing.
Could tell them that their callow love's
The. same old trousers for the man! For
woman, petticoats!
The same pretense that we are sheep,
when really we are goats!
The same rank affectation of the thing
that we are not!
The same blank horror of the gulf that
ends our earthly, lot! -
The same old mumm'ry of the show!â Ah,
it were passing strange |

restless for a change:
For once I heard a manâ the wretch!â at

CLEAR THE MIND FOR ACTION
Dorothy Fenimore
YOU know him, don't you, the man
who is always ready for emergen
cies that never arise? He carries,
stowed away, about his person, a set of
pocket tools, a corkscrew, a fruit knife,
a nut pick, pencils, a fountain pen, books
and a. city guide.
His traveling outfit is something formid
able, with its eating paraphernalia. It 3
flasks, the rubber cushions which he takes
to sit upon and to place behind his back.
He wears books out by carrying them
around, although he never opens their
covers; their weight and bulk have be
come so much a matter of necessity to
him that he would feel uncomfortable
and half-dressed without them. /.
He prides himself upon being ready for
emergencies.
Is he? Ninety T nine cases out of a hun
dred he isn't. An emergency is an unex
pected situationâ one that you, are not
prepared for. It is an occasion which
tests your Ingenuity.
In order to be ready for emergencies
you do not need tools In your pocket so
much as you need ideas in your head.
Under the former circumstances you are
a slave' to opportunity; under the latter
you are the master, and opportunity is
your genius of the lamp.
The old-fashioned housewife was one
whot stored all kinds of things away in
her attic and cellar, in the hope that they
might come in handy some day. Every
spring she tired her back looking them
over and dusting them off. Usually her
heirs inherited them and sold them for
junk, not appreciating in the slightest
degree her foresight or the dollar or two
which tho sale of them brought.
The new-fashioned housekeeper clears
out of her house all the useless stuff pos
sible. She wants time tollve. Her prob
lem Is, not how she shall prepare for
emergencies which perhaps may arise,
but how she shall fit herself to be equal
to the perplexities of to-day.
The acquisition of useless Information
amounts to the same thing. Only a ge
nius can afford to be a walking reference
library. Brains gather dust when they
are overcrowded. Just as bookcases or at
tics do.

ART BY H. P. BOWIE
CONRAD'S PLAY DISCUSSED
Council of Women Actively at Work
at Socialization of Schools.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
Interest in Japanese art has passed the
period of being a fashionable pose. It
'<= coming to mean something to the
lover of art besides furnishing a timely
topic for tea-table talk.
On next Friday afternoon Henry P.
Howie, unquc? tionably the highest author-.
Ity upon Japanese art among Americana,
will address the Sketch Club in its rooms
in the California Club, upon the subject
he knows so Intimately. /
Desirous of acquiring something of
Japanese art and literature. Mr. Bowie
went to the Land of the Chrysanthemum
some years ago, and entered upon the
serious study of the art of the countryâ
Â«.t the same time applying himself
ilillgectly to mastering the language.
So fascinated was he with the people,
i heir poetry a^id their expressions of art,
ihat he remained in Japan for five years,
working under the best painters of the
little kingdom. During that time. Mr.
Bowie exhibited pictures in the National
Art Exposition twice, and won two prizes
âan unheard of honor for a foreigner.
That Mr. Bowie will tell the Sketch Club
some interesting things next Friday
about the art of Japan is a foregone
conclusion, and every able-bodied club
member will be on hand to hear it.

The local Council of Women held its
usual monthly meeting for December on
Saturday, December 2. The committee
on the extended use of school yards re
ported that the number of workers on
said committee had been increased. The
frood work of the committee has reached
tome of the clubs. The interest expressed
by the Contemporary Club was manifest
ed by a donation of bats and bean bags
as a means o* equipping some school yard
with necessary apparatus.
A letter was received and read from the
American Civic Association requesting
the council to forward more of its re
ports on the socialization of the public
schools. It is evident from these reports
that existing: conditions unfit the school
houses for use at night. A general dis
cussion on the subject then followed. It
was- urged that the schools be opened, in
spite of Inconveniences, even for use not
immediately connected with schools. The
schools of London are thrown open night
ly and put to various uses.
The report ftom the civic section of
\h<? California Club was not read, us Mrs.
.\aron Schlcss was unable to be present.
The idea of reciprocity In civic work is
most desirable to the council, in a way
that it may lend its endeavors, working
on untrodden ground, instead of extend
ing the path of its usefulness over that
of some other club.
The programme concluded with a most
Oclishtful and interesting discourse by
I>r. Mary Roberts Smith on "Woman as
:in EScoaomle Factor." Dr. Smith is a

The Cozirad day given by the
section of the California Club was a fa
tniius success.
The story by Joseph Conrad's "To-Mor

lion by Mrs. lluddcm. The dramatic
reading was Riven by Miss KutJi Allen and
ricrbert Farjeon of the Alcazar and Miss

â¢with her breezy atmosphere, read the
t.irelcss adventurous vagabond's part
with an abandon that was fetching. Ma

was urged to impersonate the Invisible

it was most effective. Altogether the

of Postum Food Coffee that he wishes
me to express his thanks to you for the
pood you have done him. His waking 1
hours are taken tsp with his work, and
he has no time* to write himself.-
"He has been a great tea drinker all
his life and has always liked it strong.
"Tea has, of late years, acted on him
like morphine does upon most people.
At Jiret it soothed him. but only for an
hour or so, then It began to, affect his
nerves to such an extent that he could
not sleep at night, and he would go to
his work in" the morning wretched and
miserable from the loss of rest. This
condition grew constantly worse, until
his friends persuaded him, some four
months ago, to quit tea and use Postum.
"At first he used Postum only for
breakfast, but as he liked the 'taste ot
it, and it somehow seemed to do him
good, he added it to his evening meal.
Then, as he grew better, he began to
drink it for his noon meal, and how he
â¢ft-511 drink nothing else at table.--
"His condition is so wonderfully im-
j.roved during these 4 months that he
could not be hired to gi\e up Postum
and go back to tea. His nerves hare
become steady and reliable once more,
nnd his sleep is easy, natural and re-
freshing. He owes all this to Postum,
for he has taken no medicine and made
no other change in his diet. His broth-

firinking. was persuaded by us to give

Fred Schaer, a porter in a "Swiss hotel
at 455 Pine street, was stabbed in the
abdomen, hand and leg by Andrew Meier,
another porter, residing at 36(5 Natoma
street, in the barroom of the latter hotel
last nlsht. The cause of the affair, it
appears, was torment offered the man
who did the cutting. Schaer, who Is at
the Receiving Hospital, admits that he
angered the man who cut him and made
a statement to Assistant Bond and War
rant Clerk Flood and Detectives Conlan
and McGowan.
The wound received by Schaer almost
disembowled him. It was Very deep and
long and some of the intestines were
severed. It is likely that he will not
recover. When Meier was arrested he
had the knife still in his possession and
in the City Prison made the following
statement;
"I was intoxicated and slttlnsr In a
chair in the barroom of the hotel, when
several men started to taunt me. I ig
nored the taunts for several minutes, but
finally lost control of myself and slashed
at a man who T.'as near me."

the following: official statement:
My name is Fred Schaer. I live at 47S Pine

Delirious from nervous .troubles. Mrs.
M. Shafer of 73^ Gough street, a patient
at the French Hospital, escaped the vigi
lance of her 'nurse yesterday afternoon
and wandered aimlessly about the sand
dunes west of the hospital until she was
found late last night. Clad .in a night
robe and a wrapper, the sick woman
walked from the house and soon became
lost. \u25a0 ' .;-o
Early last evening it was discovered
that Mrs. Shafer was not in her room.
Excitement ran high among those re
sponsible for her. Her husband was com
municated with, the police notified and
a description of the woman left in all
of the publlc_.hOBpitals.
A searching party was sent out from
the French Hospital. For hours it
searched the surrounding neighborhood,
but not knowing at What time the patient
escaped, the members were at a loss to
know how far she might have wandered.
Every street and the sand dunes were
gone over and it was feared that the
woman, in a tit of nervousness, had slain
herself.
When darkness came the searchers be
came more anxious. It was about 11 p. m.
when the patient was found walking
calmly on a cross street in the rear of
the hospital. It is feared that she may
have taken cold and that complications
may set in. Her capture caused relief
among the hospital employes.

PAPERS ARE VAPID
Librarian W r elbank of Gen
tlemen's Sodality Deplores
Apparent Insincerity.
The annual meeting of the Gentlemen's
Sodality of St. Ignatius Church was held
yesterday afternoon, James R. Kelly, the
prefect, in the chair.. . '
In his annual report, the librarian of
the Sodality, John S. Welban.i, speaking
of the conditions of tho present day, said
among other things:
Few Catholic books make a name and the
best of them have a circulation far below
those published by non-Catholics. Catholic
authors flnd it hard to publish and to spread
thf-ir books, and for one Catholic book that is
published, a hundred non-Catholic books are
launched forth on the sea of literature.
Catholic newspapers all over the country are
struggling for an existence, where the vilest
and most Insipid newspapers flourish luxuri
antly, like weeds. All tho power of the press
teems to be in non-Catholic hands. Appar
ently those complaints are all true. But we
must not forget that the greater part of this
power of the press and the greater part of
what is really patent for good in literature has
Its AiltSmatfe source In the church of the past
and present. Unknown to them, the writers
of our age are drawing from the Catholic
treasury of the oast.
To the careful thinker in the great cities of
our nation who are \'ltally Interested In liter
ature and letters, the conditions on every side
are most discouraging.
Our secular papers and magazines are vapid
arid Insincere, there is nothing in our current
modern literature that appeals to cultured
minds. With few exceptions it is one vast
ocoan of sniEh. *
It has been remarked that as print grows
cheap, thinkers grow scarce. We arc to-day
literally deluged with books, but there Is a
woeful scarcity of men behind the books. : This
It Is which accounts for the short life of so
many literary efforts which on their initial ap
pearance were hailed as little short of master
pieces. : ' . : . :
Such books attain popularity partly because
they are well advertised, partly because - their
light and airy qualities appeal to the tastes of
semi-educated people; bu< mey fall to exert a
lasting Influence on minds.
Americans are commonly criticized by Euro
peans for valuing quantity more than quality.
Mere bigness, apart from intrinsic worth, capti
vates our attention and respect. This is par
ticularly noticeable In the popularity of -. our
Sunday newspapers. Is it not admitted by all
that the majority, of our American Sunday
newspapers, which alone furnish Ideas . to the
minds of the great body of our citizens, are
utterly demoralizing? , â¢ .
No Catholic of even average intelligence can
for a moment doubt that one of the greateet
needs of our age and country iÂ« an able, vigor
ous and outspoken \u25a0 paper that will supply an
antidote to the moral polÂ«on Instilled into the
minds of American citizens Sunday after Sun
day by the public press. ,
The decline of reading as a" recreation and
a means of Improvement among our people is
to <be deplored. The decline . of ' book reading
will be Impressed upon -any person who visits
one of cur public libraries In this "and i other
cities. There are few. Catholic books and Cath
olic writers for the very good reason that there
are few Catholic readers.*
It was unanimously resolved to have
the address printed; and ; distributed. :
The election resulted " in the choice of
James R. Kelly as prefect, John Coulson
first assistant prefect : and Maurice \u25a0 J.
Pope second assistant prefect. v

DRYDOCK AT PEXSACOLA
URGED FOR THE JfAVV
Chief Constructor Cnpps Belle%-es One
Should Be Bnllt at the Florida
Port.'
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.â Provisions
for the construction of a drydock' at
Pensacola, capable. of accommodating
the largest ships in the navy, is urged
by. Rear Admiral W. L. Capps. chief
constructor of the navy, ;in his annual
report made public to-day. The neces
sity arises, it is pointed out, from the
strategic importance of Pensacola. --
The report calls attention to the ex
pediency of sending the ships on the
Asiatic station home in divisions or
squadrons to navy yards on the Pacific
Coast for repair when in need of re
pairs.
"It Is believed," the chief constructor
adds, "that the effect on both the per
sonnel and material would justify such
an arrangement and the opportunity
for drill and the experience gained
from such long distance trans-oceanic
cruising would be quite as great as
that obtained from "shore cruises in
Asiatic waters." \u25a0 â¢

"HE H-E-A-R-S" â A prominent citizen's testi-
mony: â "Sly ear was for years TOTALLY
DEAF to the very LOUDEST spoken words;
LAST THURSDAY Rexradio quickly made
it DISTINCTLY HEAR sentences in an OR-
DINARY voice at TEN FEET distance, to
my great surprise and -delight. (Here Is the
testimony of the prominent WITNESSES: â
"WE WITNESSED Mr. Robinson's HEAR-
â¢ ING (as above CORRECTLY described),
while his, GOOD ear was securely CLOSED."
Signed, W. G BURKE (the eminent LAW-
YER recently elected CITY AND COUNTY
ATTORNEY): H. Clements, 330 Pine (the
well known PRESIDENT of the I. C. GOLD
MINING CO.), and otners.") On SATUR-
DAY last my hitherto TOTALLY DEAF ear
HEARD sentences WHISPERED at a dis-
tance, and spoken In a natural voice at the
great distance of FORTY- TWO FEET. The
elect City and County Attorney WITNESSED
â¢ this. As a further test Attorney Burke closed
my good ear to make cure it could not hear,
and then, as before, I clearly heard sentences
spoken and WHISPERED. I consider this
QUICK and LARGE benefit VERY MAR-
VELOUS. I am delighted. Up to this time
all physicians and remedies entirely FAILED
to help me. I will ANSWER all LETTERS
gladly. â William Robinson, 1101 Golden Gate
aye." NUMEROUS equally MARVELOUS?
results In TOTAL DEAFNESS are continual-
ly being made and any one can come and
SEE the cures being made. LAST WEEK a
DEAF MUTE (worse than a hundred cases
of simple DEAFNESS) clearly HEARD
and intelligibly SPOKE many WHIS-
PERED words, as WITNESSED by the be-
fore mentioned Attorney Burke," President
Clements, C. Engleke and many otherH.
NOTE THlS:â Rexradio has NEVER FAILED
to promptly benefit the VERY WORST cases of
TOTAL DEAFNESS, ana DEAF MUTEISM,
though eminent medical specialists had given
them up as HOPELESSLY INCURABLE. A
[ subject' of severe r GENERAL RHEUMA-"
TISM, who could only slightly raise the feet,
WALKED Slowly and with short steps, TES-
TIFIES:â "After ONE short treatment I feel
as if I had NEW LIMBS, and I have easily
RAISED each foot, .THREE FEET HIGH,
then freely RAN and JUMPED, which I
'could not do before." WITNESSES testi-
mony to the above: "The above is COR-
RECT. We saw it all. Signed: Attorney
Burke: President Clements 330 Pine: 1 C.
Engleke. 221 Steiner." The SAME WIT-
NESSES saw a case of severe NEURALGIA
entirely removed by a single MOMENT'S
touch of Rexradio's hand. MULTITUDES of
' precisely SIMILAR quick benefits in EX-
TKEME cases of RHEUMATISM. GOUTt
NEURALGIA, LUMBAGO " SCIATICA, etc.
Mr. C. Engleke, 221 Steiner (of CAL. DEMO-
KRATO, was INSTANTLY CURED Of 20
. years' severe RHEUMATISM, and to. -date
remains PERFECTLY WELL, a' period of
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DAYS.
(You Eee. these cures ; L-A-S-T.) LAST-
THURSDAY, in presence \u25a0 of the above wit-
nesses, Mr. Engleke showed how vigorously
and easily he can still RUN, LEAP, etc Tho
several PARALYTIC and LOCOMOTOR
ATAXIA patients who were^NSTANTLY en-
abled to RUN and LEAP, as here recently de--
scribed by Mr. Engleke. CONTINUE able to

ETHICAL VIEWS
Rev. John Hemphill Says
Christ Opposed None Who
Were Not Against Him
DEPLORES NARROWNESS
Thinks Unitarians Should
Have Been Admitted to
Recent Church Federation
The Rev. John Hemphill delivered a
strong sermon during the morning'
services at the Calvary Presbyterian
Church yesterday mqrning. His topic
was "The Tolerant Master arttl the In
tolerant Disciples," and his ' remarks
had reference to the recent rejection of
the Unitarians from federation with
other churches.
Choosing Luke ix:49-60, - . "Master,
we saw one, casting out \u25a0 devils in thy
name, and we forbade him because he
followeth not with us. And Jesus said,
forbid him not> for he that is not
against us is for us," the eminent
divine spoke as follows:
"The x disciples were high c-.urchmen,
the Master was a low churchman; The
disciples were narrow; the Master was
broad. The disciples did not ,want to
see good done, unless it was done" their
"way; the Master rejoiced when it*,was
done any way. The disciples wer&yn
tolerantf the Master was tolerant. JThe
disciples said, 'We forbade him': the
Master said, 'forbid him not, for he
that is' not against us is for us.' It
is impossible- to narrow ' the scope of
these grand words. Laying his hand
-Upon all goodness by whomsoever done,
and upon all truth by whomsoever
taught, Christ said, they belong to me.
You may not. call yourself a follower
of mine, you may not cast out -devils
in my way, but cast them out in your
own way. I forbid thee not, for he
that is not against me is for me.'
"Christ . reorganized all. that was good
and true in the heathenism, found in the
world when he came into it and specially
commended the faith of two pagans: The
faith of the Roman centurion and of tTle
Syro-Phoenlcian mothprâ 'l have not
found so great faith, no, not in Israel.'
OXE CHURCH REJECTED.
"There was hejd recently In New York
City a council of 'federated churches. The
representatives of one church knocked
for admission and the door was slammed
In their face. I am personally very sorry
at the action that â¢ was taken. I ,was
elected as a member of that council, but
could not attend. I am glad how that I
could not; I think I have always stood
for the orthodox view of the person and
work of my Lord and Master. I so stand
now. I expect so to stand before the bar
of God. Yet, I am profoundly eorry at
the action of the federated churches.
They did not' meet to discuss theologies.
They could not discuss them. They are
not agreed about thejn. They met to
discuss ethical questions for the uplifting
of the race and It was a blunder which
was worse than a crime to shut out men
who in ethical /matters are at least
abreast of the best of us. It is not the
Master's way â 'Forbid them not, for .he
that is not against us is for us.'<. . \u25a0;. ;
"Let us in the next place .apply the
principle underlying our text to:eome of
the movements of our day. Let us apply
it to science, which for the most part is
disdainfully silent, and in- some â¢ leases
fiercely hostile, to the claims of Christi
anity. .Yet the scientist is doing a grand
work for the glory of God and the good
of men and God is guiding him in the
doing of It. He is slow to confess his
faith in a personal God, who 'thinks and
loves, but I do not -look upon his work
as a bit of uncontrolled i atheism* beyond
the control of God's guiding: hand.
"The pillar cloud of the Divine Guid
ance is still ahead of it and will surely
lead it out of .the desert of atheism and
materialism arid Into the promised land
of our hopes and expectations.
SCIENCE IS GOOD.
"Whatever science mayibe in theory/in
practice it is in harmony with the will of
God. Christ cast out devils, and science
is casting out a' whole lot of them and
working out in manifold ways the re
demption of men from the evil -captivities
which have so long enthralled them. 'The
conflict between science and religion'? I
can see none. Science is doing : God's
work and moving. on to God's end. For
bid it not, for he that is not. against us
Is for us. " " ..
"'God can use queer instruments for the
achievement of his ends â war, for exam
ple. War is a bad thing; it is hell, as
General Sherman said. The war between
Russia and Japan was * a bad thing,
brought on by the national ambition and
pride and broken pledges of v Russian
beaurocrats, who promised to get out of
Manchuria and never intended to get out.
Yet God will bring great good to Russia
out of that war. Indeed, it has already
partly come. Russia Is feeling to-day the
birth-pangs of liberty.
"Let us apply the principles underlying
our text to the labor unions and socialis
tic movements of our day. We say they
are riiot Christian, but history tells me
that the Christian church has sometimes
been less Christian than some of thÂ«
movements upon which she as looked
down . with Pharisaic disdain.
SOME PLAIN QUESTIONS.
"Did Christ so smile upon wealth,' did
he so bless full fed Dives and so curse
starved Lazarus, that - we should -. call
movements unchristian whose ruling pas
sion is to champion, in however blind and
mistaken a fashion, the rights of the poor
and to protest against ; the" concentration
of wealth In the hands of a few men who
are too often callous and indifferent to.
the responsibilities of wealth? There may,
be a broad line of .distinction between'
Christ and the brazen-faced "walking

ROBBERS SHOOT
THEIR VICTIM
Symon Franco Is Fired Upon
When He Offers 'Resistance
to Two Young Hold-Up Men
WOUNDED IN SHOULDER
Pfespei'ate Battle Between
Scavenger and Two Thieves
in Dark on Potrero Avenue
Symon Franco, a scavenger living at
13 Potrero avenue, was held up by ; two
robbers last niiht on Potrero avenue and
shot through the left shoulder. Franco
had a sum of money on his person when
accosted by the thugs. Loth to .lose his
coin, ha put up a light. While he was
gxappllnjr with the thug : who was at
tempting to riJle his pocketÃ, the, other
robber shot him through . the shoul
der. "â¢'. Franco says the robber
fired point blank at his' head, but he
ducked and received the ball in ; the
shoulder. \u25a0
B'ranco attended a ball on Potrero ave
nue and was returning, home. When be
tween Eighteenth and- Nineteenth streets
he was suddenly confronted | by, two
masked men. "Throw up > your .hands,
and be â âquick aboiitit," was the com
mapd. Franco's hands went; â¢ u'p^; but
when he felt the thief's fingers rummag
ing through his pdekets, 1 he. demurred and
a terrifle struggle ensued. ' Franco dealt
one, of the robbers a vicious blow in the
face. Stunned, the thief staggered. Then
his confederate aimed his . revolver at
Franco's head and fired. Franco ducked
when hft saw the weapon go up to his
head. To this fact he owes his life. After
the shot rang out, the robbers turned
and fled, leaving Franco, who had fallen
to the street, for dead. Franco got up,
called for help, and receiving no response,
made his way to the Potrero Hospital,
where he was treated by Dr. William
Buell. His wound is not . considered
serious.
Franco describes his assailants as being
young and bearing the - proverbial dis
parity in size. i-fS.i'^u

THE PUBLIC IS AFFECTED
much more than the manufacturer
by adulteration and substitution.
Especially is this so when witch
hazel is purchased instead of
POND'S" EXTRACT, a trted
and true extract of hamamelis, and
the only one of standard strength
and purity.
CAUTION.
Witch Hard is not " the same thing "
as POND'S EXTRACT. On amlysi*
of 70 samples of witch hazel, bought of
leading wholesale and retail druggists and
department stores, 52 contained Wood
Alcohol (poison) or Formaldehyde (poi-
son), or both, and not one of the other 18
was up to the required standard of strength.
The peril of these poisons may be avoided
by the exclusive use of

KNOCKED DOWN
BY MILK WAGON
Clarence Soliler. Agent for
Eastern Paper. Deprived of
Power of Sight and Sound
Clarence Sohler, Pacific Coast agent for
the Police Gazette, -lost his vision and
hearing last night by a peculiar accident.
The injured man was knocked down and
run over by a milk wagon belonging to
the Jersey Dairy Farm. The accident oc
curred at the corner of Van Ness and
Golden Gate avenue about 7 o'clock. He
was thrown heavily to the ground, sus
taining a fracture of the skull that re
sulted in the total loss of hearing and a
distortion of his sight. .
Sohler was crossing the, street with a
triend when the milk wagon rounded the
corner at a speedy clip. Sohler's friend
stepped back, but he himself was not
quick enough. The horse struck him full
and he was thrown violently to the
street. Both wheels passed over t,he un
fortunate man, one over his skull and
the other across his body.
Willing hands picked Sohler up and
he was carried into Drucker's drugstore,
where he was treated by Dr. Maddren.
Dr. Maddren advised his immediate re
moval to the' Central Emergency Hospi
tal.
At the hospital it was discovered that
Sohler could not hear and could only see
in a distorted manner. Dr. Frank J. Tlll
man and Chief Surgeon Millar say that
Sohler hais undoubtedly a fracture of the
skull and a hemorrhage of the brain. The
blood pressure has been exerted upon the
frontal portion of the cerebrum wherein
are located the auditory and visual cen
ters. Nothing will relieve; the pressure
on those centers and restore the lost
senses but an operation of trephining,
which will allow the blood- clots to be
removed. ,
Sohler is 40 years of age and lived at
519 Golden Gate avenue. He Was re
moved to Mt. Zion Hospital, where he will
be operated upon.
The driver was found to be B. Lynch
of 'SVJ Howard street. Lynch is em
ployed by the Jersey Dairy Farm. He
will _be arrested and with bat
tery.

SEES FLOATING CORPSE
While Trying to Grasp Body
From Ocean a Swell Rises
and He Is Thrown Into Sea
As he was stretching to grasp a
corpse that was floating- in the ocean
near the Cliff House yesterday G. \V.
Cookingham " of 54 Sixth' street was
washed into the sea and had a narrow
escape from a watery grave. The prompt
work of Captain Varney and his life sav
ing crew rescued Cookingham from, his
perilous position.
Cookinghiiin went to the beach yester
day morning- to lish. I?e located himself
on a rock under the Cliff House and there
past his line into the water. It was
shortly after 9 o'clock that Cookingham
noticed ah object floating in toward him.
As it came nearer he saw it was a corps*.
From the rock â¢ where lie was seated he
reached out to catch the floater. A swell
came up and washed him into the sea.
He was able to swim and reached the
r<x-k, but it was too steep for him "to
climb. There was no other landing place
t'> which he could swim with any safety,
and he was likely to be washed Up against
the rocks and rendered helpless. He
clung, to the line from which he was
listing and held there until he got as
sistance.
People from th"c Cliff House witnessed
'the 'man's perilous plight and an effort
was made to give him aid. A. .rope wag
procured, but it was not long enough. All
this time he was clinging for' his life to
the rock and any moment he was in
danger of being-, washed into the sea or
probably thrown up against the cliff and
mangled. â¢' . '
The life station crew was notified an<3
a few seconds later the sturdy rescuers
had launched a boat and started toward
the Cliff House. When they had reached
Cookingham he was nearly exhausted.
They pulled him into the boat and rowed
back to the life saving station, where
he was given dry clothes.

Show. -at .the O'FiiiTell-Street
House Is Well Worth
Seeing.
â¢See the show at the'Orpheum this week.
The feature of the bill is hard to pick,
as several of the numbers stand out fore
most in their line. John T. Thome and
Grace Carletdh, down on the programme,
as The American Jesters, have a bundle
of stuff that will make the most harden
ed crank giggle until he is sick. They
have an assortment of material that
seemed to hit- the audience right last
night and they had a* hard time bringing
their turn to an end, as the audience
wanted more.
Charley Case is still on the bill, but
is entirely new to those who saw him
last week. In his- black face, make-up
he has a bunch of dry humor that will
make good any place. His stories about
his father are full of wit.
Two old timers, Raymond Finlay and
Lottie Burke, furnish some high class
fun that was highly appreciated. Mon
sieur Paulo and Mile. Marlow are clever
in their sparkling novelty, "A French
Frappe." Paulo possesses a ilch voice,
which he uses to advantage. The Bell
elaire brothers,- models of physical man
hood, give < a wonderful exhibition of
strength and skill. Along with the few
holdovers the programme is one of ex
cellence?
Chutes.
"Princess Fan Tan," Bothwell Browne's
delightful Japanese musical extrav
aganza iii two acts," was revived at the
Chutes yesterday and 'was received with
great enthusiasm by packed houses, both
afternoon and evening. Nearly 300 talent
ed children, headed by, Eunice Gilman, In
the title role, appear in the production
and the beautiful ballets, catchy songs
and bright specialties in which. the piece
abounds go to make up a varied and
most pleasing ' entertainment. "Jasmine
Sidlowski, the tiniest i toe dancer before
the public, was applauded to the, echo for
her work and the Champagne Dance
from the Silver Slipper, executed by a
dozen young misses, proved a particu
larly captivating number. "Princess Fan
Tan," which offers good entertainment
for old as well as young, will be repeated
every -afternoon and evening for this
week only, 1 giving way next Monday to
a sumptuous revival of. "Cleopatra Up
To Date."

BEAUTIFUL
SERVICE AT
DEDICATION
PASTOR OF THE HAMILTON M.
fE CHURCH WHICH WAS DEDI
CATED YESTERDAY.
Hamilton Methodist
.'\u25a0\u25a0Church 1 . Almost
Out of Debt.
The dedication of Hamilton Methodist
Episcopal Church yesterday was attended
by exercises which were beautiful and in
strict harmony with the auspicious occa
sion.
The new church is situated on Waller
street,* corner of Belvedere," and its sim
ple but substantial construction appealed
strongly to the great body of worshipers
that attended the three services. Bishop
John W. Hamilton, LL. D.; the Rev. G.
Avery Reeder, the pastor; the presiding
elder, the Rev. WinfieldS. Matthew, D.
D.; Dr. P. D. Bovard, editor of the Chris-,
tian Advocate; Rev. Dr.rE. R. Dille, Dr.
Wilson of China, Rev. Dr. Dyer of lowa,
Rev. Dr. G. W. White, Rev. Dr. Cheno
wyth and Rev. C. O. Oxnam, whose work
when pastor of the Hamilton Church did
much to bring about the happy results
of yesterday,, took part in the .services.
Greetings were brought from other
churches, among them being the kindly
wishes of Howard Presbyterian Church,
through its pastor. Rev. A. J. Thomas,
"and of Park Congregational Church,
through the pastor, the Rev. T. L. Earle.
Rev. W. P. Stanley conveyed greetings
i from Sebastopol, California.
.Bishop Hamilton in 'his sermon at the
morning service said in part:
' Christianity is the beautiful harmony ot reve
lation of nature. It's the world's natural re
ligion. It Is not a theory- or knowledge, nor a
Byptpm of philosophy nor a rule of llvllng. It
is the knowlQilKe Itself, the philosophy Itself.
; the living Itself. It Is the truth, the way, the
But we are so' aelf-wlllua we are all inclined
to have our own' notions of . truth, our. own
ways, our own lives. The most difficult task
is to secure such nelghbuny agreements as to
make it possible for us to live together.
The movement for federation Is a new move
ment, but It is a great movement in the right
direction. This \a- the â¢ growing aspiration of
the rrhrittian people. It will bring a nearer
approach to the one right truth, the. one right
way and the one right life.
This Is the demand of Christianity. The con
ditions of Christian discipleshlp are not ?o
much, intellectual as matters of love, and love
demands types of Innocence, simplicity and
faith. Disciples are learners, followers and
teachers but love is a key to all right learning.
It is the basis of loyalty and the only inspira
tion of righteous instruction.
' As an illustration of loyalty let us note Gari
baldi's address to the army: "Soldiers, .what I
I have to offer you is fatigue, danger, struggle
land death; the chill of the cold;nlght in the
'\u25a0 tiff air and heat under the burning sun; no
lodgings*. ,no munitions, .no provisions, but
forced marches, dangerous watch posts and the
contbiuul struggle' with the bayonet against
batteries. Those who . love - freedom and their
country may follow me."
The evening services were . largely, at
tended andr the. greatest enthusiasm was
evinced during; the whole of the exercises,
in which Bishop Hamilton, Dr.' Dille."| the
Rev. ? Mr; .Bender, f-D'r.\,E..R. -Willis and
