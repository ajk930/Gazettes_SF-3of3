BOSTOX.Oot. 6.â With only one voice
raised in opposition, the Republicans
of UassaLctaxsetts in State convention
to-day declared for a revision of the
tariff. Contrary to expectations, the
radical wiv.g ol the party, under the
leadership of FXsgene Jf. Foss of Boston,
did not oflfer a substitute for the plank
in the platform relating to the tariff, al
though â¢in a speech to the delegates
i'oes declared thÂ«it the revision of the
tariff favored in the State platform -was
not sufficiently wide in its scope. Foss
eaui, however, that he and his follow
ers \u25a0srere encouraged at the concession
made to them und-that next year they
would expect to have the convention ac

One of the surprisesicame when Gen
eral William F. Draper, former Embaa
subor to Italy and a leading: member
of the Home Market Club, opposed in a
vigorous speech the adoption of the
tariff revision plank of the platform..
rO^neral Draper said he would not offer
toy substitute plank, for the , reasoii
that he knew there, was no chance of
bis or any other substitute being: ac
cepted. General Draper contended that
taritf revision would be followed by
financial and commercial depression,
and. spealiing- us a manufacturer, he
could see no reason why there should
be a revision. , -
The platform presented by the com
mittee on resolutions was adopted with
out amendment and contained, in brief,
an indorsement of the administration
of President Roosevelt, special mention
being made of his part in bringing
about peace between Russia and Japan
and of his enfoicen.ent of the laws pre
venting: corporations from oppressing:
the people; a resolution favoring the
enactment by Congress of tariff pro
vision which shall . protect American
markets against discrimination anfi se

A feature of the day's proceedings
\u25a0*vr.s the address of Senator Henry Cabot
Lodge. Senator Loditfe took the plat
form to reply to Eugene N. Foss, who
had advocated the free admission ot
coal, hides and raw materials. Fos*
severely scored the Massachusetts Sen
f liters and Representatives In Congress,
Â» charjrlsff that they were not loyal. to
the Interests of Massachusetts.
Senator Lodge In a parliamentary
manner censured Foss for his strictures
on the Massachusetts representation at
the capital. Lodge also said that the
time for tariff revision waÂ« the time
â¢when the Republican .â¢ party was in
por'r. He argued that "free raw ma
terials" was hut another term. for free
traSe and that the admission of raw
materials would sound the death knell
of reciprocity ns well as protection.
Exigent* TC. Foss, a le/ider of the
reciprocity wing of the State Republi
can party, to-night. Issued a, statement
!n which he criticized the speech of
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge at to-day's
Republican State convention. In ' his
statement Foss classed the speech as
"a direct insult to a majority of the
Republican voters In the State." He
declared that the speech , of Senator
Lodge would cost Curtis Guild Jr., the
nominee for Governor, thousands of
votes* r

Fear That Under Arrange

HAVANA, Oct. 6.â Following the pub
lication this evening of tne text of the
ten-year treaty of commerce and naviga
tion between Cuba- and Great Britain,
the ratification of which is now pend
ing in the Senate, the Havana Chamber
of Commerce gave : out for publication
the text of the - report made by it to
the Foreign Relations Committee in re
sponse to a request for advice as to
whether the treaty ought to be ratified
and which declares emphatically 'against
ratification. >' . \u25a0_.'.â¢;-,"./ ', , : .",',:,/..".",'
The" report of the .Chamber .of.i' Co
mmerce says that as Cuba has few mer
chant ships and no warships the recip
rocal privileges grant eery fey â¢= England
would whoUy.be in favor of British ves
sels, in Cuban waters and would probably
have the effect' of seriously _\ shortening
the revenues of Cuba since* Cuba has
not enough revenue ships to watch her
coasts.s ts. At the same ti me j Cuba, was not
in a position to enlarge her marine ser
vice while the treaty would be effective
in extending encouragement^'H the other
contracting party to enterifea.Jts marine
service. Under such an arra\ Jement the
Cuban marine' service probably* would
entirely disappear. The report goes on
to say that the liberty of "pertrecharse"
la Spanfsh term meaning the resupplying
of vessels with munitions of war) granted
by the treaty to British warships would
be likely to involve Cuba In most un
welcome complications, especially since
there was no modifying clause for . the
observance of the law of International
neutrality In the event of war. Cuba
would not be benefited by such a con
vention with a frea trade nation. This,
the report says, is especially true at the
moment when a treaty of navigation with
the United States has been projected,
the intention of which is the concession
of mutual tariff reduction on products
carried in American and Cuban ihips.
The chamber, iwhich is composed of
leading Spanish and Cuban , merchants,
holds that Cuba should look to the
United States for the securing of mutual
tariff favors Instead of making conces
sions wholly favorable to the other con
tracting power.

GROW FRIENDLY
Talk of an Understanding
Between Great Britain and
Kussia in Kegard to Asia
SUPPORTED BY PAPERS
France and Germany May Be
Included in Agreement to
Preserve Peace of Europe
LONDON, Oct. 6. â Following closely
upon the publication of the text of the
Anglo-Japanese treaty has come con
siderable .talk of the possibility of an
understanding between Great Britain
and Russia. All the newspapers ane de
voting columns to the discussion of the
question, pointing out that if Russia
is sincere in her expression of a desire
for peace in Central Asia there is no
reason why the two ancient enemies
should not come to an agreement that
will not only assure peace, but clear
away the suspicions leading to fric
tion which have existed for years.
That negotiations with this object
in view are pending seems possible,
though definite official confirmation is
lacking. Color Is lent to the rumors
that have been afloat by the recent
frequent visits paid to the Foreign Of
fice by the Russian Embassador since
hts return from his holidays a fort
night ago, and the fact that Foreign
Secretary Lansdowne. who returned
from his vacation to publish the text
of the Anglo-Japanese treaty, has re
mained at his office continually since
then.
Count Benckendorff, the Russian Em
bassador, had r long interview with
Lord Lansdowne at the Foreign Office
yesterday and the latter left London
immediately afterward for Balmoral,
Scotland, where Premier Balfour is
present as Minister in attendance to
King Edward. Of course, the visits of
the Russian Embassador to the For
eign Office may have been connected
with Emperor Nicholas* invitation to
Great Britain to participate in the sec
ond peace conference at The Hague,
but Great Britain had already an
swered his Majesty's preliminary invi
tations. -;-."\u25a0\u25a0â¢,
It is thought here that the present
is an opportune moment for reaching a
better understanding between the two
countries, both the British and Russian
papers having etrongly advocated It for
the past week. The position of the
British Government was clearly stated
in a speech delivered Jby Gerald Bal
four, president of the local Govern
ment Board, yesterday, in which he
said:
Great Britain has no intention of making
arrresslve movements In Central Asia. Our
object i* defense and not defiance, and If the
Kussian Government desires to come to an
understanding with us with reference to our
respective Interests In that part of the world
it will not find the British Government back
ward In readiness to consider any proposals
which it mlcht desire to put forward.
The newspaper discussions have
reached a much wider range and in
clude suggestions for agreements
which, if carried out and lived up to,
would make Europe a family In which
there would be no differences. One of
the suggestions which most appeals to
British officialdom and the London
press is that Russia. Germany and
France should subscribe to the terms
of the Anglo-Japanese treaty. It is
pointed out that If they are sincere in
their protestations of a desire for
peace in Asia, there is no reason why
they should not subscribe to- a treaty
which has this object In view.
The suggestion that Great Britain
should more fully recognize Russia's
position in Southern Turkey has not
been given much consideration in Lon
don, though possibly this may be one
of the points on which the agreement,
if reached, will be based, and it may
be a return for Russian guarantees of
her often-repeated assertion that she
does not desire to advance any fur
ther toward the Indian frontier.
The public in Great Britain -would
welcome an understanding which
\u25a0would put an end to the freauent pe
riods of unrest and consequent un
friendly relations with Russia.

NEW YOBK. Oct. 6.â Closing, a week,
every day -of which has produced a
stnsation that has stirred tho country,
the special ' legislative committee in
vestigating 4kÂ« methods of insurance
companies adjourned to-day until Tues
day of next week, the sessions to be
held Tuesdajv Wednesday and, Thur
sday, instead of Wednesday. Thursday
and Friday as heretofore. This change
was made because Friday is registra
tion day in this State and the members
of the various committees desire to be
present in their various districts.
When the investigation opened' to
day it was expected that the president
of the Mutual Life w.ould be called to
the stand before tha day was over. By
a misunderstanding, however, President
McCurdyJhad- left the. office of the
Mutual Life before he' was called for,
and it is expected that he will be the
first witness on Tuesday. . \ '
In to-day's testimony i sensational
developments were brought, out when
Hughes, of the Investigating commit
tee, demanded the pay roll of the ex
ecutive officers of the Mutual Life com
pany. This was produced and showed
the various salaries of these" officers
since 1877. For theyear 1904 President
McCurdy received $150,000; two vice
presidents were paid $50,000 each, a
second vice-president $17,000, the third
vice president $10,000 and; the general
manager $25,000. The general manager
this year will receive $30,000 and the
treasurer $60,000., '
MANY RELATIVES FAVORED.
Robert McCurdy, the general man
ager, said he never . knew \u25a0 the salary
of his- father until to-day, when he
heard it read in 'the committee room.
He thought, however, that there Bhould
be no limit to the salary of such posi
tions,-because they should be in ac
cordance with -the accumulations of the
company.
When asked if it -was any benefit
to the policy-holder to , Increase the
president's salary McCurdy said he
thought the trustees had considered
that when they. had increased the pres
ident's BHlary. â¢ No increase/ : ho.wever,
had been considered When he was pres
ent at the trustees' meetings. ;,'\u25a0
Earlier in. the day, when McCurdy
was on the stand. Hughes tried to brinqr
out why C H. Raymond Si Co.. the-local
agents, and the partners of the- firm
received larger emoluments from.. the
business than any other agency. )\u25a0 Mc-
Curdy said he did not suuvwhat The
baud, a raeuibur of the firm, received
from tho business and had never talked
to him about his personal affairs. He
said it was "a large reward for large
achievements" and that all' businesses
of large magnitude were built upon
that principle.". ; .
By McCurdy's testin?ony r .;,-it . was
brought out \ that George Raymond, a
brother of Charles H. Raymond, was the
general agent .'for, New Jersey; that
Howard Lewls.^the, general .agent . for
Northern New York, with an office in
Albany, wasa cousin of either the vice
president. Mr. Oranniss. or Mrs. Gran- 1
niss; that Dr. "B. J. Moss, the medical
director ot the Mutual Life, t married a
sister of the president/ ot the company
and that P. Stuyvokant^Pillot, an in
spector of risks, is 'a cousin of Louis
Thebaud. son-in-law of President Mc-
Curdy and a partner ln^the Raymond
Urm.'
G. W. White, a secretary of the com
pany, whom McCurdy was asked about,
he said, was no relative of any officer
of the company, but that Mrs. , White
was a niece of Mrs. Granniss, wile of
Vice President Granniss.
Lawyer Beck, the Mutual's counsel,
here stepped forward and said: "If to
be related to the officers of an insur
ance' company in a crime. President
Roosievelt will have to modify his race
mi if idfi theory." . '
'It ,i? not a crime." retorted Senator
Armstrong, chairman of the investigat
ing committee, "it is merely ridiculous."
CAMPAIGN COXTRIBUTIOXS.
At one" point in the day's testimony
much Interest was manifested when ' the
expenditures of the company were taken
up. An auditor of the Mutual Life, C.
A. Preller, was on the stand, and he \u25a0
was asked aÂ« to the method of recording
the expenditures. It was gathered . that
these were passed upon by an expendi
ture committee, of which Robert Oly
phant was chairman. Three entries on
the book of payments to Olyphant of
$25,000 each were looked Into, but no
connection could be gleaned. Preller
was asked about the campaign contri
bution to the Republican Congressional
Committee, which was disclosed yester
day, but he said none had come under
his observation. The $25,u00 .'contribution
to the Congressional committee was
looked for when the ledgers were pro
duced, but up to adjournment this after
noon this had" not jbeen found.
It was brought out that when a gen
eral agency is changed to a salaried
agency the renewal of commissions called
for in the contracts under a general
agency are still paid to the salaried
agent. The Raymond firm was '-not
changed to . a salaried agency because
the contract with C. H. Raymond &
Co., which expired In 1904, was continued
through 1905. So far as McCurdy knew,
he said, there was no reason why this
agency should not have been changed
to a salaried agency in 1900. He was. not
general manager then ana was not fa
miliar with the affairs of the Â»company
at that time.
Witness' reason for extending the con
tract through 1905 was because for the
five previous years the firm had been'
writing $17,000,000 insurance a year. The
firm had six branch ofllces and he want
ed, in competition with the New York
Life and the Equitable,, to continue to
establish branch offices. He figured: the
cost would be 5150,000, and. he could not
very. well ask the Raymond firm to put
up that money when they, had but a
year> contract. He therefore entered an
agreement to have the Mutual Life j pay
this expense and guarantee the uaymond
firm $17,000,000 business.
BIG COMMISSIONS PAID.^
The firm wa3 then receiving. 87}$
per cent of Its first-year " premiums.
Subsequently this was raised to: 85 per
cent of first-year premiums, in con
sideration of the firm's allowing certain
concessions to the company in develop
ing the agency, business- and with ithe
expectation of converting this agency
to a salaried one at^the end of 1905," he
extended \ the contract... Witness said
there Is a constant effort to. reduce ex
penses, but to reduce expenses Is usual
ly to reduce the business. - \u25a0' \u25a0â¢'\u25a0\u25a0*
Witness said, that last year: the Mu
tual Life Company, ; wrote ' $26,000,000
worth of*. business more. than:;in*the
previous year," and "the expens.es ~ were
reduced at a ratio of :2 "per cent.- The
total receipts for 1904 were J51.002.954
and the total expenses $16,898,456. ;Tne

WASHINOTQN. Oct. 6.â Several impor
tant questions; were discussed at" to-day's
Cabinet meeting: At the conclusion , of
the session it waa announced "officially."
that- no -details of . the ,dUcuasioji_"cauld.
be made public and that such lnforma.-.
tion as it was deemed proper for the
public to have would 'be given to' the
newspaper" men "by^ Secretary 'Â£ibeb. . '"\u25a0':-
Despite the injunction [of secrecy ; it is
learned that action" waa taken- on two 'or
three; important matters and that others
were considered. >
The monopoly enjoyed by the Mer
chants* Bridge Company :of St | Louis ! of
bridge and ferry routes across j the | MiÃ-'
sissippi River was considered at length;
The Attorney . General , made the follow
ing statement ) of | the'jacuon taken: .â¢; :
"It was determined by the; President
that upon the complaint â¢ pÂ«nding in the
Department of Justice against tho mon
opolization - of; the ij two -briflges and = the
ferry across the .-,.- Mississippi into , St.
Louis, appropriate action should bÂ« . bo
gun by the Attorney General." . : .
Mr. Moody said he could "not say what
action he ; might , consider^ "appropriate."
He did not know, he said, .whether the
action "would ;look to -the forfeiture of
thor charter', of the Merchants' Bridge
Company or not, as he would j have to go
over the. Jaw. -bearing upon the matter
before : reaching : any '\u25a0 determination. ;'
â¢ \u25a0 Considerable attention was devoted ,. by
tho - meeting i. to = consideration of ques
tions" arising, from , complaints of tho
Chinese , Government that Its subjects
were unjustly against by
the States at; the; ports'* 'of this
country. Secretaries Root, Taft and
Metcalf have given much time to. this
question', and,; with the President, they
participated, in the discussion. - . ." /
After the discussion regarding Chinese
emigration to this country it was de
termined that no -changes or modifica
tions in conflict with | instructions to
United States Consuls . contained in the
circular issued several months ago. by
the President's direction will be made.
It was "deflnltely decided that the man
agement of the Isthmian Canal should
remain under Secretary , Taft. . â¢ -
I Secretary. Wilson brought -to the at
tention of the President "and the Cabinet
a determination he had reached' regard-
Ing the Inspection of meats. He indicated
that .under the law meat packers could
not bo forced to pay the â¢ cost of meat
inspeption. He decided,^ however,' , that
hereafter, tha packers, should' pay for the
seals or tags placed upon inspected meats'
intended for export. ; This: will bring "a/
revenue to the Department of agriculture
of nearly *50,0Q0 a year. Thie sum 5 the
Secretary proposes to expend in extend
ing the inspection of meats to packing
houses which 'have requested that/they
be given inspectors, :buf. whose requests
haVe^nqt^een; compHed i .with because the
'department' "had not.had* the funds : with',
which to pay : the inspectors. The idea
of Secretary Wilson'j was approved } by.
the Cabinet and it will ', be, put into *>p-;

Liabilities Exceed the AuaetH.
ST. LOUIS, ' Oct. fl.â The report or Receiver
Fred Essen of the People's \ United States
Uank'shotvis an excess of liabilities over assets
amounting to $108,002^ - according to book
values, while the estimated' values make It
$187,338. \u25a0 .
usual ratio of expense was estimated at
about 25 per cent.
\u25a0' It was the impression of the wit
ness that the general: agency in .Texas
received as high compensation as C. H.
Raymond & Co. Higher commissions
were allowed in New York and Texas
than anywhere / else, because it cost
more to get the business. '^V;^'
"Don't you think you could get Mr.
Thebaud's services for $100,000?"
Hughes asked. v
' "I; suppose If he did not have a con
tract" â¢
"Ifcon't you think you could get them
for $50,000 instead of $147,000 that he
secured from Raymond & Co. last
year?" Hughes continued. i
"I am not sa sure; of that," the wit
ness replied.
An entry, of; $25,000 under law ex- :
penses, payable to ;r; r Robert Olyphant,
chairman of the committee on expendi
tures, Auditor Preller knew â¢ nothing
about. Authorizing- this expenditure,:
witness received a voucher : signed by
Olyphant as chairman of the commit
tee. He had no idea what that payment
was for nor what two other entries of
$25,000 each, paid to I Robert Olyphant,
the last one on November 9, 1904, were
expended for. [ â¢ ; % â¢
The minutes of the expenditures com
mittee, .which were .then produced,
showed that the $25,000 items were' paid
to Robert Olyphant for ; law. : Witness
knew nothing further C regarding i it..
Preller Baid his own salary is $10,000
a year. .Witness was \u25a0\u25a0 asked where the
$2500 paid to the - Republican Congres
sional Committee was entered. . He said
he did -not know. Hughes then de
manded the presence of the man in the
company who knows how the $2500
campaign contribution was booked.

OF WRECKED STEAMSHIP ST. PAUL SAFELY TO THIS PORT
Passengers and the crew of the steamship C:St Paul,, fifty-one persons in all, arrived in this port yesterday on the Pomona. These
were taken from Lightship N0.,83 and the Tug Ranger. The rest of the passengers /were' landed at Eureka: Though one woman nearly
collapsed while being transferred in a 'lifeboat to the. lightship,, all reached here in good spirits. The Wrecked ship is still on the rocks.

HORSE LEFT TO
DIE ON VESSEL
After being buffeted about through
the mist on an angry sea for hours,
fifty-one of the passengers and crew of
the wrecked steamship St. Paul were
brought to this city on the Pomona yes
terday. Three boatloads were taken
from Point Brunt Lightship No. S3, and
thirteen people were taken from the
tug Ranger. The rest have been landed
safely at Eureka.
The experience that the passengers
of the St. Paul underwent would be a
hard one from the point of view or
strons men Inured to hardships.
There were women and babies among
the passengers on the St. Paul, but
none of those who were landed from
the Pomona look much the worse for
their perilous experience. Good disci
pline and presence of mind on the part
of officers and crew prevented a panic
i which would have resulted In horrors
inconceivable.
Of course when the St. Paul went
crashing on to the rocks there was a
wild rush to the decks. As the passen
gers appeared they were given life
preservers. Nothing: could be seen
throug-h the mist, but the ominous
boom of the surf told that the vessel
was in a sore plight. Through the
holes the jagged rocks had bitten, the
green seas rushed, filling the engine
rooms and driving the crew to the up
per deck. Sometimes when the scud
ding mist was dissipated for an in
stant the rocky beach could be made
cut dimly.
Suddenly a huge wave dashed over
the deck, drenching the helpless peo
ple huddled about- in groups. In the
grlare of the lanterns . faces " showed
deathly white. There were, shrieks
from The women and many an invol
untary rush to the raiL But members
of. the cre-w. -drove back the: panic
stricken ones.
WHISTLE 15 SI!.i;\CKD,
Until the water drowned her fires
and cooled her boilers the St. Paul's
â¢whistle wailed a signal of distress, but
r.ot for long. The sharp rocks #
crunched through her hull until she'
rested hard and fast, flooded from stem
to stern. A heavy rain beat down upon
the passengers, drenching them to the
skin.
With the threatening boom of the
surf and the whining of the wind in
their ears, the helpless people on the
decks thought the end was near at
|l V;-.nd. Captain Clem Randall sent
â¢V-artermaster A. Winslow to the fore
mast to discharge some rockets. The
red glare lighted the- gloom for a few
seconds and seemed to have a cheering 1
effect on the passengers.
A beat was launched into the boiling
seas In charge of Third Officer Holmes
as an experiment. For awhile the hun
gry rollers threatened to swamp it, but
it finally righted. The seas seemed to
grow a trifle calmer, but none of the
passengers wanted to trust themselves
in a small boat until a nttle girl. Flor
ence Macauley. swung over the rail and
dropped into the craft. The small boat
gave a lurch and for an instant it seemed
as though the outstretched arms would
miss the child. But she was caught and
deposited safely in the life-boat.
"Come on," she said, "it's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of." She
took off her hat and waved it as the
small boat, finally loaded, faded into the
mist.
I Two other boatloads followed and
reached lightship &3, ancnored at Point
Blunts. The unfortunate people were
bundled " in blankets and given hot
CM.-.ks. One of them, Mrs. J. G. Davis,
\u25a0who was in rather delicate health before
ehe started, was nearly dead from expos
ure when 6he reached this haven. Heroic
measures quickly brought her to. The
rest were almost cheerful when they real
ized that they had escaped the perils of
the hungry curf that roared about the
helpless hulk of the St. Paul.
r OTHER CHAFT ASSIST.
The distress signals of the St. Paul at
tracted the tug Ranger and the steam
â¢cbconers Vanguard and Del Xorte.
When a pelting rain beat the breakers
to comparative quiet all the passengers
\u25a0were taken ashore excepting the thirteen
who were taken on board the Ranger.
These were afterward taken on board
the Pomona,
Captain Randall remained with the St.
Paul until a late hour Thursday night.
She pounded harder and harder on the
rocky, beach until it was deemed unsafe
to remain ; with her. . The Vanguard at
last reports was still hanging around the
doomed vessel in hope of saving some of
the passengers* baggage. .
The only living thing left on the vessel
is a horse. No one seemed to like the
task of putting it out of its misery. It
is probably still munching at a bale of
hay that was left for It and will remain
there until the hungry seas engulf the
hulk.
The St. Paul was fifteen miles out of
her course when she struck on the rocks,
completely lost In a pall of mist. Third
Officer W. H. Holmes was oh watch and
Quartermaster A. Winslow was at the
wheeL They were steaming at -over ten
knots an hour through the white silence
when suddenly the boom of the surf was
heard. The warning cc â le too late.
The St. Paul struck with a', shock that
hurled ; passengers from their berths,
paused an instant, then leapeu higher up
on the ebarp rocks. She struck In almost j
the same spot where the Humboldt was
\u25a0wrecked .and * wrench ea to pieces years
aeo. " |

PASSENGERS OF ST. PAUL WHO ARRIVED HERE YESTERDAY, AND MAN WHO WAS AT WHEEL.
St Paul. Mr. Stevenson belongs to the
Chinese Immigration Bureau in Port
land, Or.
Mrs. Stevenson gave a very graphic
description of the wrecking of the St.
Paul. She said:
When the steamer ran on the rocks we were
all sound asleep. We were awakened by an
awful thud, followed by a noise, and then we
seemed to be lifted up again and after a few
moments tbe steamer hit another rock with a
crash, and we came to a standstill. My hus
band grabbed the baby and jumped out on to
the deck. I followed hint. At the same time
people from all over the ship ran to the decks.
I heard some of the officers shouting orders,
and the sailors were rushing here and there,
trying to see what had happened. The night
was somewhat misty, but I do not think it
was foggy. It was dark, but I could see the
stars. It was a few minutes after 3 o'clock.
The waves were ewashlng around the
steamer, but it was not very rough. The
passengers were somewhat excited and were
running here and there, but were much cooler
than would be generally expected under simi
lar circumstances. All of a sudden the cap
tain gave the orders for everybody to get
ready to leave - the vessel. We hurriedly
dressed ourselves, and packed up what effects
we had In our stateroom. We were then
helped down over the side of the steamer Into
the lifeboats, which had already been low
ered. The night was cold and drear and there
was a slight mist falling. It was" very hard
on us, with our little baby, sitting In the
open boat for five hours.
It was about 3:30 o'clock a. m. when we
took to the boat. There were eighteen of us
In our boat, including the crew. We drifted
around, bobbing up and down on top of the
waves, which were- constantly splashing spray
over us, until day began to break. The boat
was then headed toward the shore, as .we in-i
tended to try. to land. This was found to be
impossible, as the breakers were running high
on the -beach. The boat was then put about,
and, after a hard pulf, we finally reached the
lightship.
We were drenched to the skin and nearly
froren. The lighthouse-keeper did everything
he could for us. He dried our clothes and gave
us something warm to eat. About 5 o'clock
In the afternoon the Pomona came In sight,
and we were again lowered Into the lifeboat
and taken out and placed on board her.
I ehall never forget this trip. Captain Ran
dall did everything In his power to allay the
excitement on the St. Paul. We have not're
covered from the experience we have been
through. All our baggage, which was in the
hold of the ship, will prove a total loss.

their battle against the waves is one
ol the most exciting incidents of the
wreck. Hall is a Civil War veteran arid

TRYIXO TO *sAA r K HORSE.
Berkeley . Mnn Uklus lOfTortx In Behalf
of: Shipwrecked -Equine.
BERKELEY, Oct. 6.â W. C. Mason, a
Berkeley business man, spent most of 'the day
to-day" trying to get the ; steamship company
which" owns the wrecked St.; Paul to order the
master of : the vessel to release from 'the ,shlp
a valuable home belonging to Mason'a partner,
Luther F. Williamson. : The latter . took '; pas
sage on the St.; Paul wltn his bride of a few
days, and among his effects ' was a : fine horse

Portland on. his bridal journey.
,'Whonthe St. : Paul *: went onthe rocks and

STEERS SHIP
TOWARD SHORE
Ordering the steamer Santa Barbara
to be steered in the direction of the main
land,' after instructing hi 3 officers to call
him should? it become foggy," Captain H.
Zaddart went, below and turned in at 9
o'clock on the evening of September 30.
At .4:17. o'clock the next morning the good
ship, true to her helm, went ashore at
Del Mar landing, on the northern . coast.
Such was the gist of the testimony
given " yesterday by Captain Zaddart at
the investigation by United States Local
Inspectors* Bolles and. Bulger..' The cap
tain said that at the time he gave the or
der for a \u25a0; course northwest by west by

land' him whereMhe ship' struck, but that
he expected to be ; called on 'deck in .time (
to , change the course. He "f admitted that
the, ship's compasses had not been tested
for' four or i five years.

VALLEJO. Oct. 6.â Declaring that his
own family was trying to take his life,
Nathaniel Melvin, aged 65 years and for
many years foreman calker at the Mare
Island navy yard and a prominent citizen,
shot and fatally wounded his wife and
seriously wounded his daughter, Mrs. P.
E. * Radcllffe, at the family residence in
this -city .this morning. A minute later
Melvin took a large bread knife and at
tempted to \ cut his throat, but the blade
was dull and the sight of blood seemed to
restore the crazed man to his senses.
JHelyin has been an Inmate of the Napa
Insane Asylum on- three different" occa
sions, being released on parole three
months ago. Only*. last week his son
wrote ' a letter to . the asylum authorities
asking for a permanent discharge for Mel
vin. ;_; _ This -request is still pending.
:, Melvin ; secured - his son's ; revolver, a
baseball bat and a large bread knife early
this r morning. .7 After Mrs. Melvin and
Mrs. ; Radcllffe had said good-by to^ the
two, sons of the ; family and Mrs. Rad
cliffe's husband, " who 1 Is Boatswain . P. E.
Radcliff e rof the U. .S. S. Solace, they
started: to return to the house. As they
did so two bullets from a revolver In the
hands of the elder Melvin came! through
the wall, and a ; moment later Melvin
himself, clad only in ; his ' nightgown and
.with ; the : smoking revolver in one hand
and .'.the knife ' and .'baseball bat -in the
other, tore open , the front door and stepped
out on : the \u25a0: front \u25a0 porch of the house.
*, Mrs.;; Melvin uttered a " scream and fled.
As she v ran Melvin fired two shots at her.
One ; entered -the J pit of her: stomach: and
has /not' yet been found. The other ; flew
wide of its mark. Mrs. Radcllffe cried to
her, father for "\u25a0 mercy, but he .turned on
her with a* curse; and fired the last 'bullet
in " the revolver. The bullet entered Mrs.
Radcllffe's breast Just " below the heart,
and' striking- a "rib took a downward
course, vlt .was found \ later and abstract
ed near.the small of the back. * . .
The whole neighborhood was on the
scene in La minute, and. Melvin rushed
back : into ". the housed threatening to- kill
the'flrst man who entered^ Abe SchufÃer,
who lives near, by,' secured a revolver and
entered the house and '-. found \ the old man

EUREKA, Oct. 6.â A visit to the
wrecked sttamshp St. Paul found . the
vessel in the same position in -which she
lay when deserted by the officers, crew
and pasengera. At times immense seas
.break over her smokestacks. Portions
of the rails, spars and rigging have been
swept away. The three boats left In the
port davits are gone. Wreckage is being
washed ashore.
Captain Randall of the St. Paul with six
men left for the scene of disaster on the
tug Defiance yesterday morning, but was
unable to get closer than a mile to -the
wreck. The tug Dauntless with Captain
Turner of Lloyd's underwriters arrived at
the wreck from San Francisco yesterday
morning. Captain Randall and bis men
transferred to the Dauntless and returned
to Kureka and the Defiance steamed for
the city. . ,- . .
The passengers here arÂ« being well
cared for. Many will go north on the
Alliance to-day. Some will return to San
Francisco on various ships going south.
Of the people on board the St. Paul
only the help In the steward's depart
ment suffered. The company refused
to provide hotel accommodations for
the cook's and waiters and they were
left to rustle beds and food the best
they could. Neither would the steward
pay them the wages due them. He
said he had orders to provide only for
the passengers. The officers of the St.
Paul are comfortably quartered at the
Hotel Vance.
Seafaring men do not attach blame
for the wreck on any one. Captain
Hardwick of the Alliance says that
there 13 an undercurrent at Point Gorda
which stealthily draws a shin to the
rocks, while the compass shows' that
the vessel is pursuing the right course.
Moreover, he says, he would nqt
be .surprised to learn of other vessels
burying? themselves besides the bones
of the old Humboldt and St. > Paul,
should the latter prove to be a total
wreck.
Whether the St. Paul will be a total
wreck is a matter of conjecture. If
the present' weather continues the
stanch craft cannot 'hold together
long. Had the disaster occurred forty
eight hours' later there would have
been a great loss of life.

of the Mission t
"Mr. Chairman, Members of Improve
ment Clubs and Friends: I do not come
before you to-night to talk politics or
political issues. We have entered upon
a campaign In which there is no politics;
and for my part I propose to talk busi
ness. As taxpayers and men who have
the true interests of this city- at heart
your highest concern Is that the city
government shall be conducted along
strictly business lines, without regard to
politics or partisan considerations of any
kind.
The first and most important consider
ation in the government of a munici
pality Is that it shall be conducted hon
estly and impartially, and this' does not
mean alone that there should be no actual
pilfering of the public funds and no
actual corruption of public officials. There
is a much more common form of dishon
esty in the conduct of public affairs,
whose effect is quite as serious upon the
public interests. It is very much to our
credit, to be able to say that the men,
who will actually enrich themselves by
the sale of privileges or by taking money
to withhold "the strong hand of the law
are comparatively few... But it- matters
very little to the great mass of the people
whether privileges and immunities are
actually gold or whether they are granted
to personal or factional friends of the
administration or awarded as a return
for past or future political support.
MAYOR HAS GREAT POWER.
"The charter of the city and county
of San Francisco puts in the hands of the
Mayor unlimited and almost unrestrained
power. That power can be exercised for
the real advancement of the city and the
real welfare of the people only when
the Incumbent of the office is actuated by
complete and thoroughgoing unselfishness.
"If the incumbent of the Mayor's office
has a real sense of the responsibility
Laid upon him and if he keeps constantly
before him the one principle of the high
est Rood to the greatest number, he will
Jind the conduct of the olrioe compara
tively simple and his rule of action com
paratively plain. I think that you all
believe that if I am elected to office I
will conduct it with strict integrity, but
I would consider myself absolutely unfit
for that or any position of public trust
If I could not promise more than mere
integrity. In DUblic office a man is con
stantly assailed by the solicitations of
friends who want things done, which are
not actually . wrong in themselves, but
which it takes no great wisdom to see
are not really in accord with the highest
Interests Â«f tbe people. Favors are,con
stantly Bought which ought not to be
granted. Considerations of old friendship
are constantly urged. Men are constantly
appealing to that sense of gratitude for
past. support which any man must feel.
Offers 5 - <of i -future political assistance and
even "tlTfeats of future political retribu
tion are constantly being made. Wll these,
a man must resist if he would be faith
ful to his trust. He must know that he
is the mere custodian of the people's
power. He must have a keen sense . of
the importance of the people's confidence
in him and he must realize that in his
own conscience at least he will be held ac
countable to strict fidelity of a trustee. I

EASY TO DO RIGHT.
"As an example of how easy and sim
ple it Is Xor really conscientious men to
do well by the people, permit me \u25a0 to call
your attention for a moment to the rela
tions between the. majority of the Board*
of Supervisors and the City Attorney's
office during. tho last two years. . IÂ« trust
that you will believe me when I say"' that:
I speak of this matter with considerable
diffidence and in no spirit of boastingâ
with absolutely no partisan feeling.. But
when the people have constantly before
them a shining example of how munici
pal affairs should 'not be -conducted, it
may be worth while, ; even " at :\u25a0 the risk
of a little seeming 'immodesty,*- to show
them the other side of the shield.
"Following the last municipal election
thÂ« Democrauc party -was in contrel-of
the Board of Supervisors and the Re-
publicans the office .of City Attorney.
The people by an overwhelming vote had
declared in favor ot the .issuance of. bonds
in the sum of something over $17,000,000
for various public improvements. The
improvements were and are practical
necessities, not partaking in any. degree
of the character of municipal luxuries.
The city had previously voted in favor of
a large issue of bonds, - but owing to
technical defects in the proceedings the
highest court in the State had declared
against their validity. In order, there
fore to reassure the tJnancial \u25a0 interests
of the country, so that. the bonds could
be sold, it became necessary to have a
speedy adjudication of the validity of
the new issue. An action was according
ly brought, the City Attorney's ofQce
immediately appeared, and the matter
was elaborately and fully presented by
the City Attorney and the attorney who
represented the interests opposed to tbe
bonds. Judge Sloss at once rendered his
decision in favor of the validity of. the
bonds. Not a moment was lost in hurry
ing the matter to "the Supreme Court
By the special solicitation of represen
tatives from the Supervisors and the City
Attorney the Supreme ' Court advanced
the case on the calendar, the matter was
again elaborately argued, carefully con
sidered by the Supreme Court and by
them speedily determined in favor of the
validity of the bonds. '
"So far all was smooth sailing. The
Supervisors, again acting: with and bnja
der. the- advice of :the- City Attorney's
office, at once carried through the pro
ceediugr necessary for their salt*. The
bones were offered to the financier* ot

the country and respectfully: declined.
The whole State was shocked when it
was discovered that,, while, the Secur
ities of any little town or even any
rural school district \. were ""eagerly
sought and purchased, the bonds of the
great and wealthy city of San Fran
cisco, which dJd not have, a .dollar .of
indebtedness, were ' drugs in the mar
kets of the world. For a time all our
energies were paralyzed. We ; went
about among the men who had money
to purchase bonds, in such; al.largea 1 . large
amount, and we found, that the reason
why they were not; sold was because
not only in California, but all over the
United States, there. was a deep-seated
distrust in the administration of af
fairs in San Francisco, and that men
would not Invest their capital. In its
securities, because they feared that the
money would not be honestly spent and
that the .people in their wrath might
attempt repudiation. .> V
FAVORS PARKS IX MISSION. >
"Among the (improvements for which
the bonds were; voted. "was the Mission
Park.' The association which had been
agitating in favor of the establishment
of a park in the Mission r and which
had had much -to do- with carrying the
election in favor of the whole bond'is
sue, conferred with certain of the' Su
pervisors and the City Attorney, and as
a result a wealthy arid public-spirited
resident of the Mission was interested.
He persuaded certain | bankers to pur
chase the bonds for the Mission Park,
and afterward other - bonds, the' pro
ceeds of which were'to^be expehded.'ih
the ' purchase :of > lands. The argument
he used in inducing capitalists to pur
chase these bonds was" that; this money,
which was to be expended in the pur
chase of lands, \wasf not to be "expended
by the various commissions under* the
control Â»f the city's: administration, but
by the Board of Supervisors.- The re
sult was the Immedlate r sale of certain
of the bonds. ; ';
â "The money having become available
the Board of Supervisors instructed the
City Attorney to' " proceed f at ', once to
purchase;the; various ' tracts 'of land -if
it; could bedone, and, -if not,;,to'com

PRESIDENT WILL
USE A CRUISER
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6.â The Navy De
partment has designated the armored
criuser "West Virginia as the vessel which
will carry the President from New Or
leans to Hampfbn Roads on his return
from his 4 Southern trip. The President
asked for one vessel and wanted a^wift
cruiser, that his return from the South
might be made as speedily as possible.' â¢
Admiral Brownson, who is 'about to as
semble his division for a practice cruise,
will sail with the "West Virginia -flying
his pennant.- and may take the Colorado
and Pennsylvania with him as far as Key
.West for the purpose of drilling. He will
go on to* New Orleans with the West
Virginia and then make a fast run direct
from there to Hampton Roads. Whether
the Colorado and Pennsylvania will ac T
company the flagship back or follow at a
slower speed will be determined by dr
; cumstances.
At -first the department purposed send
ing the Pennsylvania, but the new .'ar
rangement will not necessarily break; urj
the division, as detaching the Pennsylvania
nia would have done, and will not mate-*T
rlally Interfere with Admiral Brownson's
plans for a practice cruise. .
The Maryland, the fourth vessel of his
command, win not be -ready to Join the
fleet in time to make the trip South, but
it is expected that the repairs now be
ing made will have been completed so she
can join the division at the time of the
arrival of Prince Louis of Battenberg.
The vessels of Admiral Brownson's di
vision are heavy armored cruisers of th*Â»"
greatest tonnage of any American war-
Bhips now In commission and have a
speed of twenty-two knots each.

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
DRINKS POISON
ON THE CAMPUS
Berkeley Eealty Operator
Ends Life in Shadow of
the Greek Amphitheater
HAD FAILED IN LOVE
Leaves Note of Beproach Ad
dressed to "Jolly," a
Woman of San Francisco
BERKELEY, Oct. 6. â In the shadow
of the Greek Theater on the university
campus, O. M. Jones, a real estate ;
operator Of Berkeley, swallowed a
draught o* carbolic poison this after
noon, then lay down to die. His body
was found by three strangers from San
Francisco, who notified Deputy Coroner
Btrelghtif.
Disappointed in love, disgusted with j
entanglements in business, despondent
btcause of ill health, Jones decided to
take his life, and with that resolve
made climbed lilgh on the hill back of
the Greek Theater, where in solitude
death cajoe to him by his own hand.
On the body of the dead man was
found a card pf the firm of Jolly &
Co., real estate and insurance operators
of Ban Francisco, with offices in the
Emma Spreckels building. "Jolly &
Co." represented a woman, Mrs. L.
Jolly, with whom Jones was in Jove.
He had been associated with her In
business, presumably as the "Co." of
the firm of Jolly &'Co.
Jones was In love with Mrs. Jolly
and hoped to roarry her. Their busi
ness associations, according to the dead
man's sister-in-law. Mrs. George D.
Hutchinson of Berkeley, had not pros
pered and Jones' suit had been rejected.
On thÂ« back of the business card of
Jolly &. Co. found on his person Jones
had written these words:
Remember that I love you, oh. Â»o much.
How can you. Jolly? I lovÂ« you, do you he*r?
Mrs. Jolly is said to be employed as
a saleswoman in the cloak department
of the Emporium In San Francisco.
Friends of Jones who had assisted him
In an attempt to disentangle his finan
cial affairs during the last few months
say that MrÂ«. Jolly provided the funds
*rith which Jones managed the business
of Jolly & Co. The business was not
successful, the â¢ money contributed by
Mrs. Jolly did not increase in Jones'
hands and apparently embittered by the
thought that he had failed to score as
a business man operating in the inter
ests of the woman he loved Jones de
cided to take his life.
Two letters were found on Jones'
body, one addressed to his young
daughters, Luella and Fanny, at 2126
Blake street, and another addressed to
his sister-in-law, Mrs. George D. Hutch
inson, at 2440 Haste street. The Coro
ner's deputy opened the letter ad
dressed to the daughters, but after ex
amining the other communication or
dered them put under lock and key un
til his superior should give orders re
garding them.
The letter to the daughters is as fol
lows:
Dear Daughters : When I era tone thÂ«rÂ»
tnay be ceme bills presented to you to pay.
Those that I now mention you may pay. but
X forbid you to pay any others. Pay your
eras ai a and Mr. Roberson $20 â the one in the
city where you eet the medicine for your
cr&ndpa- Do what li tight, and bang ca to
your money. Your lorir.r father.
, Luella and Fanny Jones, the daugh
ters referred to in the foregoing note,
are 6 and 18 years old respectively.
They said this afternoon that their
father had threatened to take poison
a number of times during the last few
\u25a0weeks end had carried a bottle of car
bolic acid with him for some time. He
was a sufferer from tuberculosis, of
which ailment his wife died a year ago.
The mother left some valuable property
on Blake street, consisting of several
handsome flats, to the daughters. Miss
Luella intimated that her father had
hoped to secure possession of this prop
erty to use in his real estate business
and had been disappointed of his hope.
The father carried insurance for $5000,
which the daughters will receive. They
reside now with their aunt at 2440
Haste street, having moved there last
Wednesday. The father apparently did
cot know that they had removed there
from 2126 Blake street, their former
residence, for he addressed his note to
them at the Blake-street house.
Mrs. Hutchinson, a sister-in-law of
Jones, eaid: "Mr. Jones bad failed in
health and business and he became
vÂ«ry despondent when be broke up In
business with Mrs. Jolly of San Fran
cisco. He had hoped to marry her, but
J&T*. Jolly knew that be was afflicted
with tuberculosis, and for thl% and,
perhaps other reasons, they parted com
pany.**
Jones was associated a year ago with
the firm of Baker & Jones at 2107 Shat
tuck avenue in Berkeley. They dealt
fa real estate and built-housea. Their
relations apparently were not amicable,
for litigation Is now pending in which
they are Involved with outsiders. Jones,
according to a Berkeley attorney who
Is of counsel in these legal matters,
was to have been, a principal witness
in a cult now pending where Baker Is
m. defendant.

ORPHAN GIRL SAYS
SHE IS ABANDONED
Pretty Child Wa^^^
TELLS PATHETIC ' TAkEf TO "POLICE
OAKLAND, Oct. 6.â Abandoned by her
foster mother and left to find her way as
best she could to a place. of refuse, Ag
gie Gray, a winsome orphan, 11- years
old, fell to-night Into the hands of the
police, a stranger in a strange city, home
less, â¢without kith or kin, and dependent
upon the authorities for food and shelter.
The child told a story of heartless cast
ing adrift and accused a Mrs. Lutz, who,
the little wanderer assarted, deserted her
this afternoon at Stockton, directing her
to ro to Oakland and to keep her- lips
sealed concerning: the woman who \u25a0 sent
her Into the world unprotected i and un
sheltered, and tha little girl narrated her
piteous experience, and it was a tale^that
brought the glistening tears to the eyes
-of the policemen who heard It.
Little Aggie said she had been placed
In an orphan asylum at Ogden, Utah,
years ago, her parents being dead and
all trace of her relatives being lost. About
four years, ago Mrs. Lutz took the or
phan girl and. became her foster mother.
The woman- went to Nevada City, the
child said, and opened a restaurant, which
she recently sold out. This afternoon at
Stockton Mrs. Lutz, the child declares,
told her ward she could keep her no
longer. She put the girl on a Santa Fe
train and headed her for Oakland, where
Aggie was directed to find another home
in an orphan asylum.
Arriving here the girl said she met a
child on the street near the station who
took her home. It was to the residence
of W. B. Hamilton, 661 Thirty-fiinth
street. Aggie related her story to him
and Hamilton called the police, who took
charge of the wayfarer until an Investiga
tion shall be held to determine the truth
or the falsity of the story of abandon
ment.

view- and set aside the verdict of the

Special Dispatch to Tho Cull.
SAN QUENTIN. Oct. 6.â Frank Woods,
alias St. Louis Frank, the thug who fired
the shot that ended the life of brave
Police Officer Eugene Robinson of San
Francisco," was hanged at the prison to
day. Not many hours before he was
launched Into eternity he confessed that
the blood "of j another man waa on his
hands. In the . presence' of the Warden
and several .other officials |he admitted
this 'his was the hand that took the. life
of a Fresno man In August, 189 L For this
crime a man named Washoe is now serv
ing time in Folsom. . -< - :
Woods was accompanied to the scaf
fold by Prison Chaplain Drahms and
Charles Montgomery, president of the
Prison Commission, a missionary society.
The condemned man displayed no sign of
emotion as he ascended the ateps that
led to the fatal drop. If he was peni
tent there was nothing about his de
meanor to show.it. He carefully scanned
the faces of the dozen or more persona
who had accepted an invitation to wit
ness ! the hanging. /As:: his -eyes rested
on the half dozen members of the San
Francisco police department, for the mur
der of a member of which he was about
to be punished, his features assumed a
peculiar expression.
"Hello," fellows," he eald. "CJ oo d>by-"-.
For just a second Woods allowed his
eyes to rest oh the features of Detective
Taylor, the man whose ; bullet brought
to the ground William Henderson, one
of \ Woods'* companions, and the man
whose j confession led to the conviction
of Woods. â¢ It . was but a momentary
glance, but It was full of hatred. It
said, "But for you I would not be here."
Just before Woods stepped upon the
fatal trap he expressed a desire to
make a speech. This the Warden
would not allow him to do. so the mur
derer contented himself with saying,
,"Just tell them that you saw me and
they* will know the rest," lines from a
popular song.- â¢â¢'See -that my grave It
kept ' gr'ejsn,". followed in Jesting tones,
and then ;the murderer's features wero
hidden by : . the black mask. Hangman
Arbogasf a hand .was raised, * the trap
was sprung and Woods had paid the
penalty of his crime.
.Ten. minutes after the trap had been
sprung Woods wa3 declared dead by
the prison physician.
â¢Chaplain Drahms and President
Charles Montgomery of the California
Prison Commission were with the con
demned man early this morning, when
he, made a confession to Warden Tomp
klns.* *; He told the Warden he had
been a criminal since boyhood. On Oc
tober --2', '1891, he said, in Fresno, and
while he was . In an intoxicated con
dition , he : saw a man In the Railroad
avenue Circle Bar saloon with whom he
thought he had had a quarrel. Draw
ing a penknife he rushed at the man and
stabbed the unfortunate fellow, Inflicting
a wound that later caused his " death.
Woods said he escaped from the sa
loon undetected and some time later
learned that the man he had killed was
not his enemy. \u25a0 f
"I never knew the man's name." said
Woods. "'He "had a cork leg. I think
aâ¢_ man known as 'Washoe' was sent
to Folsom for.. that crime.". Woods
said Henderson, upon whose testimony
he was convicted of the murder of Of
ficer Robinson,, should share his fate.
COWARDLY MURDER.
Crime Confessed by Woods a Cold-
Illooded One.
FRESNO, Oct. â¢ 6. â On the night of
August 2, IS9I, Michael Kinney was
stabbed to death In the toilet of the
Burdlck Saloon In this city. Attracted
by the cries ;of the, assaulted g man,
"Tom" Mitchell, the bartender, rushed
to his assistance and saw Thomas ; W.
Ashoe Kelly,' better known as
."Washoe," a one-armed man, running
away t from the scene. Kelly was after
ward' caught, convicted of murder and
sentenced, to life' lmprisonment. â¢ He is
now In -San Quentln.
" No ' suspicion \u25a0 was cast at the time
upon any other ; members of the " sans
who ."had It in" for Kinney. Kelly took
the stand in his own behalf and swore
that he knew nothing of the crime, that
he slept all night under a tree on the
edge of S town. The evident falsehood
of this statement had its effect on the
jury and It convicted him.
: ;jj Michael Kinney hailed from Oakland
and came here to pick grapes. He: was
a man' with an artificial leg. Kelly was
also a â¢grapepicker. On the afternoon
of the tragedy Kinney got into an al
tercation with a fellow-laborer, which
was. taken up on the latter's behalf by
a number, of others. All came to 'town
and took a fow drinks. Then the gang
started : in\ to "do" Kinney. He took
refuge in the Burdlck Saloon and was
so harassed while there that the bar
tender ' was â¢ compelled to exhibit ' a \u25a0 re
volver ; In ; order to : frighten his assail
ants away. Fcarlngr to_ leave, . Kinney
remained ; In the . saloon' for over two
hours. ; Ho ' finally ] stepped back to, the
toilet, where the assassin had secreted
himself. .\u25a0 He was; stabbed througrh the
heart and died without being: able to
make any statement.'

NEWPORT, Wash.; Oct. 6.â Blown up
by dynamite, the explosion of which
broke windows blocks distant, the barge
Newport, a lumber freighter of the best
type on the Pondd'Oreille River, was re
duced to wreckage at her moorings at an
early hour this morning. The destruction
of the boat was evidently malicious.
Judging from the detonation,- upward of
100 pounds of explosive was used.
The Newport was the property of
George H. Jones. She was of yellow pine
construction and fitted with three parallel
railway tracks to accommodate loaded
cars. She was launched In May of this
year, registered 300 net tonnage and was
valued at $4000.^ Captain Jones is a party
to bitter 'litigation now .pending in the
United States Supreme Court relative to
transportation rights of way, and street
conjecture connects the destruction of the
vessel with this affair, vi s * .

OFFICERS NAMED
FOR DAUGHTERS,
OF CONFEDERACY
Yesterday was the busiest day. of a lot
of busy days In the U. D. C. convention".
It was election day,; and while not up to
the standards. established in some
\u25a0women's organizations; for ' general bed
lam. It was nevertheless a lively sessionâ
with a plenitude of talking, platform and
otherwise. '
The mornlnsr opened briskly with sur
gery upon the by-laws.
A movement was afoot, to Introduce the
secret ballot , system .Into ; the convention,
through amendment to- the" by-laws,' :but
It was lost by aheavyi.vote. : !:, v ;
Another Interesting amendment, which
THE SAN ;FRANCISc6; CALL, SATURDAY; OCTOBER T ; :i905;
passed, was the provision for custodian
of "The Stars and Bars" of the order.
Owing to a lack' of parliamentary .ob
servance the entire morning was occu
pied in handling the ! foregoing matters.
But the election of officers . had been
scheduled to take place, and regardless
of luncheon and an army of 'impatient
waiters, the work went on.
Nominations were invited from the floor,
whereupon \u25a0 Mrs. J. PJ Hickman of Ten
nessee was named, followed by Mrs. Cor
nelia B. Stone of Texas. 'Here Mrs..Hick
man interrupted proceedings by declaring
that she wasn't go old as to need the
presidency right nowâ with which the con.'
ventlon laughingly agreedâ and her name
was withdrawn at her request.
Then came the nomination*, ot Mrs. Liz
zie George Henderson of ' Mississippi,
which was seconded by a dozen delegates,
among them the veneralble founder of the
order, Mrs. A. M. Goodlet.
The balloting was interesting, as it
was an awful temptation for the chair
men of delegations to talk.
The ballot counted, it was seen that
Mrs. Henderson was .an easy ; victor.
Then the Stone adherents withdrew their,
candidate and moved that the_ election \of
Mrs. Henderson be made unanimous I and

THE MAYOR'S DEFENSE.
IX his often repeated speech. Mayor Schmitz says that after his
second election in a consultation of some sort between some
body, held somewhere, to discuss ways and means for beating
him for another term, Mr. Gavin AlcXab said that the cry of graft
must be raised against him and kept up. The Mayor repeats in
detail what Mr. McXab is alleged to have said. Now everybody
who knows Mr. McXab knows that the Mayor's statement is un
true. Mr. McXab does not do things that way. He does not try
to create a false issue. He has the genius to make effective use
of an issue when it is made, and has a real existence, but he knows,
the weakness of a manufactured issue.
Perhaps no man who has figured in our politics has as little
confidence in artifice or has abstained as conscientiously from its
use as McXab. Mayor Schmitz may find the statement he makes
useful in his campaign of hatred and detraction. It may get him
the votes of some ignorant and prejudiced men, but it will" get for
him also the contempt of the judicious and the decent elements in
the city. Xo man has been more often under fire than Mr. McXab,
and none ever stood it as unscathed. He does not have to manu
facture issues nor use artifice. It is not his style.
The Mayor goes frdm McNab to the Grand Jury and calls it
names, abuses it and tries to destroy confidence in its conclusions.
Xow that will do with the kind of support for which he appeals,
but it will not attract any decent man. The Grand Jury made spe
cific charges against Mayor Schmitz' administration. They are set
forth plainly in its report. He acknowledges their force by assum
ing the defensive. But his defense is not valid when it consists in
personal abuse of the foreman of the jury, or in calling him names.
That will get a shout from the vulgar, but it does not clear the
Mayor's skirts nor wash his hands. He claims a clean bill of health
because the Grand Jury did not indict him. As it had the power
to indict him and did not use it, therefore he is innocent. That
statement of his case and claim will do only for the unthinking.
The burglar who broke into and robbed a house last night may make
the same plea of innocence to-day. He has not been indicted and
therefore is not guilty. But the Mayor, who is no fool, knows that
the offenses that trickle from his whole career in office are not in
dictable. The Mayor may do all of the things necessary to disgrace
' the city and discredit it, and degrade it, in the eyes of the world,
and yet commit no indictable offense.
The efforts of his administration to help the indicted ballot-box
sniffers were not indictable, but they were indecent, and no man of
proper sensibilities and morals would have permitted them in the
subordinates of his office. The Grand Jury said that one of the most
conspicuous blots on the morality of this city was built, and is used
for its appalling purposes by the felonious co-operation of different
departments of the city government, in the face of public 'protest,
and that it received the direct personal. and implied official sanction
of the Mayor.
It is no reply to this for Mayor Schmitz to belittle and abuse
the jury, or make florid talks about the strikes he negotiated off. The
charge is one that goes profoundly to the moral foundations of the
city. Is it true? He does not deny it, but abuses the authors of
the disclosure. The sixty or seventy charges against him and his
administration made by the Grand Jury have been printed and be
fore the public for more than a month. In all that time neither
Mayor Schmitz, nor his accused boards, nor his spokesman, Mr.
Ruef, has denied nor disproved a single charge. / .. ,
We are not the Mayor's adviser. If we were, we would ad
vise him that he cannot make a successful defensive â¢campaign by
abusing the witnesses against him. He "must disprove their testi
mony. The members of that Grand Jury are well known citizens.
They are not in politics. They have no possible private or partisan
motive in misrepresenting the Mayor. They had a disagreeable per
sonal duty to perform and they performed it, fearlessly and well.
That the Mayor does not like them goes without saying. He may
spare the repetition of his animosity. The time taken in abusing the
jury would be better devoted to disproving their charges. Unless
he does this, the Mayor stands before the people convicted on every
SANTO DOMINGO TREATY.
SENATOR LODGE has been speaking of the proposed treaty
with Santo Domingo, which is to come up before the next
session of the Senate, and the plan of that treaty, namely,
the receivership plan, is spoken of by him as the "beginning of a
great national policy." It is probably true that the determination
reached by the treaty-making power after discussion of the plan
proposed by the administration will mark the beginning of "i,
great national policy, whether or no the . Senate ratifies the treaty
as formulated by the State Department. Both the friends and
opponents of the measure recognize that the isolated issue of its
direct application to Santo Domingo is a small matter as compared
with "its fixing a precedent for our national dealings with South
American countries.
The new policy gets its importance, of course, -from its close
connection with the time-honored Monroe doctrine. The decision
to accept or reject the receivership plan will determine to what
extent that doctrine should be, or can practicably be, upheld in
the future. The United States has adopted the principle that a
nation's contractual debts could . not be collected by force. That
was a good idea, but we had to abandon its universal promulgation
because' European powers would not respect it. Although the
Monroe doctrine is not embodied in international law, European
nations are disposed to respect it so long as it is not so interpreted
as to bar their way to the collection of debts. In case a South
American country owes a debt to the subjects of a European power
and that power decides to enforce payment, the United States has
the alternative of either attending to the collection of the debt on
behalf of the creditor country or of upholding "a doctrine which
would practically mean war against the whole of money-lending
Europe. To evade the possibility of such a war, or any alternative
that would be virtually a backdown on the subject of the Monroe
doctrine, the receivership plan which is now proving such a success
in Santo Domingo would be an effective policy. However, even if
the principle of our undertaking these national receiverships -were
adopted, there would remain the possible awkward contingency of
a little delinquent South American country refusing to peaceably
co-operate with the benevolent paternal scheme. In that case ; we
would either have to use force or let Europe do it.
Mr. Edison says he does not associate with men whose lives are de
voted to getting money. That's probably why Mr. Edison has been able to
save something. â Augusta Herald.

FATIMA'S LOST OPPOHTUXITY.
"You say," observed the fair Fatlma
to the genius who had. appeared when she
accidentally rubbed the ring that she' had
foundâ "you say that you will grant any
and every .wish that: I may express?"
"Sure!"* the- genius laconically, replied.
"I may have my t very heart's desire?"
"Youse is onto de sit."
"Nothing will be withheld from me?"
"Not a tine."
"Well, then, I will have a-a-oh, yes, a
new dress."
The genius waved bis hand, and just
then the maid brought in a new and beau
tiful gown.? â¢ "\u25a0'_\u25a0'. \u25a0"Â«\u25a0'
Fatima gasped.
"Why!" she ejaculated, "the dress
maker promised that.it should be here
to-day!" ,
"Yes?" the genius remarked.
"And soâ so â Why, your power must be
perfectly wonderful, or else It never
would have been here before week after
next! And now you may bring to meâ
no, on second thought, you may take me
to the very nicest young man you know,
and you must make him fall deeply In
love with me. andâ well, ) that will be
enough for the present. But you must
wait just a minute while I change my
gown." , ' ':'\u25a0\u25a0/\u25a0
"Dat'U be all right," ' the genius re
sponded, for he was not married, and so
did not realize.
Then Fatima left the room, and the
genius sat down and waited and waited.
I Then h* waited^some more.
' After that he waited and waited.
Still later he kept right on waiting and
waiting. . :
After quite a time had fugited he
eluded to wait some: more., ' t
So he waited," and waited, and waited.
Then Fatima called, from the head of
the stairs and said she hoped he was not
in a -hurry, for she would be down in
just a minute.
The genius had been well trained, so
he answered under his breath, and such
words do not count with genii, who have
no souls to lose.
Then he waited, and waited.
And waited, and waited.
And waited, and wait-
When Fatima entered the, room the
genius had gone, but he had left a little
note, which read:
"We genii don't lib troughout eternity;
consekently I'm sorry dat I can't, wait
So long!" .
And the worst of it was that he had
taken the ring away- with him.
So Fatima. lost her one great, beauti
ful opportunity. But she says that she
doesn't care; that she just knows that
no woman could have put . on that . new
gown in a second's . less time than she
did. ____/_\u25a0

Remembering One's Boyhood
WALLACE RICE.
IT is one of the curious misfits -in
Â» life that the boy needs his father's
sympathy, and advice most between
the ages of 14 and 20, and that fathers
as a rule* forget their own feelings at
that particular age so entirely that
they have neither sound . advice nor
sympathy to offer. : .
It is not the most agreeable period
in the life of any man, to be sure. If
any of a boy's years suggested the idea
that the way to bring them up is to
put them in a barrel , and feed 1 them
through the bungholei; it' is just this
period. It Is a time. of gangling. legs,
feet and hands andteeth too big, awk
wardness and disability, and, the ten
dency to be ; fresh-^there Is no word
quite' so descriptively -..-,. expressiveâ
which is poison to the man' of mature
years. .
No wonder a' grown man -wishes to
forget he used to be like that.
Yet he did.. No matter how graceful
and handsome he may be ow. there
was a time when the coming man was
a real hobbledehoy.
If he happens to have any accurate
photographs of himself taken during
those uninteresting years, it '.will', do
him good to fetch them out and study
them. He was 'quite as awkward as
the boy that stands before him now
and calls him father.

But this Is the outside only. Inside
there is the same resemblance. There
is a something, seething, within, the ap
proach of true manhood, the knitting
of bones and muscles into the seasoned
frame, the preparation for the combat
of j life, the beginning , of aspirations
and longings, in the new case just as
in the- old. The boy is father to the
man.- 'â¢'... , â¢
It will be well for fathers to* take out
old diaries and old'school books, write
for r and obtain old letters, and do what
they | can toward â¢ rediscovering the
youth they have lost.' By insistent rec
ollection they may ]be . able to bring
back -long-forgotten bits of Imperti
nence and freshness to parents and
teachers of which they were themselves
guilty. It will have a.; wholesome and
chastening effect upon their opinion of
,the boy they have been blaming^ ,
| Most men, if they can x remember, did
pfetty badly as boys â for whom the
grown-up. world was not designed- â and
have yet done pretty well as men. The
boy before you is not likely to do much
better or much worse.
Of course you /wish him to do much
betterâ Just as your father wished in
your case. Of !. course you should be
satisfied in seeing him do no 'worsen-
Just as your father had to be.
: In any event the effort to get in
touch with the lad will do you both all
the good in the world.
College Girls
DOROTHY FENIMORE
OUR ( girls ~< t are crowding our boy 3
out of college into the technical
. schools,' asserts President Angell
of the University. :of Michigan* plainly-
Jregarding the situation with an eye of
regret. s_
But why not? Whyjhouldn't they do
so? By the law oÂ£ evolution the fittest
survive.
I do not mean to insinuate that boys
are less clever than girls, "or less cap-;
able of doSnjf creditable college work.
What rmean is that the old* classical
education which prevails in our; col
leges is better suited at the present
hour to the needs of our girls than to
those of our boys.
We are living In a commercial and
industrial age. You may deplore tnis
fact if your ideals are mure esthetic
tnan practical, uui you have to accept
it. Tne lawyer, thÂ« literary man and
the teacher all need tbe wide culture
which the college curriculum affords;
this culture Is v nattafactlon and an ad
vantage to any man because it gives
him infinite resou/ceq within himself.
But the ; prof easionn are already- over
crowded, and It Is man's first duty to
himself and to the state to make a
comfortable living. A technical train-
Ing gives a boy the equipment that ha
needs to accomplish this undur existing;
conditions.
. To \u25a0 avert the social crisis which is
impending it is necessary that our
educated men shall not.be philosophers
or theorists, but trained leaders of the
masses. The' man who thinks must
understand the man. who works, in
order that he may guide the ignorant,
and open' up new fields of. labor and
opportunity which will put to economic
profit the wasted energy of the unem
ployed. Technical training la the first
requisite for such learship. President
E. J. James of the University of Illinois
practically recognized this fact in a re
cent speech, wherein he declared that
In State universities provision should
be made for the training of more effi
cient men in public service.
Since this is so, the woman's task
has broadened,' although it 13 not less
differentiated than before. It is more
her part than ever to educate the chil
dren and make the home.
The colleges are giving women the
training which will enable them to sur
round their sons in early life with the
culture and refinement that will keep
their interests wide and their ideals
high in the struggle* of their later
years. ' liven Wells, whose "Modern
Utopia" is built from Its foundation
stone. in tbe interests of man, insists
upon the education of womankind.
If you look'fnto the matter you will
find , the college women do not, as a
clays, neglect their homes for outside
interests, although many of them con
tinue after marriage the work-ordi
narily in the fields of psychology, liter
ature or domestic scienceâ which inter
ested them, in college days. Their
hearts are in their homes, and by some
means or other their special talents are
made to conduce to the home's attrac
tiveness.
It is the women who have not re
ceived intellectual discipline who make
the big mistakes in life, and whose am
bitions are outside their natural sphere.
So far as boys are concerned they are
turning toward the technical school be
cause their fathers realize from their
own experience, and their contact with
the world of affairs, that here is the
place where Instruction Is being given
which belongs", to the 7 times. For the
technical" schools are intelligently unit
ing, with special training a general cul
ture which gives to the boy who has
.to make \u25a0 his way the polish and the
breadth of "view, he" ajso needs.
VOICE OF A QUEEN
Cables and special dispatches are all
very well for the exchange of felicita
tions with which ruler hailed ruler over
the conclusion of peace, but the plan
might be bettered. President . Roose
velt would have appreciated better than
any cable the reproduction of the voices
of those who have been congratulating
him. There is a precedent for the de
livery of a message in this fashion,
startling as the suggestion may sound.
Sir John Harrington, Minister Plenipo
tentiary to Abyssinia; was able to in
duce Queen "Victoria to speak into the
phonograph for the benefit of the Em
peror Menelek. Â»When he heard it the
sable' monarch could scarcely believe
his ears. Here," all. these thousands of
miles from her native land, was the
voice of this great Queen, actually
speaking to him. Again and again he
stopped the machine to have salutes
fired. And the Empress, when she
heard her own name mentioned, called
out her bodyguard as a* mark of re
spect to The Voice. â London Standard.
KING AND POLICEMAN.
King Alfonso was yesterday "held up*
by a French . policeman at Bayonne.

London Mail. '.'â¢â¢ -".
" His Majesty was proceeding in a mo
tor-car when a policeman signaled to
him to stop and a3ked him for his driv
er's certificated â¢ \u25a0* - â¢
"I have not got one," replied the King.
"Then I shall have to summon you."
returned the policeman, and taking out
his pocketbook, he asked briefly, ?Your
name, profession and address?". . V .
"Alfonso de Bourbon, King of Spain,
Palace Mirama, St. Sebastian," replied
the motorist. .
A small crowd had gathered and great
ly enjoyed the ; policeman's embarrass
ment, but recovering himself he put his
pocketbook i away, touched . his cap, and
signaled to the car to proceed.

SEVERAL HURT
IN COLLISION
BpecUl XÂ»spÂ«.tch to Tb. CalL
SAN JOSE. Oct. 6. â The passenger
train which leaves San Francisco at
S:3O for Pacific Grove and Is due here
at 5:20 crashed into a switch engine in
the railroad yards here to-day. A
switch had been left open by the
switching crew. The collision occurred
on the new iron bridge near the J. K.
Armsby packing house. Neither engine
left the track. - - .
That a fatal accident did not happen
was due to the slow speed of the train,
â¢which was running between ten and
twelve miles an hour. When the
engines crashed together the pas
sengers were Jarred and some of them
thrown from the seats. Many were
bruised and some of -the women
screamed with fright. J.B. Schroeder
of this city received a cut over the eye,
and F. B. Searing of Alameda was
slightly hurt- Others received slighter
Injuries.
The engine of the passenger train
was badly wrecked, the pilot and head
light being smashed and a bole stove
In the end of the boiler. The front of
the switch engine was also wrecked.
The wrecked engine was at once re
moved from the passenger train, and
with another engine the train pro
ceeded to Pacific Orove after about
fifteen minutes' delay.
Conductor Clem Armstrong and En
gineer C. N. Wheeler were in charge

Hemy Helms Finds Court's
Order* a Great Hard
ship.
Policeman Henry Helms appeared be
fore Judge Graham yesterday and woe
fully informed the court that an injunc
tion at the request of Mary E. Helms,
forbidding the guardian of the peace
from entering his own home at 55 El
gin Park, had been issued. Mrs. Helms
Is suing for $50 a month for mainten
ance and pending this action an injunc
tion was issued against Helms, re
straining him from disposing of his
property. <^BPQ
"It Is f cry hard," said Helms to Judge
Graham, "to stand all night in front
of your own ht>me singing '"Won't you
open that door and let me in,' etc, espe
cially when you have done nothing.war
ranting such punishment."
"Whut is your name?" asked the
court. - *
"Helms,- Policeman Henry Helms,"
answered the man at the bar. .
"Why, I struck out of the original
document the injunction that you
should not enter your home. You must
have been served with a copy," said the
court.
And such was the case. Judge Gra
ham corrected the copy and Helms
turned homeward to brave , the wrath
that there, a waited him.
Anna and Soren Sorensen both failed
in their efforts to get a divorce In Judge
Hunt's court. Mrs. Sorensen accused
her husband of cruelty and in- return he
Qled a cross-complaint, charging that
the oec'Jliarlty of her demeanor. toward
the dogs of their neighborhood caused
him much mental suffering. He said
she accused him of causing dogs to fol
low her along the streets, told friends
that she was not legally . married, aa
her husband had procured a dog license
Instead of a marriage license when he
wedfipfl her and informed friends that
were discussing a fight of -bulldogs that
she "wanted to hear no more of: their
discussion, as she was not a bulldog
and had no sympathy -writh' such sub
jects.
Judge Hunt said that he could not
see how the woman's aversion to doga
had anything to do with the case, and
as Mrs. SorenÃen had failed to make
any better showing than Sorensen 1 he
would deny the petitions of both partlea.

A tall, stout, overgrown -youth, .twenty
years of age, who gave:the name of D. R. ;
Blbssorai was arrested ]aX the San Fran
cisco National Bank Â£ yesterday ~ by> De
tectives Ed Gibson and T. P. Kiordan and
booked at the City Prison on two' charges
of forgery; He:is. not known; to the po
lice and . positively ; refused 'k when ques
tioned by. Acting Captain': Reynolds '\ to
give any '.information . about : himself, re
marking that .he knew- his rights. ,* ' ' \
; At Uhe lunch hour, on : Th'unsday,. while
C. K. Mclritosh,' the\yice' president of, the
bank, took the place of the paying teller.
Blossom presented a \ check for' sl2s, pur
porting to bear the : . signature of D. S.
Cartwright, drayman, \ 100 '\u25a0 Main street.;; lt
was marked "payroll" "and 'asked for; cer
tain amounts in gold * and 'silver. . Think- 5
ing it was all rlght'the coin was handed
to Blossom. It was ; discovered in a; few
moments * that CartwrigbtV . signature
was a forgery. : It was; a clumsy attempt.
Yesterday about the lunch â¢ hour Blos
som "called again at the , bank carrying
in his hand' a pass book witfi checks.; He
handed a check to the ; paying teller for
$500 ' and asked for ; currency..; The check
borey the ;; same signature^- The paying
teller quietly ; notified . Mclntosh, who
walked to where Blossom^ was standing
and ; holding I out . his hand , said:" "How
are you I old man?" '\u25a0 Blossom did not re
spond, but- ran out' of : the bank. . Me- !
Intosh.. followed him and tripped him as
he was descending ;\u25a0â¢ the \u25a0 steps. Blossom
fell on the sidewalk and Mclntosh .soon
had, a firm grip on r him:' -Cashier Wolf
and two other bank officials ran to Mc-
Intosh's assistance and police headquar
ters was notified.
~ A large crowd gathered around the
bank officials and their prisoner and all
sorts of rumors were started during the
'ten "..minutes prior to the appearance of
the patrol wagon with Detectives Ed
Gibson and T. P. Riordan. Blossom was
taken to the City Prison : and when
searched! two other checks for^ J5OO each
bearing Cartwright'B signature and an
other partly filled \u25a0in were found in his
pockets. On one the 1 name Cartwright
had been written "Cartewright" and a
line drawn through the "c." .
In the passbook which ; he carrier into
the bank with him.' there were checks ion
banks bearing other signatures , and the
police believe that Blossom may have
been successful in swindling some of
these other banks. Only \u25a0 $75 in gold was
found in his pockets. Cartwright does
not know him.
About two years ago a \u25a0 crook lifted a
sack containing $20,000 from the First Na
tion Bank and walked away. with it. He
went into the dining-room of the Broklyn
Hotel, : followed by Mclntosh, where ; he
dropped the sack and made his escape.

on^Bod^ ofiaby Keitji Mix,
Wio Died iFrom Scaldlrig
PHYSICIANS AT FAULT
Christian .Scientist Makes
an Explanation of Treat
ment in . Surgical Cases
The. jury at'the inquest yesterday into
the cause 'of death of : Keith Mix, the IS
months-old r child . of Frank T. Mix, 309
Second avenue^ after. hearing the evidence
brought In a '> verdict : that the child died
on ' October *1 from accidental scalding,
"and that i thereafter any, chance of life
was lost by tardy medical ; attention and
by betas nioved; twice." "\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'.
The most interesting witness was Mrs.
A. > Sudden, - Christian Scientist, of ' 1569
Grove street," She explained that she had
been notified of the child's condition and
that- she: had attended it from 4 Satur
day .l. l morning \u25a0 till ; Sunday; morning, when,
at i her; suggestion," Dr.. Cleary was sum
moned.* Dr. Nlemeyer came instead and
dressed the burns, and Dr. Cleary arrived
a few minutes . later. - Dr. Cleary insisted
on- the boy -being removed to a < hospital,
and / finally ; summoned the ambulance
from' the Park Emergency Hospital. The
boy was taken to that institution, â¢ and
; af terp the burns were dressed the boy'a
father had' him cent to Dr. Hathaway 's
sanitarium, 1823 Turk street, where he
died.
'Mrs. Sudden said that Christian Scien
tists were hot compelled to call in surgical
aid, but as a matter of precaution it wae
done. The treatment by the surgeon was
merely to alleviate the pain. It had noth
ing to, do with the mental condition of the
patient. She did not : believe at any time
that the child. was fatally burned. If the
child -had : lived she would not have
claimed tnat it was through her efforts,
but through ! the Divine ; Being.
â¢ | The Coroner endeavored to Impress upon
her, the responsibility she assumed In not
at once summoning medical aid in a sur
gical case, but jhe was not very ; success
ful. She said she believed the child's
death was due to the fact of its being re
moved to the, Park Hospital and from
there to the sanitarium.
Dr. Niemeyer explained to the Jury that
he and Dr. Cleary believed after a con
sultation that it was better to run the
risk [of \u25a0\u25a0 removing the child to the hos
pUaf'than allow, it to remain at" home, as
there were no proper facilities for treat
ing lt.^..
Mrs. Leonard Stone, 311 Second avenue,
testified that she had offered the services
of her own' physician free of charge to-
Mrs. Mix oh Saturday morning,* but her
offer had been declined. She had suggest
ed' using VBweet oil and cotton on the
burns, - which suggestion had been fol
lowed. ',
'Dr. Ij. D. Bacigalupi, autopsy surgeon,
testified that tne burns would have prob
ably been necessarily fatal arid that the
treatment before a physician was sum
moned was all right, but" the. child should
not I have been carried around by either
its father or mother while suffering from
the burns. ' . "* . .

VICTORY OVER LIGK FILLS THE HEARTS OF
ARDENT ROOTERS WITH HOPE
Work of Veterans
â¢ Is a Big Help to
Youngsters.
Captain Saunders Is
Developing Fast
Team.
The frame of mind the Polytechnic
students and pigskin players have been
left in is without doubt a happy one,
due to their victory over the football
team from the California School of Me
chanical Arts last Wednesday.
For the last three years these two
teams have been in the final games,
while the Lick team has beaten its ri
vals two out of three times. The Poly
technic team has always been in the
running and it was only by the hardest
righting that Lick finally downed Poly.
By the way things look, the patrons
of the local sub-league football matches
are to be treated to several extra
games. Already the Lowell and Lick
high schools have protested the game
with Polytechnic. In fact, the Tiger
players went on the field last Wednes
day under protest. â¢
The trouble lies with John Garibaldi,
"Polys" star half-back. Charges of
professionalism are brought against
him, and if these are proven the wear
ers of the red and black will be relieved
of the championship. However, the
parses left will be played as scheduled,
only â under protest.
The decision of the A. A. L. commit
tee is eagerly awaited by the students
of all the schools of San Francisco,
which may bring victory or defeat to
their respective teams. Protests eeem
to be the main features of every aca
demic sport. It will be remembered that
three years ago "Poly" won the sub
league championship on a protest after
Lick had beaten her by a score of 10-2,
so it is only natural that the schools
want to retaliate, besides acting for the
good of the sport.
The Polytechnic team this year is com
posed of exactly the right "stuff" for a
winning aggregation, and with a little
more conscientious training should be
able to give the victor of the schools
across the bay a goou time. To make
matters look good this season. Poly has
six of her best men from last year's team.
Captain Saunders, their right end, has
been playing on the team for three years
and now raruos as one of the best ends
in the league.
Edwards, their fullback, is undoubtedly
the best fu-iback icit. His consistent
gaining is the feature of every game.
Captain Saunders, though the lightest
man en the team, and in the league for
that matter, is practically the backbone
of the team, and it Is due to his genera*
ehip tnat a winning team was developed.
The games still left include: Licks vs.
Mission and Polytechnic vs. Mission and
Xonell.
CARDINAL TKAM IMPROVING.
Rooter. Flgrnre the Babies to Glre
Berkeley Good Time.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 6.â
The rapid improvement in the form of
the freshmen squad is the all-absorbing
topic of the Cardinal football fan.
Until yesterday his mind was filled
with dismal forebodings, as by con
sulting the "dope" he was able to esti
mate that the Blue and Gold youngsters
would Just about make three touch
downs against the local squad. All is
now changed. Berkeley appears to
have had a reversal in form and Is per
haps on the road to becoming stale
while the "pony" team of Stanford by
defeating the crack eleven of the Bel
rpont Military Academy yesterday, a
feat which has not been performed In
many years, proved conclusively that
they are of sufficient caliber to form
one of the best aggregations that ever
represented a freshmen class of a uni
versity.
Line positions are about settled. At
left end Blood or Owen will enter the
game; at left tackle, Cuthbertson; left
guard, Hihn; and center, either Doane
or Bar more; right guard, right tackle,
Crawford: right end, Altman or Tower.
Ilolman, the quarterback, who . has
proved himself to be an excellent ad
vancer of the ball in a scattered field,
-will be the only man for the position
and It Is even hinted that he will cap
tain the team in the game with Berke
ley. The back field positions are the ones
upon which full pressure Is brought
*to bear. At right half Palmer and
Terrlll have been doing excellent work.
The position of full-back lies between
Goodell and Ellis, the' former having
perhaps a little more advantage. Right
half is closely contested by Stolz and
Torney. both of whom are doing heroic
work.
To-morrow the freshmen will meet
the team from the University of the
Pacific. It Is probable that the game
will result. ln a close and sharply con
tested match.
The varsity Is hard at work and will
continue to be In that condition for the
rest of the month Intervening between
the date of the big contest. All fresh
men who were on the squad have been
dropped to their class team, with the
exception of Blow, who Is ~ doing fine
work at right tackle. This husky
youngster Is not, however, eligible for
either the varsity or the / freshmen
elevens, as he comes to Stanford with
Advance etandinir from Santa Clara
College, which prohibits Intercollegiate
competition for the first year of; uni
versity attendance.
The Fifteenth Infantry will clash
with, the squad to-morrow. These two
rtmes will fall on tho same afternoon
"POLY" ELEVEN A STAR AGGREGATION
CRICKET SEASON
NEARS ITS END
San Francisco Eleven Will
Line Up Against Picked
Team On Alameda Grounds
The event set down on the schedule
of the California Cricket Association
for to-morrow is a -match between the
winners 01 the ISOS championship, the
San Francisco County Club, and a com
bined eleven, on the grounds at Web
ster street, Alameda. The combined
eleven would have to be selected from
the Pacific and Alameda teams, but as
the Pacific Club lacks three of its
strongest playersâ H. F. Elliott, E. sH.
Wilkes and Dr. O. N. Taylor â and the
captain of the Alameda Club was able
to get together only four of his regular
eleven for the last scheduled match
between the Alameda and San Fran
cisco County clubs, it seems almost cer
tain that the match will not be played.
E. H. M. Lannowe, captain of the Pa
cific Cricket Club, was trying last Sun
day to gether together an eleven for
to-morrow, but his efforts met with
little encouragement.
The championship of 1905 having
been won, interest in the game has al
most ceased, though a pick-up game
or two may be played, as the season
does not close till October 15. H. F.
Elliott did not play for the Pacifies
last Sunday, as he has already taken
up association football. Dr. O. N. Tay
lor is In Boston, while Wilkes 1 employ
ment will keep him out of the city.
The Vampire and Eagle association
football clubs are desirous to get pos
session of the grounds at Webster
street, Alameda, for practice before the
series of games for the championship
of the California A. F. League opens.
All the matches for the 1905 cham
pionship of the California Cricket As
sociation having been played, the com
plete record for the season is as fol
lows:

Coming Season Promises
to Be a Very Lively One
At the annual meeting of the California
Association Football 1 Union it was- decided
to withdraw from -.the Pacific Association
of the Amateur Athletic Union, the dele
gates from the football clubs believing that
membership In the Pacific Association |Is
not worth what.lt costs. Every; playing
footballer paid 25 "cents into' the treas
ury of the Pacific Association, .which
amounted to more than- $70 a" year; "yet
the Pacific Association referred all
tions as to the status of a footballer back
to the Football Union.' The football clubs
propose to Join J the American Amateur

amount to 57 or $8 only. TheiC. A.':F. ; U.

RACKETS SWING
ON THE COURTS
Contest for the Bay Coun
ties Championship Will Be
Eesumed This Afternoon
MANY HAVE A CHANCE
Interest Is Centered in the
Match Between-Percy Mui*
dock and George Baker
Play will be resumed in the tennis
tournaments for the championship of
the bay counties on the Park courts to
morrow. Tne preliminary acck first
rounds-' of the singles were run off last
Sunday and as a result /many of the
poorer players were weeded out. Some
of the second round matches will prove
Interesting, but a majority of them will
probably be one-sided. In only one
matches there much speculation as to
the probable winner. This is " tHe
George Baker-Percy Murdock contest,
and It should prove one of the best In
the tournament.
Both Baker and Murdock are veterans
and the winner stands an excellent
chance of winning the championship.
Their styles of play are entirely differ
ent and an Interesting match should
result. Baker's chief stock in trade is
his steadiness, while Mnrdock Is in
clined to take chances. Baker has not
been playing the game as well of late
as he did formerly, while Murdock Is
In good shape. . Murdock's best game is
probably better than Baker's, but the
latter Is more reliable than hl3 oppo
nent. Whatever the outcome the spec
tators are sure to see a close and in
teresting match.
The, Whitney-Long match may prove
a good one, but Long will have to play \
better than he did last Sunday to make !
a showing. The remaining matches in
the second round will bring together
players who are not evenly matched.
Griffin* will probably beat Martin about
as he pleases and Nell Baker should
have little trouble. disposing , of Lytton.
Gardner should have an equally. J easy
time disposing of Ambrose and Gabriel
is expected to take Hall Into camp.
The third round, which will also be
played to-morrow, will be productive
of some great matches. Janes and
Griffln will come together in the first
match, which will be without a dull
moment. Both youngsters hit the .balls
hard and take all kinds of chances. The
coast champion Is expected by the ma
jority to win, but lf : Griffln Is at his
best the match will be anything but a
walkover. The clever little player from
the park is always a dangerous oppo
nent. .
Whitney will probably. meet the win
ner of the Baker-Murdock match and
more good tennis will result. N. Baker
and Gardner will, also furnish an In
teresting match. While Is ex
pected to win, his steady opponent will
sur-ely make things warm for him.
Foley â¢ will probably win from Gabriel,
who has had little practice of late. BO.i
youngsters * play a â¢ clever "/ game . and
'their match should prove a good pne.
Gabriel, at times, plays brilliant tennis,
and if he should have. one of his good
days, Foley would have no sure thing
of it. . Play will be completed' to the
semi-finals. : '"
;. Only, two matches were played In the
doubles last Sunday. , Rolf c and
Schmidt will meet Gabriel and Brabant
in the preliminary round. The Califor
nia^ Club .men will probably win ana
will ? be opposed. to the. Baker brothers
In the , first . round. .This ; match should
prove one * of ; the . best of the ; tournament.
; .The only, other.'; match In the first
round- of; any consequence will be that
between: -Whitney and Foley and
'Adams and Janes. The^ former almost
beat, the .tournament \ winners at San
Rafael .and will prove a hard team to
beat. , The winner of .this ; match will
surely, play In the finals, as the other

BEHtKELEY. Oct. 6.â The "babies" of
the blue and gold football squad hold the
center of the stage now, with Coach
Knibbs, and they will continue to monop
olize the .limelight until their gasno with
the Stanford freshmen one week from to
morrow Is ended. Then they will be all
of the past. With such few exceptions
as may convince the coach they are good
varsity material.
The youngsters, on form, are- figured to
beat the Cardinal aggregation. They have
defeated all the high school teams pitted
against them, and once have tied the-
Berkeley High. Stanford's record la not
so good, but still, surprises have been
developed In the Cardinal camp before
this", and Coach Knibbs has the "babies"
drilling away like raw â¢'recruiters" these
days, regardless of the tales that float
up from Palo Alto about the discouraging
condition of the freshmen team there.
Knibbs i 3 a bit wily himself and knows
to a nicety the art of concealing hla hand.
That indeed, seems to be one of his fa
vorite maneuvers, and Stanford Is like
ly this year to regard the Dartmouth
man as the Frenchmen are said to have
looked upon Yon Moltke. the "silent
man." Knibbs lies low, and nays very
little. He may spring a few new ones
in the freshman game, but even then It
Is not supposed that his hand will be
very materially "tipped" for Stanford's
benefit on the day of the big game.
Coach Knibbs will certainly have the
freshman give an exhibition of speed,
however, for when the team began serious
work against Berkeley High last Wednes
day the pace was very fast. Knibbs
demands lots of speed, and his work is
along lines that enable his mea to play
I fast and with accuracy.
Knibbs has the varsity squad out for
! practice dally, but one peculiar feature of
1 their practice 13 that not a single scrlm
! mage has as yet been Indulged In by the
1 men. , The scrimmages are an old estab
lished feature of practice work for thÂ«
squad, but Knibbs will have none of
them. They may possibly come later
no one knowsâ for Knibbs Is the silent
man of the gridiron. Meanwhile the stars
and the ordinary menâ all the candidates
for places toil steadily under Knibbs'
eagle eye, and Dartmouth methods are
drilled into them dally.
The big game Is six weeks away, and
Knibbs laughs at questioners who would
like to be given a hint of his Ideas about
the team's chances* and the showing it
is making now. Knlbba will not discuss
football as it is played in Calif omla^ He
declines to make speeches at the rallies,
except to say that he is out here on
business, which business is to put a
winning team on the field against Stan
ford, and that he will say no more until
the night before the game, at the big
smoker rally. Then he promises to talk
at length. ,
Snedigar is out on the field daily, and
Is in pretty good shape already despite
the fact that he la several weeks behind
the rest of the squad in training. His
decision to again get In the game heart
ened the squad perceptibly. - He will make
a: lot of difference in the going, seasoned
and expert as he is.
Vine varsity will go against Willamette
to-morrow. ; afternoon, 'being the second
game the team has played this season.
The game with St. Vincent last Saturday
was a tiresome, one-sided affair; but
Willamette Is expected to provide more
opposition.' Stanford' defeated the north-*
erners without great difficulty; go that thÂ»
varsity team merely has to run up a
bigger score to Indicate superiority * over
the Cardinal." > :> v

The Angels had all the luck yesterday
afternoon and the Seals were as bad as
the southern ctars on the previous day.
â¢o the game dragged wearily along -with .
the Angels on the U>ng end all the time.
There was hardly a' redeeming feature to
the contest and every fan in the lot was
happy Tv-hen the last man was called out.
Dolly Gray as usual butted into holes
In every inning, but that old-time luck
of bis always stood by him at the critical
moment an<i he eidestepped some awful
bad looking spots. The Seals had chances
on top of chances to break up the game,
but they fell down on every occasion save
one, when a run was squeezed through.
Jimmy Whalen was hit pretty hard,
but he did net try to pitch after Wilson
let an easy one go through him in the
third, which gave the Angels their start.
Jimmy lobbed the next two batters easy
ones and they walloped the ball for hits,
which brought in runs. The score:

Slwasbes Pot Tenive Runs Over and
Field I/Ike Champs.
SEATTLE, Oct. 6.â lt would hardly be
fair to say that Oakland played ball this
afternoon. The locals simply did as they
pleased. In the first inning the home
tetun set the pace by batting in a pair
of runs and in the second they came in
a bunch, totaling seven. . Lauterborn
opened the inning with a clean single
and .the next time he came up . he made
a three-bagger. As the skies were dark,
Oakland played for rain and made a
farce out of the game. After five in
nings had been played they saw it was
no use and they braced up. ' The game
\u25a0was finished before a drop of rain fell.
The locals played fast ball behind the
good pitching of Charley Hall. Schmidt
â¢ got a clean tdngle off mm in the third,
but cot no farther than first That was
the only semblance cf a hit until
ninth, when Van Haltren beat out* an
Infield tap and Dunleavy poked out a
safe one. Oakland did not get a man
past second, however.' Score:

MORAN FOULS
JOHNNY CROWE
Local Youth Gets Decision
in a Fi^ht That Has a
Scent of Dead -Cabbage
WOULD BOX WITH NEIL
Gotliamite's Opponent AVants
to Get a Match: With
Frankie at 122 Bounds
In a fight that had a stronger scent
than the aroma of defunct cabbage that
permeates the atmosphere of Colma,
Johnny Crowe got the decision over Tony
Moran of New York on a foul in the
fourth round last night. -Â£he vegetables
WQre only a secondary offense to the
nostrils when that go was pulled off.
It was the case of a veteran against
the comer. The boy might have worn
down the bald-headed battle-axe in time,
but Mr. T. Moran of New York wasn't
going to be flinished that waj*. In the
nrst round he landed a few under the
beltâ light ones that didn't count. The
crowd hooted and hissed. But Mr. T.
Moran kept trying to Jab Crowe in the
knees.
E. Grar.ey was there in the same straw
hat that dropped tears of glue when J.
Edward Britt was gathered to his fathers.
The village blacksmith was doing some
generalship for Crowe. The youngster
was evidently profiting from the sage
advice of Graney, for he was landing on
the India-rubber veteran with the bald
head early and often for tnree rounds.
In the first of the fourth the Crowe
drooped his wings a little. The bald head
was ehlning like the hcadlipnt of an auto
and the round looked like a question
mark for a few minutes.
Bight in the middle of the round Moran
crouched and led for Crowe's left toe.
He missed and the slap landed on the
thigh. Crowe molded his features slowly
into the expression that the leading man
wears when the house Is bad and sank
to the floor. Referee 801 Levinson didn't
sound any counts. ' Crowe rolled over on
his back and looked up at the rafters
soulfully and sadly.
It was all over. Moran walked over to
apologize or demand fare back to that
dear Xew York, N. V. â nobody knows
which. In a second Crowe was up and
wanted to make it a case of "they all
joined In.** ":.r,^";
Crowe landed one wild one in Moran's
direction in the scramble and the war of
all nations was over. The "comer", re
sumed once more his afr of tragedy and
was carried away by willing hands.
After the "'smoke had cleared away and
the free-for-all for the cars began It
was announced that Johnny Crowe would
fight Frankie Neil at 122 at .3 o'clock for
a $2)00 Bide bet. This announcement was
not given the horse laugh, but the multi
tude was from old Missouri.
One of the oldest inhabitants of Colma
suggested a way for Crowe to beat Moran
early In the came. "- \u25a0'. -'\u25a0' \u25a0 : \u25a0-
"Just sprinkle a little molasses on that
bald nut of his," be suggested to Eddie
Granny. ""When he reaches up to chase
the flies the kid can get In the hay
maker."
Before the tragedy of Johnny Crowe
was staged Eddie Kehoe got the decision
In a preliminary over Willie Edwards.
Edwards wore green tights, but did not
live up to them.
Mr. J. Coffroth, "who framed the match,
went home in a vegetable wagon dis
guised as a carrot.

(AMERICAN LEAGUE.)
ST. LOUIS, Oct. B.â lt devolved upon
St. Louis, the tail-enders in the league
pennant race, to finally head off the
Chicago American League baseball
team and drive the 'final spike in the
tatter's - aspirations for the 1905 pen
nant when the coveted piece -of. bunt-
Ing was almost within its grasp and to
give Philadelphia a clear title to the
American. League championship. Al
most" as remarkable as the now his- !
fofic burst of speed displayed by Chi
cago-on its last Eastern trip was' the
reversal of form of the locals when
they drove Dr. White. Manager Jones'
premier pitcher, from the box in the i
third Inning and snowed the visiting
team under an avalanche of hits and
runs, practically clinching the game,
which they finally won by a score of
6 to 2... .
With two runs already counted In the
fateful third, Manager Jones started
to substitute Walsh for White. There
was a hurried consultation and Jones
gave White an other opportunity. The
next two St. Louis men to face the Chi
cago pitcher hit safely, Tom Jones for
a double and Koehler for a home run.
Walsh was then sent In and held the
locals safely the remainder of the game,
but the damage was done. "Attendance,

FIVE BUNKO MEN
LANDED IN JAIL
Intended Victim Leads De
tectives to Boom
Card Sharps.
â¢ Through an Austrian, . named . John
Cilee, an engineer, who has been travel-
Ing .through this country to' gain ex
perience, the police last night nabbed
a gang -of men Intent upon pulling off
a bunko ; game that might have netted
them thousands. Cilee has been living
at the St. Francis Hotel since he came
here from Los Angeles three days ago.
and Thursday afternoon he met a man on
Market street who seemed to ' be wise
to all the. moves of a big city. It was
this stranger who introduced Cilee to
the. gang of operators working In tho
Edinburgh Hotel on Powell street, near
Geary.
\u0084The confidence men were in readiness
for;.the supposed, gudgeon- when Cilee
piloted* the pollce'to their room yester
day, afternoon' and five Individuals were
taken into custody. During the last
few weeks 'several bunko . deals have
been pulled off in this city and all of
them have been credited t'o%the gang
,that attempted to take . Cilee in.
' : Detective Ryan of the Pollca Depart-,
ment, House Detective Claude :MJ
Herschey of . the St. Francis Hotel and
several policemen made the raid on tho
gang's headquarters. Those arrested
were: E. .'.'Poker", Davis, Henry Matson,
Charles Watson, 1R- Devener Hickman
and Hugh Trainor.' The latter^ has gono
under the name of John Harris through
out \ the country and was' arrested
at St. Louis MfofVbjxnko ' operations.
Davis Is a". well-known* man. ln Los*An-~
geles, where he is a property-owner.
He -has also been . Identified .with" men
in; the "world of graft" and the last
time he came 'under the notice of the
police; was .when he. stood for the 'ball
moirey.; put up for the two Johnstons,
father and "son, who skipped out "at the
time the" local" police thought. they had
aTconvictlo'n^ certain against them. On
this ' occasion : they forfeited 51000 bail
each, which- Davis had deposited for
them. At this time a man narned*Jack
son,"alias; Miller, , was convicted of -.the
same â¢ crime that the Johnatohs'rwere
accused* of and sentenced to ten years
in San" Quentin. . .
When : ; Detective , Ryan brought '[\u25a0_ the
quintet to the City /Prison .he: placed
their I names 'on the detinue :,book :and
put ithem \in the tanks. Subsequently
he ~: them", with ;. vagrancy ? and

IN COLLISION
DURING A FOG
Steam Schooner Brooklyn Is
Run Into Off Point Reyes
by the San Gabriel
DECK LOAD SAVES HER
Lumber Vessel Would Have
Been Cut, ln Two but fon
the Nature of Her Cargo
The steam schooner Brooklyn. Cap
tain Hanson, came into port yesterday
with agapinp hole In her side, the''re
sult of having been in collision with. the
steamer. San-. Gabriel. Captain Hamilton.
The fact that the Brooklyn was laden
with lumber is all that saved her, from
foundering:. Tho vessels 'came together
at 2 a. in. yesterday off. Point. Reyea
during-' a thick fog. The San Gabriel,
bound for UmpQ.ua from San Pedro,
struck the Brooklyn 'squarely on the
starboard side, amidships. The San
Gabriel is a steel vessel with an un
usually Bharp prow. Had'the Brooklyn
been in ballant the sharp bow would
have cut her clear through and sent her
to the bottom.
. As It was the deckload of lumber was
cut Into a. considerable tlepth. The
Brooklj'n's guard was not cut through.

A "IJnrt Man" From Alnmedn.
\u25a0 Alexander I Reach describes himself as a
"bad man" from Alameda. He is younr and
tough. He had been drinking. As a climax
to a somewhat strenuous spree he decided to
commit suicide and selected the bulkhtad Â«*
Mission street, convenient to the Harbor Hos
pital, as a good place from which to dive into
the bay. He dived. A friend dived after him
and with the assistance of bystanders pulled
Roach onto the wharf. He was taken to the
Harbor Hospital, where he became so violent
and abusive that 4iu friend expressed regret
at having be-n foolish enough to interfere with
Roach's suicide programme. After his - wet
clothes had been removed Koach announced
himself a bad man from Alameda and invited
the surgeons to trot out any San Francisco
man who thought he could tight. He talked
Ilk* a bad man. He looked like a bad man.
But when little Miss Dwyer, the matron on
duty, took a Jiu Jitsu hold of his wrist and
yanked him into the ward, he yielded like a
lamb. Stout straps were then attached to his
hands and feet and under their restraining
influtnee he was constrained to stay in bed
until his clothes dried.
Nearly In Collision.
Angelo and Rocca Cargnila. Italian fisher
men, report that at 1 o'clock yesterday morning
they -JvÂ«re nearly run down off Angel Island
during a dense tog by the uik ferry steamer
Ukiah. The Uklah. they say, appeared to be
lopt and narrowly escaped going ashore on
Angel Island. The fishermen say they sound
ed their Xog horn repeatedly, but that the big
ferry paid no attention and but for their own
desperate efforts would have run them down.
As It was one of the Ukiah's paddles struck
their. boat a glancing blow.

promises to cause renewed activity In .reinsur

stock market continued entirely subservient to
the money market, where stringency continued
to prevail throughout the day. with the rul

accumulated a sufficiently large surplus to
enable them to extend fresh accommodations

there Is no probability of a resumption of ac

Wise and Brandy Shipments.
The Pacific Wine and Spirit Review gives
the following wine and brandy shipments by
rÂ«1l and eea out of California duriru: the fis
cal year ending June 30. 1905:
With rpsuect to the business in bulk wines
th* cojnxÂ»r*.tive situation is the best in the
history of the industry, the gain la the move
ment of wines by rail being far In excess of
eny previous record. The figure* of rail ship
ment* of bulk wines were 14.2*0.272 gallons,
which is In excess of the shipments for the
f previous fiscal year by more than 3.000,000 gal
lore. The natural conclusion of those familiar
with tbe exoort trade would be that the ex
cessive rail shipments were due to the bad
facilities for getting goods to New York via.
r'anama, but the figures showing the move
ments of wines by sea. do not Indicate any
â¢ eucfc explanation. For instance, the exports .
by sea to all points in the fiscal jear ending
June 30, 1904, were 6.864.806 gallons, while
in the Sfcal year ending June 30 last the fig
ures were 6.487,210 gaUons. So it Is plaiu
that that twelvemonth was an exceptionally
promising one, and if this ratio of increase
could be maintained each year thÂ« wine in
custry tÂ»r the Golden State would coon forge
to the point in tbe forefront where It would
L V(. in the liicellght instead of the twilight.
m However, it is a sturdy Infant In these days
Â«j;4 will Â«vectually makÂ« a splendid record.
The statistical situation as to wine in glass
both by rail and sea shows no marked Im
provement over that of the same tlrnÂ« last
year. The figures follow:

As comDOjed with the export figures of the

jeer ere nÂ°t oniy surprising, but uneatisfac
tory,' k> far as case gods are concerned. This
*iatcjner.t is Justified by the fact that the

M agalnft 6832 ca.i's 747.0C5 gallons, bulk. In

\fw York Stock Market.
NEW YOHK, Oct. fl. â Speculative interest
pretty well died out of the market to-day and
the determination teemed to be reached to
t welt znoro dtnnlte outcome of the money sit
uation. The rate fcr call loans did not rise to !
tbe high level of yesterday. But, the average
rate at which call money was placed was above
that of yesterday. Some trust companies were ;
reported to be calling loans and this gave the
Impression that these institutions had about
reached the limit of their ability to relieve bor
rowers from the banks by transfer of loans,
a process which hae gone on steadily for sev
eral weeks paÂ»t. This being the case and with
the depletion of bank reserves still Interrupted,
an actual contraction of cr-oiis would be In
dicated for the Immediate future rather than
tbÂ« shifting about of accommodations to enable
\u25a0 ilie bank to preserve the semblance of a sur
kv'u* wbich ha*> gone on up to this time. The
Ttri)babil!ty of a wÂ«ak bank return to-morrow
ilso came In for consideration. There is the
chance that the readjustment of the Incon
gruities In -last .week's banking operations af
fecting: this week's statement. This may af
fect U>e showing of loan Items which the call
ins: of Joans â¢ during ttie week would naturally
tend to reduce. The eubtreafury fau tatta
from thÂ« toioksthus far this week only 51,46*.Â«
000 as compared with nearly $7,000.4)00 last
week. But estimates by bankers cf a regular
movement of currency to and from the interior
indicate' a sufficient balance of the movement
against this eentar to bring again a eajsh loss
for the banks to $6,000,000 or ?T.000,000. Next
wÂ©Â«k it is expected that preparations will be
gin for the payment at the end of the week
of th^ last installment on Japanese loan sub
scriptions which calls for a maximum of about
$30,000,000, modified to the extent that pay
ments in lull may have been anticipated. For
eign money.' markets were somewhat disturbed
also by the money position, Paris selling In
vestment securities in London and London sell,
Ing herÂ«. There wÂ«s a slight reaction in thÂ«
discount rate at Berlin, but the rate advanced
in London to within a shade of the bank rats
and there was an upward reaction from the
recant downward course of sterling exchange
in Paris. It could not be learned that any
part of the dsy'a large arrivals of gold In
London hsd been secured from Xew York, but
a report was circulated here that yesterday's
withdrawal of f4.500.0C0 from thÂ« Bank of
France was destined for New York and not for
London, as was reported yesterday. Intima
tions from Washington that plans were taking
form for an tssuÂ« of Panama canal bonds took
their place with other subjects bearing on fu
ture requirements upon the mon-sy market.
Xews of the day otherwise was not of much
interest and was of scarcely any effect. Re
ports of railway earnings for August, includ
ing those of the Harriman Pacifies and St.
Paul wert notable for the largo portion of the
increase in gross earnings which was absorbed
by increased operating expenses which In th*
case of St. Paul was sufficient to leave only a
nominal increase In the nÂ«t earnings. The die
for sterling exchange went lower here jln re
spons* to the stiff money market. Exports of
wheat for th* week showed a decline of. 603,290
bushels from those of last week, explaining the
scarcity of grain bills in the. exchange market.
Tho early downward movement of stocks was
g-enerally recovered before the end of the day
on a dull buying movement, "he closing ton*
was irregular.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, S ATURD AY, OCTOBER tfj. 1900
CANNOT CALL
WILL GENUINE
The Bridget McDermont j will contest,
which was in many respects the most re
markable piece of litigation of the kind
in the history of California law, was de
cided by the Supreme Court yesterday. It
is held that the will presented for probate
was not genuine, and the estate will be
distributed according ' to the statutes gov
erning the disposition of property left by
Intestate persons. â¢
Mrs. McDermont was worth approxi
mately $100,000. Her heirs at law were
brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces. ! At
first no will was found and a brother was
appointed administrator, . of the ; estate.
Several months after Mrs. McDermont's
death Ann Burns, a niece, . presented what
purported to be a will for probate. The
document was a peculiar one, and the
story that went with It was "remark
able," in the phraseology of the Supreme
Court. :
It was related that a Mrs. Foy was
emptying a basket of clothes one day
when she discovered a paper. Mr. Burns,
husband of the proponent, who was
standing at hand, observed, "Perhaps it
Is a Will." Mrs. Foy gazed at the docu
ment a moment and said, "It is a will."
It proved to be the "last will and . testa- v
ment of Bridget McDermont." James Ker
win testified . that he had met Mrs. Mc-
Dermont on Market street, San Francis
co, one day and she asked for an "honest
lawyer." Kerwin kindly, led her to one C.
Michner, who testified that he drew up
the will. Kerwin signed it as a witness.
Mrs. McDermont made her mark.:
The Judge of the Superior Court con
cluded that the will was hardly the prop
er thing to protfate. The Supreme Court
sustains that view.

GIRL DELUGES COURT
WITH FINE IRONY.
Arrested While Fixing
v Her Coiffure on
the Street r
She Tells Judge That
Her Offense Was
Most Awful.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
She was quite ready to be sentenced to
a long term of imprisonment. Miss Daisy
Evans, obviously in sarcasm, told Police
Judge Mogan, for nobody could possibly
realize more fully than she did' at that
moment the enormity of the offenseâ
maybe she would better say crimeâ for
which Patrolman '.'Dave" Sullivan had
arrested her.
Oh, it would be useless to endeavor to
belittle the reprehensibility of her con
duct, she continued in withering tone.
If any deed could be morei felonious than
that of halting at a shop window contain
ing a mirror and utilizing the latter
while one gathered up one's vagrant
tresses and pinned them in place, she
would like to be informed of the nature
of Â£he surpassing law-defiance.
Was that all she did?/
Her gracious, wasn't that enough?
What worse cpuld she have done?, She
might have murdered some Inoffensive
person, ~ but would that have been less
biamable than deliberately halting, upon
an CFarrell-street sidewalk at 11 : p. -m.
and borrowing the use of a looking-glass
while she smoothed her disordered coif
fure? , Her goodness, If such \ behavior
wasn't of sufficient toughness to .make
her the stellar criminal of the ; century,
then" she was awfully sorry, for she
could not do anything to win . that en
viable distinction. But what was the use
of standing there talking? She knew, and
the worldâ including the : courtâ knew that
she was deserving of ** the most severe
penalty mentioned t in y the statutes, and
she was prepared to" take her medicine.:
There was no irony In the \ formal com
plaint : against . Miss Evans, jlt I flatly ac
cused her of vagrancy. In response to
her \u25a0', plea that \ she was "doing ] up" her
hair, at the time of ' arrest, Patrolman
Sullivan stated that she seemed to have
a penchant for that sort of thing, as he
had frequently seen her "primping" in
front of store windows that afforded the
requisite reflection.
No, she was not " guilty of vagrancy,
Miss Evans pleaded, \u25a0. because she recent
ly came from a luxurious' home in the in
terior of the "Stateâ exact locality she pre
ferred to abstain from disclosingâ and in
dulgent parents sent to her enough money
to maintain her: in respectability. The
object of her .residence in the city \she
would also refuse to J reveal, . because she
considered, it nobody's :\u25a0/\u25a0 business other
than her own; But, 'her goodness gra
cious, what did the charge of vagrancy
amount to when . sized up against the
confessed fact that 'she # had stood upon
a public street and fixed up her hair?
She might ask, indeed, if that damning
outrage would not pale to insignificance
,an accusation of .homicide. .
When the case was continued till Mon
day ' after next Miss Evans audibly won
dered *why she was not , sent up * for* life
right there and then. what was the
use, she inquired* of postponing the in
evitable? â¢â¢ .
â¢ '.' â¢ - *
"He earns $90 a month ,V said Mrs. Carlo
Fulvio, .swarthy and careworn, of : coun
tenance, alluding to , her husband, , "and
since last December he I hasn't â¢ con
tributed a cent to the support of our two
children." â¢ - â¢ .... *
"She tella da bull-con," exclaimed
Signor Fulvio, ; deprecatingly shrugging
his brawny shoulders. "Ah loosada Job
da year ago, an' ddoa da loaf cv' seence."
"Even If a family .were ! , not dependent
upon your industry, you are too big and
strong to loaf ' gracefully," ; quoth Judge
Conlan, "and if > within a week \u25a0 you : are
not working for money and maintaining
your household I'll send you to jail."
"Ah, mlstaire.r where'a da Job, ; eh?"
Slgnor Fulvio. inquired,; and his tone was
tinged with triumph.
"Seek and ye shall find," was his Hon
or's reply.' ; - Â£?.- â¢;'â¢;'\u25a0' '\u25a0 . " .:**&\u25a0/$
Several patients in the , Lane Hospital
had. complained of .having been myste
riously deprived of personal , property ere
one of the- attendants,; Abraham; Levin,
was arrested (and, booked for petty lar

It was stated to. Judge Cabaniss that
when Mr.'Pretntiss, .who was abed and
apparently asleep,: saw Mr." Levin" fum
bling with his (Mr. I Prentiss') % watch,
he surprised the? attendant by .,- quietly
asking him; what he; was; doing; with
the timepiece. Muttering
about feeling the ; patient's pulse, ? the
attendant withdrew,; and Mr. , Prentiss
then discovered .that 525 ; had ' been
stolen from him. ; But there , was :no
absolute proof that Mr." Levin. had taken
the, missing money, ; so; dismissal of the
charge was ordered by. the Judge.
Dr. J. S. Joslin, a young; physician;
pleadedfthat he; owed;hls arrestto^a
combination of ; remarkable -business
promptitude on i'the / part 'of : . Eugene

he resorted ; ' to ;f the , expedient ; of re
questing Mr. .Ratto' to "\u25a0 cash for him &
$25 check,, which, he alleged," would be
honored at sight when presented In the
designated bank. Now, he did not hap
pen to have $25 to his credit in that
bank, but had means of obtaining a
sum greater and his intention was to
deposit said sum before Mr. Ratto
would be likely to present the check.
But he underrated Mr. Ratto's alacrity
In fiscal affairs,, for. while he stood. at
the bar and separated himself from a
portion of the cash Mr. Ratto. was
speeding toward the bank. ,
As soon as he ascertained what Mr.
Ratto's hasty exit meant the doctor
dashed after him, but in the race he
was beaten by more than a nose. .When
he arrived at, the bank Mr. Ratto had
been there and was then en route to
the office of the warrant clerk, he be
ing satisfied that the doctor had will
fully cheated him.
Mr. Ratto told the court that the $25
had been paid to him and that he re
gretted .having doubted the doctor's
probity, so the case was dismissed.
With a golden double-eagle In one of hit
pockets Nestor Andersen deserted his hog
ranch at Colma and came to partake of
such gustatory | delights as are purchas
able in metropolitan cafes. An appetite
jaded by his prolonged adherence to a
regimen both humble and lacking of va
riety he whetted to razor-edge keenness
by Imbibing freely .of varlous' l "brand 3 of
bitters, and when he- dropped into the
restaurant managed by, Constantin Cona
palus, on Fourth street, near Folsom, his
cash capital was greatly diminished and
his hunger voracious. ;
. In a mixture of pure Scandinavian and
weirdly distorted English the swine
breeder ) ordered certain viands, and the
restaurateur | nodded appreciatlngly and
hastened to the kitchen. But when the
food was before the more-than
ever-hungry Mr. Andersen he was strick
en with horror to see that his order. had
been either willfully or inadvertently mis
interpreted and that the meal tendered
to him consisted largely of commodities
akin to those he had consumed at Colma
.until they palled his taste. He shudder
fhgly pressed his nostrils with the fingers
of his right hand while he commanded
Slgnor Conapalus to remove beyond his
olfactory range the .source; of odors that
he had inhaled with trl-dally regularity
at home. ' .

In vain did Mr. Andersen, whose hun
ger grew apace, plead that he had not or
dered baconâ that he had journeyed all
the way from Colma to lose the taste and
scent of bacon. .. Slgnor Conapalus was
obdurate, refusing to remove the offen
sive meal or to cook any other until he
was paid a sum of 70 cents. And that was
how Mr. And,ersen came, to be arrested
and jailed before he could fulfill the ob
ject of .his visit to the city.
In the court of Judge Fritz the 70 cents
claimed by Slgnor Conapalus was paid
by Mr. Andersen, who was then released
from custody. With only 35 cents in his
possession, he hastened forth to purchase
a baconless breakfast.
As nobody claimed ownership of the

Mogan dismissed, the case. "Â« ?-
Patrolman R. Williamson swore that
he saw Mr. Algec pick up the barrel
at Fourth and Townsend streets and
place it in his wagon, and Mr. Algec
admitted having done so. but averred
that his motive was philanthropic
rather than larcenous, inasmuch as the
barrel, apparently a derelict had been
rolling about that much traveled neigh
borhood for many days, serving no use
ful purpose â aye. menacing traffic.
Moreover, if the barrel had an owner.
Mr Algec would be pleased to restore
it but would -ask that said owner be
roundly chided for permitting his _ prop
erty to endanger the limbs of horses
and the lives of drivers.
