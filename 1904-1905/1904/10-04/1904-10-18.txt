Reports from Russian sources give a more hopeful view of the situation of General Kuropatkin's army. That commander has reoccupied and holds the
town of Shakhe, the possession of which for several days was first with one and then with another of the contending armies. Reports from the Russian left
wing, about the safety of which there had been much anxiety, are no later than the night of October 13; It had been fighting for two days for the
possession of Tumen Pass, an important strategic point, but up to the time of sending tHe last dispatch the Japanese were still in possession of the pass. There
is no indication that the end of the great battle is at hand. ... *

NASHUA, N. H., Oct. 17.â A will
case, one of the most interesting
brought in a Xew Hampshire court in
years, was begun in the Superior
Court here this afternoon before
Judge Pike. The dispute arises over
the disposition of the property left by
the late Miss Mary A. Burns, a niece
of the late Father O'Donnell, the first
Irish Catholic clergyman to settle in
Nashua.
Under the terms of the will certain
California cousins were given sums
ranging from 51000 to $5000 and sev
eral public bequests were made,
among the largest beneficiaries being
the parish of the Immaculate Concep
tion in this city. The Rev. Philip J.
O'Donnell. pastor of St. Phillips
Church in Boston, was named execu
tor.
Â»Miss Burns left an estate amount
ing to many thousands of dollars. The
heirs, represented by Mrs. Mary A.
McCabe of San Francisco, contest on
the ground that Father O'Donnell had
exercised undue influence.
The first witness to-day was Mrs.
May Manning Perkins of- PIttsfield,
Mass. She said she spoke with Miss
Burns at the making of her. willand
she appeared to be in her right mind.
In. opening for Mrs. McCabe, counsel
dwelt mainly on the frequent r visits of
Father O'Donriell to the Burns home.
As a result of these visits he attempt
ed to show that there has been undue
influence.

MUKDEN, Oct. 17, 1:30 p. m.â The
Russian forces at 11, o'clock this fore
noon penetrated the Japanese center
and captured twelve. guns and 150 pris;
oners east of the railway. At .another
point during the day the Siberian regi :
ments took twenty-four guns. '.
The Russian operations to-day have
been quite successful. The Japanese,
after a terrifically stubborn resistance,
were compelled to retire along their
whole line. The positions they aban
doned were ' found filled with the Jap
anese dead. In one large trench there
were counted 600 corpses.
In spite of .their losses the Japanese
are undaunted. They have brought up
siege guns and have left no stone un
turned to maintain the mastery of the
situation. Every step the Russians
have pushed forward to-day has been
In the face of a resistance that has cost
the Russians dearly. The . Japanese
seem to be willing to fight until they
are annihilated.
TERRIFIC CANNONADING.
Throughout the whole of Mukden
there can be distinctly heard cannon
ading, to the south, which is raging
more fiercely than on previous. days of
the fight, which is. now entering on the
second week. The Hesperateness of the
battle, especially near i Shakhe, has riot
been equaled since the war began. The
ferocity, of the fighting; has driven out
of the minds of Â¦ the soldiers all
thoughts of personal safety and the
troops, living; in an atmosphere: of sud
den death.. have lost every "desire save
to conquer. -.The losses on both sides
have been enormous,- but this 'is forgot

STORM JAPAN'S TRENCHES.
Yesterday the Russians were not only
successful ; on . their right but carried
out some .brilliant movements on the
left, where they assumed an energetic
offensive against the Japanese posi
tion at Soukhetung, southeast of Hun
Pass. Soukhetung Is on the high road
which runs to Bentslaputze, Joining the
Mandarin road where the Hun River
intersects it. It is a mile north of Hun
Pass, which Is four miles north of
Shakhe. '-1 ..." ','.-,
The Petrovsky, Neuchlet and Wll
minstran regiments stormed the Jap
anese trenches at Soukhetung and car
ried them after desperate resistance,
capturing ten guns. The Japanese
losses were enormous. â¢ '
On Saturday at midnight the Vallko
lutsk regiment moved out of its posi
tion north of. Shakhe to capture the
village of Fishlnpu. The Russians
crept up quietly and then charged with
the bayonet, clearing out the Japanese
at the south end of the village. But
at the other end stood a Buddhist
Temple, which the Japanese had con
verted Into a fortress. They dug a deep
trench around Its stone, walls and sur
rounded them with wire entanglements,
making it impossible to* storm the tem

with success and the Russian right
moved forward to the village of Wu

abandoning it with heavy loss.

battle of Nanshan Hill on May 27 tha
Japanese pursued the retreating Rus
sians to the southwest. Before their
retreat the Russians evacuated Dalny.
In, their retirement the Russians swept
past Dalny to a position on the heights
six miles to the southeast.
On the right flank along the railway
the Japanese drove the Russians as
far as Anshu Mountain, eighteen miles
northeast of Port Arthur, where they
made a stand. . Their line extended
across the peninsula to Socho Mountain
on the east coast, ten . miles northeast
of Port Arthur. The center rested on
two hills, Waito Hill, which is 1100 feet
high. and'Flng'Hilli renamed Ken Hill
by the -Japanese, which is 1200 feet
high.
The position "was a strong one. but
owing .to the great height of the hllla
the Russians left - many dead on the
ground. - the irregular line of the Rus
sians making the approach of the Jap
anese under cover comparatively easy.
The Russian force consisted of rem
nants of the Fifth, Thirteenth. Four
teenth and Twenty-eighth regiments of
sharpshooters, but was later increased
by some troops from Port Arthur, the
number of which was unknown.
The Japanese occupied the lower
range of hills and held a line in front
of the Russians across the peninsula
from Daishe Mountain, east of Anshu
Mountain, to the west coast. The dis
tance between the two forces was from
a mile to a mile and a half.

Dalny was entered by the Japanese
on May 29. Many public and privata
buildings there had been destroyed by
the Russians previous to> the evacua

Chinese before the Japanese troops ar

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 17.â John H.
Gay of San Diego, the scandalized mil
lionaire, was before the Supreme Court,
sitting in bane to-day, to fight another
round in his famous divorce case. His
wife, who was the beautiful Lucile
Daniel of Los Angeles before her mar
riage, was not- there. The motion to
dismiss Mrs. Gay's appeal was denied
and the motion to kill the famous affi
davits accusing Judge Torrance of San
Diego of being drunk while trying the
case was lost.
The court was sarcastic in dealing
with Gay, and stung by this fact and
the lcng-contlnued notoriety he broke
his silence at last. ; ;
It was the first time he told his side
and he burst out in a blaze against
his wife. He claims that she threw
dustpans at him, tried to kill him with
carving knives and then tried to make
him pay her $100,000 to come back to
live with him. Gay says the court
found there was nothing in the charges
of cruelty that Mrs. Gay made against
him. He claims the court found him to
be the injured one and that Mrs. Gay
was found guilty of numerous acts of
cruelty.
"The principal of these was a bat
tery committed by Mrs. Gay upon Gay
on the steps at their home with a dust
pan, by which she had inflicted upon
him a severe wound above the eye.
After having done this, he says indig
nantly, and while the blood still spurt
ed, she coldly turned and walked up
stairs without offering to render him
any assistance or expressing a regret.
One of the most sensational charges
is one that Mrs. Gay offered to forgive
him for $100,000. '
Gay claims he loaned Papa-in-law
Daniel JSO.000 at his wife's behest and
when after two years he sought to re
cover the money she dubbed him a mi
ser, wretch and fool. She left him next
day and brought suit for divorce.- He
says he had to pay her to get nice
treatment. , Â» v;>-

TOLEDO, Ohio, Oct. 17. â During
.he greater part of last week a fine
ooking, splendidly dressed man visit
ed Fostoria and the fact that he ap
peared to be paying assiduous court
to Mis* Virsrinla. Botto attracted at
.fntion. The young man was Bernard
J*. Â¦. Kaya of Niagara Falls,. N-Y-, Fri
:ay it v.-as reported that the couple
aad left on the morning train for
Buffalo and would be married to-day.
When the conductor went through
'.he train the young woman managed
:o convey to him the intelligence that
the was in trouble and asked for as
sistance. When the opportunity pre
tented itself he joined her during the
temporary absence of her suitor and
heard her story.
Miss Botto told the conductor that
the was going to Niagara Falls to
s:arry the man who accompanied her
and that she was being forced into
the marriage by a relative and *De
Fava. She said the would-be bride
groom had threatened to kill her un
less Â£he married him. She told the
conductor that she had a brother in
California who would care for her if
Ehe could get away and join him and
that she was willing to do anything if
the conductor would assist her. When
asked how she expected to get to Cali
fornia, even if she escaped from her
Suitor, she replied that she had 5200
In her purse with which to pay her
expenses.
As the division of the Nickel Plate
ends at Bellevue and as the conduct
ors change there, giving no opportu
nity for the conductor to effect her
rescue, he told her he would tell her
story to the man who took the train
on and urge him to do what he could
for her. When the change was made
the conductor told his successor the
story. On reaching Buffalo the new
conductor told the station agent the
story as rapidly as possible and suc
ceeded in enlisting his services before
the couple left the train- As they
did so, the conductor motioned to Miss
Eotto to Join him. which she did after
tn apclogy to her escort- After In
troducing her to the agent the chiv
alrous conductor joined De Fava and
engaged him in conversation, at the
earne time summoning a policeman.
While the conversation was in prog
ress the agent had hustled the young
wcman to a nearby hotel and secured
a room for her, warning the hotel
people to report that she was not In
the house in case Inquiry should be
made.
Miss Botto was kept in hiding until
it was found that she had. lost her
reason because of the strain of the
l2Â£t few days. She was taken to a
hospital and a brother residing here
notified by telegraph. He brought her
hcme this morning. The change in
her appearance is horrifying:. She
kr.o-xs no one and thinks every one
wishes to kill her.

"We have robbed ourselves of that

old general to-day; 'if we had not
done this the crisis might have found

have produced such fighting men as
America threw to the top in the civil
war; such conquerors as so often led
the Russians against the Turks."
It is obvious that the deepest minds
in the country regard the outlook as
desperate. They assert that the Man

from Liaoyang (which, after all, was
a negative achievement) has been ut

FROM HIS EASTERN TRIP
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 18, 3:15
a. in. â The news from the front .last
night was more reassuring from the
Russian standpoint. The situation is
still regarded as being critical, but
General Kuropatkin is apparently hold
ing the Japanese firmly on his center
and right wing, even having re
crossed the Shakhe River, and while
there are rumors of extensive Japanese
flanking movements, both on the west
and on the east, there is no evidence
that they are actually occurring.
General Kuropatkin"s left has "been
heard from. The press has the first
connected report of the four days'
fighting from the front of Tumen and
Saitchoun passes, resulting in the final
withdrawal of the strong Russian col
umn, which had been sent to turn the
Japanese right, though General Mlst
chenko seems to have actually pene
trated a considerable distance inside
the Japanese line. The report of the
operations of tho Russian left wins is
still three days eld, and since that time
no news hus been received from this
colunti;.
KUROPATKIN'S POSITIONS.
The situation at this date may be de
scribed as follows:
General Kuropatkin has slightly ad
vanced his center, reoccupying Shakhe,
south of the Shakhe River. Directly be
hind him, at a distance of nine miles,
lies the Hun River, and across the
bridges spanning this stream the Rus
sians must retire in case they retreat
on Mukden. General Kuropatkin must
continue to firmly hold his center and
right flanks, in order to prevent the
Jcpane&e getting possession of the Hun
River bridges. Thus he will cover the
withdrawal of his apparently beaten
left wing.
There is still considerable uncertainty
as to the disposition of this left column.
Certainly it has not returned to Muk
den; whether it is again advancing
after its withdrawal is not known.
It is no longer a question of a Rus
sian Sedan, although all hope of re
lieving Port Arthur apparently must
be abandoned. Little hope is expressed
that Kuropatkin will' be able to con
tinue to advance.
VICTORY PROVES BARREN.
The four days' fight of the Eastern
column was of the same desperate
character that marked the operations
of the center and right wings. A heavy
Russian column, under such leaders as
Ivanoff, Rennenkampff, Carngross and
Kondratovitch, repeatedly assaulted
strongly entrenched Japanese positions
on heights commanding the passes. The
assaults were largely night work. The
cannonading was so powerful that it
was impossible to advance in the light
of day. Finally, on October 13, when
the passes had been actually occupied,
came the order to withdraw, probably
owing to a critical position at other
parts of the front. Here the story of
the "operations of the eastern wing of
the western army ends. 'Â¦;'-, Â¦;(.Â£
General Grippenberg, who has-ar
rived at St. Petersburg, will go to the
front ten days hence to assume the
command of the Second Manchurlan
army. :
LONELY TREE HlLli RETAKE?*.
Russians Are Again In Possession of
the Eminence.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 17.â General
Sakharoff telegraphs that the Russians
yesterday recaptured Lonely Tree Hill,
south of Shakhe, and captured eleven
Japanese guns and one quickflrer.
Reiterating the details .of the flght
at Lonely Tree Hill, General Sakharoff
adds:
"The fighting did not cease until this
morning. The Japanese defended the
hill with great stubbornness, and ac
cepted a bayonet attack in which
many of them perished. Our troops
fought valiantly. The losses have not
yet been ascertained."
Lonely Tree Hill is situated near
Shakhe, about three miles east of the
railroad. â¢
By the middle of July the Japanese
navy had cleared Talien Bay of Rus
sian mines and Dalny was made the
depot and base of the third army.
At the eame time the force was in
creased by the arrival of a division,
consisting of independent brigades of
the Second Reserve Infantry.
From July 5 to July 26 there was no
fighting and the time was employed
by the Russians in making semi-per
manent fortifications upon their na
turally strong new position, with a line
extending across the peninsula from
Swangtaikou on the west coast through
the Anehu and Oeekai Mountain ranges
to Lootduo Mountain on the east coast
and south to the Tai Creek.
On the morning of July 26 the Jap-
The capture of Ken Mountain en
abled the Japanese to swing to the
left and occupy Socho Mountain and
later in the evening the whole line of
the Russian position.
During the afternoon three cruisers
and four gunboats of the Russian Port
Arthur fleet shelled the Japanese left
I'.unk from the chore near Shaopingtao.
'J he Japanese fleet arrived and after a
*^hurt fpa fight the Russian ships were
tiirced back to the harbor of Port Ar
thur.
There is a Japanese story to the ef
fect that Lieutenant General Stoessel
was enraged when he heard of the cap
ture of Ken Mountain because from its
t..p both Dalny and Port Arthur are
visible. He ordered the position to be
retaken at all costs.
On the morning of July 3 a whole di
vision of Russians advanced against
the Japanese left, with bands playing
and banners flying. The division car
ried many machine guns- The Rus
sians attacked with great spirit and
fought until they were within 300 yards
of the Japanese, when they were forced
to retire with heavy casualties." "
On the next night a company of Rus
sians climbed the slopes of Ken Moun
tain and came close to the permanent
works which had been erected at the
top of the mountain by the Japanese
after its capture and but for meeting
v.ith an unexpected obstruction the
Russians would have captured the
works. A desperate flght followed at
t iose quarters and there were several
fierce bayonet charges before the Rus
sians were repulsed and driven down
the slopes of the mountain.
On the following day the Russians
a pain attacked the whole line of the
Japanese left and on the same night
made another attempt to surprise the
Japanese. Both of these attacks were
repulsed.
The Russian casualties during the
three days' fighting were 800 and tho?e
of the Japanese 200.
JAPANESE ATTACK HEIGHTS.
OTHER I*OSITIOXS TAKEN.
before daylight the outposts of the
Jiussians were easily driven in. Waito
Mountain was taken at- 9 r/clock, as it
uas easily outflanked.
An advance guard, consisting of one
regiment and one battery of mountain
guns, attacked Ken Mountain at 12
o'clock. The position was a. very diffi
cult one, but up the steep and pathless
mountain the Japanese infantry went;
scaling the heights with unexampled
bravery, -under a withering fire from
the mountain top. The Russians ex
ploded electric mines on the mountain
tide as the line advanced, but these did
little damage.
The Russian force, consisting of two
battalions of infantry, with four rapid
fire and some machine guns, fought
with great determination, but the Jap
anese captured the position and two of
the rapid fire guns at 5 o'clock in the
evening. The casualties were 150 on
each side.
It is evident from their positions
that the Japanese have shown great
skill irt locating trenches and in plac
ing guns. The concentrated artillery
fire of the Japanese was splendidly
effective in silencing the Russian guns,
while the infantry, with machine, and
mountain guns, were enabled to climb
almost impossible heights and to en
gage the Russians hand to hand.
It 4s impossible to understand Gen
eral Stoessel's determination to retake
Ken Mountain, as the en"* p t cost him
900 men, and as he coula not have
held the place if he recaptured it, as
it could be easily outflanked.
In advancing the Japanese right has
moved twenty miles, while the left
has moved only twelve miles, to its
present position in front of Port Ar
thur.
The Japanese successes were pur
chased dearly, but they were wonder
ful considering the tremendous diffl
cultis the Japanese encountered in a
country which Is a series of natural
fortresses, almost impregnable. The
Russian losses were about 1500, while
those of the Japanese -were close to
5000. â¢ v^. -
The Japanese line was now as close
to the Russian line of forts as pos
sible, except on the east coast, where
Taku and Shonku mountains, strong
strategic points, were held by the Rus
sians.
It is evident that the Russians only
fought strong rearguard actions dur
ing the two months they have been
holding these positions; waiting until
they could inflict serious-' loss on the
Japanese and then retiring in good
order to their next natural positions.
.General Stoessel Is evidently unwill
ing to sacrifice his men by holding
these positions, though they are strong
ones, and evidently he also is afraid
of being outflanked by a superior
force.
NOGI'S PRESENT POSITION.
The Japanese advanced before day
light on the 30th and surprised the
Russian outposts, who retired, leav
ing their kits, blankets and rifles
piled in their bivouacs. A short fight
followed with the Russian main po
sition, but the Russians soon retired
within the line of permanent fortifi
cations on the west and center, but
held on the Taku and Shonku moun
tains and the hills close to the east
coast.
On the morning of July 28 the Rus
sians evacuated their positions along
the entire line and retired to a new
line from Taku Mountain, on the west
coast, through Fanghoan ranee to a
point on the west coast.
anese advanced and bombarded the
Russian positions on Anshu and Oji
kel Mountains. " That night the Japan
ese attack on the Russian center was
repulsed with heavy loss. The next
morning the attack was renewed "on
OJikei Mountain under cover of a heavy
and concentrated artillery fire. The ad
vance of the infantry, was enormously
difficult, as the mountain sides were
almost precipitous. ... .' ,\.
. The : Russians; remained in the
trenches 'until the- last -moment and
were driven out. only after several
charges... Many. Japanese' were wound
ed. The Japanese wer^struck, by loos*e
stones wnlCjh A<-ere ;hiirled at -them by
the Russians above, when they were
climbing the sjopes. _ -J
There was alsohafd fighting on the
It ft flank, where the .'positions were
very difficult to take. A body of Rus
sian troops held to Loatzu Hill long
after the rest -of the line had retired.
The Japanese made a desperate effort
to outflank them, but during the night
the force escaped.
The number of Russian troops en
gaged at the Shakhe River is about
226,000, consisting of 200,000 infantry,
26,000 cavalry and 950 guns.
It is generally believed here that the
fate of Port Arthur will be settled with
in a fortnight.
It is reported here that Major Taka
shima's battalion captured fourteen
guns at Sairchiatzu on October 16. This
makes a total of thirty-four guns cap
tured by General Nodzu's center army
since October 14.

LONDON, Oct. 18.â The greatest ad r
miration is expressed by the London
newspapers; to-day for. the. tenacity dis
played by General Kuropatkin in pro
tecting his retreat, but nowhere is the
idea entertained that the Russians'
late success on the Shakhe can change
the broad character of their defeat or
have any. effect beyond slightly re
tarding the Japanese advance to Muk
den and probably to Harbin, since the
Japanese "appear to be . fully prepared
for a winter^ Campaign.
The Standard's correspondent with
General kuroki, telegraphing under
date of October 15, says:
"Kuroki, as usual, has borne the
brunt .of the struggle and sustained a
majority- of the casualties. We are
now occupying the line of the Shakhe,
with" outposts near Mukden. The Rus
sians 'oat the initiative on the second
day "of the battle, when the Japanese
repelled Â¦ their infantry 'and* assumed a
vlgorqus ; offensive movement. For a
time the situation at Bensihu was ex
tremely critical, the Japanese being
practically surrounded. Eventually,
however, the Russians fled, leaving
eighteen dead,on the field. We are now
pressing the dnemy from the railway
into the mountains."

.V_The"next day, the Russians again ad

The order came to advance at mid
night, but the Japanese themselves At
tacked at 10 o'clock. They fought stub
bornly, but were driven back. The
Russians followed up the advantage
and occupied the pass. Meantime, in
the darkness, the Russians got nearly
all the commanding heights, including
two conical hills, besides the pass, but
there was still one height at the left
of the pass which had not -been taken
and. at dawn the Russians were again
forced to -retire, as the Japanese bat
teries commanded the ground the Rus
sians had so ; hardily ;won.
VICTORY PROVES BARREN.
The whole day passed without mak
ing much headway and the Russian
troops were again forced to seek the
shelter of the rocky slopes, there to
wait until nightfall, when a. fresh as
sault was planned.
On the morning of October 12 the
Russian batteries again signaled the
beginning of anpther day's fighting.
One battery silenced some Japanese
guns and then another battery opened
on the Russians, but a concentrated
volley smothered that fire. Then the
Russian' infantry advanced to the.at
tack and the fight became general. The
left was heavily engaged.. Tumen Pass
was turned by detachments of the
Third, Thirty-third and Thirty-second
regiments. More Japanese batteries
appeared on the heights. One of, these,
particularly annoying, was located by
Captain ajlchaells, .whose guns, getting
the range, literally blew it to pieces.
From' the Russian positions logs which
formed the protective works for the
Japanese guns could be seen to be
thrown high in the air by exploding
shells.
At night an order came to renew the
attack. General Kendratovitch led at
the front and again the Russians began
to scale the rugged heights.
The Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth
regiments fell under a withering fire-
The men were scarcely able to breathe
as they clambered, up the steep slopes,
but they hung to the rocks and re
turned the fire that was poured down
upon them. Then. they scrambled for
ward again.
The Thirty-fourth Regiment was first
to reach the trenches, going with the
bayonet at the Japanese, who fought
with clubbed guns, swords, bayonets
and revolvers. It was an indescribable
melee.
The Russian reserves were ordered up
to support the gallant Thirty-fourth
and, aided by the Thirty-sixth, the
Russians carried two lines of trenches,
after which the men lay down, dead
tired, in the Japanese shelters till
dawn. Then it was discovered that
while the attacking forces wer^e about
on a level with the passes themselves,
they were only half way up the
heights, which were commanded by
the Japanese positions. In these cir
cumstances the Russians were forced
to withdraw. Â§ffijEI
While this attack was going on the
Russian right also carried several
heights occupied by the Japanese after
a fierce resistance. The Japanese then
resjjmed the offensive, rushing for
ward in a great wave, but failing to
dislodge the Russians from the posi
tion they had gained. ,
LITTLE PROGRESS MADE.
GENERAL LEADS ATTACK.
The roar and crash of artillery and
the rattle of volley fire were deafening.
The Japanese defended desperately.
Their positions were so steep that the
attacking Russians could make no pro
gress in the face of a murderous \.fe
from the Japanese. Whole advance
companies lay down, hugging, the
ground until evening and repulsing sal
lies - by - the- â Japanese .. - from their.
trenches.
The battle began at 5:30 o'clock in
the morning of October 11. The batte
ries on the right flank opened on three
Japanese batteries to the right of the
pass. Saitchoun Pass is a double pass,
the main defense ; being to the left,
overtopped by high, rocky mountains,
while to the right are rocky ridges.
General Gerngrosse's corps was as
signed to capture the" passes by frontal
attack and the remainder of the Rus
sian troops were to turn the Japanese
position and take them on the flank
and rear. The Russian right advance
was commanded by its chief of divi
sion, while General Kendratovitch, who
was continually with the troops at the
front, commanded the left.
The first assault was set for noon
and the Russian batteries pounded the
Japanese position, searching out their
guns. Wherever possible the Russians*
artillery was rapidly followed up by
the infantry advance, the cannon fire
being continued first on one and then
on another of the eminences which were
seamed with Japanese trenches from
base to summit.
On the morning of October 12 the
Russian fighting line consisted of four
regiments of the East Siberian Rifles
cm the right flank and the Third, Thir
ty-third and Thirty-fourth on the left.
The right was supported by two bat
teries 'of the Eighteenth East Siberian
Brigade and one of the Ninth East
Siberian Brigade. One battery occu
pied the center and three were on the
right.
BATTERIES OPEN FIRE.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE RUS
SIAN FLANKING COLUMN ON THE
LEFT, Friday, Oct. 14.â On October 10,
when the, Russian advance guard ap
peared before Saitchoun Pass, its east
ern detachment occupied -a correspond
ing position before Tumen Pass. Dur
ing the night the Russian signal corps
intercepted a flashlight message show
ing the Japanese artillery was to shell
several Russian positions where bat
teries were posted at dawn. The Rus
sian batteries, therefore, shifted their
positions" during the night and in the
morning the Japanese furiously bom
barded the enemy's ground.
After dinner a great many Chinese
fugitives came into the Russian lines,
reporting that the Japanese were pre
paring to evacuate the villages of
Tichaonandzy and Tchlgawa. The Rus
sians then moved forward and at 5
o'clock in the afternoon occupied the
passes as the Japanese withdrew.
Then, just as the task had been ac
complished, came the order to retire,
which the column accomplished safely,
but thoroughly exhausted by the long
fight.
Toward noon several fresh Japanese
batteries appeared on . the heights,
firing high explosives. â¢ The First
Siberian Battery, changing ground,
came under their fire and lost seven
teen men in crossing an open space
200 yards wide. Most of the Russian
guns, however, were hidden in defllea
and suffered little loss, the Japanese
shells falling short.
The Russian batteries finally got the
range of the Japanese batteries and
silenced them all. ..Â»/.* â¢â 'Â¦ *
ing the day the Fourth Corps was
forced to draw back, but at night re
occupied its earlier positions.
During the fighting on Thursday
Lieutenant Colonel Peocuta was thrice
shot and finally died fighting in the
Japanese trenches. Lieutenant Colonel
Agafoff and Chief of Staff Udonsky are
among the wounded. The Thirty-fourth
Regiment suffered terribly.
On the morning of October 13. Colonel
Martinon", chief of artillery, inspected
all the Russian batteries and the com
mand moved forward. The Japanese
held with' particular tenacity on the
left flank. The Japanese advanced on
Colonel Haskin, who. with seven cap

right. The Japanese turned his flank,
but a regiment was sent to his support,
and he turned back the Japanese,"-: 1

RENO, Nev., Oct. 17. â It was
learned to-day from the Southern Pa
cific officials that an attempt was
made last Friday night to wreck the
eastbound flyer at Laughtons, a small
station near here.,
The engine on the flyer was dis
abled at Laughtons and an engine
was sent from here to brine the train
to Reno. On arriving at Laughtons
the light engine found a switch brok
en and a huge bowlder obstructing
the track. Robbery is supposed to
have been the motive of the would-be
wreckers.

The fifth and final debate of the
present series of the San Francisco
Debating League took place at Golden
Gate Hall last night. The Lyceum
Literary Society, for the affirmative,
won out against the California Debat

College, for the negative. The Ly

possessor of the silver loving cup, as
they had previously won it twice be
fore.
The subject for debate was: "Re

Own, Control and Operate Its Public
Utilities." Speakers for the affirma

Louis T. Diebels and Fred J. Berg:
for the negative, Miss Edna I. Old

The judges were Thomas F. Graham,
Wallace Wise and Judge Murasky. L.
A. Kutner was commended by them
for making the best speech of the
evening. The hall was packed. Dan
cing followed the debate.
DEBATING LEAGUE HOLDS
ITS FIRST MEETING
Mucli Is being made of this by the
Democrats, and Governor Van Sant
has gone so far as to say in a speech
that :"no nomination would be so
strong, as to" secure the election of an
unworthy man to office." '
This is ; the trouble in Minnesota.. It
is all : in the Republ lean ranks and is
offering ; much comfort to the Demo
crats, who hope to elect their Governor
by its aid. The Populists also have
done what|they "could â¢ irr not nominat
ing a State "ticket " this year." 'This -Is
said to be worth 5000, votes to^ Johnson,
the Democratic candiate.' - No -fear ; is
expressed concerning'thesuccess of the
Republican' national ticket,*! nor yet '"of
the Representatives to the; House.
Judge Collins, who gave up his place
on the, bench, is now out of the run
nig entirely. Dunn was nominated
early and easily, together with a com
plete new ticket, not In any way asso
ciated with the administration.
Dunn had made a good record as Au
ditor, and all efforts previous to and
during the convention to discover any
flaws in his record were fruitless. Nev
ertheless, the opposition of the Gov
ernor continued. A few days ago Pub
lic Examiner S. T. Johnson, after la
borious searching, made a report to the
Governor that Mr. Dunn, while State
Auditor, had signed certain leases for
mineral lands in favor of Mabel Evans,
one of his clerks, which leases are said
to' be worth millions. Mr. 'Dunn
learned of the report and asked for a*
copy of it, but it was not given him for
some days. Mr. Dunn charges that the
report was furnished to the Demo
cratic committee ana to the news
papers before it was given to him. He
does not deny the truth of the report,
but says he signed the leases without
noting what they were, and declares
that- had he noted them he would have
signed them, any. way, as "one man's
money is as good as another's," and
there Is no law against clerks oro^rs
in. the Government employ, securing
leases. Â¦ . . . ,
and was a candidate before the con
vention for the nomination, but such
was the opposition developed toward
the Governor that the convention â be
fore which he would otherwise have
found favorâ turned down Mr. Doug
las, together with Judge Collins and
every other candidate favored by him.
"Very strong and bitter feeling was de
veloped. - J', ;
OUT OF THE RUNNING.
SEATTLE, Oct. 17. â Lars Hansen, a
member of the crew of the whaling
schooner Barbara Hernster, which ar
rived in Seattle harbor recently from
the Arctic Ocean,- tells of a strange
sight he saw while returning to the
vessel from a lively chase after a big
Â¦whale. The small boat with three men
in it was passing the face of a monster
iceberg when three polar bears, a fe
male and two cubs, were seen. All of
them were frozen in solid ice, the cubs
nestling against their mother.
Hansen says that the berg stood out
of the water fully 100 feet and that the
Ice wherein the bears were intombed
was clear as a crystal. How long the
animals had been locked In their winter
palace Is a matter of conjecture, but
they were at least twenty-five feet
above the water-
The most active stock on the list was
United States Steel preferred, in which
more than 205,000 shares were traded
in during the day. Missouri Pacific and
Erie forged to the frcmt later.
Commission houses reported that
there was an increase in buying from
out of town quarters and the opinion
was expressed that the bulk of the buy
ing came from the West and South.
NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â Wall street
had another session of exciting .trading
in stocks and bonds to-day. The total
transactions exceeded that of any prev
ious day on exchange this year and
comparisons .can be made only with
the heavy days of the spring of 1901.
Altogether slightly more than 1,800,000
shares changed hands to-day. There
was considerable short selling by the
bear element and in addition heavy
realizing sales fought further advances.
Nearly a. million shares were traded
in during the first two hours of busi
ness, but a reaction about the middle
of the sessic-n dampened the specula
tive ardor of traders and business
f lackened.
In the early trading a number of
stocks made high records for the year.

NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â Charging that
the Hungarian Government is extort
ing fully $20,000,000 yearly from the em
igrants coming from that country to
this, through a system of discrimina
tion in the matter of ocean transporta
tion, an appeal has been made to the
State Department in Washington ask
ing that action in the matter be taken.
The American Embasuador at "Vienna
has been Instructed to make an Inves
tigation and submit a report.
It appears that the difficulty arises
from the contract made last spring be
tween the Hungarian authorities and
the Cunard Steamship Line by which
the former agreed to turn over to the
company 30,000 emigrants annually at
a passage rate of 533 each. For every
one under that number the Govern
ment was to pay the Cunard Company
a penalty of $20, while as a return con
sideration the steamship company was
to pay to the Government $2 on every
such passenger it received.

Colcnel Kowalsky In an extended in
terview with the President entered into
the real motives lying behind the de
mand of British humanitarians that
the United States should interfere with
the conduct of aitalrs In mid-Africa.
King Leopold's representative made
the positive statement that the purpose
of the British in this attempt to en
tangle America in Africa affairs is not
the amelioration of the condition of
the natives, but to open the question of
sovereignty over these regions by call
ing a conference of the powers, at
which, it is hoped by the Britishers,
England may establish the contention
that Kelgium is impotent to maintain
an effective government in Congo.
Colonel Kowalsky pointed out â¢ that
the proposal for such conference, made
officially by the British Government,
failed entirely through the non-accept
ance of the powers. That effort belns
fruitless, it is now proposed to accom
plish indirectly, through the Congo Re
form Association of Liverpool, what
the British Government itself is unable
to effect.

The experiment in the association of
members of the Tonopah Stock Ex
change with the San Francisco Stock
and Exchange Board was of short du
ration â that is, so far as the majority
of them is concerned. Out of the
twenty of the Tonopahs who joined
the San Francisco Exchange last
week, thirteen of them resigned on
Saturday. '
The first few of the Tonopahs who
joined were admitted without an en
trance fee. â¢ The next seven paid $200
a seat. They all attended the meetings
on Thursday and Friday and on Fri
day they requested the exchange that
the rest of their members be admitted
without a fee entrance and that fees
paid by the seven members be re
turned to them.
j According to the by-laws of the ex
change it was necessary to take the
matter under advisement. The Tono
pahs would not wait for this ruling
to be carried out and thirteen of them
withdrew on the spot. It was ru
mored that this was only an excuse
of the Tonopahs for resigning, but
that the real reason was they did not
find the rules of the exchange condu
cive to their ideas of conducting their
business. The San Francisco Ex
change has never stood as a promoter
of mines. It deals with those that are
listed upon its boards.'

Before the firemen arrived police re
serves from a near-by station had res
cued many persons from the blazing
building. When the firemen came hu
man lines were formed from the fire es
cape and the screaming women and
children were lowered to the pave
ment. The flames burst from windows
all about them and the clothes of many
of them were burned from their bodies.
At the same time firemen with scal
ing ladders had reached the roof and
were carrying down to safety the fren
zied women and children who had been
driven from tbe blazing rooms. Many
persons unable to reach either roof or
fire escape were taken from windows
through which the flames already were
beginning to pour.
Twelve families, comprising 120 per
sons, were asleep in the big five-story,
double tenement-house when the flames
were discovered. When the alarm was
sounded through the house the men
and women, some of the latter with
babies ..n arms, others with little boys
and girls dinging to the night clothes
of their mothers, ran to the hallway.
There they were met with great clouds
of choking smoke, while' the flames
were rapidly closing in about; them.
Incendiaries are believed to have
been responsible for the fatal fire, and
this theory is strengthened by the fact
that while the firemen were at work
on the blaze alarms were turned in for
two other fixes in the immediate neigh
borhood. The dead:

The mere animosity of Governor
Van Sant would not probably have
counted for much, as his heretofore
great strength in the State was shown
at the time of the convention to have
greatly diminished. But things have
developed as a result of the hot con
test calculated to at least embarrass
the candidate and lend aid to his de
tractors. â¢
The campaign was begun early in
Minnesota and Governor Van Sant took
the lead like a man absolutely sure of
his case. He was not eligible for re
election, but he proposed to bequeath
his policy to his successor, and to that
end he would choose the man. Judge
L. W. Collins of St. Cloud was a mem
ber of the Supreme Court of the State,
had been for eighteen years and might
have so continued to be until he died.'
Confident in the support of the Gov
ernor Tor the place of the executive he
resigned before the convention had
been held. â¢ In the meantime R. C.
Dunn, former State Auditor and now
editor and proprietor of the Princeton
Union, announced himself as a, candi
date. Governor Van Sant began". ah
active opposition, spent money to look
up v his - record and finally preferred
charges. But the charges and the op
position fell flat. Governor. Van Sant'8
influence was'evidentlylori the iwane.
The Governor": had appointed
General Douglas* to flll'the place 'on the
bench Â¦ made Ivacant by^the", resignation
of Judge Collins. 1 He' was to' have' been
It had been hoped that the bitter con
test that preceded the nominating con
vention would end with the naming of
the ticket and that all hands would
join in a united pull to win in Novem
ber, whoever might be the party's
choice for ' late officers, -.nd for a time
it seemed that this was the programme.
But the bitter war between Governor
Van Sant and the candidate who hopes
to succeed him, which began when the
latter was first mentioned for the
place, is being waged again with an
energy and effectiveness that discounts
the best efforts of the Democrats. R.
C. Dunn, the Republican candidate for
Governor, charges it all to the jealousy
and chagrin of Governor Van Sant.
And this is how it happened that Mr.
Babcock has the fight of his life on
his hands for the next few weeks op
posing a combination of the Democrats
with the wing of the Republican party
against which he had himself taken up
a fight. It is this stress of circum
stances in his own district likewise that
probably. colors, h}s view pf the pros
pects throughout the country 'with re^
gard to the House of Representatives
and causes him to think that the whole
world is falling away toward the dem
nitlon bowbows. As chairman of the
National Republican Congressional
Committee he has the disposition of
some of the best of the spellbinders to
send wheje he thinks they may do the
most good and a large consignment of
them are scheduled for the Third Wis
consin District. Among those already
having dates are Uncle Joe Cannon and
Congressman Landis of Indiana. The
Democrats are very sanguine of suc
cess in the district and are preparing
to match these speakers with the
strongest available of their faith,
choosing chiefly those of the Bryan
wing.
But if the complexion of the House
Is affected in this Presidential year by
local dissensions in the Republican
party' the same may be said of the
State governments in what are ordinar
ily safe Republican States. Stepping
across from Wisconsin, where the row
is of such complicated proportions that
the State is in doubt on the national
issue, I come into . Minnesota to find
a situation, as to the State ticket, fully
as bad as is that of Wisconsin and for
which neither the court nor any other
circumstance seems to offer a cure. In
stead it grows worse day by day and
the Democracy watches Its course with
every sign of joy.
HOPED FOR SETTLEMENT.
INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 17. â J. W.
Babcock has said that the House of
Representatives, as a Republican insti
tution,' even in this year of a Presiden
tial election, is in danger. Mr. Bab
cock feels the importance of his an
nouncement- the more, perhaps, not
only because as chairman of the Re
publican National Congressional Com
mittee he has a certain responsibility
in the matter, but because, in spite of
the conspicuous ability with which he
has represented his State at Washing
ton, the enemy is so conducting the war
in his own district in Wisconsin as to
create grave doubts a^ to his own re
turn. The enemy in this particular
case dc^s not mean merely the Democ
racy. It' will be remembered that Mr.
Babcock is a so-called "stalwart" in
the Republican politics of Wisconsin
and as such enlisted for the undoing of
Governor La Follette. In enumerating
the enemies of Mr. Babcock, therefore,
in his race for re-election the names
of the Governor and his warmer ad
herents must not be omitted. It is a
game that works two ways. It is given
out as a true story of the campaign
down in that State that the Democrats
were influenced in their choice of a
candidate, in Mr. Babcock's district by
Governor La Follette himself. Herman
Grotophost, who is contesting for Bab
cock's seat in Congress, is known as a
La Follette Democrat. He is a good
enough Democrat, perhaps, but he is
also a warm friend and admirer of the
Republican Governor. So that when
the Democrats were casting about for
some strong man to go up against Bab
cock and were considering first this
man and then that with no special ref
erence to Grotophost, they^ were given
a very direct tip that if the halfbreeds,
or La Follette men, had a chance they
would vote for Grotophost in preference
to Babcock â whom they wouldn't vote
for in any case.
HOW IT HAPPENED.
BY. S. W. WALLi,
Miss Grant, who passed part of the
summer at her father's country place
at Merryweather Farm, in Salem Cen
ter, Westchester County, decided a
short time ago and before the formal
announcement of her engagement was
made to have a private wedding in
New York instead of a more formal
one at the home of her parents in San
Diego, Cal.
The only member of the family at
the wedding was her father, who gave
her away. The bride wore a costume
of tobacco brown voile. The corsage
was trimmed with lace embroidered
chiffon.

NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â William
Rockefeller is to build a hotel at the
southeast corner of Fifth avenue and
Fifty-fourth street, outrivaling in
splendor John Jacob Astor's St. Regis,
according to the declaration of real es
tate brokers to-day. Louis Sherry will
manage it. This ends the fight be
tween Astor and Rockefeller over a
license to the St. Regis and breaks
down the barriers of exclusiveness for
the avenue. The idea of commercialism
which the Astors have carried into the
social section will .be developed by the
Rockefellers as they only can develop
business prepositions.
The disclosure of the plans of Rocke
feller came to-day with the announce
ment that he had bought a residence of
John R. Platt; who sued Hannah Elias,
at 7 East Fifty-fourth street. .
Rockefeller has been engaged in a
feud with Colonel Astor for two years
over the St. Regis. Rockefeller ob

NEW YORK. Oct. 17.â Democratic
and Republican students at Princeton,
N. J., to-night marched through the
streets, carrying transparencies, led by
brass bands and making the campus
and village echo with their ringing
cheers for Roosevelt and Parker.
The Democratic students had or
ganised their parade to arouse enthu
siasm for a speech'making meeting. The
Republican parade was purely in the
nature of a counter demonstration.
Outnumbering the Democratic march
ers by two to one, the Republican stu
dents forced their way ahead of the
Parker shouters and for an hour" the
Princeton cheer ending with "Teddy"
was flung back in overwhelming vol
ume at the heads of the Democratic
ranks. . .

MILWAUKEE, Wis.. Oct. 17. â Na
tional Republican speakers must sup
port Governor; La Follette In the
speeches in Wisconsin or the La Fol
lette men will not support the na
tional ticket. That is practically the
ultimatum laid down to the National
Committee. It came from the Fair
banks meeting on Saturday evening.
The La Follette men are angry be
cause Senator Fairbanks did not men
tion the Governor's name in his
speech, which was devoted entirely to
national matters. A leading La Fol
lette man said to-day:
"Roo-evelt has not got this State
yet. We arranged the Fairbanks
meeting and made it a great success.
It was nothing but a deliberate at
tempt to slight Governor La Follette
which kept Fairbanks from mention
ing him. It looks as though it was
done on the advice of the National
Committee."
Chairman Connor of the State Cen
tral Committee sent a vigorous pro
test to the National Committee to"-'
<Jay,' in which it is said he demanded
recognition by national Speakers of
Governor La Follette and his candi
dacy if the national ticket was to re
ceive La Follette support.
National Republlcnn Speakers Must
Support Him in Wisconsin.
LA FOLLETTE'S ULTIMATUM.
The white hat of "White Hat Mc-
Carthy" is no more. Vandals have
sacrilegiously filled its depths with
duck soup, mayonnaise, patte de foi
gras and other foreign substances,
which may nourish mortals but are fa
tal to millinery.
The crime was committed at the
Terrace GardenB. McCarthy entered
wearing the famous headgear, as well
known a land marls in San Francisco
as Twin Peaks. The band struck up
"This Is the Hat My Father Wore,"
whereupon McCarthy smiled the smile
of a gracious monarch, who acknowl
edges homage done him.
With graceful dignity he sat down
at one of the tables and deposited the
historical headgear by his side. He
never suspected that any one had de
signs upon the white hat of "White
Hat McCarthy." What wretch dared
lay a hand upon it?
He raised a tankard to his lips and
when he lowered it the white hat of
"White Hat McCarthy" was gone. Con
sternation tied his countenance into
knots. "Waiter," he shouted. "Where
is my hat?"
"Did you have a hat?" inquired the
garcon, whose name was O'Houlihan.
"Did I have a hat?" gasped McCar
thy. "Did I have a hat . I, McCarthy,
Wh.ite Hat McCarthy. I had the hat.
Where were you raised that you ask,
Did I have a hat?"
Down the line the news flew that
"the white hat of McCarthy is miss
ing!" If the ferry clock had taken a
hike up Market street to call on the
lady on the City Hall dome or the
Twin Peaks had matched for a twenty
round go, some surprise might have
been expressed. But White Hat Mc-
Carthy's chapeau anywhere but on his
cranium! Surely this was topsy-turvy
dom.
Policemen,, waiters, hackmen and a
mixed gathering aided McCarthy in the
search for the relic. It was ' soon
found, but alas, poor bonnet, we knew
it well! It was curtains for the cele
brated hat! The owner added his
tears to the fluids already in the head
gear. ... . . . .,r
'Â¦. Then his righteous wrath uprose and
he demanded damages from the propri
etor. A conservative estimate of the
value of the skyplece runs into six fig
ures. ' â¢ -
White Hat McCarthy may wear an
other white hat some day, but it will
not be the white hat. The white :hat
of McCarthy is only a memory and in
time it will become a legend. .'

NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â In the course
of a leading editorial the Herald will
to-morrow practically concede Roose
velt's election, as follows:
"In three weeks from to-day the peo
ple will have to decide who will be their
choice, Roosevelt or Parker. There
does not appear to be room for much
uncertainty as to their probable de
cision. It seems almost a foregone
conclusion that Roosevelt will be elect
ed, not, perhaps, because the people
have confidence in him and in his con
ception of the Presidential functions,
but because the country is prosperous
and thus the necessity for a change is
not very pressing. Roosevelt's chances
are increased by the people's misgiv
ings as to the reality of the 'change of
heart' the Democratic leaders profess
to have experienced. Bryan's grip upon
his party has been ostensibly shaken
off, but have all traces of his disorgan
izing reign been eradicated? *â¢
"As election day draws nearer it be
comes manifest that the Democrats
can oppose Republican discipline with
nothing more efficacious than disunion
and indecision." . .

No revolver was found on William
Buckley at the time of his arrest and
he was in sight of some one of his pur
suers all the time after the crime until
he was captured. No revolver was
found at the scene of the crime. Mur
phy hopes by Charles Buckley's testi
mony to show that Copeland had the
revolver. The alleged murderer is said
to be serving a sentence in a Dakota
prison.
Attorney Frank J. Murphy, who is
laboring to save William Buckley from
the gallows, unearthed another Impor
tant witness yesterday. The necessary
affidavit will be secured as soon as pos
sible and then the whole matter will be
laid before Governor Pardee.
The new witness is a machinist
named Charles G. Buckley, who is satd
to be in Chico. He is not a relative of
the condemned man and was not ac
quainted with him. His story will be
that he met "China" Copeland. the al
leged murderer, on the night of the
shooting of George Rice. Copeland, he
says, met him in a saloon at the corner
of Second and Xatoma streets and,
drawing a revolver from his pocket, re
marked: "That has made one less scab
in the world to-day." Buckley bought
him a drink and advised him to clear
out as soon as possible. The witness
has refrained from telling his story be
fore because he feared that the police
might try to get him Into trouble.
Murphy says that he will save his
client's neck because he believes the
man is innocent and hints that he may
be able to show that a large number of
men were concerned in the conspiracy
to kill the non-union man. Detective
Thomas Ryan has made affidavit to the
effect that he suspected "China" Cope
land and John Granfleld did the club
bing and shooting and that he learned
both men had fled on the night of the
murder. Alfred Rosenholtz, a chemist,
has come forward with the testimony
that a man clad in dark clothes, dark
hat and of dark complexion did the
shooting. Buckley wore light clothes
and a light hat and is of light complex
ion.

t-ion of Republicans, headed by a brass
ba.nd, to the Opera-house. The large
auditorium was packed with people by
the time the procession reached there,
and it was with difficulty that passage
could be made for the guests. A roar
vf applause greeted the Governor when
he stepped forth before the audience.
J Albert Dole presided at the meeting,
and when. he introduced the Governor
there was another burst of applause.
Governor Pardee's speech dealt large
ly with the importance to California of
continuing the Roosevelt administra
tion-
He created a burst of enthusiasm
when he epoke of the value of a West
Â«rn man as President and showed what
the Roosevelt administration has al
ready done in aid of our State. He
expatiated upon the good that has come
from the national irrigation project
and the beginning of the Panama canal
and paid a glowing tribute to the work
of Congressman McLachlan for this
district and ail California.
Senator Ward dealt generally with
reasons why Roosevelt should be elect
ed. He told of the extension of na
tional commerce and the high rank
that America has taken among all the
! fctions since the Republicans came
into power. When he referred to
Rosevelt'a Western habit of thought
and his care for Western interests the
cudience rose and cheered.
To-morrow Governor Pardee and
Senator Ward will go to Pasadena.

UNION LABOR MEETINGS.
The Republicans are encountering ac
tive resistance in three of the State
Senatorial districts, namely, the Third,
comprising the counties of Sierra, Plu
mas, Nevada and Placerf Twenty
ninth, the counties of Santa Cruz and
San Mateo, and the * Thirty-first, the
counties of Monterey, San Benito and
San Luis Obispo. H. W. Lynch, the
Republican nominee in the last men
tioned district, is confronting a normal
Democratic majority of 300, but he is
progressive and personally popular.
The Republicans are rallying nobly to
his support and the great wave of pub
lic sentiment for Roosevelt \irtll proba
bly land Mr. Lynch in the State Sen
ate.
Now that the Democratsihave aban
doned hope of carrying California for
Parker and Davis and see defeat for
their entire Congressional ticket loom
ing, up. they are falling back for en
couragement on the Senatorial fight in
the Twenty-ninth Senatorial District.
At Democratic headquarters the claim
is made that Ed White, brother of the
late Stephen M. White, will defeat S.
H. Rambo, the Republican nominee.
They say that while the Republican
factions are slashing one another the
Democrats are working vigorously for
White, with every chance of carrying
him through to victory.
The Democrats are finding further
cause for regret in the fact that A. C.
Lang, their nominee for the Assembly
In the Twenty-second District, Contra
Costa County, failed to file his certifi
cate of nomination in time and now the
only manner In which he can get on the
ballot is by petition as an independent.
The Democratic State Central Commit
tee has endeavored to straighten out
the tangle, but without success, as the
law Is plain and inflexible.
PROHIBITION' PARTY.
The prospects of Republican victory
in the Fourth District grow brighter
every hour. Julius Kahn is daily re
ceiving assurances of support from
workingmen who voted for his oppo
nent in 1S02. The Republican State
Conunittee counts the Fourth' District
as safe. In the Second and Fifth dis
tricts the Democrats are putting up a
determined fight, but confidence in the
success of the Republican cause in
each district is Increasing. Advices
from Sacramento are to the effect that
the Republicans will win out in that
county by a majority exceeding, one
thousand. Two years ago the Demo
crats carried Sacramento County on
the Congressional issue.
STATE SENATORS.
FOURTH DISTRICT.
E. A. Hayes, Republican candidate
for Congress, Fifth District, and H.
D. Porter will talk to the men of the
Union Iron Works at noon to-day.
Duncan E. McKihlay, Republican
nominee in the Second Congressional
District, and State Senator Charles M.
Shortridge spoke at the Veterans'
Home, Napa County, yesterday. The
enthusiastic reception accorded to the
gifted speakers took on the character
of an ovation.
Congressman J.N.. Glllett, who is
making a splendid campaign for re-?
election as the representative ut . the
First District, was at Republican head
quarters at the Palace Hotel early yes
terday morning. Indications point to
his re-election by a large majority. He
is one of the ablest of California's pub
lic men and the* people have the great
est confidence in his judgment and in
tegrity.
The present .outlook is decidedly fav
orable to the success of the Republican
party in every Congressional district in
California. Livernash' made a bad
break as a candidate for popular favor
at the' Alhambra Friday night last
when he suggested that his Republican
opponent, Julius- Kahn, in making a
house to house canvass of the Faurth
District should follow the commercial
instinct of his race and take with him
a box of collar buttons and a basket
of suspenders.
FIRST DISTRICT.
5 Joseph Clifford, candidate for the As
sembly in the Thirty-fifth, and C. J.
Roller, county commltteeman, also
spoke briefly.
There was a good attendance at the
meeting in Mission Turn Verein Hall,
but candidates shied at it and only a
few put in an appearance. J. N. Copus
called the assemblage ta order and in
troduced James de Succa as chairman.
Both made brief speeches.
. The address of the evening was by
C. J. Williams, nominee for Congress
in the Fifth District. Exclusion of
Chinese and Japanese was his chief
topic and, inasmuch as the issue will
be raised next year, he argued, It was
incumbent on the "common people" to
see to it that they were represented in
national legislation by men who are
zealous "to fight the yellow peril."
Incidentally the speaker cqntended
he was the*only Democrat In the race
for Congress in the Fifth. He declared
that William Wynn, his opponent on
the Democratic ticket, had always been
a Republican. A voice ln the audience
demanded further enlightenment on
this point and this was furnished by
Copus, who paid he had received in
formation to the effect that Wynn once
served as secretary of a Republican
club in the Twenty-ninth District and
had always been a Republican.
We can obtain cheaper Iron and steel by
Improving the, Interstate commerce laws In
such a way that the transcontinental railroads
coming into San Francisco will be obliged to
transport freight on reasonable terms and
without discrimination of the sorts now prac
ticed. We can obtain cheaper, fuel by re
moving the tariff on bituminous coal and by
putting the Standard Oil trust under such
governmental control as will prevent the de
struction of competition in our own petro
leum districts. We can obtain enlargement of
our merchant marine by making sea life fit
for white men and by giving to American ves
sels Â«ome kind of Government aid â either by
handicapping foreign ships competing for our
carrying trade or by some direct tipping* of
the> scales in favor of our own flag. San
Francisco ought to have dozens of factories
and dozens of chips where now it has one.
Han Francisco would have them. too. were an
enlightened and concerted move made In that
regard by the working classes and the em
ploying classes. In Congress I have been
Â¦standing for amendment of the interstate
commerce laws, for putting bituminous coal
on the free list, for checking the excesses of
the Standard Oil trust, for improving the
laws relating to seamen, for prompt action
to arrest the decadence of our merchant ma
rine and for a number of similar moves. I
have been doing this for the sake of San
Francisco and the country as a whole.
To make the working classes of San Fran
cisco more prosperous and happy than they
are these things, among others, should be
done: More employment should be provided,
by enlarging our manufactures and extending
our commerce. At present there are hundred*
of unemployed men In this cityâ many more
than there were a year ago. These should
have work and work should be found for
thousands of others. This can be done by
getting for ou r factories cheaper iron and steel
and cheaper coal and by encouraging the
growth of our sea business.
Egan, chairman of the campaign com
mittee, made addresses.
George J. Berger, secretary of the
Union Labor Co-unty Committee, pre
sided at the meeting, which was well
attended. J, A. McManus, a member of
the County Committee, introduced Mr.
Berger as chairman. It i was getting
late when Congressman Livernash
made his appearance, but the crowd had
been apprised of his coming and waited
to hear him. In part he said:
Five years ago Ford suddenly ap
peared in San Francisco and with a
fortunate faculty of making friends
he was soon mingling with the beat
people* of this city. He was admitted
to private homes, received cards to
the various cluba and enjoyed the dis
tinction of being one of the few civil
ians who could go and come at will
from the island military fortresses.
Ford's local career, however, was a
short one, for one day a gentleman
who had been victimized by him in the
East exposed him as a social high
wayman and to support his accusa
tions, which society was loth to be
lieve, he* produced a photograph of
Ford, taken in an Eastern peniten
tiary, where Ford had served time for
forgery. The published story of Ford's
double life was a sensational affair
and was quickly followed by hi3 dis
appearance- It then became known
that he had been borrowing the Jewel
ry of many of San Francisco's young
society buds and pawning it in order
to get funds.
A few months after the expose Ford
was discovered in El Paso, where he
became involved in a quarrel with a
frontier official, whose wife he attempt
ed to mislead. The irate husband over
took him after a long chase and was
busily carving up the young impos
ter when outsiders interfered.
From Texas Ford managed to reach
London, where he assumed another
name and with a flimsy project, the
sale of a supposed big stationery con
cern in this country, he succeeded in
mulcting the British investors out of
a sum reported to be in the. neighbor
hood of 50,000 pounds. Lacking the
courage of, the Whittaker Wrights.
Ford was not slow in getting beyond
the clutches of the English law and
landing in Paris he took the name of
Waterbury and has since been spend
ing his British gold in that gay city
in a manner that has attracted gener
al attention.
Members of the Bohemian and Olym
pic clubs and young men abdut town
are deeply interested in a bit of news
fresh from Paris to the effect that
Paul Ford, who cut a wide swath in
San Francisco several years ago and
finally decamped after victimizing a
large number of newly made acquain
tances. Including the members of the
officers* mess at Angel Island, is now
enjoying the fruits of his 111 gotten
money in a life of luxury in the gay
French metropolis.
As Paul Waterbury, a name which
he has recently adopted in order to
conceal his identity, he is splurging
about Paris and Monte Carlo, riding in
his own carriages, keeping a private
establishment and boldly mixing with
visiting Americans whenever he is per
mitted.

Peculations of Passenger Department
Clerk Cover a Period of Four
Months.
It was admitted yesterday by the
passenger department officials of the
Southern Pacific Company that James
McCabe, the missing assistant of As
sistant General Passenger Agent Ju
dah, is an embezzler and is being
sought by ..the police. A3 announced
in Sunday's Call, McCabe's shortage
amounts to a little over $1000, repre
senting excursion ticket money which
he received and misappropriated. An
investigation of the missing man's ac
counts revealed the fact that he be
gan "stealing three months ago, just at
the time that the Dicnlc season was in
full blast. It was about then that he
began to change his method of per
forming his work. Although his su
periors were not advised of the fact,
it appears that he had drifted away
from his previous regular habits and
had begun dissipating. Gambling and
carousing are supposed to have
tempted him to steal, and he con
tinued to do so until he had realized
that he had tjiken more than he could
ever hope to pay back.
The police are of the opinion that
McCabe has left the city, but they are
confident that he will be apprehended
unless he has boarded a steamer and
gone beyond the reach of the civil au
thorities. He is well known by West
ern railroad men. whom the police
hope will aid the Southern Pacific
Company in arresting -him. Yester
day Assistant General Passenger
Agent Judah's office was besieged by
people who know McCabe and were
reluctant to believe that he had gone
wrong. Among the visitors were some
of the leading railroad men of this
city.

MICHEL.S SAYS COMPANY

Expiration of Contract for Supplying
Old Corporation Is Given As
Reason for 3 love.
Leopold Michels, president of the
San Francisco Coke and Gas Com
pany, is authority for the statement
that the corDoration in which he. is
concerned will, within a month, be
gin to lay gas mains in the streets of
San Francisco as a preliminary to sup
plying gas to the public. Mr. Michels
said yesterday his company had a con*
tract with the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company, that expired -in
August/under which the last named
corporation received gas from his
company. When the contract â¢ ex
pired there was a disagreement con
cerning the price to be paid as a con
dition for the renewal of the con
tract. This led to the decision on the
part* of the San Francisco Coke and
Gas Company to engage In supplying
gas to the public. Mr. Michels also
said that the present capacity of his
company's plant is 1,000,000 feet of
gas a day. This will be increased to
2,000,000 feet immediately. In ad
dition to gas the company produces
metallurgical coke that Is particularly
well adapted for use in smelters.

James J. Jeffries, champion pugilist
of the world, was a disappointment to
many of the folk who witnessed his
five-round go with Thespis last even
ing at the Central Theater. They who
went to scoff remained to applaud.
Instead of being convulsed by the at
tempted acting of a man who had can
didly disclaimed ability to act, they
saw a histrionic exhibition that com
pelled their respect, at least. When
they laughed it was not at his reading
or action, but at the way in which
their less cultured neighbors received
his rehearsed sentiments and gestures.
The audience afforded more amusement
than the stellar mime.
It was in the titular role of "Davy
Crockett," created and played for many
years by the late Frank Mayo, that
Mr. Jeffries made his stage debut in
the city that has seen so many of his
ring triumphs. The character is In
tensely, if not impossibly, heroic, and
one would naturally suppose that the
Jeffries temperament would fairly
revel in its many opportunities to con
vey thrills to the upper tier. The fact
that the Jeffries temperament did noth
ing of the kind, but was constantly
held in most discreet restraint, was the
cause of the disappointment herein
before alluded to. If anything, the
part was underacted. Even in the fa
mous wolf scene that closes the second
act and opens the third one. the . big
fighting man never rose, or descended,
to the ranting and striving fer claptrap
effect that was practiced by his illus
trious predecessor in the personation.
"While his brawny arm barred the door
and his mighty torso seemed to heave
naturally under the strain, his lines
were delivered with the calm deliber
ateness of a man suffering more phy
sical agony than he cared to reveal.
His failure to overdo that scene was
what convinced thÂ» critics .that worse
actors with greater pretensions to act
than James J. Jeffries are rather com
mon. - \: '
In his love scenes with the leading
woman the leading man's studied
self-repression stood him in admirable
stead, for it would have been easy to
spoil the effectiveness of their roman
tic dialogues by the least show, of
overexuberance. His' seeming awk
wardness on those occasions was con
sistent with his part. An illiterate
backwoodsman, strange to the ways
of educated city folk, could not feel
entirely self-possessed in presence of
a lady who spouted "Lochinvar's
Ride" with the charm of a profession
al elocutionist, especially when he
felt enamored of the lady and suspect
ed that she returned his passion. To
make a Chesterfield of a Daniel
Boone would be a crime against na
ture. The titters from the auditorium
were not provoked so much by what
the swain on the stage said or did as
by the murmurs , of approval that
wafted from . an unquestionably sin
cere gallery. :â¢ I
Whatever else may be said of Mr.
Jeffries as an actor, he must have
credit for appreciating his limitations
In that. profession and abiding within
them. What he . lacks in grace of
stage deportment and knowledge of
the technique of the craft is compen
sated for by his intelligent modesty â
a quality that no other man who
doffed the mitts to . don the buskin
has shown in any marked degree. '} He
is a more admirable actor '. than he
would be if he believed he could act.

SANTA ROSA, Oct. 17.â Two deaths
are expected to result from a shoot
ing affray at Glen Ellen Sunday morn
ing, the outcome of a dice game par
ticipated in by three men at the saloon
of B. Fanocchla. , The man who did the
shooting was a stranger. When trouble
seemed imminent and the stranger was
drawing a revolver, Fanocchla ordered
them from his place. Half an hour
later two pistol shots were heard and
L. Laricci and John Guidottl were
found in front of the Roma Hotel with
bullet holes In their heads-
LariocI was shot in the neck, the ball
entering from the back, passtng up
ward and lodging in the man's head.
Â¦Physician Jesse probed for the bullet
this afternoon, but was unable to lo
cate it. John Guidotti. who is the most
seriously injured of the two. was shot
in the center of the forehead, the bul
let shattering the frontal bone. His
death is hourly expected.

Special Dispatch to The Call
The marriage startled friends and
relatives of the parties. In the
presence of George Austin and Attor
ney David McWade the impetuous
couple were made one in an Oakland
restaurant. A merry banquet followed
and then the inevitable morning after-
The pair made good the old adage.
"Married in haste, repent at leisure."
The husband is alleged to have ex
pected more than beauty as his bride's
dowry and the wife expected more than
love in a cottage. Love flew out of the
window and the couple took different
ways. Cords proved that- one disap
pointment did not prevent him from
assummg marital obligations again.
Though Cords is said to be well-to
do it is alleged that his first wife did
not think so. The young lady is a
relative of the late Solomon Heyden
feldt.
Immediately after Judge Graham an
nulled the marriage of Mimi E. Cords
and R- Cords Jr. yesterday the enter
prising young man hurried to Cupid
Danforth'a office and obtained a li
cense to marry Miss Flora Stern, who,
like wife number 1, hails from San
Francisco.
The age of Cord's second matrimon
ial choice is given as IS. She has been
living at 524 Ellis street with her sis
ter. His former wife is about 2S years
of age.
Cord's first venture as a benedict was
a real marriage in haste. Miss Mimi
Talmadge. a pretty blonde, met him
May 10, 1303, in Oakland, where he is
engaged in the real estate business.
After a twelve-hour courtship the two
agreed to travel . life's pathway to
gether.
A day later they mutually agreed
that they were not suited to each other.
The young woman filed suit for annul
ment of the contract on the ground
that when she married the fascinating
real estate man she was under the In
fluence of opiates and whisky, which
she had taken to. relieve pain result
ing from an operation for appendicitis.
YÂ»hen # she looked upon matrimony with
clear eyes she did not favor It. In her
complaint Mrs. Cords said she met
Cords for the first time on thÂ« day of
their marriage.
While the annulment proceedings
were pending Cords figured In an esca
pade in Fruitvale. The husband of
Mrs. Thomas Wand rubbed the real
estate dealer's countenance with a
reck because Cords had visited several
resorts with his wife.

this evening. The artist, who is but 11
years of age, will play works of Bach,
Beethoven, . Mendelssohn, Schumann,
Chopin and other eminent composers,
including a difficult fugue for left hand
by Kalkbrenner, and, in company with
Rudolph Forster, her instructor, will

hands, by Kela Bela, and two of Mosz
kowski's dashing Spanish dances. She
will sing "Au Printemps," by Gounod,
Pinsuti's "The Last Watch" and the
Bach-Gounod "Ave Maria," with a vio
lin obligato by Charles Foley. Mrs.
Jeanette Cof er, the soprano, v and - Mr.
Foley, who is a tenor as well as violin
ist, will assist in a' varied and interest
ing programme.
Gertrude Fleming Concert.
Nina Rudolph is the San Toy and
sings a little and dances prettily. But
she hardly "belongs." There is a large
chorus of girls, who add much to the
picture â the most sumptuous that we
have had here for longâ and two splen
diferous scenes. One might go through
the list of songs in vain to find a poor
cne. but the "Six Little Wives" (For
tescue). "Tommy Atkins" (Peachey),
"Rhoda and Her Pagoda" (Miss Mc-
Kinney), and "Chinese Soje-man" (Mr.
Powers), compel mention. Hear them
and see "San Toy." You'll never be
sorry. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
George Fortescue's Yen How is quite
as good. Mr. Fortescue Is Just 300
pounds of solid fun. Then John
Peachey, rejected of Fischer's, turns
up as an excellent barytone, and Fred
W. Huntley does a remarkable charac
ter hit as the Chinese lover. There are
others, all good, and all in their splen
did garb as mandarins, guards and
such, making a truly magnificent pic
ture.
Miss Margaret McKinney is chief
among the women. Miss McKinney
sings very prettily, and acts with much
sprightliness and humor as Dudley, the
lady's maid.
You feel you have never seen these
things done before and that nothing
else could be worth doing. Even his
speech. After his dance â and that's
better than any other dancing, you will
remember â Mr. Powers wandered in at
all the entrances to bow and finally
came forward. He put up his hand,
the audience said "Sh!" Mr. Powers
said "Sh! No more." He sings, too,
and you can hear every word he says.
Remains only his dialect, and that you
can hear any day in. Fish alley.
Mr. W. L. Romairie's Emperor, with
his falsetto voice and rickety gait, is
worthy to stand with the Powers' Li.
It is capital fooling.
But San Toy has a Chinese lover, and
she herself loves an English sailor. The
Chinese lover demands her hand as the
price of his silence. Refused, he then
discovers the English lover and re
venges himself by betraying Yen How
to the Emperor. But San Toy, to save
papa, goes herself to Peking, and all
turns out happily. And Mr. Powers?
Mr. Powers is a lazy, lightfingered and
altogether delightful Oriental named
Li. who fills in all the corners of the
plot and fun most richly.
It is not at all that there is only
Mr. Powers in the cast. "San Toy" is
not the one-man or Daniels variety of
comedy. There are at least three bril
liantly funny comedians, a tragico
comedian, two barytones and a lacy
humorist in "San" Toy's" company. It
Is "place aux hommes" Indeed with the
comedy, even to the best male chorus
that I remember to have heard outside
of grand opera. And to begin with,
Jams T. Powers.
Mr. Powers is a class by himself.
Quite like no one else that you know
is this genius of comedy. His very
makeupâ he might have walked in off
a fanâ prepared one for the exceptional.
And Just where lies his peculiar dis
tinction is difficult to lay a finger on.
Perhaps it is in the absolute ease of
his fooling, or in its vital magnetism.
But there is not a hair of his head that
is not funny. He touches new nerves
of laughter. Whether he drinks the
cologne he has filched from the lady's
maid â developing an entirely original
intoxicationâ or tries to hide the ring
ing alarm clock up his sleeve, or
mouths monkey-fashion at the aud
ience, doesn't matter.
"San Toy" is one of the earliest ex
amples of that curious combination of
comedy, comic opera and vaudeville
known as musical comedy. In itself it
Justifies the breed. It is almost comic
opera and it nears the best of comic
opera, with its sharply drawn types
and clever story, set about with the
sprightly and characteristic musical
setting.
Augustin Daly imported it from Eng
land, with those other charming
pieces, "The Runaway Girl" and "The
Chorus Girl," and we have ever since
been hearing "San Toy" echoes. Last
night's performance consoled one for
the echoes. 'Twas best for us and best
for the comedy that we had to wait ten
years for Mr. Powers to bring it along.
We might have had it last vear with
the dusty Daly shows that did wander
out here. Yes, true, they did bring
voice and fun with them, but "San
Toy" needs dressingâ and Powers.
"San Toy" took five men to make,
Edward Morton finishing the book, Sid
ney Jones the music, Harry Greenbank
and Adrian' Ross the lyrics and Lionel
Monckton the other musical trim
mings. And a compact, sparkling and
picturesque thing they have made of it.
The scene is Chinese. San Toy is the
daughter of the Mandarin Yen How,
who has been ordered to send her to
the Emperor's harem. Yen How disap
proves. He wants to keep his daugh
ter. Accordingly he disguises her as a
boy. Word is sent to the Emperor that
Yen How's only child is a son.
As Yen How says: "The turtle goes
Blowlyâ but it gets there in time for
the soup." Only, there is no soup in
connection with "San Toy." But like
the turtle the comedy has been long
getting here apd is just as well worth
waiting for as the soup. A large crowd
sat through the" Hash and sparkle of it
last night at the Columbia and left
with a single verdict, stunning. You
see, there was James T. Powersâ but
we anticipate.
BOSTON. Oct. 17.â The House of
Bishops, one of the legislative bodies
of the Episcopalian General Convention,
to-day adopted an amendment to the
canon on divorce and marriage forbid
ding the remarriage of any divorced
person The amendment was substan
tially the same as that which was re
jected by the House of Deputies on
Friday last.
The action of the bishops was not un
expected, as the sentiment of that body
was well known. In fact, a similar
amendment was passed at the San
Francisco convention three years ago,
but failed, as was the result this year,
to secure the support of the other
house. A conference of committees rep
repenting the House of Bishops and the
House of Deputies will be held to con
elder the disagreement, but leading
clergymen do not expect that the dep
oties will recede from their vote of last
week- The amendment is as follows:
"No minister shall solemnize a mar
riage between any two persons unless
by Inquiry he Fhall have satisfied him
self that neither Derson has been or is
th"? husband or the wife of any other
person now living, from whom he or
she has been divorced, for any cause
arising after marriage."
Additional amendments will be taken
tip to-morrow.

NEW IMPROVEMENT. CLUB
BUILDING IS DEDICATED
The Market Street and Eureka Val
ley Improvement Club held a sort of
"at home" reception in their new hall,
2569 Market street, last evening. Re
freshments of sandwiches, cake, beer
and cigars were served and good cheer
was the general sentiment of the oc
casion. Major J. Hlggins presided and
stirring remarks on the work of thÂ«
Mission Improvement clubs and the
future of their own club were made by
President R. C. Clark. A. S. Lillle,
president of the Federation of Mis
sion Clubs, Messrs. Healy, Lover and
others-.
The club hall, which has been com
pleted at a cost of S6000, is the work
of the association, formed Into a
stock company. The shares are held
by the -members of the club and have
been almost all disposed of at S3 a
share. The lower floor is rented as
a store and the upper story la used by
the club. The construction of its own
hall by an improvement club Is a new
departure and an improvement * In
deed. The club meets every Monday
evening.
' , All of this was in response to resolu
tions offered by Supervisor Rowe call
ing iupon the company to explain why
It had not delivered the Columbia ma
chines according to contract. The sub
ject was referred to the committee of
the whole.
Reed declared his belief that the new
machine would meet the requirements
and that his company's action in not
supplying the Columbia could only be
construed as fair and honest dealing
with the county in view pf. the finding
of the new machine.
- - Information came to our company that a
new voting machine had been invented, which
was very far superior to any other voting ma
chine In the market. Our company immediately
sent out Senator Leavitt to New York and
Chicago to investigate this new machine. A
thorough and complete Investigation was
made and it was found that this machine,
called the Dean machine, could do all that
was claimed for it and more, and that it wan
the only machine in existence which fully
complied with the California laws. This in
vestigation convinced us that neither the Unit
ed States Standard nor the Columbia Voting
Machine Company complied with the California
laws in this, that the voting machine law of
California provides that "they must also pre
vent his voting more than once for the- same
person for the same office, and allow of his
reversing bis vote in case of mistake or de
sire to change."
After reciting that the contract had
been awarded to the Central Supply
Company to furnish 100 Columbia vot
ing machines, Attorney Reed, as presi
dent of the company,- said:
The Board of Supervisors was re
quested to-day to postpone all action
in the matter of purchasing voting ma
chines until a new device, known as
the Dean machine, can be exhibited tq
the. board about January 1- This de-i
lay was urged by the Central Supply
Company, represented by State Sena
tor Frank W. . Leavitt and Attorney
George W. Reed. They submitted a
written explanation to-day concerning
the failure of the company to deliver
the Columbia voting machines for
which a contract of sale had been made
with the Supervisors.
The reason given was that the com
pany had discovered that the machines
would not meet the requirements of
the law, which permits a voter to
change his ballot before it is finally de
posited. It was pointed out that after
a. voter had operated the machine he
could not make a correction if he
should so desire.

ALAMEDANS MAY ASK
FOR NEW ORGANIC LAW
"Mr. Bailiff, take the woman from
the courtroom until she can behave
herself."
J. J. Sheahan, the husband, finished
giving his testimony in the now cele
brated divorce case this afternoon. He
said that he and his wife had lived
happily together until about a year
ago, when she became interested in
spiritualism- He was away from home
a good deal of the time on his busi
ness of insurance adjuster and said
he was told nothing about what his
wife' was doing until she nad become a
full fledged medium. One night he went
home and found the house a blaze of
light and a seance had been advertised
to be held there that night. The first
comer was ordered away by him and
the affair broken up. He said his wife
had neglected her home, her children
and himself and squandered the money
he had given her to pay the family
bills.
The court ordered all of the answer
to be stricken from the notes, except
her" admission of having put the ad
vertisement in the papers and then
said:
Judge Melvin warned her that they
would get along better if she simply
answered the question, when she re
sponded.
"Well, I don't care; it's nobody's
business what I did about the adver
tisement, as it was after I left my
husband."
She was recalled to the stand for a
few minutes to tell why she had put
an advertisement of a spiritualistic se
ance in a San Francisco paper and
stated that it was none of the court's
business, as she had done it after she
had made up her mind to leave her
husband.
Judge Melvin showed that be believes
spiritualistic mediums make bad wives
and bad witnesses. Because she in
sisted upon talking back to the court
to-day the bailiff was ordered to take
Mrs. Mabel C. Sheahan from the room
by Superior Judge H. A. Melvin. She
did not wait for Deputy Sheriff Swee
ney to take hold of her, but hurried
from the room. The scene was the
climax to many warnings given the
woman, who has tired the patience of
Judge and lawyers with her persistence
in answering more than she is asked.
Spirit rappings, card readings, and
the nerve wracking strain of trying
to peep into the next world have ruined
the household of J. J. Sheahan. Such
is his testimony.
The wife and mother of that house
hold, Mrs. Mabel Sheahan, is an ex
ample of a nervous, talkative woman,
who left her domestic ties for the table
tipplngs Vnd trumpet whisperings . of
dark seances.

AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 17. â The South
ern Pacific will build a new long grade
line of railroad between Eagle Pass,
Tex., and Beeville, the distance being
175 miles. At Eagle Pass the road
will connect with the Spofford branch
of Its transcontinental line and with
the Mexican International. At Bee
ville connection will be made with its
New York, Texas and Mexico division.
It will form a more direct and easier
route for Mexican and Californlan
through traffic between Eagle Pass
and Houston than by the existing
route through San Antonio.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC TO BUILD !
A NEW RAILWAY IX TEXAS;
It is pointed out that the saving
on this item alone will be enormous
both in gold leaf and labor In the
course of the year over the entire
Harriman lines.
OMAHA, Oct. 17.â The tendency
toward the elaborate decoration of
railroad cars has received a check. A
new style is now being put out from
Its shops here by the Union Pacific
which marks a return to severe plain
ness, costly embellishment giving place
to simple comfort.
For years the effort of the decora
tive artist has been directed toward
the richest and most complicated de
signs. Each succeeding car turned out
of the shops has surpassed in the
splendor of outward ornamentation
the beauty of the preceding coaches.
Fancy scroll work and geometrical
figures of the most bewildering pat
tern have been worked out in gold
leaf upon the exterior of the coach.
The cars have been flanked and en
riched with graceful curves and bands
of gold.
Now all of this is to be changed.
Thousands of dollars, it is said, will
be saved each year in the amount of
gold leaf used for such purposes. The
expensive woods and beautiful fur
nishings of the interior will continue.
In fact, it is intended that the ex
pense which is saved on the gold leaf
on the outside will go into the im
provements on the interior for the ad
ditional comfort, pleasure and con
venience of the passengers. Here
after the word "car" will be dropped
from the outside lettering, the l-'oels
will be simply, dining, chair, buffet,
etc.
Special Dirpmlch to The C*ll
YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Oc
tober 17.- Captain W. H. McCornack.
acting Superintendent of the Yosemite
National Park and commanding officer
of the First Squadron (Troops C and
D), Ninth Cavalry. United States ar
my, left the park Saturday en route
to the Presidio of Monterey. The de
parture of the troops this year is ear
lier than usual and is due to the reg
iment being ordered to Fort Riley.
Captain McCornack leaves the park
in a bttter condition than it has ever
been lef; before. General MacArthur,
en his tour of inspection of the park
this year, was pleased with its general
ir.anagement
A great many innovation! have been
mad*, the most prominent among
v.hich are the arboretum, suggested by
Major Bigelow; a neiv bridge spanning
the Merced and the renewal of the
Chilnualna Falis trail. The arboretum
will be one of the most interesting
features in the Yosemite National Park
and the resort of botanists and all
those interested in forestrj-. Almost
every specie of plant life indigenous to
the Sierras has been collected and bo
tanically classified. The space covered
by the arboretum is about ten acres.
The Ej-ot was selected on account of
the beauty of the surroundings and the
fine variety of trees already there. It
is at the junction of the south fork of
the Merced and Big Creek, just below
the post, and is adjacent to the State
f:sh hatcherj- and the Wawona mineral
springs, thus making the walk from
the hotel to the post a series of attrac
tions.
RUSTIC BENCHES IN NOOKS.
That the sightseer may not grow too
weary, every shady nook has a rustic
bench, many of fantastic designs ar
tistically arranged by the quartermas
ter. Lieutenant Edmund A. Buchanan.
The place is a veritable park, as all the
underbrush has been cleared and a
great deal of landscape gardening done.
Connecting the post to the arboretum is
the new bridge, which enables the pe
destrian to visit the post.
In the can:D there has been a number
of improvements. A building has been
erected as an office for the acting Su
perintendent of the park. One of the
most necessary improvements in the
lark was the renewal of the trail to the
Ch;lnualna Falls, which is onÂ« of the
greatest attractions of Wawona. These '.
Calls rival any of the falls in ths Yo- j
son;ite Valley and have always been a
great sight to the passing tourist.
The entire park h;is been carefully
S"ne over and all its boundaries clearly
â¢lofined and trails built to the various
patrols, thus opening the beauties of
the park to the public and facilitating
the work of the trocps. A good trail
has been built frcm Sunrise Meadows
to Merred Lake and fron: Rodgera
Lake through Return Canyon, and Vir
ginia C.ir.yon to Pmoky Jack Meadows.
More than 73,000 head of sheep have
been driven out of the park this year,
and Captain McCornack ha.s a.bly ex
ting.lished the numerous forest fires
that have occurred during the sum
mer months before much damage could
be done to the forests. The method he
employed was to make a counter-fire.
RECOMMENDS TELEPHONE.
In the Euperintedent's report to the
Secretary of the Interior he recom- '
mends that the National Government
assume control of the Yosemite Val
ley; the purchase of all patented lands
and toll roads withir the limits of the
National Park, and strongly opposes
the Gillette bill (the catting out of
eight townships in the park). To keep
in touch with all points in the park he
advises that a telephone line be con
structed from Wawona to all the patrol
stations. He also recommends that a
trail from Mirror Lake be constructed
to Lake Teneya. This will greatly
Fhorten the distance between the va
rious patrols and headquarters.
It is estimated that $13,500 trill be
reeded for the renewal and construc
tion of trails next year. Captain Me-
Corcack thinks it very important
that the acting superintendent be
Feet one month in advance of
the troops In order that he may
get a clear understanding of the
park, ?.nd thus save a. waste of time
in patrolling it. He also suggests that
thÂ« troops come earlier, bo as to have
ruJTlcient time to complete the improve
ments.
The Government has appropriated
about JiOOO for next year for the build
ing of kitchens and sheds and dining
rooms for the two troops, construction
cf quartermaster and commissary store
houses and enlarging the stables and
r.-ater supply. It v.as necessary to rent

it i:r> and down over the mountain
road*; besides the expense incurred

THE man who wrote that epi
gram so often quoted, "In order
that a love letter may be what
It should be, one should begin

sonal pronouns with premeditation and
not conventionally. He was speaking
for the edification of a masculine aud

Chicago Journal.
No girl could afford to follow any
such haphazard rule as this in love
correspondence. Whoever sits down to
write to her avowed admirer, or to her
fiance, should have in advance a
definite idea of what her reason is for
writing and. after she has finished,
she should know with some degree of
clearness to what course she has com
mitted herself and invited him.
But such a love letter would have no
savor, you say. It would lack spon
taneity. Besides, would it not imiOy
that a girl did not have confidence in
the man to whom she was writing? If
she hesitated to trust to him her soul
put down on perishable paper, could
she dare to trust herself to his life
long keeping?

There are few letters, except those
of important and confidential business,
which are read only by the persons to
whom they are addressed. This does
not always mean an intentional be
trayal of the writer's confidence on the
part of the recipient. There are, of
course, men who would read to others
the letters a girl has written them, in
the same spirit that they would recount
personal exploits, and, to balance
things, there are girls who make a
practice of reading to confidants the
letters that admirers or lovers write
them.
But there is a much larger class that
is simply careless about correspon
dence.
The man who has a rolltop desk at
his office is likely to prefer a writing
table at home for the sake of variety.
This is usually inadequate and, as a
result, letters are stuffed into a chiffon

dresser, or are left in the pockets of
coats which are periodically sent to
the tailor.
Consequently, a girl's^ letters may
reach the curious gaze of people for
whom they were not intended. It is
not a pleasant thought to a woman
The standing of the State in Congress is of equal interest to
every citizen. Every Californian with the interests of the State at
heart should ask himself what was gained by the election of Liver
nash, Wynn and Bell. We know what was lost to this city by
sending two class representatives to the House, where they failed
utterly to do anything for the general interests of San Francisco, and
even accomplished nothing at all for the special class they professed
to represent. They were utterly useless and had no standing even
with the minority. They were unpopular on the Democratic side of
the House and with its leader and were in every respect inefficient
and incapable of favorably impressing themselves upon anybody.
In consequence the city lost appropriations that would have paid out
much money in wages to labor and would have supplied facilities
much needed by our commerce.
San Francisco should not look at the partisanship but the utility
of this issue. We need a. decent immigrant station. The Govern
ment has the proper location for it. The Senate passed an appro
priation for the purpose and it was beaten in the House by the two
Representatives from this city. It would have obsoleted the miser
able detention shed on the Mail dock and would have made more
room there for commerce, which is badly needed. The Water Front
Federation, with a keen knowledge of the interests of labor in an
increase of our trade, has joined the commercial bodies of the State
in supporting the bond issue of two millions to extend the seawall,
increase the dock room of the water front and provide berths for
lhe big ships which are making a commercial conquest of the Pacific.
\Ve desire to impress the Water Front Federation that it has as
great an interest in a proper representation in Congress that can
secure for both labor and trade the measures needed for their united
prosperity.
There is not a laboring man nor a business man in San Fran
cisco that does not know that Mr. Kahn and Mr. Hayes can do the
things needed in the House by the interests of this city. They also
know that Mr. Livernash and Mr. Wynn cannot do those things, for
they have been tried and they have failed. We will have politics
always, but San Francisco will not always have the opportunity to
secure permanently her primacy of the Pacific trade. We are at the
crisis of that effort now. Strong rivals on each side of us, abounding
with ambition and capable of the command of resources that can
compel results, are in the field against us. A false move now may
disastrously check our advance. As an element of first importance
we require two men to represent this city in the House who stand
for all of our people and all of our business interests, and not for
one class alone. The business men, taxpayers and those who have
anything at stake in the prosperity of San Francisco can command
the situation if the}' will, and elect Mr. Kahn and Mr. Hayes and
secure their influence in Congress.
Going beyond the city to the State, its interests require a har
monious delegation in the House. The partisans of Mr. Bell are
trying to influence votes in his favor by questionable means and by
claiming for him credit that is not his due. We wish to remind them
that a seat in the House, secured by such means, is a seat wasted and
opportunity thrown away. The fortunes of the people of California
are joined in bonds indissoluble. Whatever makes for prosperity is
for the good of all. There is not a reasonable Democrat in California
Lut will admit that the prosperity of the State requires a strong and
harmonious Republican delegation in the House. They know that
the good work for the State performed by our two Senators, and by
McLachlan. Metcalf, Xeedham, Daniels and Gillett, has been for the
benefit of all. They cannot benefit only Republicans. As members
of the majority, and representing the majority in the State, their
work was for the minority as well. Let us strengthen the delegation
by making it unanimous and not weaken or dilute it by sending three
useless members of the minority, whose election will benefit no one
but themselves.
In this city it is apparent that offers are made to trade votes for
the Presidency to help Livernash and Wynn. We ivish to ask the
real Democrats in their districts if there is any good and patriotic
reason why a Democrat should vote for either. In the Congres
sional Directory, where every member writes a brief sketch dis
closing his party affiliation, these facts appear: "Edward James
Livernash, Union Labor party of San Francisco," and "William
Joseph Wyrin, Union Labor party, San Francisco." Each says he
was indorsed by the Democracy, but both are at pains to describe
themselves as not Democrats. They take pains to make it known
that they are representatives of one class only, and that purely
artificial.
The Democratic party in all its history has taken pains to pro
claim itself the representative of all and not of a class, and that is the
boast of Democrats who can give reasons for their faith, as it is
the boast of Republicans. Genuine Democrats, therefore, can carry
out their principles only by supporting the Republican candidates
for Congress, who represent all interests, and not one exclusive
class. We are persuaded that such Democrats will support Messrs.
Kahn and Hayes, who represent everybody, without limitation or
distinction.
THE most casual observer of the campaign in this State must
see that the Democracy concedes California to Roosevelt and
that his majority will be larger than the record vote for Mc-
Kinley in 1900. This being the case, the Democracy is concentrating
its efforts in the two Congressional districts in this city, and in the
Xapa district, to hold the three seats that were wasted on the
minority two years ago.

other depositions are to be taken, Â«o
under the usual rule they cannot be

PROPOSED STOCK ISSUE
CAUSES SLUMP IN MARKET
Alaska Packers' Association Securitiirs
Drop Heavily Pending Proposed .
Move by Directors.
The stock of the Alaska Packers'
Association had a heavy slump In the
stock market yesterday. Last' July
the stock fell to $121 50, which was
something like $40 a share off in a
few months. ' Yesterday the price
dropped to $104. Last Saturday the
price was $117. The association has
paid dividends for many years. The
break some months ago was the re
sult of a statement of heavy Indebted
ness. The present downward tendency
is supposed to be/ due to the Intention
of the directors to issue 2000 shar-is
of treasury stock and to the knowl
edge of that intention that has been
made public in the daily papers. The
capital stock of the association Is
$4,800,000 in 48,000 shares. On the
stock $65 a share has been paid, mak
ing the totalpaid up capital $3,120, -
000. The purpose of the issuance of
the treasury' stock Is the payment of
the indebtedness of the company.
Employment Agvncy In Trouble.
A warrant was secured from Police
Judge Mogan yesterday for the arrest
of J. E. Brower, manager' of the Em
ployes' Register Company, Chronicle
building, on a charge of conducting
an intelligence office without a license.
Several women have complained to
the police that they had paid a fee to
Brower for the purpose of obtaining a
situation, but when they called at the
place indicated they found that the
position was not what it had been
represented to be.
f Twenty years 6f married life is to j
i have a sensational ending for Lucy j
i and Jean Loupy, if the wife succeeds in '
; proving her accusations against the '
I proprietor of the "Pup Rotisserie" and
| incidentally the character of one of
i San Francisco's most famous eating
i places will be bared to the public.
1 Mrs. Loupy's complaint recites that
she married the restaurant man on .
September 29, 1884; that since then they
, have acquired as community property
; an undivided half interest in the Pup :
Rotisserie. on Stockton street. The ,
; business and its equipment are said to
! be worth $50,000 and the net income to ;
Â¦ be ?2000 a month, of which the Loupys j
[are entitled to one-half. ;
Cruelty Is the basis of the complaint. !
Mrs. Loupy asks for $100 a month all- .
mony, $250 counsel fees, and $50 costs
and an injunction to prevent him from
j disposing of the property.
j LIlHe Telles, on a cross-complaint
charging cruelty, yesterday obtained a
divorce from Charles A. Telles In Judge
Graham's court. Telles had charged
! his wife with cruelty, but the evidence
showed that he was the aggressor in
their frequent family fights.
Judge Hebbard set aside the divorce
granted two years ago to John P. j
Clark from Agnes K. Clark, a telegram '
from Clark at Wallace, Idaho, saying j
i that he v/as willing to let the motion |
to set aside go by default. The Clarks ,
were married for thirty years, and the t
; wife did not know she had been di- j
vorced until informed a few months
; ago by the War Department, to whom
she applied for her husband's pension.
| She then charged that the decree had
| been secured by fraud.
Divorces were granted by Judge Heb
i bard to John L. Robinson from Minnie
! Robinson for desertion, and by Judge
Sloss to Mary Ellingsen from Peter
j Ellingsen for neglect and desertion. ;
Suits for divorce were filed Â¦ by Lulu

The following committee was ap
pointed to co-operate with a like com
mittee of other denominations to con
sider the question of the maintenance
of the Bible in the public schools: Dr.
A. T. Needham, Dr. F. D. Bovard, Dr.
E. R. Dille, the Rev. A. C. Bane and
the Rev. J. H. N. Williams.
"Higher License" was the subject
before the Methodist Ministers*.Asso
ciation yesterday morning. Dr. Fran
cis M. Larkin reported the action of
the Election Commissioners on the re
jection of the petition for an amend
ment to the ordinance favoring higher
license. He explained that the sig
natures were transcribed by type
writers and names had been mis
spelled, yet the Registrar's clerks were
not permitted to consult the original
signatures. He complained that the
Civic League was not allowed to in
vestigate into the matter of rejected
names, although the Brewers' Asso
ciation was permitted to have a spe
cialist on handwriting and he worked
two days.
L. M. Hartley spoke as to future ac
tion. Ten thousand five hundred citi
zens, he said, had petitioned for an
amendment to the ordinance. The
Election Commissioners were asked to
obey the charter, b*ut had refused to
place the amendment on the ballot
under the pretense that there were
signatures that were not bona fide.
Dr. Hartley continued by saying that
he had gained two great points. The
citizenship of the city had been
aroused- and the sentiment of the peo
ple had been stirred, and the liquor
craft had shown that it feared to have
the question submitted to the people.
Bible teaching in the public school
was a matter discussed by the asso
ciation following an address by the
Rev. J. H. N. Williams oa "The Bible
as Literature."
It was said that the National Edu
cational Association passed a resolu
tion at its last meeting, held in St.
Louis, favoring the introduction of the
Bible in all public schools as a book
of religious instruction.
Dr. E. R. .Dille approved of the
movement and said that the principal
of Oakland High School was in favor
of including the Bible in the course
of study as literature and historic
value.
The Rev. Mr. Williams held that
they were more apt to meet with suc
cess in the project of Introducing the
Bible in the public schools if it should
be taught as a classic. The Junior
Order of American Mechanics, he said,
stands for the Bible In the public
school.
Dr. F. D. Bovard said that the pub
lic school must have a solid ethical
basis, and-,that the Bible Is the only,
true source" 1 of enlightenment and free
conscience.- He said "that the 1 public 1
school is now between the' alternative
of receiving religious instruction from
the open scriptures or from a hier
archy. The question, he said, was
vital to the permanency of the public
school.
A complimentary reception for the
past pupils of the convent will be held
on Sunday afternoon. It will bring
together many women who have re
ceived their early training here.
The first sisters of this order were
brought from Ireland and arrived In
this city on November 13, lSo^. 1 * They
settled in a small house on Green street
and opened school. Two of the four
sisters who came to this country re
turned to Ireland on account of the
hardships they encountered. On De
cember 3 the present convent on Powell
street was erected and grew with un
usual rapidity, and it affords to-day
every facility for learning to its pupils.

The graduation exercises at the Tivoli
Thursday afternoon will be worth wit
nessing. The sisters have arranged an
interesting programme. Pupils who
have received their musical education
at the hands of the devoted sisters will
take part in the drama, in six scenes,
which promises to be a feature of the
afternoon. It Is entitled "The Pupil's
Story of Fifty Years." Archbishop
Riordan will conclude the performance
with an address. The following pupils
will receive graduation honors:
Rev. Father McGough will celebrate
mass on Thursday morning at 6:45
o'clock for the graduates of the con
vent. They will renew their consecra
tion vows to Our Lady of Good Coun

After the mass the priests will be

sentation Convent, Powell and Green
wich streets. Every preparation has

in honor of the founding of the convent
fifty years ago. * In the afternoon there

It will be seen that Sperry is not in

be alternated in the game, though Cap
tain Stroud probably will play through
out. . '
The Multnomah team has been weak
ened by the injury which Coates, the
fullback, sustained in the game with
Stanford. Northrop will take his place.
The Multnomah line-up will be as fol
lows:
BERKELEY, Oct. 17.â Because'' of the
"line" it will give on the California
varsity team, the game to-morrow
with Multnomah is attracting more
than usual interest. It will be played
on the campus.
The men from Oregon gave the Stan
ford eleven a surprise last week when
they held down the Cardinals to a 0-0
score. Should California best the
Multnomah team, supporters of the
blue and gold will have added confi
dence In the varsity eleven's ability to
down the Stanford men In the big game
on November 12.
To complicate matters George says
that he is satisfied another man
stole the crock.
George Schmitz was released from
custody late last night. Captain Bur
nett does not believe he is the thief.
When George was arrested Friday
night he was taken before Captain
Burnett and on being questioned said
he would show the officers where the
coin was ' hidden. On Saturday he
went with them to the shop of E.
Livermore, painter, 2529 Mission
street, where he is employed, and, go
ing to an outhouse, produced a sack
containing $34 5. He said he had
grot the money from his mother on
Wednesday night, as it was his own
savings. To the surprise of the of
ficers he denied having taken the
crock containing the $11,080, saying
that he thought they meant all the
time the $345.
Captain Burnett said yesterday he
had learned that George's mother was
averse to any prosecution of her son
and she thinks that throusrh her In
fluence the father will relent.
William Schmitz, the aged painter
of 741 O'Farrell street, is still mourn
ing the loss of the crock containing
Jll.OSO. which was stolen from its
hidiiier-place in the cellar of his house
laÂ« Wednesday night, as told exclu
sively in yesterday's Call. He is very
bitter against his son, George W.
Schmitz, aa he is positive in his be
lief that George knows where the
money can be found.
Mr. Shortridge said that he would
produce his client In court this morn
ing and argue the motion for the re
duction of ball. He and Mr. West also
informed the United States Marshal
that they would produce the defend
ants at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon,
but 4 o'clock came and slipped by and
the defendants did not appear.
Eca da Silva is in hiding. Lee Toy,
his alleged partner in the illicit Im
portation of Chinese women, cannot
be found. United States Marshal
Shine and his deputies have been
hunting for the pair in all the China
town resorts since Saturday. The miss
ing men were indicted by the Fed
eral Grand Jury at half-past 2 o'clock
last Friday afternoon and a bench
warrant was immediately issued by
United States District Judge de Ha
ven commanding the Marshal to arrest
the accused forthwith and bring them
before the court. The warrant was
sent to the Marshal's office imme
diately after its issuance.
Marshal Shine last Saturday called
upon Thomas G. West, attorney for Da
Silva, but Mr. West was unable to give
any clew as to the whereabouts of his
client. The Marshal thereupon hid
Deputy Dingley in Mr. West's office to
receive Mr. da Silva should he come.
But he did not come. The search was
continued on Sunday and yesterday,
with no better result. Both men are
under S5000 bonds each to answer to
a former indictment, the bondsmen
being a surety company. â¢
Samuel M. Shortridge, attorney for
Lee Toy, appeared before Judge de
Haven yesterday morning and asked
that the bail be reduced dn the new
indictment. He frankly admitted
that he did not think that his client
and Da Silva could furnish $10,000 ad
ditional bonds. Judge de Haven as
frankly stated that he could not con
sider an application for reduction of
bail so long as the defendants were
not present in court Then the court
adjourned and the Judge went whist
ling down the corridor homeward
bound.
SEATTLE, Oct. 17. â There was no
excuse for the weird exhibition of I
fielding that Seattle put up to-day.
The players simply threw the ball to
the corners of the field, allowing Los
Angeles to win as she pleased after
the sixth inning. Baum pitched fine
ball and. was well supported. In fact
Baum was responsible for every run
Seattle got. Williams' pitching was
marred by indecision in plays that
came his way. Los Angeles stole bases
at will. The score:

no snap, but he is going to fool a lot
of people who think he has no chance.
I don't think that Gans, clever as he is,
stands a chance with Jimmie at 133.
He can whip anybody at that weight."
Both the little fellows started at light
work yesterday. Seats for the go will
be on sale at Harry Corbett's on Oc
tober 25.
Gans is getting ready for the decisive
struggle over at Bill Shannon's villa,
in the Marin County hills. The brunette
boxer isn't saying much about any
thing but the proposition of making
weight. Concerning that all-important
subject, he says, "Easy."
Al Herford. the negro boy's manager,
is confident that Gans has the fight
pocketed on class, general appearances
and everything. The "dope" reads
Gans as loud as a fog horn, says Her
ford. The Britts are not doing any
loud elocution on the subject. "I know
Gans' reputation," says James, "but
I'll go right to him. I can't afford to
lose and I won't."
James Edward Britt crossed the pond
to Croll's Gardens, Alameda County,
yesterday and there pitched his tent to
prepare for the battle with Gans.
Frank Rafael, who will prepare Jimmie
for the war, accompanied the little
champion. Britt was as chipper as if
going to rehearse for a new melodrama
instead of getting into training for a
mix with the shiftiest man in the busi
ness.

JAMAICA, Oct. 17. â With a warm
October sun diffusing life and health to
grateful thousands, fortune favored the
Metropolitan Jockey Club's fall open
ing to-day. The horses provided a sat
isfactory day's sport, excepting the
performance of Newton Bennington's
Blandy in the first race and the poor
handling of Water Pansy in the last
race.
The brilliant features of the day were
the track record victories of Dolly
Spanker. in the Pierrepont handicap
and the thrilling contest in the six-fur
long handicap, which was won by Clo
ten at 12 â¢ to 1 by a head from E. R.
Thomas' Reliable, which, in spite of his
high impost of 134 pounds, struggled
all the way and finally went lame just
before the finish, which undoubtedly
cost him the race.
That the miserable race shown by
Blandy is not to go on record without
official scrutiny was made known dur
ing the afternoon, one of the stewards
stating that the colt's trainer F. Bur
lew, had been sent for, but the answer
came back to the officials that Burlew
was ill and could not appear. Rumors
all over the ground before the betting
began on the first race were to the ef
fect that Blandy had worked half a
mile in 48% seconds and many of the
big bettors backed the colt. In fact his
late races were so good that if he was
fit to race he should have won easily.

CHICAGO, Oct. 17.â Miss Crawford,
at 7 to 2, won the third and feature
race at Worth to-day handily, with
two long shots, Gloriosa, 25 to 1, and
Idle, 40 to 1, struggling for place
money. They finished in the order
named behind Miss Crawford.
"Boots" Durnell evidently tried to
make a "killing" with Gloriosa, which
was backed from 30 to 1 to 25. Unlike
her former races, she was sent right
to the front to-day and led all the way
to the stretch turn, where Miss Craw
ford skinned the rail and took com
mand. Glc-riosa, however, was game
to the last ounce and was only beaten
a length. Idle, which, to all appear
ances, was outclassed, came up with
a rush on the inside in the closing
strides and was only beaten a head for
place.
In the fourth race, won by Royalty,
Lissardo bolted over the inside rail at
the paddock gate and broke his neck.
Jockey Minder, who rode him, was un
injured.

the third round, forcing Bowker to
the ropes in an exciting rally, landing
his left and right effectively.
Bowker caught Neil a good one in
the fourth round, when he reached his
left eye with a swing, but Neil paid
little attention to the blow and plunged
in, mixing matters in a lively fashion.
BOWKER ON THE AGGRESSIVE.
Neil had the better of the fifth and
he had an apparent advantage up to
the ninth, when it appeared that he
had Bowker beaten. A. stiff left to the
face and a series of wallops seemed to
take the steam out of the Englishman,
but, although he appeared groggy,
Neil did not seem to have the punch to
knock him out. Several times he tried
hard to put his man away, but his
blows lacked force. Despite his severe
punishment, Bowker came back for the
tenth round in good shape. He imme
diately took the aggressive. Neil's ef
forts in the early rounds seemed to
have taken much of his steam. Bowker
broke through his guard a number of
times, . but when he landed his blows
had little of their original effect. Bow
ker did the best of his work in the
eleventh round. He landed a left-hand
uppercut that jarred Neil from head
to foot. Neil landed a feeble right on
the face, but in return was walloped
on the jaw.
He rushed Bowker and the latter
jabbed him with a straight left. Neil
now seemed satisfied with taking the'
defensive and throughout the remain
ing rounds he held the Englishman off
as best he could, coming back now and
then and scoring some, good wallops.
Neil was badly punished in the last
half of the battle, but stood it gamely.

In the second round it was apparent
that Neil was on to Bowker's curves
and he started to cut a pace in an
effort to land a knockout. Neil con
tinued to land most effective blows in
Neil started off like a winner. It did
not take him long to get on to Bowker's
style. The latter began to dance away
and Neil at once began to force the
fighting. He went after the English
man and landed first with wallops on
the jaw with his right. Bowker stepped
lightly away, but before he pould get
set Neil crossed him with his left.
Bowker then got home a straight jab
to the face, which Neil didn't like. The
American retaliated with a right swing
on the neck and the pair clinched. They
exchanged some lively wallops at close
quarters, but Neil seined to have a
shade the better of it. \

LONDON, Oct. 17. â Before the Na
tional Sporting Club to-night Joe
Bowker of England beat Frankie Neil
of San Francisco on points in a twenr
ty-round contest for the bantam
championship of the world. The con
test was for a purse of $2500. The
pugilists were in fine condition. The
Englishman was a slight favorite at
11 to 10, but Neil was well supported
by many Americans.
The early rounds were rather in the
American's favor and in the ninth
round he almost had Bowker beaten.
From that time forward Bowker
greatly improved and administered a
lot of punishment, which Neil sus
tained In plucky fashion. It was an
interesting fight throughout. *

A. W. Fox vs. J. O'B. Gunn and T.
W. M. Draper, Oregon; Judgment're
versed and case remanded.
The original suit was brought by the
Government to quiet title to several
thousand acres of land in Southern
California, patents for which had been
erroneously issued to the railroad com
pany by the Government- - Much of this
land had been settled upon by squat
ters and bona fide settlers and the Gov
ernment interposed to prevent them
from beinfr ousted from the land. The
Government won the suit in the lower
court and the railroad company was
ousted.
Howard C. Holmes vs. Board of
State Harbor Commissioners, Califor
nia; judgment affirmed.
Holmes had brought the suit to re
cover damages for an infringement by
the State of a patented process of pre
paring wharf piles. On the first trial
in Judge Morrow's court the jury found
for the plaintiff, awarding him $5000
damages. The United States Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed this judg
ment and the case was remanded for a
new trial. Upon the second trial the
j'iry found for the defendant under
peremptory instructions of the court,
following the decision of the Court of
Appeals.
C. E. Burrows and A. P. StockweD
(claimants of the steamer T. C. R*ed)
vs. J. P. O. Lownsdale. Washington;
Judgment affirmed, but interest strick
en out.
iThe United States Circuit Court of
Appeals yesterday handed down deci
sions as foilows:
Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
Central Trust Company of New York,
D. O. Mills and Homer S. King vs. the
United States. Decree of the Circuit
Court affirmed.
For several weeks the engineers of
the Harbor Board have been working
on plans and specifications that they
think will fill the demands of the Pacific
Mail Company. Under the contract
with the State the Pacific Mail is the
responsible party in the matter of the
lease that gives to It certain dock priv
ileges on the water front that are
jointly enjoyed by the three transpa
cific lines mentioned. The 'officials of
the Pacific Mail have scrutinized the
plans for the new dock and have ac
knowledged that they are satisfactory.
To-morrow there will be a meeting of
the Board of Harbor Commissioners at
which it will be decided, after mutual
agreement between the steamship peo
ple and the State Commissioners,
whether work shall be commenced that
will change the dockage facilities at
Brannan and Fremont streets and
Brannan and Second streets, from an
cient to modern structures. The
amount to be spent In these improve
ments is about 54-0, 000.
What is known as pier 44 will be a
double-deck dock, something similar to
the dans first submitted to the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company and re
jected by it on the ground that It was
too costly. The steamship line pays
for the dock in rent money; that is, its
monthly Â¦ payments to the State must,
within a given time, equal the sum to
tal, of the cost to, the State of con
structing the dock. The monthly pay
ments to be made by the Pacific Mail
Company . will be decided at to-mor
row's meeting.
After the Pacific Mail Company re
jected the double-deck plans the Har
bor Commissioners went to work on
modified lines and produced the plans
that have now met the approval of the
steamship people.
Pier 42 will be converted into a first
class cylinder pier dock. In fact both
docks will be built on the cylindrical
steel pier plan and guaranteed to last
for decades."
There is a likelihood that the double
deck pier for the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company, Occidental and Oriental
Line and the vessels of the Toyo Kisen
Kaisha will be constructed by the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners ac
cording to modified plans submitted by
the . State . officials. ; >L j_. -

" 'REXRADIO' In only 3 seconds made my 30
years' "totally' deaf ear clearly hear distant
"whispered" sentences In view cf audience.
, Interview me."â Mr. B., 632 Market, offlce II
" 'REXRADIC quickly cured my large stom-
ach 'cancer.' It soon dried up ar.d was ab-
sorbed. Can't now see or feel slightest sign
of it. Am the most grateful man in city." â
H. C. Knott. 112 Fell.
" 'REXRADIO' in few seconds â¢publicly'
. quickened my long 'paralyzed" limb: instant-
ly I walked, ran and 'leaped' easily from
the floor. See me."â K. Hall. 17 4th. r. 5.
" 'REXRADIO'S' brief treatment subdued my
'heart' affection, palpitated violently, ir-
regularly, missing beats; now regular, nat-
ural, no missing beats." â J. Little. 201 Hyde.
"REXRADIO," before many. Including Mr.
Butler, representative of "S. F. Chronicle."
by one. brief treatment caused "deaf mute"
to clearly hear and Intelligibly speak sen-
tences and numerous words. Over 2O of audi-
ence each spoke to patient, who promptly
heard and repeated their words. (Bring
some "deaf mutes" Sunday healing meeting.)
"REXRADIO" made a second "dÂ«Â»f mute"
besrln to hear and speak (precisely as In
above case) In a local "physician's" offlce.
"REXRADIO'S" first short treatment marvel-
ously benefited the disabled limb of Mrs.
Bruce Le? (Lick Honve). well known to all
"Freemascns" as the honored widaw of
Cal. "Grand Commander of Knights Tem-
plar." The limb was in a dangerous state,
greatly Inflamed, immensely swollen. First
treatment reduced Inflammation and swell-
ing, and after the third the inflammation
was entirely gone and the limb of natural
size. REXRADIO presents this pleasing In-
cident to the traternal notice of his brother
"Masons.'"
" 'REXRADIO'S* single treatment subdued
my 'locomotor ataxia,' 7 years "bedfast :
couldn't move limbs, stand, "lifted* from and
. into bwi. Right away I moved legs freely,
rose from bed and 'stood* unaided. No re-
lapse in wreic?. still improving. See me." â
Stuart. <592 f i Capp (rear).
"OSSIFIED" lady. Joints firmly grown to-
gether, "immovable." One treatment in-
stantly joints freed, moved naturally. Years
"bedfast," helpless, lifted from. Into bÂ«d.
Now ruse unaided, seated herself in chair.
Can now cook. etc. still improving. Wishes
to see you. â Mrs. Knowles. 379 Bartlett.
" 'REXRADIO" went with me see sadly af-
flicted 'bedfast* man. full .of pain, helpless,
couldn't rise from bed or move limb? several
years. I saw the (one) treatment . ar.d pa-
tient astonished m? by rising (unassisted)
from bed and walking; limbs had largely re-
gained normal power; severe pains suddenly
ceased. Change was so great and quick it
seemed a dream." â I. Porter, 3460 20th st
" â¢REXRADIO'S' one treatment instantly
caused me to raise nearly powerless arm.
limb. ran. 'leaped' like boy (age 74). See me
at offices."
" â¢REXRADIO' quickly restored my 'falling
sight.' Couldn't read large print, recognize
faces. Two treatments, read small print, rec-
ognized faces at 50 feet. See me at offices.''
" *REXRADIO* speedily cured our dangerous
lung affection, removed severe general rheu-
matism, opened . many years closed nostril,
rtraightened crooked rheumatic arm. dis-
persed large tumors, cured neuralgia, etc.

' Potatoes were weak and lower prices ruled
for river and Salinas Burbanks. The demand
was of a light Jobbing character and the mar
ket was overloaded with river Burbanks,
which have been accumulating for several
days. Sweets, too, were weak, with supplies
far in excess of the demand. Onions arrived
freely, but were firmly held, and some dealers
were holding out for an advance.
Miscellaneous vegetables were generally
plentiful and. aside from some little firmness
in Green Corn, there were no changes in prices.
Mushrooms were offering and met with a good
demand at 20@25c per pound.

Future Grain and Provisions..
CHICAGO. Octl 17.-^Contlnued free move
ment q/ grains from the farms was 'one. of the
principal reasons for a loss of l%c In. wheat
prices to-day. From beginning, to end. senti
ment in the., wheat pit was bearish. * At the
start ' the market was , influenced . by liberal
world's shipments, lower cables and continued
heavy receipts in the Northwest. Extreme
weakness of thÂ« corn market alsrÂ» 'Kerted a
depressing effect. . At the ' opening December
wheat was off %c to %c at $1 12% to $1 18Â«.'
May was down %6%c to 5Â»#%c at $1 11%0
1 12%. Several prominent commission houses
were heavy T sellers of the. December t option.
With ' little support the market Â¦ Increased 'Â« in
weakness . as trading progressed. : Fresh i in
centives to" sell' were fou'na in the "enormous
Â»rlmary V rÂ«cei jtt. A further motive , was '-. an
Late mail advices from New York quote a
continued firm market for Hops at unchanged
prices and say:
"It is now calculated that there remain
only 8000 bales of the California crop to be
sold; 25,000 bales of the "Oregon crop. 10,000
bales of the Washington crop and 25.000 to
30,000 bales of the New York State crop. The
local market, reflecting the stronger advice*
from the coast and up the State, was firm and
higher, prices being advanced lc to 2c per
pound. Foreign advices continued strong."
A local estimate cuts down the quantity of
Hops left In growers' hands as not exceeding
2000 bales. In any event, no matter what the
estimate, the quantity is small.

LUMPER FINDS
SACK OF COIN
Hazel Damon, young, petite and
modestly attired, j tearfully told Police
Judge Mogan that she had no recollec
tion whatsoever of the misconduct al
leged bv Patrolman "Sam" Orr, who
arrested her last Saturday evening for
disturbing the peace on O'Farrell
street, between Stockton and Powell.
She must have been completely crazed
by the third and last drink of whisky
she . took In a concert hall which she
had visited with "a lady friend," for
oblivion quickly followed its consump
tion. No, she would not go so far as
to say the' liquor was drugged. The
truth was that she had never drunk
much alcoholic fluid and it was reason
able, to presume that the influence of
drink No. * 3 produced her delirium. If
the policeman said she fought like a
wildcat at bay and said things unfit for
publication, she guessed he told the
truth. He might say what he pleased
without fear of contradiction from her,
for she remembered nothing of what
happened from !the time she imbibed
that third drink until she found herself
in -solitary confinement Sunday morn
ing
The policeman testified that the girl
had been twice ejected from the con
cert hall before he was summoned to
take her into custody. She had resisted
expulsion with tooth and nail, and sev
eral athletic, waiters were hardly able
to cope with her. She resisted him fu
riously, casting herself upon the side
walk, screaming like a hyena and.slap
ping his face. She endeavored to .smash
the patrol alarm box to which he
dragged her. and in the wagon she kept
two burly bluecoats fully engaged in
holding her down.* At the Central Sta
tion it was found v necessary to place
her in a cell by herself.
After the girl had entered her plea of
lack of recollection, she informed the
court that her home is in Portland,
Ore., but for several months she has
been* employed in an inn at Berkeley.

"It am a 'culiar thing, yo Honnah,"

G. Piheit, a Frenchman, denied that
he willfully smote MonFoon in the ab
domen while the latter was passing
out of the Chinese Theater last Sat
urday evening. -After witnessing the
drama,? M/ Piheit explained, he met a
compatriot at the door and to him
was i illustrating the-way In which the
leading man had beaten the villain to
earth and rescued the heroine just as
he was about to be confined In a cave
alleged to be alive with dragons. While
thus engaged the narrator swung his
right arm backward to show how the
hero had swung his spear and Mon
Foon stepped out of the doorway just
in time to receive the full force of the
swing in his gastronomic region. When
he recovered from the immediate force
of the blow, which had doubled him
up like a jackknife, Mon Foon haughti
ly waved away M. Plhelt's apologies
and had him arrested for. battery.
"Eet war ze sad accl-dent," M. Pi

Mrs. Anna Brewer exercised her fem
inine prerogative of mind-changing to
an extent that tried the patience of
Judge Mogan. After having her hus
band, John, arrested on the charge of
threatening to kill her with a knife
last Sunday at their home, 468 Eddy
street, she whispered to the Judge yes
terday morning her desire that the case
be dismissed, as the defendant had
promised to treat her' better and she
would be deprived of maintenance if he
were sent to jail. Her request was
taken under consideration and probably
would have been complied with if she
had not withdrawn It half an hour later
and said she was willing thtt the law
should take Its course, as she was not
entirely satisfied that John would live
up to his promise. Before she had me
to undergo another change of desire the
case was continued till Friday, by
which time her mind may be made up
"for keeps."
Manuel Aguirre, a Mexican, said he
did not willfully violate the ordinance
which prohibits the carrying of deadly
weapons because he did not know that
such an ordinance existed. He was ar
rested at 1:30 o'clock Sunday morning
while attending a hop at Washington
Square Hall and from his waist belt
protruded the butt of a revolver, which
investigation proved to be fully loaded.
In his native land, Senor Aguirre aver
red, no gentleman is regarded as prop
erly equipped for a fandango unless he
carries a pistol or a knife or both and
it was quite a revelation to him that

extent of 40 per cent of their value
they shall be repaired with fireproof
material only^ln a certain designated
district outside of the fire limits, was
re-referred to the Fire Committee to
give lumber dealers who oppose the
measure a chance to be heard next
Thursday at 11:30 o'clock a. m.
An ordinance was passed to print
fully accepting the roadways of Jer
sey street, between Castro and Dia
mond; Washington street, between
Cherry and First avenue; Chenery
street, between Thirtieth and Randall,
and Dorland street, between Guerrero
and Dolores, all paved with bituminous
rock. Similar action was taken for
the conditional acceptance of Mission
street between Onondaga avenue and
the county line. * . .
A resolution was adopted accepting
the offer of the Southern, Pacific Com
pany to dedicate for public street pur
poses certain tracts of land sixty feet
in width along both sides of the "com
pany's right of way between Twenty
fourth and Twenty-seventh avenues
South. The company agrees not to
close any streets in the Paul Tract,
which is adjacent to the lands de
scribed, but will not be compelled7to
maintain any grade crossings between
Twenty-fourth and Twenty-seventh
avenues South.
The following ordinances were finally
passed: Ordering, the performance of
street work in Park Hill avenue, South
Broderick and Tilden streets. Eighth
avenue, Hancock, J ana Cole streets.
Authorizing the^ return of special taxes
for schools and a hospital to the United
Railroads, $35,477 2S; Oceanic Steamship
Company, $1713 75; Bankers' Invest
ment Company. $3390 07; Union Trust
Company, $7521 80, and many others.
The H street contract is worth $21,
150, and the Board of Works claims
that as a specific appropriation was
made in the budget for the work no
additional authorization is required.
The same reasoning also applies to the
Fourth street contract, which, however,
has not yet been awarded. In all like
lihood Mayor Schmitz will veto both
resolutions, as his views on the sub
ject are similar to those of his Board
of Works.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
took the Board of "Works to task for
having awarded a contract to F. M.
Yorke & Co. for the paving of H street
between Seventh and Twentieth ave
nues and for having Invited bids for
the widening anS paving of Fourth
street without having first received the
legal authorization from the Super
visors, as required by the Jurisdictional
provision of the charter.
The resolutions as adopted recite that
the Board of Supervisors does not rec
ognize the authority ot the Board of
Works in entering into the contract
with the Yorke company nor in adver
tising for bids for the paving of Fourth
street and that any demands presented
for work done under the provisions of
the contracts will not be recognized
or approved by the Board of Supervis
ors.
The Finance Committee refused to
pass the demands of E. M. .Graney for
shoeing horses of the Fire. Depart
ment and ordered them returned to
the Fire Commission, together with a
previous resolution expressing dissat
isfaction with the manner in which
the contract was awarded.
The Election Commissioners were
requested to file a statement showing
what saving would be effected by the
employment of a caretaker for the
voting machines, as recommended by
the Mayor. Commissioner Leffingwell
thought the man selected should be a
competent mechanic, not necessarily
on the civil service list. Supervisor
Payot took occasion to criticize the
departments that are fighting civil
service and declared that it was all
due to the character of the men placed
on the various commissions.
County Clerk Greif was directed by
the Finance Committee to file a formal
request with the Mayor that he be al
lowed a temporary clerk to collect
seme $30,000 due the city in probate
cases not yet closed. Some of the
claims run back twelve years. Greif
reported that he was now up to date
with the work in his office besides
catching up with eight -months' back
work left by his predecessor. The
cemmittee complimented Greif on his
splendid showing.
The Finance Committee requested
the City Attorney to press the city's
suit against ex-City Treasurer Brooks
for the recovery of commissions on
collateral inheritance taxes retained
by Brooks in the city's vaults. The
committee also* requested Treasurer
McDougald to write a letter stating
that he will not take advantage ot
the statute of limitations in the matter
of commissions on inheritance taxes
which have been retained by him in a
sealed bag in the city's vaults for near
ly two years. The court decision in
the Brooks suit will determine if the
City Treasurer is entitled to the com
missions. The City Attorney was also
urged to press the suit, against the
Board of Works for the recovery of
ex-Cashier White's defalcation.
Chief of Police "Wlttman explained
to the satisfaction of the committee
why it cost $800 to repair seven patrol
wagons in three months and the de
mands were passed.
Acting on the report of the Finance
Committee, the Board of Supervisors
yesterday rejected the three bids for
the bond issue, including that of
$250,000 from the State Board of Ex
aminers, and ordered new bids to be
advertised for. Monday, November
21, 1904, at the rooms of the board,
was fixed aa the time and place for
receiving bids. Only $277,000 worth
of bids were filed on October 3 for
an aggregate of $5,600,000 of the
bonds and it was deemed proper to be
gin proceedings all over again for
their sale.
The communication from the Asso
ciation for the Adornment of San
Francisco, notifying the board of the
desire of banking institutions to bid
for $2,000,000 of the securities, the
funds of which are to be utilized for
the purchase of lands for parks and
playgrounds, was referred to the Fi
nance and Utilities committees. The
Mayor received a letter from a New
York concern offering to lobby a bill
through the New York Legislature le
galizing the issue, so as to permit of
investments therein by the banks of
New York.
At Brandenstein's request the License
Committee was directed to inquire into
the advisability of reducing or abolish
ing the license tax on Junk dealers.
The Auditor was allowed to emplay
thirty extra clerks for a period of sixty
days.
A resolution introduced by Supervisor
Lunstedt was referred to the Joint
Committee on Judiciary and Streets.
It provides that all street railroad com
panies operating street railroads in San
Francisco be authorized and directed
to place stop plates or stop signs at all
points where cars regularly stop to
take on or let off passengers, provided
that no such stop plates or stop signs
shall bt placed where the stopping
place is at or near a crosswalk from
an intersecting street. Such stop plates
or stop signs are to be placed under the
supervision of the Board of Public
"Works.
To prevent street oar accidents such
as have occurred recently the Rich
mond district citizens petitioned the
board to enact ordinances that will, (1)
restrict the 1 speed of cars having elec
tric or air brakes to fifteen miles per
hour and cars having hand brakes only
to ten miles per hour; (2) that no car
shall carry a greater number of pas
sengers than the seating capacity plus
ore-half the sameâ that is to say. a
car seating forty passengers shall not
carry more than sixty at any one time;
(3) that double the present number of
cars be provided; (4) that each car
shall be washed three times a week.
The petition was referred to the
Street Committee.
Alfred Roncovieri. president of the
Board of Education, filed with the
Board of Supervisors yesterday a peti
tion that article 7 of the charter, re
lating to public schools, be amended.
The petition contains the names and
addresses of more than 27,000 legally
qualified electors, that number being
largely in excess of the 15 per cent of
the votes cast at the last general elec
tion. Roncovieri requests that a spe
cial election be held for the purpose of
submitting the amendments, which are
designed to render the school depart
ment independent of the Board of Su
pervisors in the fixing of the school
budget and other matters. He also
atks that an early date be set for the
same. The petition was referred to the
Joint Charter Amendment, Finance and
Public Utilities Committee.
â¢ The City Attorney was requested to
advise the board whether the city is
liable for the cost of a sewer con
structed in Pierce street, between Mc-
Allister and Golden Gate avenue, in
view of the erroneous full acceptance
of the street by the Supervisors on
January SO, 1S93, previous to the con
struction of a sewer in the block
named. - Property crwners have peti
tioned the board to make provision for
the payment of an assessment levied
against their property by the Board of
"Works on July 1. 1904.
RESISTS POLICEMAN IN FURIOUS MANNER.
The Supreme Court is disturbed by
the fear that a certain Bernard D.
O'Connell, whom it has recently ad
mitted to practice, is none other than
an ex-convict from Massachusetts. An
investigation is under to make
certain of the facts in the case. Should
the official suspicion be verified Attor
ney O'Connell will get short shrift.
An attempt has been made to veil the
affair with secrecy, because the sus
pected lawyer received his credentials
from men prominent in official life in
this and other large cities. O'Connell
is in New York on legal business.
Stephen Costello, on whose motion the
suspected lawyer was admitted to
practice, discovered last night that he
knew little or nothing of the man. At
torney Keegan, who is O'Connell's
partner, knew nothing of his asso
ciate's history. Both lawyers had ac
cepted the man's credentials from a
leading fraternal organization and had
made no further investigation. Cos
tello stated last night that "he should
immediately petition the Supreme
Court to disbar O'Connell unless he
could clear himseTf. The suspected at
torney states in his application for ad
mission to practice that his name is
Bernard D. O'Connell, while the name
on his office door and the name by
whick he has made himself known is
Daniel O'Connell.
The Massachusetts ex-convict bore
the name of Bernard Daniel O'Connell.
In 1SS6 he was admitted to the bar by
the Supreme Court in Boston. He be
gan the practice of law in Lowell,
Mass., and mingled quite freely in poll-
tics. In 1897 he was convicted of "in
citing, aiding and abetting an attempt
at bribery," for which he was fined $foo
and imprisoned for six- months. A few
weeks later he was disbarred by the
Massachusetts Supreme Ccurt. Later
he was connected with another case. In
which his - bad record was fully ex
posed. Then he retired from the scene
of action.. The following cases will give
a summary . of Convict O'Connell'a
criminal history:* 170 Mass., 22$; 174
Mass., 253-261; 1S6 Mass., 541; â¬6 North
eastern Reports, page*7S8.
O'Connell was sent to prison for b<Â».
ing a party to an attempt to brib<?
Councilman I^ang to vote for Edwanl
IL Donovan for the office of City Treas
urer and Tax Collector of LowelL Lane;
seemingly agreed to the scheme, but
concealed a stenographer and witnesses
behind a screen when the time came to
pay over the bribe of $250. Convictions
of all the guilty men were easily se
cured, and Donovan did not get the
office, except temporarily, by appoint
ment by the Mayor.
Are the two Bernard Daniel O'Con
nells one and the same p'erson? They
are of about the same age. Attorney
O'Connell of this city confided to Cos
tejlo that he originally came from Mas
sachusetts. Both men were educated
for the bar and both have practiced.
The San Francisco O'Connell Is
known to his sponsors principally
through his membership in a promi
nent fraternal organization. Another
feature in the case is a letter received
at the Supreme Court recently.
This missive states that the O'Con
nell who was admitted to prac
tice here last August is the ex-con
vict. The writer is a woman, an old
friend of the Massachusetts briber, and
she evidently does not wish to lost*
track of him. She lacks the education
possessed by the one-time lawyer, but
her remarks are at least very much to
the point when she refers to him.
O'Connell is expected back from New
York in about two weeks.
