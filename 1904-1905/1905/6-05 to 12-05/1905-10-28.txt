Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â Secretary
Taft. accompanied by Major General
Storr, Colonel C. R. Edwards. Colonel
Black and Major Goethels, left Washing
ton to-night lor Hampton Roads, where
he will to-morrow board the cruiser Co
lumbia and proceed to Panama for in
spection of The canal work. This trip
promises to be of great importance to
thÂ«> future of the canal. Upon Taft's re
turn what is at present a much unset
tled .condition of affairs in the canal com
mission will T>e definitely adjusted, as
President Roosevelt will have returned to
Washington at that time.
Although ihe press agent of the canal
commission denied the story to-night there
are many strong indications that the crux
of the whole situation Is the desire of
both Secretary Taft and T. P. Sbonts.
chairman of the commission, to be the
*u]jreme authority under the President.
Each desires to have an absolutely free
hand. Upon returning' from the Philip
pines. Secretary Taft expressed his wish
to turn the canal work over to the State
Department and agreed to retain the di
rection of it only en the canditiaa thai
he was to be supreme in authority, that"
the chairman of the commission was to
!>â¢ subordinate to him and should carry
out his instructions or- be answerable to
him for the work- If the canal work was
to be done under his department Taft
declared his authority must be paramount
on the isthmus.
Shores came back to find that Tat had
taken the pains to impress upon the Pres
ident that he was to be supreme and had
planned a trip to the isthmus himfelf
without waiting to hear the result of the
trip made by Shonts and the international
engineering board. Shonts has had little
intercourse with Secretary Taft since he
returned. He declared to-night. In re
eponse to inquiries, that affairs had come
to a point where he would retire unless
he had full powers, with accountability
only to the President, and that his posi
tion had not changed since be accepted
the chairmanship. This is taken to mean
that he still believes that he should have
"full swing," which he is said to have
eUpulat^d as necfgsary to his acceptance
ef the chairmanship, which came to him
unsolicited.
Secretary Taft, at the earnest request
of officials of Panama and the United
States, hag timed his visit so as to be in
Panama on Nocember 3. the second anni
versary of the independence of the re
jjublic of Panama. The officials believe
that his presence on this occasion will
<3o much to strengthen the relations be
tween this Government and the isthmian
republic.

Special Dispatcb to The Can.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27,â Jamea J. Ml.
president of the Great Northern Rail
way, and E. H. Harriman, head of the
Union Pacific, opponents In the railroad
war which is being waged in the West
by rival interests, arrived in this city-
Hill from St. Paul and Harriman from
his trip to the Orient. Each paid his
compliments to the father in characteris
tic terms when asked concerning the mu
tual hostile attitude of the Union Pacific
and the Burlington. The two roads have
obtained restraining injunctions against
each other in a dispute over the rigrhts of
way along the North Platte River Valley
route.
"We have started- to build an old line
along the North Platte" said Harriman.
"We located the road a long time ago.
but they tried to stop us. It is an. old
line, as I said, and a very small affair.
I do not know," he added, "that we are
apt to run into an era of competitive
railroad building just as we passed
through an era of railroad buying. In
any event Uie Union Pacific is in the best
position of any railroad west of Missouri.
It has nothing to does It care."
Hill, when informed of Harriman's re
marks on an era of: competitive buying,
said that that view of the situation bad
not presented Itself to .him. Retorting to
his rival's belief that the Union Pacific
was In the best position of any Western
roads. Hill observed, with an air of mock
seriousness: â¢-.-\u25a0.'\u25a0 :.
"I am glad to hear that Mr. Harriman
is feeling so good. Yes, it .is undoubt
edly a reflection on tfle Hill roads, but
then the Hill roads are all crippled and
will soon be going, out of business." Hill
insisted that he. knew nothing regarding
the Injunctions .and he agreed . that the
North Platte extension was a small mat
ter. \u25a0_ '
"Three-fourths of those stories from
the West are nonslnse, and the one that
the Burlington intends* to reach Salt Lake
Is only one of the fables. I am on the
Burlington board, and I do not know of
any proposition ever submitted to It that
the road should build two hundred miles
In the' direction of Salt Lake."
Hill would not discuss the purpose of
the Great Northern's new $23,000,000 stock
issue, saying he did not believe the public
was interested in the matter.'
Harriman. in discussing his trip to the
Orient, was enthusiastic in his estmate
of the Japanese.
"They are going to develop the
Orient," he said. '"The Japanese are the
dominating factor there. Our best In
terests will be preserved if we operate
with them. They are going to get their
share of the trans-Paciflc business in
their own bottoms."
Harriman added that he believed busi
ness conditions in the United States were
never before so good as they are now
throughout the country.

Drugged by milk that contained a
deadly poison In the form of hair dye
ims the, fate of little Gladys May
Tumult}', six month* old, the daughter
ot Mr. and .Mrs. Frank Tumalty, rcsld
iuc at 702 Autunia street.
For days the infant ha* been under
the watchful *y*Â» of a physician,
while a young mother, distracted over
the critical Illness o* her first born,
Ua*Â» spent many anxious hours at the
cradle where the lever-racked baby
lies, another victim of the greed of un
scrupulous dairymen and the neglect oX
the uUclals charged with ':he protec
tion of the people's health.
. When her baby was stricken last
Friday., Mrs. Turaalty. sxX once suspect- ..
Ed there was something wrong with
the milk fed to the little one. She
summoned "Dr. William Barbat. who
diagnosed the trouble and . confirmed
the Mother's suspicions. The physi
cian ordered the milk diet stopped and
put the child on rice water.
The mother decided to satisfy her
self beyond all question that the milk
was at fault, and she sent a sample
to the physician. He reported it tÂ»
be deficient in' butter , fats. Still un
satisfied,. Mrs. Tumalty took another'
pint to the Board of Health and re
ttuested an examination, \ reporting thÂ«Â»
condition of her baby.
The 'milk was analyzed and City
Chemist Gibbs reported to the board
that it contained peroxide of hydrogon,
a drug used commonly to bleach hair,
and also as "an antiseptic for destroy
ing, germs. In milk, it would tend to
check fermentation. And this wa.3 the
compound which baby Tumalty drank
as a part of her daily food.
The dairyman who served the Tu
maltys was John Linehan. who. with
three brothers, conducts the Green
Valley Dairy. So particular had the
mother been to insure pure milk for
her 'infant that she had demanded a
service exclusively from one cow. M^s.
Tumalty said Linehan had agreed ,1a
her request, but had compelled her to
pay more than ' the : usual rate for this
particular service; The condition of
the baby testifies to the careful selec
tion that must have been made.
RKFUSIIS TO ARREST.
': In the face of this disclosure the
Board of Health has refused to take
action against Linehan. Instead of
ordering hts arrest Immediately upon
the discovery of the deadly drug in
the milk the officials of the Health De
partment took no action other than to
send a coldly formal notice to Mrs.
Tumalty requesting her to play tha
part of prosecutor.
And Dr. D. F. Ragan. the Health Of
ficer, offered as the only excuse for
official neglect in this exposure of
"doping",' milk that the department
could not proceed because its inspec
tors had not collected the sample of
milk whfch was tested. To Dr. Ragan
and â¢ his seventeen assistants in food
and sanitary inspection -the thought did
not occur * that the department, full-,
panoplied: in official authority, could
proceed against the ;off ending dairy
man, and summon Mrs. Tumalty a3 a
witness. It did not occur, apparently,
to the high-salaried bureau employes
that the public expected some service
other than the perfunctory labor of
writing letters when the lives and
health of innocent babes were at stake.
: Following is the curt message Mrs.
Tumalty, received as a response to hpr
labors in the r cause of Infants' protec
\u25a0'\u25a0;\u25a0 October 26. 1303.
Mrs. Tomalty. 702 N'atoma Street â Dear
Madam: A sample of milk left by you at this
office, said to be from the Green Valley Dairy.
Is shown by * chemical analyses 1 to be below
the but Ur- fat standard, and to contain perox
ide of hydrogen.
It is the desire of thia department that you
at once take steps to swÂ«*r out a warrant for
thÂ« arrest of the offenders, and, this depart
ment will aid in suca prosecution. This de
partment cannot arreat these offenders, as tha
samples were not taken by our Inspectors. Re
spectfully. D. F. RAGAX. M. D..
Per COFFEY. Health Officer.
So the mother, worn out. by constant
watching at her baby's bedside, must
take the- place of the Board of Health,
or the- dairyman goes unpunished.
MOTIIEK TEL.LS HEJI . STORY.
Here :is the mother's story of her
experiences with poisoned milk:
Gladys was taken seriously ill last . Friday.
I sent for Dr. Barbat. and he ordered me to
stop her milk. After, several days on rice
water the baby '. bsgan to improve.- but slw U
still ' very lit. ;, There *vere all ,the symptoms
that I have read about the other children who
were poisoned by. adulterated milk.- I haven't

flooded the city with letters to physi
cians, civic organizations and others re

TERRORISTS ARE TRYING
TO FORCE A CONFLICT.
STRIKE IN: RUSSIA IS SPREADING
Officials. Abandon
Hope of Quiet ] ;
Settlement .\u25a0..;<!
Believe Bloodshed
Is Certain to
ST PETERSBURG. Oct. 27.â Thai the
present situation cannot, end without
bloodshed hs the conviction prevailing in
the higrher Government circles, which
from moment to moment are expecting a
conflict between the troops and the revo
lutionists in SL Petersburg and news of
trouble In the provinces, especially at
Kharkoff, which has been declared in a
state of eiege. \u25a0; Governors . have' iieen in
structed to takÂ« all necessary precautions
to preserve order.
One of the most prominent members of
the Emperor's council said to-day with
every evidence of deep emotion:
"The situation is a grievous and pain
ful one, and I see no way out of it, ex
cept by the employment of .armed force.
Please do not misunderstand me. I look
upon the prospect, with tears, but it is
becoming more and more evident that the
troops will be compelled to fire. I can'
see no other possible outcome. The revpr
lutfpnlSUi and terrorists are absolutely
bent on forcing a conflict upon us, and
nothing we can do will satisfy them. The
extension of the suffrage and the right
of assemblage will be to them.
They are 'determined to have bloodshed
and we cannot avold^ the issued It is a
frightful disease from which Russia is
suffering, and* sad and painful as it is,
the Government must act with force. "\
The Minister said "that the law creat
ing a responsible cabinet will probably
be promulgated and Count Witte's nom
ination as Premier announced to-morrow.
Under the statute the Premier may or
may not hold a special portfolio. \
CONFLICT IS AVERTED.
CounfAVitte spent almost the entire day
with the Emperor at Peterhof, and he
has not confided to his colleagues whether
he intends to take the Ministry of the
Interipr or. the Ministry of Finance or no
portfolio at' all. The whole of the Min
isterial body is also In ignorance as to
whether they will retain their places un
der the new leader.
Realizing that any attempt to interfere
with the monster meeting at the univer
sity would inevitably lead to a bl.oody
outbreak. General Trepoff ,â¢ Who announced
during the afternoon that he intended to
prevent the assembly, instructed the po
lice to close their eyes to the fact, and
the meeting, which was attended by beÂ»
tween 15,000 and 30,000 persons, passed off
without a conflict. The troops stationed
around the building were withdrawn, bujt
in the court, the city bourse and other
nearby buildings tialf a. dozen ;compani<js
of Cossacks and Strong for.ces of infantry
and dragoons were in readiness to sally
forth if necessary.
Big , meetings, were also , held rjn the
technological and art Institutes' "and iv
two engineering schools. The student*
at neither of these meetings took a prom*
taent I part in , the deliberations, yield/ng
the'nospJtality "fat "' the* coilesw^ buildings
without attempting to cloak the meetings
witn' the guise' of. student assemblies.
With the hope j of. avoiding further Ttieet
inge at the university. General Trepoff
later placed .halls in three different .parts
of the city at the disposition of the people
for ireetlngs, thereby practically conced
ing the demand of the agitators of the
ri??ht of aEsembly. â¢ * . !
â¢ GENERAL STIIIKE, I'LAJiVED.
The scene Inside the university beggars
description. In the great open-air court,
with no light except a few flickering can
dles on a hastily constructed tribune,
from 4000 to 5000 workmen, students* and
professional men stood wedged together
in the cold and wet snowfall, listening
to revolutionary harangues.
Another great meeting was .heldMn the
central hall of the university building
and several smaller meetings were held
in labor, and secret society halls.
In all the sections a strong minority
urged conservatism, but these were
carried from their- feet by the- general
enthusiasm and resolutions for a gen
eral strike in every " branch of Social
Democracy were adopted with a hur
rah. Even the Chinovnlks in the Gov
ernment service, whose meeting was
largely attended, were possessed of the
came spirit and passed resolutions to
\u25a0top all work in the. Government de
partments to-morrow. ' This probably
will include the Government telegraph
agency, and may put the telegraph and
cable service out of commission. An
other resolution whlch : was generally
adopted notified the authorities that
the assize court building on L/itania
street must be opened for a uniyersai
meeting of all classes at noon to-mor
row, at which measures will be adopt
ed against any person who Is reported
as not adhering to the general strike.
AGITATORS COXFIDRXT.
A remarkable feature .of air the
speeches was the spirit of complete
confidence that the success of ' the
movement was at- hand and the. mani

to force an armed conflict upon, the

TO RULE NORWAY
Bane to Accept the Tlirone
Which the Swedish King
Declines for His Family
OFFICIAL RECOGNITION
Farewell Note Addressed to
the New Country by Its
Monarch of Former Days
PARIS, Oct. 27.â Information reaching
the highest Quarters here shows that
definite arrangements have been made by
wbica Prince Charles of Denmark will
accept tho throne of Norway, following
a plebiscite on November 17. Prince
Charles will leave Denmark to aesume
tile royal functions immediately after the
notification of his election is conveyed to
STOCKHOLM, Sweden, Oct. 27.â King
OÂ»car has definitely and formally de
clined the offer of the Norwegian throne
to a Prince of the House of Bernadotte,
and in a letter to the president of the
Storthing: finally severs his connection
with Norway. The letter, which is dated
October 26. is as follows:
After having in thÂ« namÂ« or Sweden rec
ognized .Norway a* & state completely sep.
â¢rated frÂ«n Sweden I inform you of my de
cision to relinquish the crown of Norway,
which, notwithstanding ail my good Intentions,
has given me in the course of years so man;
bitter cares. Moreover. I could no longc*
wear it to the benefit of the country since tnÂ«
Illegal decision of the Storthing has rendered
illusory even the suspensive veto or the King.
JBut I desire only the welfare of the country
and the nation toward which I have enter
tamed a sincere affection ever since my youta
And to the happiness of which it has always
been my heart's desire to contribute so lons
a* the means to that end could be reconciled
with ttvs duties entailed by my position aa
King of both countries of the Scandinavian
peninsula.
In view of the turn the mutual relation*
between the two countries have taken I can
not think it would be conducive to thÂ« hap
piness of either Eweden or Norway that a
Prince of my nous* should accept an election
to be King of Norway. Assurediy there would
not fall to arise in both countries a feeling bt
distrust which would operate as much against
him as against me. This distrust might only
too easily become an obstacle to the improve
mtnt of the mutual sentiments of thÂ« twÂ»
e&tlons unfavorably separated. I hope to see
pacific relations assured between them la a
not too distant future. I cannot therefor*
accept the Storthing's offer. I thank with all
my heart thote who during my reign of thirty
three years have faithfully served me and
Norway and who may even now entertain af
fection for their former King. In now bidding
them farewell I cherish sincere good wishes
for them.
At a meeting: of the Council of State
to-day King Oscar announced that he
\u25a0would in the future use the following:
style and title:
' " We.- Oscar, by the Grace of God,
King of Sweden and of Gothswends."
He further announced that his motto
would be "the welfare of Sweden" in
stead of "the welfare of the sister na
tions."
WASHINGTON. Oct. 27.â Official an
nouncement of the recognition by Kin?
Oscar of the separation of Sweden and
Norway has cc:ne to the State Depart
ment. A circular note is being addressed
to the powers conveying this informa
tion In a formal manner.
UTAH FUEL, COMPAXVS PLANT
IS BADLY DAMAGED BY FIKK
Blase May Cause Temporary Shutdown
of the Big Smrlten In Salt
Lake Valley. 'V "
SALT LAKE. Utah, Oct. 27.â A loss
estimated at $200,000 was caused by a
fire which broke out last night In the
plant of the Utah Fuel Company, a
Gould corporation, at Sunnyside. Utah,
on the Rio Grande "Western Railroad,
The company's great coal crushers,
which supply coal for its coke ovens,
were destroyed and the eoripany will
be unable to produce coke until the
damage can be repaired. As all the
big smelters in the Salt Lake Valley
receive their coke supply from Sunny
side, the fire may .seriously affect the
smelting industry. About 600 men at
Sunnyside arc temporarily thrown out
of work. Sixty per cent of the com
pany's loss is covered by insurance.

or less trouble with my kidneys for
fifteen years, my back aching at times
so that I could neither sit, stand nor
lie in any comfort. When in the acute
stage I had sinking spells, was weak.
I lacked energy and often felt as if I
â¢ would totally collapse. If I stooped
for a few minutes when I regained an
upright position I grew so dizzy I
could scarcely stand, and, despite the
fact that I was continually taking
medicine from physicians and using
Standard remedies, I grew worse in
pMace of better. I had very little
. faith in Doan's Kidney Pills when I
first commenced their use, but aftei
a few days of the treatment they must
have acted on my nervous system as
â¢ well as the kidneys, for, I was able to
sleep at night peacefully â something

time. I most heartily recommend
Doan's Kidney Pills."

FIVE HOURS BEFORE HE WAS SAVED. '\u25a0i" ' v - - ' 1
When the walla of the Central Can
nery Company nt >orth Point and Bay
â¢Urects collapsed an hour after the fire
Rtarted within them early yesterday
morning:, four brave firemen were
found to have been burled In the blaz-
Inc ruins.
Two of thene menâ Frnnk Cassadsa
anil Harry Wilson of truck 2â were
rescued without much difficulty; an
other, Jack Arata of engine 5, waltted
nearly an hour before bis rescuers
were enabled to reach him, and the
last, Lieutenant Dnvld Harrison, also
of engine 5, lay nearly six hours pin
ioned under heavy timbers and hemmed
In by flames before be was dragged to
safety. â¢ '
The story of Harrison's rescue is. at
tended by most thrilling circumstances.
How he remained a prisoner as hour
after hour passed, while His compan
ions worked to save his life, each of
whom was exposed to as great a dan
ger as had been his own, and. how he
directed their operations, refusing
either stimulants* or medical attention
until their work was complete, can
only be realized by the bevy of brave
workers who tunneled under a mass of
charred and smoldering ruins- until
success rewarded their efforts and
their victim was carried out with only
x his legs slightly injured. The earnest
ness with which the firemen labored to
save the life of their comrade may bo
better considered when it is known
that the man who led them was Bat
talion Chief McCluskey, father-in-law
of the man who was imprisoned be
neath the fallen building.
The first alarm for the fire was
I sounded very shortly after 3 o'clock in
j the morning. Special Policeman H. F.
j Stone discovered the flames on the
North Point side and when Chief Sul
livan arrived the necessity of a sec
ond alarm was apparent. The old
structure, which was formerly occu
pied by a wire manufacturing com
pany, was soon enveloped in flames
and the entire block, which contains "a
warehouse and the works of the Cali
fornia Ore Testing Company, was in
danger of destruction.
Streams were played on the fire from
all directions, but owing to the com- i
bustlble material contained in the box '
factory of the north .side, little pro- i
gress was made in subduing the fire.
As quickly as possible Battalion Chief
McCluskey ordered the crew of engine '
5 to take a line of hose into the build
ing. This order was quickly, obeyed
and Aratii and Harrison climbed to the j
second floor with a line of hose and j
found, a position of advantage. <
TERRIBLE CRASH COMES. i
It was exactly one hour after. the* first
alarm had been sounded when a sudden
creaking of timbers was heard and a
second later the entire structure -tttilged
out and collapsed with a crash. The peril
to life was known Instantly by the chief.
It was only a question then as to how
many men were beneath the debris. Sul
livan did * not hesitate. He/ ordered a
third alarm turned in. and directed his
men "to bend their efforts toward saving
their comrades. Cassassa and Wilson were
about half way up;a ladder on the North
Point street â¢ side ' when * the crash came.
They were thrown to the ground and the
shattered side . of; the building covered
them. They owe : their .lives' to^the fact
that a freight car Impeded the fall of;
the ruins and they were 'taken out a
few- minutes . afterward with numerous
cuts and bruises, but neltner was serl
out^ly Injured.*?-.
A hasty roll call was made and all
THE SAN FRANCISCO GAIS^^SATORIMy;^^;O
were accounted for with the exception
of Arata and Harrison. It was first be
lieved these men were dead, but after an
hour's struggle in the debris they were
found and they conversed with the men
who were sent to their rescue. Sullivan
dispatched automobiles to. the corporation
yards In quest of saws, set screws and
other appliances. Then he ordered a
corps of men to brace the remaining por
tion of the building and timbers- of all
sizes and descriptions were secured from
a lumber yard on the opposite side \u25a0; of
the street. A brick wall on the south
side of the structure menaced operations
as it had been jarred out of position and
might fall at any moment.
It was not practical to throw any water
on the fire while the o men worked except
from a small line that was used to keep'
the flames back from the Imprisoned fire
men and those who lay beneath black
ened and heated timbers, hacking and
sawing and making slow progress. ,
HEAR CRIES OF VICTIM.
Arata was reached first. , After cutting
through a wall the firemen heard his calls
and a handsaw quickly cut a large girder
that held him down. ;. .When taken out
he was almost suffocated and was quickly
transferred to the Emergency Hospital.
When the crash came -.Lieutenant of Po
lice Fred Green ordered two ambulances
and -.three' patrol wagons, equipped
stretchers, to the scene, and Dr. D^ggins
of the Fire Department was on hand to
render immediate aid. The effort to>' reach
Harrison, was then taken .up under \u25a0 the
direction of Battalion Chief McCluskey.
For nearly six hours the men struggled
to take out their companion.
Two heavy timbers ' rested across | the
unfortunate fireman's legs. One of them
was removed about 6 o'clock," but great
difficulty arose ; In lifting the other. \u25a0 Set
screws were brought into play . but the
space was too small for the free use of
ci th er saws or axes. :

Hundred Thousand Dollars
Could Be Saved on One
Set . of Big V6l nines' Alone
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â Acting Public
Printer Ricketts to-day made several sug
gestions for the saving jof money ." to the
Government in its public printing to the
joint committee on printing, of the Senate
and House of Representatives. A volume
of ,4800 pages was 'exhibited *>y Ricketts,
being one of twenty-four such volumes
Issued annually by ; the Patent Office and
containing pictures of patents Issued. It
was the belief of Ricketts that $100,000 a
year '; might be saved In the Patent Office
printing alone by a condensation of the
subject matter. ,He also ventured the in
formation that v the $40,000 ) annual appro
priation for franked envelopes for mem
bers of the. Senate and House was. more
than the actual requirement.
As the* wages of the employes of the
Government bindery are 25 per cent higher
than in commercial offices,, Ricketts was
of the opinion that much ofthe binding
done for the Government could be done
outside eta treat saving. :'}*tS \u25a0'!â¢ -; '
Ricketts expressed - the opinion that 20
per cent of -the 'present cost >of composi
tion is due to corrections In proofs, which
expense, he showed,: could be \u25a0 saved, by
more careful editing. before sending copy
to the printer. .
Representative Landis, chairman of the
committee, took occasion during the hear
ing to 'say that he thought that vanity is
in a measure responsible Tor -the immense
amount of printing- turned . out by the
printing-office. The. proportion was, he
thought, . largely dependent upon the
prominence of the authors' names on
title pages. ?\u25a0 ' - -.:-W> \u25a0\u25a0'

TRY TO DROWN
PEACE ENVOYS
SEATTLE, Oct. 27.â What is pictured
as a deliberate attempt to murder several
members of the Japanese \u25a0 peace commis
sion in the .harbor of Yokohama is de
scribed in a letter to a high official in
this city brought "over on the steamship
Minnesota. The letter was written by a
woman prominent in Seattle social circles
and tells how a Japanese torpedo-boat
endeavored, while running at full speed,
to collide with and. sink the launch upon
which the , peace commissioners were
leaving the steamship Dakota to go
ashore. .
The letter states that after Mr. Denl
son and the \u25a0 commissioners had been
taken into a launch from the Dakota, the
crew of a Japanese . torpedo-boat came
ahead at full speed in an apparent at
tempt to cut the launch in two. . A sec
ond launch came between the torpedo
boat and the launch . carrying \ the . com
missioners and received a glancing blow,
which threw j the torpedo-boat partly out
of its course, with the result that instead
of hitting the commissioners' launch
squarely ? amidships it was hit near the
bow, but the entire bow was knocked off
and one of the crew was thrown into the
sea/ The second launch' went to the as
sistance of the disabled craft.

California for many years at least. It Is
stated upon the reliable authority of the
leaders of the local Japanese colony that
-the Japanese" residents of Southern Call-:
fornia, of whom there are large' numbers,
are leaving dally for home to proceed
thence to the newly opened commercial
fields in Manchuria and Korea.
It is declared that within a year a ma
jority of the present local Japanese pop
ulation will have migrated. The cessation
of the war and '.the opening of tew op
portunities in the Orient .'furnish an at
traction to the Japanese, who believe they
see there a chance to use to advantage
the knowledge of -commerce and business
gained by a residence in this country.
Three of the prominent Japanese busi
ness men of this city. It is said, are clos
ing up their affairs preparatory to de
parting for the Orient as soon as possible,

Mongolians May Now Come to
America on the Statement
That They Are in Transit
WASHINGTON. Oct. 27.â 1t is the un
derstanding that the efforts at treaty
making between the L'nited States and
China will await the action of Congress
in the matter of amending the Chinese
exclusion act, in accordance with an ex
pected recommendation of President
Roos-velt in his next annual message.
So far there has been inter failure on
ths part of the two Governments 10 get
together on a treaty.
Boon after China brought the treaty
of liÂ»M to an end on December 8, 1904. she
presented the draft of a new treaty to
the State Department. This was turned
over to the Department of Commerce and
Labor, which has jurisdiction of immigra
tion matters. When this department con
cluded with the treaty It was- returned
to the State Department for transmission
to China. China utterly rejected the in
strument In its modified form. Since that
time no further steps have been taken in
tne matter, although the understanding
here is that China is preparing a nÂ«w
draft.
That much has been done to lessen the
rigor of the exclusion act in accn dance
with the expressed wishes of Pres^cent
Roosevelt is manifest by the increased
number of Chinese who are comins ijito
the United States.
A recent modification cf the regula
tions makes, it is declared, an absolute
breach In the wall. The reg
ulation in question required, befors It was
modified, a bond of JSOu to be furnished
by the transportation company for every
Chinese in transit through the ccuntiy.
This bond has been entirely Bwsy
>ith. This fact, taken in connection with
the ease with which a laborer can nw
persuade an Inspector that he is a "mer
chant," and only desires to pass through
the country, constitutes the breach in
the wall. Once in the country "in tran
sit." it is an easy matter to set otf the
T.rain at any desired point and remain.
This modification of the regulations in
favor of the Chinese has not as yet be
come generally unuerstood. When it is.
o&cials look for an influx of Chinese "in
transit."

URGE INSURANCE
FOR THE NATION
Several Congressmen Said
to Be in Favor of Radical
. Solution of the Question
BILLS BEING PREPARED
General Sentiment Growing
Which Has Supervision by
Government as a -Basis
CHICAGO,- Oct. 27.â Shall the United
States Government go into the Insurance
business? This question will be asked
with a good deal of force at the opening
of Congress. Individual Representatives
from different districts, including widely
separated sections of the country, nave
indicated their intention to introduce bills
regulÃtlng life insurance and even fire
insurance business. Inquiries have been
made of the Bureau of Corporations at
the Department of Commerce and Labor,
and other investigators have been study
ing methods in the office of Comptroller
of the Currency. All these researches, as
conducted by individual Congressmen,
have had for their one object the develop
ment of data going to show the neces
sity of Federal control of the great in
surance corporations.
There will be( a large number of bills
introduced at the opening: of Congress,
which will sweep away all intermediate
steps and will provide that the United
States Government shall go into the life
insurance business and into the fire and
marine Insurance business as well, if such
a thing be possible.
' Of course, no one expects that any such
radical legislation will be passed at this
session of Congress, .but several members
of the House seem, to have become im
bued with the idea that the time is ripe
for a radical and even a Socialistic de
parture in the direction of a more pater
nalistic theory of government.
WILL OBSERVE
ELECTION LAW
Commissioners Make a Pub
lic Declaration Concern
ing Their Official Acts
The â¢ Board of Election Commissioner!
has issued an address to the public,
touching Its purpose to administer the
election laws impartially. The salient
features of the statement follow:
The Board of Election Commissioners of the
city and county of San Francisco on the eve
of election desires to say a serious word to
the voters of San FrancUco. The Election
Commission In the coming election has but
one duty to perform, namely, to see that the
election laws are properly administered and
afterward to see that the will of the people
Is properly and lawfully proclaimed. In per
forming this duty the commission is entirely
non-partisan, adheres to no party, consider*
neither the man In or out of office. The
administration of . the law Is the sole office
of the commission, and to that office the
sacred honor of the members of the
commission, as men and citizens, is pledged.
To the people of San Francisco .the commission
presents the fact that It will carefully,
sacredly, solemnly guard the ballot box; that
It will permit no partisan representation to
Interfere with the legitimate duties of the
election boards; that the members of the board
hold themselves ready to assume the respon
sibility of any infraction of the laws govern
ing and guiding such election officers or in
terference with the ballot; and- that Bhould nny
diÂ«=deroeanor of that character come to their
not'.ce on' or after election day they, the mem
bers of the commission, will be the first to
criminally prosecute the miscreants who would
tamper with the most sacred rights of Amer
ican citizens. J. A. DEVOTO.

UNITED ; STATES WARSHIP. WEST
VIRGINIA; /Oct. 27 (via New Orleans by
wireless).â At 11 o'clock last evening
through confusion of 'signals - Vie . fruit
steamship Esparta collided â¢ with jjj the
lighthouse tender Magnolia,: which was
conveying President Roosevelt, Secretary
Loeb and Dr. Rixey . to the West Vir
ginia. The rail and port bow of the Mag
nolia were damaged and two or three
holes made in the vessel .below the wa
terline. No one was hurt. The Magnolia
immediately on being struck was beached,
her bow j being high and . dry. After a
careful examination of the damage ; to
the vessel it was evident there was no
danger and the President and his party
went to bed. . , \u25a0 '
Major Craighill of. the United States
Engineers, was "aboard â¢. the - Magnolia.
His ship, the Ivy, a sister ship . of the
Magnolia, had preceded the Magnolia and
was some distance ahead.. , A boat was
immediately put off for the nearest tele
phone, about - a mile and- a. half away,
and the order given to head'the Ivy off
at Pilot Station and. have her . return ,f or
the President and his party. The trans
fer was made at 3 o'clock this morning.
The vessel got under way immediately
and the West Virginia was boarded on
sphedule time. S; : . â¢
PRESIDENT ASLEEI* AT TIME.
NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 27.â After a nar
row escape from losing, his -life in an
early morning collision In which . the
lighthouse tender Magnolia, in which he
was traveling, was so much damaged
that he had to abandon . her,' President
Roosevelt is now safe on board the ar
mored cruiser West Virginia. Neither
the President nor any member . of his
party was injured in the accident.
At ths time of the accident the Presi
dent, worn out , by his strenuous experi
ence in New^Orleans, was fast asleep^
The two ships were near the west shore
when they came in contact. The prow
of the Esparta struck the Magnolia on
the port bow. It was not known to what
extent the Magnolia might, have been
injured, and there was great haste in
pushing her ashore. Both vessels ground
ed, but. the Esparta got off under her
own steam and was found not to- have
suffered any damage. '. - ;-
The President showed no excitement
when informed of the extent of
disaster, although he was; somewhat
finnoyed by the probability of a delay.
He dressed immediately, and those of
his. party hurriedly made arrangements
tor his transfer to the Ivy. " ;" -.
TUGS RUSH TO THE SCENE.
The first news of the accident reached
New Orleans by telephone at an early
hour this morning, coming. in the shapo
of an appeal for help from Captain
Rose of the United Fruit Company's
steamship Esparta. which was the ves
sel' reported in collision with the Mag
nolia. Captain Rose gave no details
except that the boats had struck'xeaeh
other, that the President was uninjured
and that the Esparta might have to
take him on board and carry him to
the mouth of the river. The message
came from Nairn, La., near which point
the accident occurred.
. Immediately upon receipt of the news
communication was opened with the
tug owners here, and the powerful tugs
R. Wilmot and R. D. Weed left New Or
leans shortly after with orders to go at
full' speed to the scene of the accident.
Meanwhile, however, the President's
party had managed to get in communi
cation with the lower part of the river,
where it was known that the lighthouse
tender Ivy was lying. The Ivy got
under way and covered the forty miles
In rapid time. President Roosevelt,
Secretary Loeb and Surgeon â¢ General
Rixey, with their baggage, were at
once transferred, and the Ivy proceeded
down the river. When tn"e Ivy passed
Pilot Town on her way down she sig
naled that the President and party were
all well. # :<;
At 9 o'clock the Ivy reached .Port
Eads. President Roosevelt and his
party were on deck. The tender did
not stop, hut Immediately, passed: out
Into the gulf. The West Virginia' was
in plain Bight. The tender- quickly
covered the distance separating 1 the two
vessels, and as the Ivy appeared a Pres
idential salute Pounded from \u25a0 the war
ship. The transfer after the Ivy reach
ed the big: ship's side was a matter of
but a few moments, the weather being,
fine and clear, with little sea runnintr.
At 9:40 the President stepped on board
the West Virginia, safe and. sound, after
his exciting: experience here, and on his
trip down the river. The West Virginia
had already lifted her anchors, and before
10 o'clock she started on her Journey up
the coast. ; \u25a0 .
PENSACOLA, Fla., Oct. 27â The crui
ser West Virginia, with President Roose
velt on : board, was spoken /; to-day^"by
wireless telegraph, the ship at the time
being about 300 miles off shore. ; The mes
sage was received at the Pensacola navy
yard and stated that : the West , Virginia
would reach Key West Saturday night.
OFF SOIL OF COUNTRY. V
WASHINGTON, Oct.' 27â So far as the
official records show,. President Roosevelt.
6n leaving the South .on the, cruiser West
Virginia, Is' the first chief : executive"' of
this country to go beyond its territorial
limits. Legal authorities here are unani
mously of the opinion that the President
has in no sense vacated his office, even
temporarily. They point out that there ls t
really nothing In the constitution prohib
iting the President from leaving Ameri
can territory, and In the^present case,
being "on a national ship," the ; deck \of
which is as much apart of American ter
ritory as the District of Columbia, he has
not legally departed from' the 'country./.
According ,to t a report \, received ' at the
Navy Department, to-day, the \u25a0 wireless
telegraph station >at Key ;, Wes t; picked \ up
the armored \ cruiser \u25a0 West | Virginia' at a

Witness: \. THE HQN. W. H. HlfvrTV,
Chief Justice of Our Supreme . Court,
This STtb day of October, A. D. 1905. . , â¢

FRANK C. JORDAN, Clerk.
G. H. S. DRVDEN, Deputy Clerk.
The brazen attempt of Boss Ruef and
his' satellite Schmitz to secure by fraud
a portion of the Democratic' and the
Republican vote was thwarted yester
day by a flat of the Supreme Cour,t.
The Election Commission is command
ed to place on the official ballot the
names of those only who have been
nominated by' regular parties. The
tricky scheme of the curly boss was
exposed by the Fusion Campaign Com
mittee and brought immediately to the
attention of the State's highest tri
i bunal.
*- Ruef managed to get some of his per
sonal adherents into both the Repub
lican and the Democratic conventions.
These henchmen subsequently assembled
at the order of Ruef and made "Independ
ent Republican" and "Independent
Democratic" nominations. The nomi
nees were the same In each Instance
es those on the graft ticket.
The Election Commissioners, also
â¢ Ruefters, decided to place these "In
dependent" nominations on the ticket,
but the eummary action of the Supreme
\u25a0Court has given the whole plot its
Quietus. The opinion was written by
Justice Shaw, with whom Justices Van
Dyke and McFarland directly concur.
Chief Justice Beatty wrote a concur
ring opinion. The complete text of the
cecision follows:
MUST NOT MISLEAD VOTERS.
John 6. Partridge, petitioner, vs. James A
Devoto. Elmore C. Leffingwell. Thomas Me-
Guire and A. W. Vooreanger. constituting the
Board of Election Commissioners of the city
end county of San Francisco, respondents.
This Is an application for a writ of man
date commanding the Board of Election Com
rr.isslonert of San Francisco to prepare thÂ»
â¢Â«mple ballot to bÂ« mailed to the voters of said
city at the election to be held on Novembei
7. 1905 and the voting machines to be used
s.t fcaid election by omitting from said ballet*
sujd from said voting machines the names ot
certain persons nominated by two separate
certificates by voters of the city who desig
nate themselves by the party designations "In
ttependert Republican party" and "Independent
"Democratic party" respectively, and without
Â» any separate columns for the designation oi
Psuch so-called parties or the insertion of the
â¢ Mmi purporting to be nominated by said
certificates.
: : It appears that certain persons filed with
the Board cf Election Commissioners a cer
tificate of nomination naming as candidates ror
the respective offices to be filled at the com
ing election certain persons and desirnatm*
certain ether persons to constitute a committee
representing the eignere of the certificate as
! a political party by the name "Independent
Republican party." and that a similar cer
tificate was signed by certain other person*
appointing a committee and designating them
â¢elv^g by the name "Independent Democrats
petty." and that the Board of Election Com
missioners are about to print the ballots and
prepare th* voting machines by Inserting there
in a column headed by the names of such
parties respectively and containing the names
of the candidates nominated In said certificates
Nomination* had been previously made by reg
ular conventions of the Republican and Demo
cratic parties re.'pcctively, and certified unaei
the party names of "Republican party" and
"Democratic party" .respectively.
Ttie code provldp* that in the case of nom
instior.e mÂ»de otherwise than by a convention
the person* signing the certificate -may adopt
r name to designate their organization as a
political party, but that such name must not
be the same as that or any existing political
party at Â»> similar thereto that voters may
be misled thereby (Pol. C. sec. 11SS). The
drcie'.onis on the subject recognize the prin
ciple tbat where the name Jhus adopted is tn
â¢owe respects similar to that of a pre-exist
ing party a court, in determining whetheÂ»
or not the name if liable to mislead the public
may consider matters of public and common
knowledge, such as the existence of the old
parties and their respective names In common
use the recent - formation of a new party
known by <he name adopted In the certificate
or the absence of any Â«uch organization, ana
from Â»I 1 the circumstances thus known may
consider the probability of deception by tfte
def!sr.flt!on adopted. Â«n re Greene 41 IX. T.
gj]Â» 173; Phillip* vs. , Curley. 28 Colo. 2i).
' SO ORGAMZATIOX FORMED.
It U obvious that If there -has been
keo previous organization publicly
'known Â»>y (far name selected, nnd th*
perron* visiting; ehe certificate have
not nude ttny public avbtral of any j
peculiar political principle or \u25a0â¢ policy l
*h* adherence to wblcn has moved
them to join in (tic certificate, and the
name selected Is nlmilar to that of an
other party, and has never been known
|In that vicinity as the name of - any
parity or . association of persons until
made public by the filing of the cer
tificate In question, the likelihood that
the new name will mislead 'the beed
! less, Indifferent or uninformed voter Is
much greater than it would be In the
case of the selection of a name known
to the public as that of an existing
'. organization created to promote some
principle or policy concerning which
> there had been some previous public
1 discussion, and the candidates named
are avowed advocates of that, prin
ciple or policy. ''.
The courts have held that the names "Na
tional Democratic party" JCralg; vs. Brown,
114 Cal. 480) (In re Greene, supra), "Silver
Republican party" <6tate vs. Johnson, 18 Mom.
page 556), â¢â¢Bryan Democratic party" (State
vs. Arms. M Mont. 447) and "Social . Demo
cratic party" (In re Social Democratic party,
Â«3 N\ Y. Sup. 1023). are not misleading. But
in each of these cases there had been a,
.previous organization, well and publicly known
by the name in question, which, had been
: created and carried on for the purpose of ad
vancing the peculiar political views- and prin
ciples of its adherents, and which" had been
for a lone time the subject of much discus
sion at public gatherings and In the pubiu
prints. In each of them also the candidate*
named were, in the main, different from those
of any of the pre-existing parties. These party
names were so well known that it was ex
tremely unlikely that any voter could fail
to perceive their significance . or be misled
thereby.
In the pres'it case the existing circum
stances and. cono.i'Ti! are significantly differ
ent. There have been no differences or dissen
sions as to any political principle or policy
within the Republican and Democratic parties,
respectively, that have been publicly discussed
or become generally known, or causing lac
tions known by descriptive titles. There has
been no organization previously formed for
the furtherance of any such principle or pol
icy, or for any purpose, or at all, and tjie re
spective names. "Independent Republican
party" and "Independent Democratic party,"
have been hitherto unknown and unheard of as
the names of any distinctive political parties,
or otherwise. They were first presented to
the public by the certificates of nomination
here in controversy.
CONFUSION WOULD RESULT.
To make the distinctive names
adonlted still more meaningless of
themselves, as the. â¢ names of distinct
parties, the two certificates In Ques
tion respectively name ; the same per
sons as candidates for the respective
offices, and those candidates are the
same persons previously j nominated
for the same offices by a parity known
as the "Union Labor party." â¢ The per
sons signing \u25a0 said certificates and
adopting said supposed party, names
cannot claim to represent any body
of delegates who participated In the
conventions of the Democratic and the
Republican parties respectively, pre
viously held, and who became dissat
isfied with the action of their respec
tive conventions concerning the nom
ination of candidates, nor .the persons
who voted for such delegates at - the
primaries, for neither such delegates
nor the persons who voted for them
at the primaries are permitted by low
to Join In the nomination of any other
peraons by the filing, of certificates
sucb as those In question. (Pol. C,
Sections 1188-1159.)
All these circumstances, of course, might
be also considered upon the question of the
good faith of the persons signing the certifi
cate. If their good faith were In issue. But no
charge of bad faith is made. In terms, and.
even if it is conceded that bad faith would
be good cause for rejecting -such certificates,
we cannot consider the question in this pro
ceeding. Our consideration of \u25a0 these circum
stances is confined to the subject of. their
bearing, if any. upon the question of the de
ceptive effect ofÂ» the names adopted. ' â¢'
The purpose of 'the statutory provision con
cerning nominations by certificate Is \u25a0 two-fold.
It to . intended. In the first . plare. to permit
absolutely independent nominations of per
sons as candidates who have no political affil
iation* with any party and who do not Intend
to form a party/ but who Â» become: candidates
for reasons personal to , themselves \u25a0or to \u25a0 those
who sign the certificates.- In .the second place.
It Is intended MO" facilitate 1 the' formation of
uw nautical parties, enabling such an orrajji

zatlon to get a place on the ballot, and if, ! at
th* ensuing- election, it receives as much as 3
per cent of the total vote. It thereafter takes
Its place as a regular and recognized political
party, entitled to â¢ nominate candidates by. a
convention. â¢\u25a0 â¢ . . ...Â»
CASE IS CLEAR. \u25a0'.
Undw these circumstances 'it seems i clear
that the average voter, K. at ;< all . susceptible
to misleading influence, or Ignorant of the
origin. of the certificates In question,', as some
may be supposed to be, would naturally believe
that the party ticket thus designated was > a
ticket of the party to which he belonged, or of
the opposite party known by a similar name,
and It cannot be said that he would necessa
rily know that it was a distinct, party from
that designated by the same name without the
qualifying adjective. .\ - .';\u25a0'
There are votera of all degrees of
intelligence, who exercise different | de
grees of care, circumspection, ,' : Intelli
gence, or negligence, as the j case : may
be. It Is to the public Interest, and it
Is the purpose of the particular pro
viso !of the code, which la here j In
volved, to secure that end, that the
ballot be so framed with respect to
the ticket headings, that even the moat
Ignorant, heedless,' or hasty voter
shall not be unnecessarily misled In
regard to the ticket for , whose ccndl
dates he votes.
It is obvious that the word* used may have
that effect of misleading voters. The nomina
tion is. therefore, in violation of the proviso
and is not a legal designation of a political
party such as It is permitted to place upon
the ballot.
The- certificates do not purport to be
Independent nominations, ' ' but . are
avowedly nominations by '. persons
claiming to be organised as a party.'
For that purpose the certificates are
Invalid, and' as they are not Independ
ent nominations, , and \u25a0 as . all ' the per
sons named therein are already on the
ballot as candidates of the "Union La
bor party" for the respective offices,
the attempted nominations .by these
certificates should be Ignored. :'â¢-'-.-\u25a0
. For these reasons we are*of the opinion that
the uetition should be granted, and the writ
lseued as prayed for, and It is so â¢ordered.

CONCURRING OPINION.â I concur in the
Judgment for the same reason that Induced
my dissent from the Judgment In the case
of Crale vs. Brown. 114 Cal. <81. The orefcn
lrers of a new party can always find a party
designation which Is wholly distinct, from
the name of an existing , party. - . The name
"Republican" or "Democratic," though quali
fied by an epithet, not only may but Inevitably
must deceive some of that daas of voters whose
protection Is the avowed -\u25a0 policy of the - law,
*nd when every legitimate purpose of the or
ganization of a. new political ; party can bo
accomplished by the adoption of a name \u25a0 en
tirely distinct and which can deceive . no one,
they should be required, ' and . under.: a proper
construction of the law they nre required,- to

CROWDED MEETINGS.
iHIS ABOUT ABE RUEF
Says the Boss' Plan
< Is -boiled, by
Sey e r al Candidates
Tell About the
Grafters..
"While .the Supreme Court and the
United Garment .Workers have dealt the
Ruef forces two . heavy blows, John S.
Partridge, the fusion standard bearer of
decency, kept up a running fire yesterday
upon the - ranks of his opponents In five
meetings. Twice the fusion leader spoke
In the Thirty-ninth District and twice In
the Fortieth, and yesterday, noon . he vis
ited the .Western Sugar . Refinery, where
he was generously welcomed by an audi
ence composed entirely of worklngmen.
respectfully listened to and greeted with
greater enthusiasm than has attended his
previous outdoorl talks.
The flrsf. visit made by Mr. Partridge
was to the Oceanslde Club of the Thirty
ninth District at the Breakers. Here, de
spite the fact that there was another
meeting. at Ninth . avenue and H street,
every seat was taken and the hall com
fortably filled. . Mr. .Partridge was the
first speaker of the evening and was pre
sented by Alexander Russell, who pre
sided. - r
After thanking his auditors for their
hearty greeting,. Mr. Partridge read to
them the. decision of the Supreme Court
that hasdealt the Ruefites a body blow.
He then told them the needs of the dis
trict and promised them that when elect
ed he would see .to it that a complete
sewer system was Installed in the dis
trict. He also told them of the street
work that would be done and of the plac
ing on the* various commissions of men
who would do their duty by the city and
not do politics for a boss. At the con
clusion of his speech he was heartily
cheered.
Later in the evening Henry U. Bran
densteln addressed the audience on the
evidences of graft shown to the Board of
Supervisors at the City Hall. He also
told of the personal attacks made upon
him by his opponents and of the lack of
labor men on the supposed Union Labor
ticket. Mr. Brandenstein was warmly
greeted by the residents of Oceanside.
ANOTHER HALL CROWDED. .
The next plac/ visited by Partridge
was a crowded hall at Ninth avenue near
H street. The residents of that section
of the Thirty-ninth crowded In the small
hall to hear the fusion leader. As Part
ridge entered the hall Fred Eggers. the
candidate for Tax Collector, was In the
midst of his speech. After the cheering for
the fusion 1 leader had subsided. Eggers
continued his attack upon the failure of
the municipal departments, especially the
Board of Works, to improve the Sunset
district. He told of their failure to pave
the Mission road and spoke of the May
or's action In the matter of locating quar
ries among the homes of the poor. He
also told of the campaign circulars that
Ruel is circulating in his (the Thlrty
elxth) v - district, accusing Eggers of mak
ing money by grafting and spending fifty
dollars a day at the race track.. The an
nouncement was greeted with laughter.
Partridge in his speech referred In
particular to the boasts of Ruef that
he would have everything his own way
from the time that his Judges were
running for places â¢on the Superior
bench. He gave as tl\e sole cause of
their defeat the knowledge by the peo
ple that they were under Ruef guid
ance. He then told of Ruef's historic
and decisve defeat at the primaries,
later in the forming of the Repub
lican convention, still later In his de
feat to prevent the Joining of the Re
publican and Democratic parties to
sweep him from power., and now . the
decision of the Supreme .Court keep
ing his misleading and so-called inde
pendent tickets off the ballot. Ruef
was so confident- of their going upon
the machines that he told his friends
to wager on it.
GREETED BY CITIZENS.
From Park View Hall the candidate
then swung over to Bear Club Hall, in
the Fortieth District, where another
packed house was awaiting his com
ing There the audience had already
been enlightened concerning municipal
graft by the present administration by
such speakers as Daniel A. Ryan and
C. A. Sweigert. .1 Ryan made his char
acteristically dignified speech, while
Sweigert brought down the house by
calling Ruef Schmitz's tender mend,
his legal tender friend.
Following a -short speech- by
ward Rock, candidate for re-election
as Supervisor, Mr. Partridge was pre
sented by the chairman of the evening,
B.*S. ..uickhoff.
With -' the speechmaking at the For
tieth District's headquarters Partridge
closed his evening's campaign. There
he had already been preceded by Daniel
A Ryan and Fred Eggers and Â» the
crowd that filled the building was aug
mented by many \who followed Part
ridge from the preceding hall and were
compelled to remain. outside. .*.: :
The leader was presented by the pre
siding officer,' Matt Brady. He spoke
of the meetings thathave greeted him
throughout the , campaign," of the en
tnusiasm % evoked which showed that
the people were awakened, were, rally
ing to his support and would sweep the
grafters off the face of the earth. He
told of the disgraceful meeting at Gari
baldi Hall arid â¢ its wiping out a week
later when the residents responded ,to
his can.
Later -In the evening Brandenstein
addressed the meeting, as did several
of the district officers and workers. â¢

SUPBEME COURT JOLT
Time* for Board of Election
Commissioners to - Cancel
All Illegal Begistrations
A high-handed aoheme of the Election
Commissioners of San Francisco to be
wilder voters by the use of misleading
and false 'designations on the official bal
lot Is foiled by a writ of mandate from
the Supreme Court of California. The
decision of the highest Judicial tribunal
In the Stats clears thÂ© political atmos
phere â¢ and convinces the people that
their right to a free and fair expression
of Judgment through the election fran
chise cannot be denied at the dictation
of Ruef. ' â¢
Apart from the decision of the court
there is some assurance tnat the reign of
folly and lawlessness In the Board of
Election Commissioners Is nearing the
end. There is hope that the board will
do its duty and cancel on the register
the names of thousanhs or men who are
not at present in the city and who would
not be entitled to vote in the precincts
wherein they are registered If they were
here. v
Hundreds of men who are on the reg
ister as dwellers in lodging houses of the
Twenty-eighth. Twenty-ninth, Forty
third. Forty-fourth and Forty-flfth As
sembly districts are not here. The pro
prietors of the houses know nothing of
the whereabouts of these men. The posi
tive information is derived that the men
do not live at the places from which
they are registered.
The fair v-eal on the official ballot, which
all good citizens hoped for, is guaran
teed by the decision of the Supreme
Court. In order to make the command.,
so clear that Jio one can mistake its
meaning, the court designates the col
umn on the face of the machine in which
the ticket of each of the four party con
ventions shall be placed.
The Republican party, having cast the
largest vote at the last election for Gov
ernor. get 3 the top column. The Demo
cratic party gets second place, the So
cialist third and the Union Labor fourth,
as the law provides. The Socialist party
in the election of 1902 cast 9502 votes for
its candidate for Governor. The Union
Labor party had no ticket in the field.
There are no independent candidates in
this .municipal contest. Every candidate
before the people la the nominee of. a
regular party convention. Column as
signment to independents is not permitted
by the decision of the, court, as the peti
tioners for independent columns â¢ peti
tioned in behalf of candidates who were
entitled to a place on the /ballot as the
nominees of. a , regular party convention.
In trickery and Juggling Ruef is an ex
pert. No doubt he expected to confuse
several thousand voters by the independ
ent designations, and by unfair mean 3
divert to his candidate. Schmltz. many a,
vote intended for Partridge. The Supreme
Court was not fooled by ponderous coun
sel for the Election Board. It cast aside
the sophistry and saw the plain truth of
the proposition.
Ruef was a loser in the primary elec
tion. He was a loser in a desperate game
to prevent coalition of Republican and
Democratic forces. He lost his head at
the Alhambra Theater when he advised
the murder of newspaper men. He was
a loser in the Supreme Court yesterday,
and he will be a loser in the election on
November 7. This Is Ruef's year to lose.
Wage earners of the building trades
say the "hoodoo" is P. H. McCarthy.
Word comes from the inside of the Union
Labor camp that "Eugene IS scared." .
The United Garment Workers* Union
No. 131, at a regular meeting Thursday,
night, voted to rescind its previously
adopted indorsement of E. E; Schmltz's
candidacy for Mayor. Walter Macar
thur, State organizer of the American
Federation of Labor, explained that the
constitution of the Garment Workers for
bids all of Its affiliated unions from in
dorsing the political aspirations of any
candidate. .The motion to rescind was
carried by a vote of 86 to 26.

LEAVES HER HOME
AS IF DEMENTED
Oakland Matron Steals Away
and Plunges Family in
Deep Sorrow.
BERKELEY, Oct. 27. â From her
beautiful home at 2!*lS Telegraph ave
nue Mrs. J. T. Coughlin stepped into
the wide outer world last evening,
creating a mystery in her disappear
ance and leaving behind to add to her
family's distress a pathetic note, indi
cating- her purpose to commit suicide.
Pinned to the <loor of her room was
found last nlgrht a paper containing
tljÂ«se words: "1 could lie down like a
tired hind end breathe away this life of
care, which I have borne and still must
bear."
The note was found by H. A. Smith,
Â£ son of Mrs. Coughlin, when ne came
to visit his mother last evening. Mr.
Coughlin, an employe of the Sunset
Press Printing Company of San Fran
cisco. was> notified and search was com
menced at once for. the missing' woman.
The police aided in the hunt and those
enlisted eptnt most of the night look
ing: in the bills back of Berkeley and
tlcnj?- the water front for traces of Mrs.
Coughlin. They were not successful.
JJts. Coughlin is a woman of 49,
handsome in a matronly way. Her
daughter. Hasel Smith, was married
two week* ago to Walter Aborn and
had just returned from the honeymoon.
The excitement of the wedding prepar
ations and the depression that fol
lowed, it is thought, may have pro
duced an * effect upon the mother's
overwrought nerve? so that she lost
her mind temporarily and planned to
either leave the country or commit sui
eidf.

GIRL ASSAILED.
BY A STRANGER
Unknown Man Makes Attack
on the Daughter of Berke
ley Real Estate Operator
BERKELEY, Oct. 27. â In a lonely
spot in N'ortb Berkeley, close to the
bridge that spans Cordon ices Creek, an
unknown man last night choked Mary
Quackenbush, a 14-year-old, girl, until
her screams for help frightened him
and drove him to flight. On escaping
the villain's clutches the girl ran to
the home of C. A. Poole at 1426 Spruce
street, and, falling to the floor, cried
that she had been attacked by a
stranger. Then she fainted. Her
father, S. 6. Quackenbush, a real estate
operator of Berkeley, ; residing at Ox
ford and Eunice streets, was notified,
and, with several neighbors, began a
search for the ruffian. The hunt was
unsuccessful.
The assailant was later described by
Miss Quackenbush- as being about 30
years old, smooth-shaven, short, stout,
vrith pug nose, curly hair and wearing
a black derby hat.
Miss Quackenbush was returning
from a neighbor's home about 9 o'clock,
when the strange man, "coming from
the rear, attacked her. clasping her by
the throat and scattering the few
bundles she carried. Her struggles did
not avail to release her, but when she
was able to scream the man apparently
became frightened and let 'her go.

Grovenior Pardee Replies to
Mayor r; MqttV Inquiries
Concerning ; the Guarding
of Rights in Water Area
IMPROVEMENTS TO
BE OF PUBLIC -USE
Executive- Suggests That No
Injury Will :â¢: Begone the
State's Claim if Railroad
Is Permitted to Finish
The improvements in progress by the
Southern Pacific Company at the broad
gauge mole at Oakland have been the
subject of correspondence between Mayor
Frank K. Mott of Oakland and Governor
George C. Pardee, with relation to the
rights of the State in the water-covered
area that has been Inclosed by the com
pany. In , a letter of date October 16
Mayor Mott urged that while the im
provements were necessary and would be
of great benefit. by providing greater fa
cilities for travel, the Interests of the
State should be 'guarded and conserved.
Governor Pardee has replied to Mayor
Mott and has pointed out that there is
no existing law. by -which the company
can procure a title to this area from the
State. ; The Governor believes it would
be better for public Interest to permit
the company to .complete Its important
improvements,, and to compel legislative
action to meet the conditions. Excerpts
from the Governor's reply follow:
I beg to. acknowledge receipt of your letter
of October It;, in which you say. In reference
to the broadening of the Southern Paclfio mole
and the addition of one or more ferry-flips:
"By all. means, give them every opportunity
to provide proper accommodations and conve
niences for their ever-increasing travel and
business." This answers my question whether
you considered the improvement which the
Southern. Pacific -.'Company, is now making
would be ot advantage to the city of Oakland
and to the public jceneraUy. You then add:
"But In doing. this our first thought should be
to make sure that the Interests ot the Deoole
and the State are being completely and legally
conserved. The paiticular point 1 want 'to
present for your consideration is whether the
Southern Paelnc Company, or any other cor
poration, ha* the right to appropriate tÂ« its
perpetual use any given area ot the State s
land â no matter where situated or whether
covered with' water or, not â without first se
curing permission from the State by eith-er
buying the land outrluht or leasing the same
from the State for a definite . period of years.
I cannot help thinkinc that thÂ« Southern
Pacific Company should eltbtr buy or lease
from the State the land they propose to ap
propriate." â¢;' - ... . \u25a0
AGREES WITH MAYOR MOTT.
. I see little or nothing to dissent from In Jhe
above language quoted from your letter, and
with the closing sentence 1 cordially concur.
Not 'only the Southern- Pacific, but every other
transportation company which- desires to oc
cupy, in the legitimate transaction of its
business, a reasonable urea, of the State's sub
mersed land, should buy or lease that land.
But the trouble is that at the present time
there is no authority of law by which such a
corporation can do either. No State olficer
or board can cell or lease such land, and none
has any power to fix the price or the rental.
My authority for this statement Is that of.thft
Attorney General of California, J.o whom,
soon after I took the office of Governor, I sub
mitted all of these question?. In a lengthy
and comprehensive opinion the Attorney Gen
eral discussed them, and the gist of his con
clusions was as I have stated. This will be
made clear by the following quotation from
the opinion referred to:
. "The result of all this seems to be that there
is no precedure laid down In the code* of Cali
fornia by which a railroad corporation . may
acquire a right of way for the location and
maintenancse of. roadbeds, tracks, wharves,
piers, slips or terminal facilities over sub
merged lands beyond the corporate limits of
the city -of Oakland, which limits are the or
dinary low-tide line, and that the only method
left for such a corporation to pursue, is to ob
taln'a special grant from the Legislature.
LEGISLATION IS SEEDED.
A' reading of this opinion made very appar
ent the necessity of general legislation in or
der to provide some lawful means by which
transportation companies may acquire needed
rights or way and also to vest in some State
officer or board the power to restrict within
proper bounds the occupation for this purpose
of State lands, and aUo to fix the price of
gale. If the lands are to be sold, or to deter
mine the rental, it they are to be rented. To
bring the matter properly before ,the Legisla
ture, I devoted a chapter in my biennial mes
sage to the subject . of public policy In re
spect to water fronts. The hope that legis
lation would. "of the last eesision of the Legis
lature, be enacted along these lines was not
realised, and the whole matter remains in a
state as chaotic as ever, with no lawful au
thority vested in any one to decide upon- what
terms and conditions the State's submerged
lands may be occupied b>* railroads and other
corporations, or by Individuals. . -
Cnder these circumstances, there seem to be
but two'XouMea which can be pursued by the
State with reference to the improvments be
fore mentioned which are being made by tht
Southern Pacific Company. It can either per
mit the improvements to proceed for the time
being, trusting to effect a fair adjustment of
the respective rights of the State and the cor
poration after the necessary legislation is had,
or it can exercise the powers it possesses to
etop the Improvements * and compel the com
pany to give up the land which it has occu
pied. If the State should decide^ to follow,
the latter course. It could, according to thÂ«
Attorney General, proceed In any one of
three waysâ it could bring a suit for â¢ eject
ment; It could obtain a mandatory injunction
to have the wharf removed,' if it obstructs com
merce, or it could commence an action to quiet
title. Whichever one of these wemedles should
be employed, > the making of an improvement
which I understand you ito hold ; is desirable
and even necessary ; would be stopped at least
a year or two, and longer if . the Legislature
Should fall, to act at its next session. .
IMPROVEMENT A; BENEFIT.
/On the other, hand,. It' the >" Improvement : Is
permitted to no on, the public will the sooner
enjoy the Improved service made possible by
better facilities and , the substantial rights of
the State will bÂ« in no serious danger of being
lost, because, assuming -that the Legislature
\u25a0will before long doits duty, the occupation of
the land by sufferance within the statutory ten
year* will not have established any such title
in the I company â¢as can defeat I the State's
claim to compensation. YoÂ»i \ will
of course. : that . in all of /this I refer only to
the occupation of 'such limited portions of
lanl as transportation companies can; actually
use and really,, need In the transaction of their
legitimate - business ' and . not' to the attempted
seliure <of large areas for .\u25a0;..\u25a0 speculative or
monopolistic purposes. That the 1 latter should
be *urev*nted in the public Interest is; self
evident. 7ln this connection- 1 might .mention
that one of the questions : I referred^ to- tha
Attorney General was whether the mere filling
in with dredgings of State land would estab
lish a title in* the persona who did the filling',
to which question the Attorney .General, repled
that a title to - overflowed lands t could not be
created lln this way.
Thsse t-emarke apply/equally as: well* to other
corporations which. : like; the Southern ; Pacific,
have \u25a0 erected structures upon * submerged ' land
owned .by the V State â¢: Without '; having ,. \u25a0: secured
the consent. of -the; Legislature- t*> : - do^so.v The
moat notable example is that of the San Fran
cisco. Oakland and - Ban Jose - Railroad -; Com
pany.; eometlmes known as ( the \u25a0 "Key i Route.'.!
I suppose ' no . citizen â¢of Oakland would v pro
poÂ«Â« .to eject that ' company from the - posses
â¢lon of UÂ« \u25a0 deep-water \u25a0 terminals \u25a0 and thereby
bring its business to a standstill. And yet it
has placed those â¢terminals -on State * property.
Just aÂ« ' the : Southern j Pacific â¢ is " now s doing. :y-.;
:.:.' The > correct Â» eolution \u25a0 of . the : whole ! matter /is
an act ' or acts ' of the-? Legislature making good
the ' remarkable omissions in ; the - present I laws.

Because of the late upheavals In the lit

ulous personages about the campus, might
possibly include their names in the next

Collides With the Steam
Schooner Aurelia and Near

AMERICA MARU SAILS
Japanese Liner Is Saluted
as She Goes to Sea by
the Russian Cruiser Lena
Compared with the liner Mongolia the
Steamship Uxnatllla Is a vessel of modest
dimension, but when the Umatilla backed
into the steam schooner Aurelia yester
day morning during a thick fog she looked
like a marine monster, and what she
didn't do to the Aurelia Is hardly worth
chronicling. The Aurelia, with 650.000 feet
of lumber, was coming in from Portland
and was passing Broadway wharf at 11:30
a. m. when the steamship UmatiUa, bound
for Puget Sound, was backing away from
her berth.
When the Umatilla was about 100 feet
from the wharf and going full speed
estern, Captain Nopanaer, on the Uma
lilla's bridge, sighted the Aurelia as she
emerged from the fog. The Umatilla's
two whistles were answered by two
\u25a0whistles from the Aurelia, Cut it was too
late to avoid a collision.
The Umatilla's stern struck the Aurelia
en the starboard side. Or all the dam
age done the most serious for the time
â¢was the bursting of the Aurelia's main
eteam pipe. The engine room was filled
with hissing steam, and how the three
men on duty there escaped being scalded
to death is a mystery.
In the engine room were: Chief En
gineer McGregor, Fireman B. Timmins
end Ed Smith, the Aurelia's cook. Before
leaving their post Timmins and McGregor
drew the Aurelia's fires. The three men
were scalded, but not seriously.
The Aurelia's bulwark on the starboard
Bide was carried away for forty feet with
the rail and planking. Six stanchions
were smashed and the deck houses were
shoved over to port. The Aurelia's hull
\u25a0was strained, the seams were opened and
the schooner began to leak.
FivÂ© of the Umatilla's plates were
dented, but the steamship suffered no
material harm and was able to proceed to
sea. Captain Nopander of the Umatilla
bears a good reputation for carefulness.
Tht Aurelia was commanded by Cap
tain Erickson. The vessel is owned by
tho Russell & Rogers Company of this
city.
A heavy fog hung over the bay nearly
ell day and on all the ferries the boats
ran but once an hour.
America Mara Sail*.
The Japanese liner America Ms.ru, Captain
P. H. Going, sailed at 1 o'clock yesterday for
the Orient. Soon after leaving the Paciftv
ilÂ£ll Wharf thr- America passed the Russian
cruiser Lena, lying at anchor, and the lately
reecnciled participants in a bloody war dipped
ensigns in mutual salutation.
The America looked mort like a yacht than a
merchantman heavily laocu with cargo. She
was so trimmed that the ;:. showed to full
advantage. Her while paint glistened In the
eun and her brasswork was polished like a
country schoolboy's morning face. She made a
pretty departure from the wharf and looked
every inch an ocean greyaound as she glided
with ev<r increasing pace down the bay toward
the Golden Gate.
The America carried IS cabin pass&nrera, 13S
Japanese and 3S Chinese.
Among thfi passengers was Ignacie Altamlra,
Charge d'ASaires" for Mexico to the court of
Peking. He wae accompanied by his son.
â¢ The cabin passengers were:
For Yokohama â T. R. Newton.
Nagasaki â T. Kuiroka.
Shanghai â Mrs. C. M. Goode, George P.
Codsey, Mrs. George P. Godsey, Ignacio Alta

Montague, William C. isrodenstein, Fred E.
Chester. G. Brockir.ann, Mre. C. L. Rion, W.
Lavj. W. Schuchner, Mrs. S. La Grave.
Lena Look* Like a Warship.
For tfÂ»e first time Einee she ran away from
the Japanese and Bought refuge in this harbor
the Russian cruiser Lena looks like a smart
warship. She is now lying at anchor off the
army transport wharf. Newly painted and
"with her brasswork and guns brightly polished
{â¢he floats as proudly as any victor and is an
ebject lesson of the truth of the old adage
which holds out to the man or chip that runs
away the prospect of future usefulness in the
fighting line. Had she stayed to fight she
might have been taking part in the Japanese
r.aval maneuver? as one of the Mikado's cruis
ers. As It Is, the is flying the flag of the Czar
Â«md is in commission as a full fledged fighting
Fhlp without a battle-scar to mar the yacht
like beauty of her lines. She ia taking on a
supply at ccal and j probaWy on Sunday will
call for Vladivostok.

COLLINS MAKES
BITTER FIGHT
Accused Attorney Objects
.to Judge Lennon and De
nounces Lawlor Savagely
SOME TOEEID REPARTEE
Accused and Hiram John
soiL Engage in Skirmish
and Court Is IMignant
With a smile on his face and a joy
ous gllritof battle in his eyes, George
D. Collins began to fight his case In
earnest before Judge ' Lennon yester
day. The skirmish was full of ex
citement and surprises.
First Collins introduced three more
lawyers who would act with him â -At
torneys McPike, Morehouse and Frank
Murphy. Then .he read an - affidavit
charging Judge Lennon- with bias and
prejudice, .introducing â¢, a . letter ,. in
which .h,e charged Judge ' Lawlor with
being an /adjunct of the District At
torney's office. He concluded by insfn
uating that ' he -would charge Hiram
Johnson with perjury, and engaged in
a game, of caustic repartee' with that
gentleman until sternly ' reprimanded
by the court. ; District Attorney By
ington moved that" ball -be. 'raised to
J40.00Q,' which was^enled. â¢
Fight was, In/Colllns' every utter
ance and in his entire 'attitude. His
smile indicated complete, confidence
that he could easily tear aside : the
meshes that are being thrown around
him. Why he introduced additional
counsel was not apparent yesterday.'
He conducted his own case. The
courtroom was packed with attorneys
curious to learn how this man could
win -what seems to. them a fight
against Invincible odds. -After intro-.
ducing his additional counsel Collins
objected to the case being tried . by
Judge Lennon on- the ' following
grounds: - \u25a0 :\u25a0 : ,'..â¢ â¢ >'
That as affiant cannot .have a fair and^lm-'
partial trial before said Judee^Lrfiwlor, neitnei
can be have, a -fair and Impartial, nor a fall
or impartial- trial- before thÂ£ Hon.-"Thomaa
Lennon. the said appointee and choice of said
Judge Lawlor. .Affiant says that said Judge
Lennon is prejudiced \u25a0 and biased against af
fiant and that, by reason of said prejudice -an-1
bias affiant cannot have a fair and impartial,
nor a fair or impartial trial, : or other hearing
before the said Judge Lennon.
-WANTS ANOTHER JUDGE.
That the Hon. Thomas -Lennon is not a JudsÂ«
of the Superior Court-In and for the said city
and county of San Francisco, that there- are
Judges of the said Superior Court who arc
entirely fair and â¢ impartial *nd who are able
to try said action in said Superior Court; 10
hear and determine fairly \ and Impartia!l>
every proceeding therein, and by express re
quirement of section 170 of the said Code of
Civil Procedure the said action can only Oe
transferred to another department of said Su
perior Court and cannot be heard nor can any
proceedings . therein be heard, tay a Judge of
another countr. \u25a0-. - : .
Affiant further says that either -the sala
Judge Lawlor or the said Judge Lennon in
order to further oppress and Injure the said
affiant caused . a certain warrant of -attacn
ment to issue for the oppression of affiant's
wife and hpr mother upon a charge of con
tempt of court In falling to appear as wit
nesses in said action, and said warrant was>
issued without any preceding affidavit to show
any contempt,, and as affiant Is informed,
and verily believes, no bail was Indorsed upon
said warrant. That said warrant was returned
unserved by the officer to whom the. same
was given and was filed with such return in
dorsed upon it, and thereafter- at t the Instance
of the said"' Judge . Lawlor. or the said Judgi.
Lennon,' was takeii from said flies and aftei
it had become funtus offlclo and again placed
in the hands of a police officer for service.
All .of which- is rank despotism and a gross
abuse'of -authority and a palpable and flagrant
violation' or > the cdnstltution of the State ot
California. And", having nothing, but oppres
sion and unlawful violation ot liberty for ltt
purpose, and expressive of the Intensity of the
malice and hatred and venom and prejudice
existing against this affiant. â¢ T ;'; j
BITTER AGAIXST LAWLOR.
In his affidavit vColUns Introduced
the following letter, which he wrote
to Judge Lav.-lor from Victoria under
date of October 10: "
Sir: As I recollect It, I wrote you on ths 22d
ult., and have not been extended -even the
courtesy of even a reply. I suppose \u25a0 this
is due "to your personal animosity toward me.
as well as your sympathy with my, enemies.
Indeed, your zeal and extraordinary uctlvlty
in aid of the persecution and to the great dis
credit of a' fair and impartial judiciary will
amply explain your attitude. Instead of re
maining here and securing my discharge, "to
which I . am entitled." on the first of next
month, I will at ence arrange. for my return
to San Francisco, to the end that my enemies,

Dinner, x
ST. PAUL, Oct. 27.â President Roose
velt's forty-seventh birthday was cele
brated in St. Paul by the "Original Roose
velt Club" .to-r.isht through the medium
of a banquet in the large dining-room of
the Ryan Hotel, at which over 400 cov
ers- were laid for enthusiastic admirers
of President Roosevelt, who, in the lan
guage of Governor Cummins, was in more
senses than one "the man' of the hour."
President A. B. Stickney of the Great
Western Railway, who was assigned to
the topic of "The President and the Rail
roads," said:
ThÂ« ingenuity which Js now exercised by both
railways and their customers to maintain thtÂ» .
secrecy of rebates can Be illustrated better
than described. Since the Injunctions were is
sued I have been told, I do not vouch for Its |
truth, although I have seen what purports to j
be a copy of the contract between shippere and i
the routing agent, of cases where - young men j
from so-called routing agencies in New York i
make periodical trips through the Western
cities, leaving not bank checks, but packages j
of actual money, without note or comment, j
upon certain merchants* desks, taking ,no j
voucher â¢'â¢r receipt. Curiously, when thes*
packages are , counted they ure . found to be
exactly ia certain percentage, supposed to be 25
per cent of the amount or freight which such
merchants have paid a certain railway com
pany since the fast previous visit of the young
man. who thus distributes hundreds of thou
sands of dollars annually.
. In twenty years, possibly In ten years, there
will be few If any competitive railways, and It
thereby': becomes Important while we can to
establish these correct punciples In law.
Experience has proven that no commission
cair be a disinterested board of arbitration,
while at the same time -It is engaged In the
prosecution of the case at bar. Hence If the
recommendation of the President le adopted
the arbitration committee appointed for the
purpose of arbitrating disputes in respect to
rates should not.be charged with the executive
duty of enforcing the provisions of the law or
of their own decisions.
' Mr. Chairman never before have the Ameri
can people had a ' Roosevelt for a President.
Never before has a' President, In season and
out of season, in official documents and' from
the stump, so courageously stood for the square
deal.-
Governor Cummins of lowa received
cheers when he rose to speak on "The
President and ' the Tariff.'' Governor
Cummins said in part:
â¢ Therp is a benumbing spirit which seems to
be fascinating: some of the members of .our
party and ." that has found expression In the
phraseology of ' the gamblerâ r'-'Stand pat." I
predict that if the party meet* disaster \u25a0 and i
downfall there: will be floating over Its re-!
treating columns this miserable maxim, j
"Stand pat." â¢ If it Is ; victorious and trlum- j
"An . absolute nobody, an empty barrel is
always found to make the most noise."
: And 'i the caustic exchange of repartee
went: on until Judge Lennon interposed :
sharply.: /*\u25a0:'-'
/\u25a0"Mr. Collins,", said the court,- "I .must
insist \u25a0 that ; during . the trial , of this : case

\posed Collins iwith a halt. sneer. â¢

JOHN McN'AUGHT Manager
S PUBLICATION' OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAX FRANCISCO
SATURDAY ............'. OCTOBER 28, 1905
THE MAYOR'S PLEA.
npHE administration organs still harp about the clergymen of
I the city because they utter their opinion adverse to the Mayor.
But whose fault is it that they oppose the Mayor? At the
beginning of his first term he appeared before the association of
clergymen in this city and delivered a prospectus of his coming ad
ministration. It was entirely at one with their views. It repre
sented their opinions so exactly that they unanimously indorsed
him and promised their support. Was that "going into politics?"
Did that move the Mayor's organs to attack the preachers? No.
The organs were ecstatic over the support of the Mayor by the
preachers, and it seemed as if he proposed an immediate golden age
by the Golden Gate.
Now who has changed, the clergymen or the Mayor? Evidently
they have not, for they utter the same views about the morality of
local government which they held then. It is something more than
an impeachment of their consistency to say that they oppose the
Mayor for keeping his. promise to them. They declare that he has
broken every promise which he voluntarily made. They cite cases
oh him. They tell what pledges he violated and how. None of the
Mayor's followers deny a single citation. There is his i prospectus
and alongside of it his performance.
We do not believe that the Mayor himself will say that he car
ried out his prospectus and kept his promise voluntarily made to
the clergymen's association. We do not believe that he will dare
to specifically deny the justice of their arraignment of his admin
istration. He contents himself with a general plea of "not guilty,"
and demands re-election now, not on the score of the promises made
to the preachers, but because he conceives that he is necessary to
prevent laboring men resorting to violence and making war in the
streets. But does the Mayor think there is more danger of such
violence now than when he made his promise to the preachers?
He did not talk to them about civil disorders and lawlessness,
but about morality and decency in the city government, and they
indorsed him with feeling and sincerity. He now asks them and
the people to throw public and official morality and decency to the
winds, because the city is in danger of bloodshed which only, he'
can avert!
His plea of not guilty is not accepted by the gentlemen to whom
he broke his promise. They submit evidence in particular and de
tail of his guilt, and call upon the people to convict him. They have
not changed. He has changed, and why? He has changed because
evil communications corrupt good manners. His official association
has been, unfortunately, with the dangerous elements of society,
with the beasts of prey, which have their lairs in great cities. Under
the irmnunity they have enjoyed during his administration their
number has enormously increased. They have votes and control
votes. He has counted noses and finds them more numerous than
the preachers, and therefore more useful to him in politics.
He minimizes the influence of the clergy, and conceives that it
goes no further than their own votes. If this calculation is correct,
he is safe. But is it correct? Were only the clergy interested in
the promises made by the Mayor, at the beginning of his first term?
We think not. The Mayor did not think so then or his prospectus
would not have been issued. He believed then that a majority of
the people agreed with the clergymen that a city should be made
morally and physically clean through its government.
Since then he has been surrounded by the courtiers of vice and
graft. He has grown inflated with his own importance and so
reliant on the evil forces of society that he feels safe in defying all
that makes for uprightness in civic life. If what he promised to
the clergymen were' necessary then, how much more necessary is it
now! The record is made under his two administrations. Every
observer of conditions notes the multiplication of the causes of civic
decay and disorder. Yet he tells the people that if the promises he
made to the clergy are kept by some one else,, there will be war and
bloodshed in the streets! â¢
What he relies upon for re-election may be judged by the
pjaces all over the city which display his banners. The legend on
them under his portrait, borrowed from the advertisement of a brand
of ham. announces him as "Our choice." Does he pretend that if
he had kept his promise to the clergymen he would Have been under
the ham sign in the places where it is displayed? We are not dis
cussing the matter and the wisdom of his promise. He made it,
and was under no compulsion to. do so. Wise or unwise, it was
liis promise, his covenant entered into with the men whom he has
deceived. If he did not intend to keep it, why did he make it? If
he. found keeping it inexpedient, why does he not admit that he
broke it and tell why?
Mr. Partridge is making the same promises, but to the whole
people. They have faith in him and will elect him, in the belief that
re will make his word good. $ut the Mayor and Mr. Ruef savagely
attack Mr. Partridge for promising to do just what the Mayor prom
ised to do, and did not do.
THE INDORSEMENT CONVENTION.
WHAT'S in a name? is a query that might be well put in re
gard to the appearance or pretense -that there are two con
ventions in Chicago, both claiming the name of the Interstate
Commerce Law Convention. The accredited delegates to that'con
vention have split so far apart that they are occupying different
lialls, and the doorkeepers of one will not recognize the members
of the other to the extent of allowing admission. Now although
technically the assembly takes the broad name of Interstate Com
merce Law Convention, the real truth of the matter is that virtually
the name of the one true and only authorized assembly is the In
dorsement Convention. A recognition of that fact "settles the dis
pute at once to all fair minds. There is only one convention, and
.call it by any other name you please, it is a convention explicitly
called to indorse the President's railroad policy, and the smell of
it is sweet.
. If there had been any ambiguous lack of explicitness in the
call of the convention and the accredited delegates who are making
their clamorous opposition to signing any pledge to support the
President's policy, then they would be undoubtedly right in demand
ing free opinion and free speech in a convention called to discuss
the interstate commerce law in all its phases ; but the" call made
plain its intent, and they have no just excuse for putting in their
plea for liberty of discussion. Their indignation is thinly plausible
only, and the vehemence of their expression of it is absurdly the
atrical. In that way, consider for instance the wild cry of Kiesel of
Qgden, as if he was being outraged of his rights and was screaming
his appeal to high heaven and to the people of, a great and liberty
loving republic: "1 will never surrender my rights as an American
citizen. * * * I will not sign away my birthright."
Do not bawl so. A man or a party which makes a sophistically
theatrical exclamation like that misuses passionately earnest assev
eration and solemn petition to great liberty to such an extent that it
is close of kin to blasphemy. The bawl is bogus. When either
individuals or parties violate the fitness of language and of sentiment
by making a superlative appeal upon some trifling or false occasion
the fact that they have done so weakens the force of any justly
moderate plea they might hereafter wish to make to the powers that
be. Certainly this country will not stand for the high-handed closure
of free discussion; but the question of giving the Interstate Com
merce Commission more power to regulate rates has been discussed
for weeks and months, and the Chicago convention was explicitly for
the crystallization of the opinions of that part of the nation which
favors the President's policy. That policy is so conservative that it
makes the badges distributed by the "rump" convention with the
legend; "Supervision not commercial revolution," sound also trick
ily theatrical and absurdly false.

Pretty Daughter of Mrs. T. C. Platt
Soon to Wed a Lawyer.
MIoS MARGAReT L.ULE bNOW.
NEW YORK and Washington are
much interested in the, an
nouncement by Senator and
Mrs. T. C. Platt .of the en
gagement of Mrs. Platt's daughter,
Miss Margaret Louise Snow, to Fran-
Thought It Easy.
The late Mayor Patrick A. Collins of
Boston liked to see a wife treated lib
erally and reasonably In tne matter of
household expenses. One day when a
committee of women called on him for a
subscription he told them a story about
a certain home missionary movement. In
this movement every participant was to
contribute a dollar that she had earned
herself by hard work. The night of the
collection of the dollars came, and various
stories were told of earning the. money.
One woman had shampooed hair, another
had baked doughnuts, another had se
cured newspaper subscriptions, and so on.
The chairman (who was Collins himself)
turned to a handsome woman in the front
row. â¢ -
"Now, madam, it is your turn," he said.
"How did you earn your dollar?"
"I got it from 'my husband," she an
swered. .
"Ohi" said he. r "From your husband?
There' was no hard work about that?"
' "You don't know my husband," she
said. ; . , â¢ : '\u25a0\u25a0
Fate of the Lamb.
At a dinner which George Harvey gave
in Nei' York in honor of Mr. Witte and
Baron Rosen a young Russian officer was
seated beside H. 11. Rogers. "I admire
your country," said the Russian, "be
cause it is so peaceful. Politicians, finan
ciers, the laboring classes, business men,
ministersâ all dwell amicably together,
one happy family."
Mr. Rogers laughed. "One happy fam
ily," he said. "Yes; such a happy fam
ily as P. T. Barnum, our great showman,
used to exhibit. This family consisted
of a lion, a tigeri a bear, a wolf, and a
lamb, all penned together in one cage."
" 'Remarkable,' I a visitor said one day
to Mr. Barnum. 'Remarkable, impres
sive, instructive. And how long have
these animals dwelt together in this
way?"
" 'Seven months,' Barnuni answered;
"but a lamb has occasionally to be re
newed.' "âNew. York Tribune.
The Violin.
It seems strange to think that. my violin
was once a tree, but I do not know what
else could have caught the music that lies
within it, waiting for the touch. It must
be centuries old, and through all those
years it was listening and learning, weav
ing in with Its growth the forest melodies
to sing to generations yet, unborn. .--;
Wind and wave and song of bird, crash
of thunder, drip of rain and mating" callâ
all of these are in the fiber my violin.
And the thousand notes of sea and storm,
the music of the waterfall and streamâ
what wonder that it is so nearly the hu
man voice! There must have been a love
story in that forest, for it sings love,
love" and only love, though I do not re
member of hearing it until I knew you.â

A New York "Hall of Fame," -
/~\ Where a gentlemanly usher dis
, played to him the same,
And when that fj man had gazed about
where earth s immortals .were.
He said. "Where's Edgar, Allen Poe? I
hear he made a stir."
"Hus-s-sh!" cried the/ usher.
him not! Too long he was ad
mired, .
But our bright judges found him out
and now he has been fired."
Oh, then that man did beat' his breast.
"I might have known," he cried,
"If New York critics got to work that
. Edgar must subside."
Then did the man gaze once again and
asked with bated breath,
"Where's Bryant, he whose genius
wrote the living 'Song of
Death?'" , â
yWhis-s-st:"- cried the usher, "mention
not thatiname within; this hall.
The Judges took a whack at him, and
Bryant took a fall."
"And Is. Holmes, too, expatriate?" the
visitor, inquired.
"You bet heis!" the usher said; "like
all the rest, he's fired." ':
"I catch your point," the visitor to
theEe few words replied;
''If 1 would find earth's truly great I'd
better look outside." '.
Then roamed that visitor about within
that sacred spot,
And saw some names he recognized and
some that he did not.
"Yet one thing still doth puzzle me,"
he said; "this hall is Fame's,
Bu^ thougn I find some names I've
seen, > where are the judges'
names?"
Then did that usher seek a post, where
long and loud laughed he, .;
And slapped his sides in merriment and
eke in wondrous glee.
"This is 'the Hall of Fame," he gasped,
"as I have said before;
But if you want- the Hall of Fools,
you'll find it just next door."
I know not well what meant that
wight by words he thus did state;'
But in that hall next door, I've heard,
the judges. cogitate.
FABLE OF THE OFFICE-SEEKER'S
KOSE. ,
"The record that I have made while
in office," said the Professional Poli
tician, who was again running lor the
same office, "Is as^ the beautiful rose,
which demonstrates by its bloom that
the soil in. which it is planted is good
and fertile."
Then did the People whom he ad
dressed immediately smell pt nis rose,
and after just one whiff they nearly
fell over backward.
"That Is the darnedest rose that ever
we smelled!" cried the People, as with
one voice.
"True," said the Professional Poli
tician, "but that is because I forgot
to fumigate it before presenting it to
you."
"But," remarked the People, "if you
want us to vote for this kind of a rose
you should change its breath."
â¢ "Alas!" responded the Professional
Politician, "I would if I could, but un
fortunately. I cannot, for that- is, the
sort of a rpse It is." -
."So: some of . the people are going to
hold their noses while rthey .vote for
the blossom, but others have concluded
taat no rose ever smelled in that way.
Moral â Before some office-seekers
present the rose of their record to the
people for investigation they should
have it fumigated.
SHE WAS IX A HURRY.
A woman came to my house and said she
t couldn't stay,
Remarked that she was hurried and
would have to haste away;
And so, as I'm sagacious, I took my rod
and line
And opined that I'd. go fishing, as the
day was looking fine.
And I stayed and I stayed till the sun
began to set;
Still I stayed and I stayed till the sky
had turned to Jet.
Then I took my rod and line, and I sought
my home once more â
Do you think the woman's flitted? She
was standing by the door,
Just to talk and to talk and to talk and
to talk,
And to talk and_ to talkâ then I took a
I little walk,
And when I. sought my couch at last, the
rest of sleep to
She was standing by the door and was
talking, talking yet.
I love the tribe of women, and have loved
it since a child.
But when one says that she's in haste I
want to be exiledâ
Not very far. but far enough; somewhere
\u25a0 in foreign.- lands; .
Perhaps to Madagascar or^the hot Sa
hara sandsâ
And when she lifts her alto voice to
\u25a0 say, "I cannot stay!",
I wonder where I'd better go to pass the
busy day.
Of course she goesâ l know she doesâ
exactly to the door; â¢
But there she stops to talk a bit, and
; then to talk some more;
To talk and talk and talk and talk and
talk and. talk and talkâ ,
There's not a thing beneath the sun that
can that torrent calk. -
Oh, yes, I love * the women, and I ever,
ever will,
But I hope for some approval when I say
I love them still.

MRS. TALBOT TELLS COURT OF
HER FINANCIAL NEEDS.
Indicates There Is Much Back of Divorce Suit
That Has Not Yet Beeii Revealed.
MRS. ANNIE D. TALBOT, WHO GAVE TESTIMONY YESTERDAY AS TO HER
FINANCIAL, NEEDS IN SUPPORT OF HER PETITION FOR $2500 A MONTH
MAINTENANCE PENDING ADJUDICATION OF HER DIVORCE SUIT.
Each day's progress of the hearing
of the action for maintenance insti
tuted by Mrs. Annie D. Talbot against
her millionaire husband. William H.
Talbot, gives further indication of the
general belief that back of the dis
ruption of the home of these people
there lies a story even an Inti
mation of which has not reached the
public True, the recital of the causes
of disagreement so far set forth con
tains brief mention of debates between
husband and wife that might even be
construed Into quarrels, but none of
these reached the point of severity suf
flcieht to Justify divorce, linked as the
parties are, by the ties . of marriage
and the affection of three children,
two handsome sons and a pretty
daughter. There Is yet much to be
told, but whether It ever' will be, is a
question for speculation, it being the
present purpose of counsel to confine
the dispute, so far as the proceedings
In court are concerned, to the narrow
est limits permissible for the purposes
of prosecution and the exigencies of
defense. -
However, one fact is evident, as
brought out by the testimony yester
day, and that is that tne breach be
tween Mr. and Mrs. Talbot ia widening
as the days pass. Asked as to whether
or not her present residence at the
family home Is agreeable to her. Mrs.
Talbot said, her tone denoting the bit
terness ehÂ« feels:
WAATS TO LEAVE HOME.
"I would rather not, remain at the
family home, as it is far from pleas
ant for me there. I would rather go
to some hotel. If I could have my chil
dren there, for then they would not
be taught to disobey me as they are
now being taught to do."
Later the information was given that
though they are litigating, Mr. ana
Mrs. Talbot are both dwelling at the
family home. Mrs. Talbot canes in her
boudoir and her husband in the dining
room. This condition of affairs is far
from pleasing to either of the litigants,
especially to Mrs. Talbot. who, saying
that she is weary of the unpleasant
situations the estrangement is respon
sible for, wishes to leave the family
home and in some hotel gather her
children about her where her affec
tions and desire to promote their wel
fare may be unrestrained.
The hearing again proceeded before
Judge Murasky on the order directing
Mr. Talbbt to show . cause why he
should not pay Mrs. Talbot $2600 a
month for her maintenance pending
the final adjudication of her action.
Mrs. Talbot, handsomely gowned in
heliotrope, a chinchilla cape thrown
over her shoulders, was called to the
stand. Defiance marked her attitude
and gave rise to the expression of the
belief that' when the case in chief
goes to trial she will tell a tale that
will Â£et society by the ears. The calm
and unperturbed attitude of Mr. Tal
bot, however, indicated that his con
science rests, in equanimity and that
fear of the developments of the future
has no hold upon him. The question
of Mrs. Talbot's finances was imme
diately taken ud. .
HAS * MOUTHY] OUT; DEPOSIT.
She testified that she now has on de
posit In various banks, two of them
here and one on Wall /street New-
York, something in the neighborhood
of $3000, this; sum -Including a check
for $200 received by her from the sale
of an Qldsmobile she had just disposed
of. Lying around her home were a

few more dollars, she said, perhaps 100,
but the bills that were due and unpaid
would require more funds to meet than
she could at present command. 1
Her grocery bill, her meat bill, the
demands of all the tradesmen, the
wages of, her four servants, a cook, a
maid, a butler and a "roustabout,"
were due. Then her children must be
clothed and they must be educated;
her wardrobe must be advanced with
the seasons and then in a large house
hold in which luxury has ever held
sway there are many Incidentals ex
penses that -cannot be foreseen,' but
that must be met.
"Well," interjected Attorney Jordan,
who represents Mr. Talbot, "how is it
that you have managed to save up the
sum that you have In. bank? Have you
been laying aside for the future, moneys
given you by your husband "to meet your
expenses?"
"It is sometimes necessary that wives
lay aside money for the future," an
swered Attorney Shortridge sarcastically,
"especially if they have miserly husbands
that grind them down to the bone?"
HUSBAND IS GENEROUS.
Jordan made no reply, but going ahead,
elicited from Mrs. Talbot the admission
that her husband has always been gener
ous and that even since she instituted
the action against him he has given. her
JSOO monthly, placing in her hands $200
of this sum and placing {GOO on deposit to
her credit every four weeks without var
iation. This admission gave rise to
further speculation among the auditors
as to what really has operated to sep
arate the Htigants, it being apparent that
there has never been a shortage of funds
in the Talbot home.
As to her demand for a lump sum of
$2500 to meet the expense of taking dep
ositions of hotel clerks and maids In New
York and St. Louis, Mrs. Talbot said that
she had specially in mind a Miss Duser,
who had been her nurse; the names of the
others she had forgotten.
"What do you expect these people to
testify to?'.' asked Attorney Jordan. :
"I expect them to- testify. to. the truth,"
answered Mrs. Talbot quickly.
"Verily t+iat is bo,"- answered Jordan,
"but what is this truth . for which you
seek?" ! .. 'â¢ "â¢" ' , â¢ Â« \u25a0'- '

PORTLAND, Oct. 27.â A large cougar
scared from the hills of South Portland
ia terrifying women and children and
causing the male residents to brighten up
long unused tirearms. ; Yesterday" while
workmen 'were blasting rock for county
road work the flying pieces hurled up the
hillside drove the cougar from his lair
and the animal, badly frightened, sprang
down toward the little suburb ft of . Ful
ton. Workmen seeing the animal gave
chase, but It escaped. Great excitement
was caused by the news that' tb,e animal
had been seen in the city limits arid chil
dren were kept indoors, while the moth
ers were afraid to venture from .their
yards. Men at night carried /lanterns,
and preparations are being made. for an
extensive cougar hunt. v '

SANTA ROSA, Oct. 27.â Miss Martha
C. Forsyth, daughter of the well
known pioneer, Bryant Forsyth, who
was married last Saturday In Alameda
to Mrs S. I. Grlggs, widow of the late
Joseoh Griggrs, : v. r as married the day
previous to her father's wedding In
far-away Nome to W. A. Miller, a promâ :

Forsyth left here about a month ago to
visit Alaska. Her brother, H. M. For
syth, received word that she had re
turned as far as Seattle en route home,
when she Vas recalled by a telegram
from Miller. The news of the mar
riage was received here to-day by her
brother. /

WHO IS LOCAL
TENNIS KINC?
"Kouiid Robin" Needed to
Decide the Issue Between
Season's Four Champions
LAST TOURNEY OF YEAH
Finals for Bay Counties
Doubles Trophy Will Be
Played in Park ToOlorrow
The tennis players will complete the
last championship event of the year
on the park courts to-morrow. The
completion of the doubles tournament
for the bay counties championship will
end the season. It is expected the
semi-Xinal match between Carl Gard
ner and Charles Dunlap and Stewart
Oayncss and G. Hall will be played this
afternoon. Gayness and Hall stand lit
tle or no chance to win.
In the iir.als to-morrow Charles Foley
and It. N. Whitney will meet the win
ners of to-tiay"s match. Gardner and
Dunlap disposed of two of the best
teams in the tournament, but despite
this fact a majority pick Whitney and
.Foley to carry off the honors. Gardner
and Dunlap have had but little, prac
tice together, brt botii know the game
v.tll. They defeated Murdock and
Griffin and the Baker brothers handiLy
and this entitles them to some consid
eration. Whichever team wins, the
lina.l match should prove a close and
Interesting one. It will consist of three
sets out of live and will begin at 2:30
o'clock.
Charles Foley"s victory over Percy
Murdock in the finals of the singles
tournament was as popular as it was
unexpected. Foley has always done
v. ell in practice, but previous to last
Sunday had never cut much of a figure
in tournament play. Four champion
ship tournaments have been played
during the year and a like number of
champions developed. This is the first
' year -in the history of tennis on the
coast that one or two players have not
outclassed the rest and proved their
"superiority. Will Taylor for years was
Uie undefeated champion. His place
was taken by George Whitney, who
. -outclassed everybody on the coast but
tue Hardy brothers. Bell, Freeman and
MacGavin in the last three years were
at the top of the heap. The players
. this year do not class with those just
* mentioned, but they are a promising
â¢. lot of youngsters. Adams, Janes, Foley,
Gardner and Griffin all have bright
lutures. f
.A tournament that would prove the
most interesting of the year would be
c round robin between the four cham
pions â Janes, Adams, Foley and Gard
. ner. An event of this kind would
eliminate the element of luck. Let
. c-ach champion meet the other three
â¢' and the one scoring the most victories
â¢will surely be coosidered the cleverest
of the four. Gardner won the San
Francisco championship from Percy
Murdock in May; Fred Adams won ti:v
State championship in July; Janes jin
nexed the coast championship â ihe
highest honors of the year â in Septem
ber, and last Sunday Foley won the
bay counties championship. The last
three titles were held by J. D. Mac-
Gavin in 1904. The doubles champion
ship of the coast was won by Sinsa
bough and Braly.
Beals Wright, the national champion,
5s expected here next month on a busi
ness trip. Wright will probably play
In exhibition matches on the park and
California Club courts. The local play
â¢ ers would be outclassed by the cham
pion, except Sumner Hardy, who would
prove a hard man for him to beat.
Hardy is somewhat' out of practice, but
rould get into shape on short notice.
Six years ago Hardy defeated Wright
easily at Del Monte. The latter has
improved since then, while Hardy has
not. Hardy is easily the best player
In the city to-day and would make by
far the best showing against Wright.
On the park courts to-day the young
ladies will hold a draw doubles tourna
ment. The entry list is unusually
small, only four teams being in the
competition.
On the California Club courts to-mor
row the first of a series of handicap
. singles tournaments will be played.
The directors have put up a silver lov
ing cup to be won three times. All of
the club cracks have entered and each
one is anxious to have his name sub
scribed first on the trophy.
The Claremont Country Club is mak
ing arrangements for an invitation
scratch doubles tournament to be
played on the club courts next Satur
day and Sunday. Many local players
1 have been invited to participate.

So far no date has been set for the
play-off of the tie that resulted In the
36-hole home-and-home match between
teams representing the San Rafael Golf
i..ub and the Menlo Golf and Country
Club. It was proposed to go down to
Del Monte to-day and play it off to
morrow, but some of the players say
they cannot spare the time 'necessary
for the trip. The Ingleside. course of
the San Francisco Golf and Country
Club is hardly ready yet, but will im
â¢ prove rapidly after the first rains.
P. W. Selby/ captain of the Mcnlo
Golf and Country Club, is trying to in
duce the teams to go to Del Monte next
Saturday and hopes to be successful in
his efforts. The Del Monte greens are
always kept In perfect condition and
the course is a most Interesting one.
On Sundays a private car for mem

bers of the San Francisco Golf and

Tickets, costing 25 cents for the round
trip, may be obtained by writing or

whiph is being developed at Stanford.
The game on California field with Ore

the critical expertsâ and their name Is

California's strength, and the contest

Corinthian dinner will be served on the
piazza about 7 o'clock this evening and
shortly afterward the members will ad
journ to the main hall, -where a vaude
ville entertainment* prepared by J. V.
O'Brien and the jinks committee will
be given. Among the entertainers will
be Oscar Franks, D. McLaughlin, Frank
Thompson, Charlie Hay, M. J.'Hynes, T.
Hickey, "Kid" Nelson, Fox and Harris,
the Bohemian quartet, Sam Hall, Eddie
Angelo and other favorites.
To-morro\r morning the fleet will
follow Commodore T. Jennings on the
last cruise of the season. At the tide
floods until 11:38 a. m. at Fort Point,
being one of the highest .tides of the
season (6.1 feet), it serves well for a
run to the upper bay. If there is
breeze enough, however, it is likely
that the fleet will cruise over to the
city front, that being the usual practice
on closing day. .
At the closing jinks of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club last Saturday night,
Commodore W. G. Morrow received a
handsome solid silver cigar-box, hav
ing the club pennant and the commo
dore's flag enameled in colors on the
lid and the initials "W. G. M." In raised
silver monogram letters. A. J. Treat,
in making the presentation, referred to
the energetic work done by W. G. Mor
row for the club during the past two
seasons as commodore. R. G. A. Muel
ler, who has been financial secretary
for the past three years, received a
handsome gold watch chain and locket,
engraved with the monogram "A. G. A.
M.," the letters S. F. Y. C. and the date.
The California Yacht Club did not
hold any jinks at the clubhouse to cele
brate the conclusion of the. season, but
last Saturday night the fleet cruised to
a point on the mainland opposite to
Sheep Island, where an informal jinks
was enjoyed. Last Sunday clam chow
der was served on the beach.
At the last quarterly meeting of the
California Yacht Club the question of
building a clubhouse on the foundation
already constructed near . the Key
Route pier was discussed. The matter
is in the hands of the California. Yacht
Club Building Association, which is said
to. have about $3000 In hand. It is
earnestly hoped that the Oakland Creek
yachtsmen may ' have new quarters
ready for use at the opening of the next
yachting season.
:T: T Several of the . yachts of the San
Francisco: fleet will belaid up for the
winter in Corte Madera Creek, where
the sloop Phoenicia is already moored.
The Queen and others , will probably
cruise to their winter quarters to-mor
row. 'Though Sunday, November 12," is
set. : down \ as ' the date for raising" the
drawbridge at Tiburon, it is doubtful
whether any of the pleasure craft will
be taken into the lagoon this year.
Since the new bulkheads were built the
tide runs so strongly into and out of
the lagoon that it is scarcely practi
cable to take yachts in or out.
.: The Oakland Canoe Club will end Us
season ' to-morrow, but â¢no entertain
ment will mark the closing*. The club
may be < obliged to move . its quarters
fifty, to seventy-five feet back from the
present location on account of the Im
provements to be. made in Sessions
Basin. The moorings of the yachts will
have to be picked up .while the basin
Is being j dredged out to a uniform
depth of "thirty, feet.. After this has
been done andTbulkheads
the location will -be better than ever
before. The unsettled. condition of af
fairs has i prevented any .arrangements
being â¢ made for the regular reception
and dance at the end of the season. The
club Is in an active and prosperous con
dition.; " â¢

LOWELL GAINS
CHAMPIONSHIP
In one of the most exciting and clean
cut games of football ever played In the
local sub-league, the Lowell High School
triumphed over the California School of
Mechanical Arts yesterday afternoon by
a score of 5-0.
The game was characterized by long end
and quarterback runs, which wera made
by both sides.
In the first half the. lick boys came
nearer scoring than In any tlma during
the combat. ' Main kicked to Glberson,
who was promptly downed. Between
Corbet and "Gibie" eight yards were
gained and then Roncovierl -kept up the
good work by making a quarterback run
for twenty yards. Lowell could so no
farther and LJck got the ball.
Lick done' the best ploying In the first
half of the game. Miller and Main sev
eral times made straight bucks for five
yards at a time. But Lowell seemed to
be the most consistent gainers. Ron
covierl made another of his ' quarterback
runs and Hall was the last man to get
him, making a leaping tackle, and In do
ing so received a blow on the point of the
jaw that settled 'him 'for the rest of thej
game. Golcher, who ran Lick's champion- -
ship team In the finals last year, was
put In and put up a creditable game.
The scoring came In the second . half.
Glberson kicked, oft to McNeil." Glberson
at' this stage made one of his numerous
sensational plays, breaking right through
Lick's line and bringing the ball to the
six-yard line, Charlie Golcher being the
last man to stop . him. -But hl3 efforts
were In vain, for the next play saw Tis
cornla' bring tne ball over the line for
the only touchdown of the day, and the
one which , wins the local sub-leaguo
championship for the Lowell High School.
â¢ The rest of the last half was equally
exciting and at one time it looked a.i
though Lowell would score a second
touchdown, but at i Lick's ' five-yard lin;s
the Lowell boys were stopped. Main
punted over Giberson's- head and the ball
was downed on Lowell's twenty-flve-yanl
line. The game ended with the ball in
Lowell's possession in the center of the
field. - \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0-
As usual, Glberson of Lowell proved
the star \u25a0 oo r the game, and was closely
seconded by * Roncovleri and Tlscornla.
On the - Lick side, Captain Main played
his ;usual v con3istent game. Lieb, Llck'3

BY KRED E. .MI'LIf OLL.AM).
AJ Kaufmann, aspirant for the
heavyweight championship, had his
Ambitions checked and crushed at
"Woodwards Pavilion last night, for,
after seventeen bloody rounds of fight-
Ing, he was knocked out by smooth,
slippery, Jack O'Brien. the
Philadelphia Beau Brummcl. The do
te&itrd boxer did not lack gameness.
as his puffed, swollen and bloody
visage n-Â»8 grim evidence to this fact.
â¢ Rouud after round he cheerfully an
ewered the gong with eyes nearly
closed, the red fluid flowing from
mouth and nostrils, but with one
thought uppermost Sn his mmd â land
tag that fearful right on the Jaw of
â¢liis evasive opponent. It proved a mid
summer night's dream.
AI Mas pitted against a man whose
ten years of experience within the roped
â¢ arena has made him a past master at
the art of boxing. A marvel at foot
\u25a0work, possessed with a left hand that
\u25a0works like a piston rod, a right that
â¢ilwaya helped out when the opportu
nity presented, his feints, sidestepping,
chops and general knowledge of the
, fame dazzled the young Olympian,
leaving him completely outclassed.
Believing that his right hand would
keep the long end of the purse in San
Francisco. Kaufmann resorted repeat
edly to leading with it, after being
drawn out with a feint, a fatal mis
take when mixing with a man like
O'Brien.
KAUFM A\.\ STRONG FAVOHITE.
â¢ The pavilion was well filled, with ad
mirers of the local fighter in the big ma
jority.
Duiing the afternoon kaufmann ruled
a 10 to 7 and 10 to 7*s favorite, but a ver
; liable deluge finally sent AI into the ring
a 2 to 1 chance. Even money was wag
ered that he would not win in fifteen
rounds, however.
With two wretched nreliminarles over,
there was a tedious wait and it was :
beuly 10 o'clock befcre O'Brien, followed ,
by "Spider" Kelly and other seconds, {
climbed through the ropes. Kaufmann j
â¢appeared a few seconds later. He was j
ffecondca by Billy Delaney, Harry Foley,
Joe Kennedy and two or three retainers.
After Billy Jordan had introduced both
boxen in his inimitable fasmon. Referee
Jtiek Welch instructed the men as to the
TUles governing the contest.
Kaufmann wore soft bandages, while
O'Erien chose light driving gloves, with
the fingers cut, to protect his somewhat J
fragile hands. The Philadelphian's j
\u25a0weight was given as 165 pounds and AI j
must have scaled twenty-five pounds
mote.
. O'Brien came up smiling for the first j
round and almost immediately intro
duced his famous left, which was later
on to be a frequent visitor to the hand
some countenance of Kaufmann. To- j
"ward the end the latter rushed in an
.endeavor to put his haymaker Into \
commission. Jack did not fancy its j
rpeed after a sample and was on the '
run when Xiie gong sounded.
O'BIUKX BEC.IXS TO WORK- j
Jn the round following, after Kauf
tnbnn had tried with his right. Jack
â¢turned loose an avalanche of lefts,
nearly smothering the Olympian and
<â¢Â» using the claret to flow. Before cor
ners sounded Kaufmann staggered
Jack with a right-hander, and later
nearly went through the ropea on a
taisspent swing, which failed to make
connections.
â¢ Kanfmann'B left eye began closing in
[ the third from frequent jabs, but it did
rot appear to feaze him, for he kept try-
Ing with his right. Jack seemed tired
-and was stalling as the gong sounded.
Both were weary in the fourth from
heavy exchanges. At the close of the
"round Jack had Kaufrnann's arm locked.
. Although repeatedly cautioned from his
corner by Billy Delaney, Kaufmann in
sisted on leading with his left. Jack's left
*ye was cut In the seventh arid another
cut on the forehead did not make him
tiiore prepossessing to look upon than
T~. :-. uf aann, with his damaged eye and
rwollen nose. Both scrambled it up In the
Â«ighth, and Jack seemed pleased as the
gong sounded.
Both of Kaufmann's eyes looked
mournful coming up for the ninth, but he
took his medicine without a whimper.
There was a deal of clinching and Jack
landed heavy rights and lefts as corners
# were called.
The tenth was a disastrous one for
Kaufmann. and people began talking
about curtains, as Jack fiddled and
Jabbed and ducked away from his bigger
opponent. And so with the round follow-
Jng, Kaufmann spitting out blood and
teying low as ever with his right.
OL.YMFIAX BEGIXS TO TIKE.
There was little cheer about the rounds
leading up to the fourteenth, for the
Olympic boy's admirers: then he made
a desperate effort to stem the tide that
was slowly carrying him out. While it
looked promising at times. Jack, when
clung with a heavy body punch or a
glancing blow to the face, would dance
dr run out of danger.
Kaufmann's speed had slackened to al
most nothing, barring an occasional flash
and then came the finish in the seven
teenth.
Soon after the men came up Jack' land-
Ed a damaging right on Al's jaw that
shook AI all over and he rocked from its
* effects. Jack, quick to perceive this,
crowded on all steam. The recipient of
& withering cross fire, Kaufmann backed
out of the northwest corner; as he did
he lowered his guard.
â¢ Like a flash. Jack scut over a right,
which landed flush on; the point and
Kaufmann fell like a^log on his back.
Several minutes elapsed before the de
feated boxer fully regained h^s senses.
HILLY DELASEV SUItPUISED.
"I am very much surprised." said Billy
Delaney, Kaufmann's manager. "O'Brien
sure had a punch which I did not jdve
him credit for. I thought AJ would bring
over that haymaker, but O'Brien man
aged to go the route.
"No, I am not disappointed in Kauf
mann. He is a game boy and a great
fighter. He went every Inch of the way
and lost because he was up against a
man who knew too much about the
game. AJ will take a rest now for a
â¢while and then take on any of them."
I O'Brien said: "Kaufmann Is a game
boy and a good one. HÂ« will defeat
many men at the present time. He is
young and will learn a good deal from
r.o w on and I would not be surprised to
tee hlxn-jBX the head of his class* with i
proper coaching. He showed last night
that he is spunky and game and never for
a moment did he stop fighting. He took
many a blow which would have stopped
otr.er men, but he never flinched but
continued fighting."
In the firpt preliminary' Ralph Worth
ington, the steeplechase jockey.' earned
the decision over Harry McCloud In the
second round.
Jim Hayward, the dusky 133-pounder.
was favored with a "tapioca" in his bout
with Billy Sheperd. a chocolate scrapper
introduced as from Australia. The lat
ter could probably do more with a tray
of dishes and Hayward was awarded the
verdict in the second round. .
Both "Twin" Sullivan and Jimmy Gard
ner were called before the crowd. Gard
ner issued a challenge to either Britt
or Neison to fight at 133 pdunds for $5000
a side. He stated that Siler, Graney.
Harry Corbett or Welch would be ac
ceptable as referee.
PHILADELPHIAN TOO CLEVER.
Kerp* Peppe>ria{Â£ Hi" Big Opponent
From (be Tap of the Gobk.
O'Brien was too fast and clever for
the Olympic Club boy and demonstrated
his superiority throughout. Following
is a description of the fight by rounds:

landed a left crocs to the face. He then shot
his right for the Jaw, but was a bit short.

and a lert uppercut and caught Kaufmann on
the point of the Jaw. Then O'Brien whipped
two fearful rights to the face, but Kaufmann
merely shook his head, although the blood
streamed from his mouth and noEe O'Brien
landed twice, again and Kaufmann apparently
grew weak from the mercllees hammering
O'Brien shot two vicious rights and a left to
the jaw and the- ring resembled a mlniaturn
slaughter-house from the blood that fell from
Kaufmann's pulpy face. O'Brien continued
to land until the end of. the round. Kaufmann
scarcely; landed a blow In this round and his
seconds worked heroically 'ovor him aa he took
his corner. For the first time he -appeared
weak. : V
TWELFTH ROUND.
O'Brien went - after "his man and smashed
him with left and -right to the face. O'Brlca
kept up this monotonous battering of Kauf
rnann's face, . landing - his '' left at ' will.'. : Kauf
mann appeared all at sea and his attempts to
counter at this stage were feeble. ?. His game
ness, however, was - almost ; ' , superhuman
O'Brien went In : again ' with [ left and : right to
the face and tried vainly to entirely : close tbe
local , man's eyes, which . were ' swollen to thrice
their - normal size. ; It ; Is doubtful \u25a0 If ; he was
able to see O'Brien at- this stage. - O'BriÂ»n
ghot his left to the face and sent iKaufmann
against the ropes and the bell rang with Knuf
mann presenting .a. pitiable i eight. '.'\u25a0 . â¢;

Mr. Cates was accorded a reception by
the Seals yesterday tha^t is -seldom the
unfortunate lot of any youngslabster'to
be handed.' Just as soon as their eyes
became bright they had a longing to clout
everything, that Cates" possessed. And
their} efforts gathered something, as the
thirteen runs and sixteen hits in the
score will attest. :
Such a batting fest ha^ not been pulled
\u25a0oft- by 'the charges of Uncle Hank before
the admiring gazes of the home fans for
quite a little: time. Singles, doubles and
triples were unloaded with such : a regu
larity as to bewilder the. fanatics and
malte the "Giants feel slck. * Every man
on the team, with the exception of .Wil
son, got his.
The game was punctuated *by the hits
of the home brigade pretty much in every
spasm, but the real big sensation of the
afternoon occurred In ,the third, when
Wheeler .walked and Waldron and Moh
ler proceeded to beat out inrield hits that
made it "a full house right off the reel.
Hildebrand then swung through with the
mightiest. drive of the day, a' triple, away
out to the. score board, where no"watch
ful Giant guarded. Everybody came home
on this. \u0084;. .. : .
â¢ Nor did it stop . there, for Nealort cut
loose with a double to -right and House
holder â got .thÂ§ queerest . looking double
ever made on any man's ball field. J He
bunted the ball- and it came with so much
force that- Cates,. In ,his endeavor, to.'en
trap it, interfered In such a way that the
ball bounded back of the plate and House
holder traveled.lo second... . ;.'.;';" "f. ... ;
Cates was not feeling right-at thistime
and made a wild pitch that' let Nealon
in. : Irwin- was passed, and -''Gochnauer
produced a long fly to left field that let
Householder In: Irwin stole and- arrived
when -McLean- --'threw-the/, ball-away .try
ing to catch -him as he! tore : Into third.
The" Giants were lucky Indeed to' get; a
run qti -Wheeler ' ; the way- he was tossing
'em up. 'In tbe^fpurth^spasm^'yan .Buren
dispatched a .: tripie * td" deep center.- and ' a
single by \u25a0 Mltehfjll brought him around,
thus saving" the honor of the Giants from;

face. / Jab followed Jab and blow followed
blow. 7 Kaufmann was as a blind man. O'Bnen
never relented In his . bombardment and kept
dancing aw&y from- lCauimgun when the latter
atumpted a counter. Suddenly Kaufmann
shot a hard right to O'Brien's face and it
looked as if the tlae might be stemmed.
O'Brien, however, did not falter and Immedi
ately began his battle of left and right hooks
and > jabs to the face. Kaufmann still con
tinued to bletd profusely. The Uml rang at
this stage. ,

tried a l earful right swing for the head, but
he missed by a foot. Both : men ' were covered
with the ' blood' that came from Kaufmann's
lace. Kautmann succeeded in landing a buck
hand right to O'Brio^.'s face, but O'Brien
lucre tban evened matters with let ts to the
face. i
FIFTEENTH ROUND.
At this point the police made a. motion as
if to stop the contest, 'but. yielded to Delaney' s
importunity to allow It .to proceed. Kauf
mann took a brace and shot his right hard to
O'Brien's face. O'Brien drove a terrific right
to Kaufmann's face and In the clinch sent two
rights to' the body. .Kaufmann got O'Brien
In a,. corner and with the desperation : of: a dt
feated man sent him against the ropes with
rights and left to the face. -He followed his

effort and landed 'the most damaging blow of
the^flght, a straight right smash to O'Brien's
mouth, which . came very nearly turning the
tldo ot battle.
SIXTEENTH ROUND.
O'Brien came" up, taunting Kaufmann with
sarcastic yells. ' Kaufmann r chased - O'Brien
rabout and In a wondertul ; rally sent In right
and left swings to the face. Jack fought'care
fully at -i this stase and Kaufmann tailed 'to

went wide. Finally â¢ Kaufmann ,\u25a0.. drove two
wicked rights to the body and a right swing to

SPOKANE. Oct. 27.â With a right swing
to the jaw in the eleventh round* Honey
Mellody of Boston put George Peterson
of San Francisco out to-nisrht. Peterson
took the count, attempting to rise but
finally giving up. He was carried to his
corner a badly beaten nyin. Mellody had
the best of the mill from the start, but
Peterson showed great gameness."" The
winner takes about* $1000 and the 'loser
nothing. The men fought at 144 pounds.
Both were in good condition.
The feature of the fight was Peterson's
sameness. He came up smiling again and
again after receiving blows which stag
gered him to the ropes. In the first
round it- was predicted he would not last
three, but he fought on and on, and after
the fifth round frequently showed to bet
ter advantage In the sparring, but his
blow 3 were not effective. He ducked
cleverly, avoiding swings while the crowd
yelled its approval.
Mellody frequently used his elbows in
the mii-ups and the Peterson backers
claimed foul, but the \ referee, Eddie
Qulnn, allowed the fight to go on. â¢
In . the eighth round .a .wrangle ensued.
Peterson went down backward from a
blow/on -the chin, .but "asserted he was
hit- -by <> Mellody's elbow. Seconds piled
into the ring' and the gabfest went on
until a round of time was cut out and
the fight , proceeded. Mellody cut Peter
son's eye in the second round and kept
it swelling until thp California boy could
not see with this optic. Mellody showed
no marks of the mill. '
The recovery of Peterson was a marvel
to the- crowd. He. withstood swings all
through the fight which looked like de
cisive But not until the eleventh
did he fail' on the return. In this round
ho was staggered by a left swing and
went down wlt,h the right before he could
get his guard.

ers, -were arrested* by the marine* guard
en Mare Island this morning, and after
being confined to the naval prison for
several .hours were released and sil
lowed to return to .their homes In this
city. They were out duck bunting and
ventured too close to the navy yard,
when a sentry uroso/ from the tules,
and pointing a gun. at them, demanded
that they come lwith him.
Another, marine; showed up about
this time and t the -hunters gave up
their' guns and were escorted across
the island to the prison. Later they
were taken before Captain I. J. Drake
and warned not to come so close-to. the
Governrhenf; reservation.* McArdle and
Flarinigan j are /wroth, as they claim
several:flne ducks which they had shot
were~ stplen while .they, were confined
In ]the prison. This is denied -by the

NEW YORK, Oct. 27â The market started
Off et aji artlvepace to-day, but the first hour
cf trading absorbed th- bu!k of the day's busi
r.tss and thereafter there v.as a notable shrink
ing in ihe volume tit tr.".nFactionB r until the
close, whirh was " weak. The activity of the
first hour *-ss clcw'd by a contest between con
flicting, forces. There wÂ»s large selling for
foreign account and tbe market was plainly
undt-r the continued lnfu<"noe of depression
manifest at the close yesterday. . Support was
fcrthfonsing. but It required large buying to
sustain values against me telling pressure.
AYhtu the decline was arrested prices crept up
epuin and for & long time hung practically
ej*pÂ«idÂ«Â«i about laet night's closing level.
. Movements In special FtocEs continued a fea
ture without much effort en the general sur-
SW* Â°t the market. The Northern Securities
rymp came into prominence on the assumptiun
\u25a0 :]n ihe return to New York of the head of
tiÂ«e Union Pacific Company would be followed
b>' developments in . thÂ« Northern Securities
scheme. There was nothing authoritatlva on
this point Â£jÂ»d the operations seemed confined
to the trading element. The foreign selling
was attributed largely to unsettling effects
of the disturbed state of. affairs In Russia.
' (.kmtlnenial centers were reported sellers of
securities in London and apprehension was said
to be felt that the issue or the proposed Rus
sian loan irould be delayed and - the tie-up of
money In pnepuration for It extended for this
rr&eon. Foreign exchange vontintted strong In
thrs market, but no exports of gold were an
nounced. There were reports that a gold outgo
to South America from here In payment of
London obligation* there ivts also in prospect.
The estimates of the week's currencsy move
ment with the Interior indicated a nominal
rain by the, banks end the gain In sub-treasury
operations was also reduced to nominal propor
tions, by the subsistence of pension payments.
Money on call was in brlsK cema&d In London
In connection with the pay-day for, the Stock
KJfttiange eettJ.nienC " Among the " news devel
o;Â«nents applying to special properties,. United
States Reduction and American Smelting were
effected by the â"ports of the sale by the for
me* to interests largely represented In the lat
ter eompapy of holdings in the Utah Copper
Company. The recent weakness of .Rock Island
found an explanation in the statement of the
ret earnings for September, showing the gain
In gross earnings almost all absorbed by the
increase in. operating cost, while for the *af
tiJinted St.' Louis and fcan Francisco ' system
the heavy , increase in operating expenses
served to cut down considerably the net re
turn. The strong upward movement of Stand
ard OH In the curb market was a subject of
comment and hafl (Â«me influence in keeping
the tniddsy stock market firm. Exports of
\u25a0wheat for the week rose 1.455.C27 bushels over
those for last week and Vher* were reports of
very urgent demand for vessel room for further
shipments in. prospect. This development, did
n't affect the strength of the foreign exchange
A .'Ut-u The Ftock market held Its recovered
T^ntf' poorly and during trie last half hour of
the trading fell back to the lowest and cloeed
weak and active.
Bonds were heavy- Total sales,- par
vakie. $3,150,0C0.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Pro-visions.
CHICAGO. Oct. 27. â Extreme fluctuations
marked trading in the wheat pit.. The volum*
of business wag jof large proportions. \u25a0As a
result of an advance" of 1%@1%c in the price
of wheat at Liverpool the market here opened
strong: with May ,up a shade to lift %c ju
VU9ssO2V&c. December opened unchanged- to
%o higher at BUV4@<K>c. Demand was; ex
tremely active. .Commission houses had come
Into -possession of an almost unlimited number
of buying orders over night.- The \u25a0 orders . had
apparently been placed Jn. the. large part uÂ»
foreigners- and by that part of the American
public which isJ quick to enter the market
when an occasion like the present develops.
The sharp advance; however,- brought- out
realizing sales of a wholesale kind. Toward
the end of .the first half -hour, the market
yielding to continuous prortt-taklng, some re
action occurred. \u25a0 Offerings. then seemed to sud.
denly cease and prices again started: upward.
A cablegram from a prominent banker in
London claiming that all business in Russia
had been suspended owing to strike disorders
caused a fresh outburst of buying. The prlcu
o( the May delivery Jumped (to- J>2%c, while
December went up to v 9oÂ«.Â£c. i Throughout tn*
remainder of' the sessiiSj.the market was de
cidedly nervous, fluctuations in prices -beina
%'B'Ac between trades. During the last half
hour the market became notably 1 depressetl
in consequence of general' profit-taking. Prices
sank lower and lower until May had touched
9OV4c and December Sfc%c. The market 1 closed
weak, with May at yo%@Â«lc. a net loss 01
He. December closed- iÂ£c lower at --tiSc. >.-."- .
General liquidation caused weakness in the
corn market. December closed %c off at/4u%c.
The situation in oats was similar to that
in the corn market.;- December closed Â»^c
lower at SOVic. ;\u25a0",'. " - -
Provisions .were a' trifle -easier on ; selling
credited to local packers.. At the close Janu
ary pork was off 5@7?,Â»c, lard, was down 2Â»4c

LIQUOR HOUSE
IS IN TROUBLE
The wholesale liquor house of F.
Cavagnaro Company is in trouble. ' The
assets are less than the liabilities, as
estimated by some of the creditors, by
about $40,000. The discrepancy, as
estimated at the office of the company
lasi evening, does not quite reach these
figures.
Mr. Barnes, the manager of the F.
Cavagnaro Companj', says the liabili
ties will run between $75,000 and
SSO.OOO and the assets will probably be
found to amount to $50,000. making the
deficiency between assets and liabilities
from $25,000 to $30,000.
Yesterday the creditors of the F.
Cavagnaro Company met at the rooms
of the Board of Trade and listened' to
a partial explanation of the situation
as regards the company. A committee
of creditors was then appointed to look
iiito the books, accounts and assets and
was authorised to have stock taken at
once, so that a clearer understanding
might be reached. ThÂ« committee con
sists of F. H. Hilbert of Hilbert Bros.,
A. L. Dowler of Clark Bros. & Co. and
F. S. Jacott of the Swiss-American
Bank. '.~:'^-
This committee was found in con
ference last evening with Manager
Barnes. It was said by the manager
that the cause of the trouble to the
company was two-fold â poor collec
tions and a lack of capital to carry on
the business. The principal creditors
are Hilbert Bros., Clark Bros. & Co.

GREIF WAKES
UP THE COURT
Upon the shoulders of County Clerk
Greif has fallen the work of awaken
ing the Judges of the Superior Court
now on the bench and many that have
served in the past to the absolute neces
sity of completing the records relating
to citizenship. For many years the
Judges have been derelict in the. per
formance of this duty, and it. is only
through the insistence of County, Clerk
Greif that they have begun the work
of completing the records as required
by law. -. \u25a0''./-\u25a0
All * yesterday- morning ex-Judge
Bahrs was working on the records,
stamping his name where it should
have been signed years ago. The ques
tion as to whether or not the use of a
rubber stamp for this purpose, is legal
was discussed among attorneys, but as
ex- Judge Bahrs Insisted that it was
and as he alone had the right to affix
the -signature the rubber stamp
went on. ' :
The necessity for the signature of
the Judges on the records has been
made painfully manifest by the recent
campaign of the United ' States secret
service agents, who have ;been cancel
ing citizenship . papers by. the whole
sale. When the attention* of County
Clerk Greif was called to the fact that
the Judges were derelict in this duty
he immediately took up the matter,
with the result that . the records are
rapidly being adjusted. Those that re
main to be signed are:
By Troutt, 17 certificates of naturalization ;
Muraeky, 6; Dain*erflÂ«ld, now off the bench,
lti; Sullivan, oft the bench, 1; Hebbard. 8:
Sea well, 4; Evans, off the bench, 2; Rhodes
Borden, deceased, 3; F. W. Lawler, off the
bench, 17; Cook, 2; Sanderson, off the bench,
13: Garber, off the bench, 7; Ferral, off the
bench, 2: Toohy, off the bench, -2; Levy, off
the bench, 10; Van Reynegom,- off the bench,
1; Wilson, off the bench,. 1; Edmonds, off the

bench, 2; Wilson, off the bench, 1; Finn, off
the bench, 1; Coffey, 2; - BahrÂ», 18 remaining:
unstamped; Lawlor, 8; Dunne, S; Graham, 3.
Just what will be done in the case
of the certificates unsigned iby Borden
remains to be seen. He is now dead
and it is the general opinion that
should a copy of the certificates pro
cured from him ever be required by
thÂ« persons entitled 'thereto' they will
have to appear Â« before the\ court with
witnesses and by making oath as to
the fact's, in the .case, cause some other
Judge now on the bench to complete
the record by attaching his signature.

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Cupid received a most severe Jolt when
Police Judge Mogan pronounced Miss
Carrie Gomez guilty' of vagabondage and
remanded her to reappear before him .this
'morning for sentence. His Honor's de
cision was a direct slap at several'time
honored adages anent the universal pop
ularity of the mischievous dart-shooter,
especially the oft-heard saying that "AH
the world loves a lover."- For .the* de
fendant "had not ".only blushlngly con
fessed that her affection was monopolized
by John Cuppers, but had declared with
great show of . pride that she and >ehe
alone possessed the heart of John. Her
hair was cropped and surmounted by: a
jockey cap, - termed a "dinky lid," by
one of the bailiffs.
In Justice to the court, however; it
should be stated that the disparity of
years between Carrie and John,*- coupled
with consideration of' her character and
his comparative worldly experience; may
have prompted the pronouncement from
the *Dench. While she claimed ,' to : -.be
twenty-three, and seemed tq be almost
twice as. old, his claim to twenty-three
was accepted without question, because
he appeared -to~be' even; younger.
j. The complaining?;,.. witness was . the
swain's paternal relative, a special po
liceman, who did \ not relish the idea of
having Miss " Gomez nomenclaturally dig
nified by becoming Mrs. 'Cuppers. He
had talked with John 4 concerning the pro-;
posed mesalliance," but, the youth 'was
love-blind and his ' inamorata gave_ him
no time to form a plan of escape .from
her | thralldbm, even had he felt, so in
clined. So there was no other course for
Cuppers pere to pursue in the protection
of his name from Social depression than
that of 'enlisting the} law's aid.
"Why did you persist in keeping com
pany with this young fellow when ; his
father 'is^opposed "to such; association?"
the Judge asked. Miss Gomez.
"Because I'm stuck. . on: him an' he's
stuck on me," she modestly faltered. -
She admitted that her: vocation of per
forming in â¢ a Pacific-street: dance hall
disqualified her for % admittance to the
society circle resident at the avenue end
of that thoroughfare, -averred that any,
one who imagined. John was a' .day
younger than she, or that: she would
think of such a thing as marrying a
"kid,''., was mistaken. Moreover, the
sending of her to Jail would not destroy
her infatuation for John, and: if it weak
ened his passion' for her. there had been
gross error in her. calculation" of his 16y
alty. ! .-, " "- i \ v!' r '
"We'll try it anyway," | said the! court.
The ; smile ' of assurance she ;Â». bestowed
upon John, failed to. bring response,; and
her face was reflective of perturbation' of
spirit as she watched him depart moodily
from the courtroom. ;
George A. Ferguson, arrested at 5
o'clock a. m. for. drunkenness, on Kearny
street, pleaded that he had spent the
night "working" for the . election/ of ; a
certain candidate for Supervisor. â¢
"The burglar vote," quoth Judge Cab
aniss, "is about the only one working
after midnight." .
'."I have a good many, friends who are
milk-drivers," said , Mr. Ferguson." /
, "Ah? I beg, your pardon. "Case dis
missed. I'll ' make a note of that for fu
ture reference."
And he did.

of battery by/ Frank Sibella, . ; aV boy re

chanced to glance through a window and

mainder rapidly approaching that state
she entered the place and fed and watered

Mogan that the conduct of Mrs. , Jane
Creightonf who keeps a lodging house at

The specific act alluded to by Mr. Hig
gins was ! Mrs. Creighton's removal, from
his room In her house, while he lay abed,
of his pantaloons and JITS contained in a
pocket thereof. He recovered the trous
ers, but not the money, and Mrs. Creigh
ton is accused of grand larceny. The de
fense has yet to be heard.
On motion of the complaining witness,
Perry H. Newberry, secretary of the \u25a0 Re
publican League, the charge of false reg
istration against Joseph Thomas Maloney,
a laundryman, was dismissed by Judge
Cabaniss. .
After* candidly acknowledging that he
erred In the case, Mr. Newberry grace
fully tendered an apology to Mr. Ma
