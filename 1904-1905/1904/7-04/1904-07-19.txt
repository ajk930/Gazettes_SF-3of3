"After the occupation by General
Kuroki's army of the passes in the
Fenshui Mountain chain, bur informa
tion concerning his position was in
general inadequate. According to
some reports his army had been rein
forced and he had even extended his
forces toward Saimatsza. Other re
ports said that a displacement of his
troops had been made in the direction
of Ta Pass and Siuyen. There were
even indications that Kuroki had
transferred his headquarters from
Taskhahekan-to Touinpu. '*'Â¦&>
â¢ "On' the strength' of this information
received and on the basis of recon
naissances which had been made, ,the
hypothesis was formed that the prin
cipal forces of the enemy were con
centrated around Linshankwan and
that ;their advance guard should be
strengthened in the passes of Siaokao,
Wafankwan, Sinkia/ Lakho and Pa
pau, as'well as at Sybey Pass, two and
a half miles north of the road and
half the height of Siaokao Pass.
KELLER ORDERED TO ATTACK.
"On July 16, in order to determine
the strength of the enemy, it was de
cided to advance against his position
in the v direction of, Linshankwan.
Lieutenant General Count Keller had
been Instructed not to start with the
object of. capturing the pass, but to
act according to the strength of the
force . that he would find opposed, to

"The left column of the expedition

Pass. The entire column, commanded
by Major General Kashtalinsky, con

patkin to the Emperor, dated "July 17,
on our eastern front," was given out
to-night:
"At about 5:30 o'clock on the morn

siderable strength and with numerous
guns, occupied Wafankwan pass and
the mountainous bluffs to the south
on the flank of General Kashtalin
sky's column. From this position and
from the crest of the mountains to
the east of the heights surmounted by

The right column, eight battalions
strong, was occupying points where
the roads leading to Sinkia and Lakho
passes cross, in order to cover the left
flank of General Kashtallnsky*s col

at Ikhavuan, and a portion of the
force occupied a position at that place.
"At 10 p. m., July 16, the head of
the column advanced from Ikhavuan.
At 11 o'clock a battalion of the Sec

outpost at the point of the bayonet at
the crossing of the Lakho and Sinkia

correspondent at Malta: "The British Mediterranean fleet left here to-day for Alexandria. It is believed that the
destination of the fleet may be connected with the presence of the Russian volunteer fleet steamships in the Red

LONDON, July 19.â The corre
spondent of the Times at General
Kuroki's headquarters says that the
Japanese loss during the fighting at
Motien Pass on July 17 was trifling.
TOKIO, July 18. â General Kuroki
reports that two divisions of the Rus
sian army made a desperate assault on
Motien Pass at dawn, on July 17, but
were repulsed. The casualties were
not stated.
At 3 o'clock on Sunday morning, a
heavy fog veiling their movements,
two divisions of Russians, commanded
by Lieutenant General Keller, made an
assault on the Japanese positions at
Motien Pass. General Kuroki's report
adds that the Russians assailed all; the
Japanese positions at Motien and in its
vicinity desperately. The Japanese re
sisted stubbornly, repulsed the Russians
and pursued them for a considerable
distance westward. Kuroki in his re
port praises the valor of his men.
LONDON, July .19.â The Morning
Post's" correspondent at 'General
Kuroki's headquarters, telegraphing
under date of July 17, says:
'/A Russian force, apparently, about
20,000 strong, attacked the front, left
and right of the Japanese positions on
the western slope. of Motien Pass at 2
a. m. to-day under cover of a dense
fog. The sudden onslaught drove' in
the Japanese \>utposts, but as soon as
reinforcements" arrived the Japanese
gallantly adva'riced to I the/attack and
after severe fighting drove off the Rus
sians and reoccupied the position. The
Russians retired, their retreat being
well covered. The fighting lasted until
3 o'clock In the afternoon, and when I

Dr. Webb, ..after describing the
wounds, said that they were inflicted
before "death. He added that Loomis
might have been stunned and fallen
into the water and been drowned. It
was not a sharp wound, but possibly
the result of a fall on his head. Either
he . struck something or something
struck his head.
The blow was not inflicted after
death. Supposing the deceased had
ascended on deck at midnight tu take
the air and 'gone to an unprotected
space where the davits were and fallen,
that would account for the wound.
He died as the result of a blow, but
there was nothing to Indicate how the
blow, which . was a very heavy one,
had been' inflicted.^ The blow seemed
to have been struck In a horizontal
direction. The wound was about an
inch and' three-quarters long and pear
shaped.
Replying' to Consul Stephens, Dr*.
Webb said the blow might have caused
death If Loomis had not fallen into
the' water. He thought it was im
probable that Loomis would have re
covered from the blow, even if he had
not fallen into the water.
Consul Stephens explained to the
Coroner that if the time at which
Loomis'. watch had stopped was Amer
ican time it meant one o'clock here,
which was about the time the Kaiser
Wilhelm II reached Plymouth on June
20. None of the official papers carried
by Loomis were lost or stolen.

KINGSBRIDGE. Devonshire, July 18.
"Found dead, washed up by the sea
in Bfgbury Bay, Devonshire," was
the verdict to-day of the Coroner's
jury in the inquest over the body of
F. Kent Loomis. The evidence was
very inconclusive and wholly con
jectural, as pointed out by the Cor
oner when he advised this verdict, add,
ing that although death was caused
by a blow there was nothing to justi
fy the suspicion that it was foully ad
ministered.
Consul Stephens of Plymouth has
charge of the body, which is in a fair
state of preservation. It will be em
balmed and sent home for burial as
early as possible and practicable.
The inquest to-day threw the
picturesque little Devonshire village
of Thurleston, on the shores of Big
bury Bay, Into a state of unwonted ex
citement- The court, over which the
Coroner, Dr. Sidney Hacker, presided,
was somewhat late In assembling, in
consequence of the delay in carrying
out the official medical examination of
the body. This was conducted by. two
local doctors, whose testimony was to
the effect that there was a contused
wound below and behind the right ear.
There also was a general .bruise, in
volving the scalp and the integument
of the brain on the left side above' the
ear. Both wounds, in the doctors'
opinion, were inflicted before death.
The American Consul at Plymouth,
Joseph G. Stephens, attended the pro
ceedings. After the Jury had viewed
the body the first witness, Thomas
Snowden, a laborer, who discovered the
remains In the breakers, testified to the
recovery of the corpse.
A' policeman, who searched the body
told of the recovery of a gold watch,
which- had stopped at 6 o'clock; some
English gold and silver coins and a
â¢pocketbook containing $60 in American
notes, a report for a subscription to
the Blennerhasset Club, a railroad pass
issued in the name of F. Kent Loomis,
a receipt from the Grand Hotel, Broad
way, New York, for $250, which Loomis
desired to be sent to his wife; a gold
ring with the name "Mildred" inside,
etc.

Of the men Injured in Sunday's riot

A flank movement by the strikers de
veloped to-day in the announcement by
President Donnelly that in conjunction
with William Sterling, vice president of
the Butchers' Workmen's Union; John
Floersch, secretary of the Packing
Trades Council and Philip Murphy,
"champion butcher of the world," re
cently employed by Swift & Co., he will
start a small packing house where
union butchers may secure supplies -at
prices which will enable strikers to
purchase meat without contributing to
the profits of the big concerns. Cattle
and hogs have already been bought.
President Donnelly asserted, the plant
secured and operations are expected to
begin to-morrow.

NEW YORK, July 18.â Owing to the
agreement among the 3000 beef dealers
of this city that they buy no more beef
until high prices created by the strike
s-hall have again become normal, all
but ten Kosher shops are reported
dosed. Throughout the east side and
Harlem watchers from the Benchmen's
1'nion. working for the association of
Kosher butchers, watched the shops
and reported every one that was open.
The threat had been made that any one
tilling beef would be arrested under
the Sunday law. Only one of ten
butchers t=u?pected was arrested. He
was discharged because it could not be
proven that he sold any meat. He de
nied having; disposed of any. Three
wagon loads of fresh meat sent to the
tast Fide and offered for 12 cents was
ppurned by all of the butchers. They
raid that if they offered it to the pub
lie at the high prices their shops would
be mobbed. The meat was sent back,
but the wagons went the rounds a sec
ond time, offering it for 11 cents a
pound. No one took it. A rate of 6^
cents was all the butchers said they
Â¦would pay.
This united action of the Kosher
butchers enforces the most complete
meat fast ever kno\\*n on the east side.

WASHINGTON, July 18.â The Com
missary Department of the army does
not anticipate any trouble in procur

especially bacon, already had been sup
plied by the army and the only diffi
culty might be in the filling of orders
for canned meats in the Philippines.
The department, however, has enough
of this food for the next shipment to

skirmishes in this region between Amur
Cossacks and Japanese scouts. The
Japanese made an unusually heavy
attack on the Russian outpost at Tzy

however, the Japanese retired and the
Russians reoccupled the- position. .
RUSSIA'S POSITION 'AWKWARD.
Diplomatic circles believe Russia will
speedily disavow the seizure; V since a

among the foreign diplomats show
there, is a belief that the. raising of
this question wfll. be extremely .awk

ST. PETERSBURG, July 18.â Russia
does not foresee international compli
cations on account of the passage of
the volunteer fleet steamships through
the ' Dardanelles and their subsequent
conversion into war cruisers. The
framers of the treaty of Paris, In seek
ing to prevent the ingress and egress
of warships, evidently did not expect
the present contingency.
"The St. Petersburg and Smolensk
did not pass the Dardanelles %s war
ships, but as merchantmen," said ah
official of the Foreign Office. "Under
the treaty of Paris there is no question
of the right of ships to go out as mer
chantmen. With their subsequent con
version into warships Turkey has noth
ing to do. The treaty Is silent' on the
subject"
The precedents allowing unarmed
Russian warships to pass the Dardan
elles without protest from the parties
to . the treaty of Paris are. considered
valuable now.
While . the diplomatists have not
questioned the right of Russia to seize
contraband of war, the actual confisca
tion of mails supplies a different ques
tion and Germany, both at Berlin and
In St. Petersburg, Is investigating the
circumstances In order to ascertain
whether the Russian commander in
this case exceeded his orders. -
The Admiralty has received -reports
of the seizure of the Peninsular and
Oriental Company's steamer Malacca

GERMANY ENTERS A PROTEST..
BERLIN, July 18.â The German Qpyj.
ernment has taken a prompt and ,flrm
stand In' regard to the seizure of the
malls of the North German Lloyd
steamer Prinz Heinrich, which arrived
at Aden on July 16 from' Hamburg and
Southampton for Yokohama, by the
Russian volunteer fleet steamship
Smolensk on July 15. It has entered
a protest against the carrying off of
the mails and f asked for a disavowal
of the Smolensk's action and the re
turn of the captured mall sacks.
The German Government, the For
eign Office says, recognizes .the right
to search mails when on board the
vessel itself, but claims the Smolensk
had no right to take off mails In bulk
from the vessel. The further argu :
ment is advanced that the right of
search can be exercised only by a war
ship, whereas the Smolensk traversed
the Dardanelles \nly recently flying
the Russlon commercial flag and not
assuming the character of a warship.
The German Government has not ta
ken a position on this last point, but
leaves it for future discussion ' and set
| tlement. No answer has yet been re
ceived from Russia.
The correspondent says the captain
of the Russian volunteer fleet steam
ship St. Petersburg has notified the
British residents at Aden to wire the
British Consuls at Suez and Port Said
that he would seize any British
steamers bound for the Far East if
the contents of their packages were
not clearly shown, on their manifests,
according to international law.
The Daily Mail's St. Petersburg
correspondent says that two more
steamships of the Russian volunteer
fleet now at Odessa have received con
fidential orders to leave this week for
the -Red Sea to seize British vessels
which are alleged to be carrying con
traband of war.
The Standard's Toklo correspondent,
cabling under date of July 18, says:
"The passage of the Dardanelles by
steamships of the Russian volunteer
fleet attracts increased attention here.
The Japanese press continues to dis
credit the supposition that Russia real

in no more, personal -vein than others

made public a statement that the
chairman of the Democratic National

Privately it was the judgment of all
present that the interests of the party
would be best conserved by leaving the
committee absolutely free to elect its
chairman. Judge Parker was said to
favor this- course. The conference re
sulted in an agreement to call a meet

held at the Hoffman House on July
26. The question of fixing the time

themselves.

Alcazar.
"The Prisoner of Zenda," a dramati
zation of Anthony Hope's famous
novel, was presented at the Alcazar
last night with White Whittlesey in
the star part. The production was
splendidly staged and the Alcazar
stock company showed itself at its
best. Although it was the night
the performance carried through
without a hitch, and the repeated
rounds of applause and curtain _calls
attested the audience's appreciation of
the work and the players. Whittle
sey. in his double role of the King of
Ruritania and the young Englishman,
had an excellent opportunity to dis
play his talents, and he made the
most of it. Howard Scott as usual
was cast as the villain and carried
out his part in a manner which would
have won him rounds of hisses and
jeers on the other side of Market
street. As the Princess Flavia Juliet
Crosby won considerable , applause,
and after trie second act was present
ed with many fiowers. The quartet,
which rendered a number of choice
melodie3 during the evening, is one of
the features of the performance that
deserves special mention. All the
members of the company do well and
the play should have/ a good run.
"Rupert of Hentzau" will follow.

WASHINGTON, July 18.â The new
salary schedule for rural mail carriers
has been completed. The new schedule
applies from July 1. The last Con
gress recommended the maximum sal
ary to be increased to* $700 a year, from
$600. It was found that the maximum
route was twenty-four miles long and
to carriers on routes of this length,
numbering about 12,000, the maximum
salary will be paid. The salaries of
carriers on routes shorter than the
maximum was fixed by deducting $18
for each mile less than twenty-four.

During the last year more than 123.000
immigrants went to Canada, While this
is only about a seventh of the num

they are more desirable. Those Who
have gone to Canada are for the most
part farmers or farm laborers who have
gone out into the country to develop
the agricultural situation and help
raise wheat "and other grain. The ma
jority of those who have come to the
United States hang around the cities
and the centers of population. Com
paratively few of them are willing to
go out on the farms and they do not
come here with any such intention. â

MEN ARE PUT ON HALF TIME.
Lack of Demand for Coal Causes Idle
ness in Ohio Collieries.
CLEVELAND, O.. July 18.â Owing to
the lack of demand at the coal mines
in the Eighth Ohio District, which are
largely owned by Cleveland operators,
the men have been put on half time.
Eight thousand are affected by the
curtailment of operations.
The action of the operators in cutting
in half their production is the result of
an almost unprecedented stagnation in
business. Shutdowns are not confined
to this district alone, but are extending
to other districts of the State. In no
district does there appear to be a de
mand for coal. The bins arc full at the
mines and a complete suspension of
operations is said to be almost inevita
ble unless the market receives an early
stimulation.

CALIFORNIA MUST SUPPLY
THE EAST WITH PRUNES
Crop in Washington and Oregon Re
ported by Experts to Be a
Total Failure.
TACOMA, Wash., July 18. â Wash
ington's prune crop this year la
destined to be almost a total failure,
according to advices reaching the
trade. P. F. Kelley, an expert, esti
mates the crop at about one-tenth of
what it was last season. Several state
ments have been made during the past
month that the season was an excep
tionally poor one for the prune grow
ers, but the extent of the depreciation
in the output was not definitely known
until within a few days.
The condition of the fruit at this
time, however, is claimed to make a
one-tenth estimate a conservative one.
Kelley says: "In Clarke County,
where last year the output was be
tween 150 and 160 cars, it Is prob
ably that the evaporators will not even
be operated this season. The short
age, so far as we are able to tell, ap
plies to the entire State and to Oregon.
When the trees first blossomed the
pollen fell off prematurely for some
unknown reason and to this cause is
assigned the failure of the crop."
Heretofore whole trainloads of
Clarke County prunes have been
shipped each season to the Eastern
markets, which must this year depend
almost wholly on California for their
supply.
OTHER CRIMES A HE

Kendall aboard the overland train and
left for Danville, 111., where the pris
oner will have to answer two or three

claims Kendall is her husband, is still
in the city. The pair are accused of
stealing many valuable diamonds and
a large sum of money.
Kendall was brought back from the
East to Indianville by Whitlock. He
then jumped his bail and came to
Stockton.^ Mrs. Sabin was identified
by Mrs. Fannie Moal. of a Chicago
company bearing her name. Mrs. Moal
declares that Mrs. Sabin embezzled the
diamonds from her as well as from
other Chicago women.

Orange County Republicans Empha
size Indorsement of Bar.1.
SANTA ANA, July 18.â In view of
the controversy that has arisen as to
the action of the Orange County Re
publican Convention held in this city
last Saturday, with reference to the
candidacy of Senator Thomas R. Bard,
whether it did or did not indorse, the
exact wording of the resolution adopted
was to-night given to the Associated
Press. It reads:
"Resolved, That, speaking in the
name of the Republicans of Orange
County, this convention declares Its
choice for United States Senator to be
Hon. Thomas R. Bard, the distinguished
incumbent. His high character, long and
useful career in public and private pur
suits, his tried integrity, his proved Re
publicanism, his present advantageous
official position, his stronghold upon
the popular heart makes him, in our
judgment, the most available candi
date of the south and of the State."
Another resolution was introduced in
structing the candidates for the Legis
lature, if elected, to vote for Bard, but
this failed to pass.
A sad case of distress, brought be
fore the Congregational Ministers' As
sociation yesterday, reopens one of the
most sensational tragedies that have
ever taken place in San Francisco.
The story of the illness and the need
of Mrs. E. J. Nelson of .526 Natoma
street came before the clergymen and
it was remembered that she was for
merly the wife of the ex-Rev. Thomas
Crossley of the Congregational de
nomination, who twenty-nine years
ago, after shooting her down,' shot and
took his own life.
Mrs. Nelson's life has been one of
almost perpetual gloom, for scarcely
from the time of the tragedy has a
rift occurred in the clouds which
would allow a ray of sunshine to warm
or cheer her moments.
..There are many In the city to-day
familiar with the dread details of the
crime. The ex-minister coaxed his
wife, who had separated from him, to
visit him at his apartments on Howard
street on the pretense that he wished
to see his child. His conduct had been
such that a perfect reconciliation was
impossible. HoweVer, Crossley im
portuned his young wife to return to
him, although he realized and ad
mitted the enormity of, the offense
which caused the parting between
them.
Khe told him that reconciliation was
out of the question in view of the cir
cumstances. Again he pleaded, but so
humiliated and distressed was the suf
fering woman that again she rejected
any offer of remaining under the same
roof with him, upon which Crossley
drew a revolver, and, aiming it directly
at hia wife, shot her in the temple, and
to-day part of the bullet remains im
bedded in her forehead, and the hand
with which she protected her head is
crippled.
With her at the time of the tragedy
was the infant, and when the neigh
tors and police broke into the room
they found the child on the floor near
the lifeless body of its father, playing
with the watch he had placed in its
hand prior to doing the shooting. The
child died some years after the occur
rence.
A subsequent marriage to E. J. Nel
son did not turn out quite happy for
the unfortunate woman. By that mar
riage she had a daughter. Miss Grace
Nelson, who, although In very deli
cate health, strives to maintain the
neat little home on Natoma street.
Mrs. Kelson has been doing fancy
needlework and has also been occupied
as a canvasser, but never having re
covered from the shooting, she has at
last broken down completely, although
with nutrition, rest and freedom from
the fear of losing their home she may
recover her strength.
Miss Carrie Hodge, a deaconess of
the Methodist Episcopal Church, has
been doing all in her power to sustain
th<; stricken woman. Yesterday two
members oÂ£-^the Central Methodist
Church, Mrs. A. H. Staubridge and
Mrs. E. Metcalf, were the good Samari
tans who called and sat by Mrs. Nel
son's bedside.
The Congregational ministers ap
pointed the Rev. John A. Hollars, pas
tor of the Bethlehem Congregational
Church, to act in the matter without
delay.
ROME, July IS.â From the highest
source it is learned that the Vatican's
view of the situation between the Holy
See and France Is as follows:
The Pope regards the dissolution of
the concordat by France as absolutely
certain. The pretext is that the Holy
See, before the visit of President Lou
bet to Rome, called upon Bishop Gray
of Laval to resign. He refused and
was summoned to Rome to answer the
gravest charges. The Bishop appealed
to the French Government, which
claimed that the Holy See was in
fringing on the concordat; but, as the
Bishop had not been punished. Foreign
Minister Delcasse acknowledged that
the Vatican was within its rights.
The Pontiff is firmly decided to pro
ceed with the case of the Bishop, who,
if he is not in Rome on the 28th in
stant, wll! be suspended.
To the error of imagining that "Car
rots" preceded "Cousin Kate" last
night at the Columbia, I had the pleas
ure of seeing through again Mr. Davis'
fascinating comedy â this Jus^t to say
that enjoyable as was one's first even
ing with "Cousin Kate," only a second
gives one the full value of the wit,
grace and abounding fancy of the play.
. And the contrast is one to be grate
ful for. Miss Barrymore. charming
woman of the world, as the curtain
rings down on "Cousin Kate." reap
pears as a slim, red-headed youth in
"Carrots." "Carrots," too, is different.
It is a little French playlet by Jules
Renard, produced first at Antoine's
Theater in Paris, and transplanted
here last season with amiable success
by Miss Barrymore. As Miss Barry
more herself says, "nothing happens"
in the play.
A child's desperate unhapplness â an
unloving mother the cause, the father's
discovery of his sorrow, with the
father's confession to the boy of his
own grief and of the mother's unhap
piness. Is all of it. But how charm
ingly the little story is told, with all
the delicacies.j subtle reserves, lumin
ous suggestions of a De Maupassant.
A new maid arrives at the Lepics.
"Carrots" is weeding in the garden.
His father has invited him to go shoot
ing, to his deep delight. His naive
directions to the maid put one then
en rapport with the neglected boy's
position. "Everybody cannot be an
orphan," he laments. - The mother,
nagging and self-tormented, then ap
pears, explaining further the situation.
She wants "Carrots" to do things, run
errandsâ anything to prevent his going
shooting with his father. She further
compels him to say that he does not
wish to go. But the maid, a witness
of both scenes, explains the boy's ap
parent caprice to the father. Then the
boy timidly unfolds his sorrowsâ how
he has twice tried to commit suicide,
how he wishes to run away from home.
The father's explanations follow and
how the two decide to bear the thing
together is then most gracefully told.
Perhaps Miss Barrymore does not
altogether realize "Carrots" for one.
As a picture, gray-bloused and au
burn-haired. Ehe is perfect, the Boutel
de Monvel sort of thing. Ah, yes! It
is something of the Boutel de Monvel
sort of thins one gets in the acting â
the flat tint, the simple line, the deco
rative quality. One is not impressed
by Carrots' sorrows as living sorrows,
but rather as by a lovely tale of sor
row. One gets almost a Yeats' sense
of aloofness from every-day life in the
play. It is as a fairy tale read, and ex
quisitely illustrated, that it impresses,
and Miss Barrymore's elusive and po
etic handling of the part enforces the
illusion. In the same carefully un
emotional vein is the rest of the acting.
Fanny Addison Pitt is the mother, and
a very stepmother of fairy tale in her
conception of acting. Bruce McCrae
in his acting of the father is quietly
sufficient, and Miss Agnew is a charm
ing little maid. Those who do not see
"Carrots" will miss very much a pe
culiar and delightful pastel.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
At a meeting of the Brewery Work
men's Union, held last night at 1159
Mission 6treet, it was decided to go out

This decision was the result of a re

At the meeting of the association
yesterday afternoon the troubles be

decided to make a number of conces
sions to the drivers and stablemen, the
former being granted $2 increase in
pay and the stablemen a decrease of
an hour in their daily labor. The de
mand of the insfde men was positively
refused. The action of the employers
>vas generally expected and they have
already anticipated a strike in conse-
Quence by laying in a large supply of
beer. It was stated last evening that
the employers were prepared to close
the breweries for several months.

FATAL RIOT OF STRIKERS.
HAVANA, July IS.â All the unions
in the harbor' workmen's federation
struck to-day again in sympathy with
the stevedores, who had' refused to* re
sume work since the other strike was
partly settled unless the steamship
companies and consignees continue to
employ, stevedores through the unions
instead of individually. Some incipient
fights occurred between the strikers
and those who attempted to work. The
Mayor is again endeavoring to arbi
trate. -
Many non-union men are at work
at the wharves, which are guarded by
the police. Several non-union work
men were attacked by the unionists In
the streets to-day and twenty of the
latter were arrested.
I President Palma to-day summoned
the representatives of the principal
steamship lines and expressed to them
his hope that, if not Incompatible with
the general business interests, a con
ciliatory attitude be adopted toward
the strikers. The steamship men re
plied that they were willing to con
oede the question as to wages, but not
the recognition of the union.
A sympathetic strike of every union
is being urged by the strikers.
â¢Through the fatal mistake of Miss
Stella. Wllley, a nurse at the United
States Marine Hospital, Frank John
ison. a fjiiior, now occupies a slab at
the City Morjrue instead of a con
valescent's bed at the home for the
marine sick. The nurse by mistake
gave Johnson eight teaspoonfuls of bi
chloride of mercury instead of mag
nc-sium sulphate.
The accident occurred at 6 o'clock
Sunday nigrht. Miss WiHey was nurs
ing Johnson, who had been in the hos
pital but a few days. He was suf
fering from broken ribs, which he re
cel* ed - on July 16 by falling down the
hold of the ship Glory ol the Seaa.
Dr. Simpson had instructed the nurse
to give the patient doses of magnesium
sulphate. The medicines are kept in a
closet and no drug clerk Is retained by
the Government to dispense the rem
edies. . .
On Sunday evening Miss Wllley went
to the medicine closet to get a bottle
of magnesium sulphate solution. It
Kood beside a bottle of bichloride,
bearing the. same kind of a label, ex
cept for the email label on the neck
marked "poison." The solutions in the
two bore the name transparent color.
The nurse had been to the closet a
hundred times for the magnesium so
lution, and, thinking that she knew
the bottle, failed to read the label.
Going to the bed where Johnson
lay, Â«he gave him eight teaspoonfuls,
enough to kill several men. The sailor
became deathly sick. Dre. Simpson
and Warren were immediately sum
moned and discovered the nurse's fatal
blunder. Antidotes were administered
and the patient's stomach was emptied
with a pump. Johnson hovered be
tween life and death till 1:20 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, when he passed
away.
Detective Ed Gibson was detailed on
the case, but did not arrest the girl
pending the completion of the autopsy,
which will be performed this morning.
Dr. Simpson is of the opinion that
Johnson died of a punctured lung,
<~aused by a broken rib being forced
through his respiratory organ during
a fit of coughing, induced by the ef
fects of the poison. Detectives Gibson
believes that death was caused by the
poison, which was the indirect cause,
even though a lung was punctured.
If it is found that death was due to
the bichloride. Miss Willey will be
charged to-day with manslaughter.
The nurse is not a graduate, but is
known as a trained nurse. She was
about to take the examination to grad
uate. She epent eighteen months in
the California Women's Hospital and
had "been e!x months at the Marine
Hospital. She is 20 years of age and
keenly feels the awfulness of her mis
take.
Johnson was a sailor on the ship
Glory of the Seas.
I CINCINNATI, July 18.â The regis
i tration for the meeting of the Grand
I Lodge and the reunion of the Elks ex
| ceeded 15,000 to-night, while all the
railways were bringing in special
i trains and expecting their greatest
j crush to-morrow.
The grand opening to-night consisted
of fireworks on both sides of the Ohio
river. Two large steamboats were
j chartered. The one used for members
of the Grand Lodge and their families
and friends carried 2000, and the one
for members of the press and others
had 1000 persons aboard.
As the steamboats returned from a
cruise to Coney Island the twelve Ken
tucky suburbs and the river front of
Cincinnati and *its Ohio suburbs riv
aled one another In a display that
really asumed the proportions of a bat
tle of fireworks. The boathouses or.
various clubs were equipped as bat
tleships along the shores, and the
wharf boats were arranged in similar
form, presenting a magnificent naval
j display in action as the fireworks were
{ operated. This great exhibition closed
j with a huge illuminated picture of
I Grand Exalted Ruler Fanning at the
! Cincinnati public landing. It is esti
| mated that more than 100,000 persons
i witnessed the scenes along both banks
Â¦ of the Ohio, after which various enter
! tainments were given.
The Grand Lodge will open with a
| public session at 10 o'clock to-morrow
! in the Music Hall, preceded by an
j organ recital and other musical num
i bers. Following the address of wel
â¢ come and responses, the annual re
: ports will be presented and the election
! of officers will end the animated con
| tests that were going on to-night for
: grand exalted ruler, grand exalted
j secretary and other offices. While
j there have been no material changes
; during the day, a very hard fight Is
Â¦ being made by the field against what
! is known as the administration' slate.
: O'Brien of Baltimore, for grand ex
â¢ alted ruler, and Robinson of Dubuque,
i for grand exalted secretapy, are still
; favorites as the so-called administra
| tion candidates, but the election of no
I one seems to be assured.

Captain William F. Kilgore. of the
revenue cutter service, was at the fair
during the week with his wife, on his
way to San Francisco, where he will
assume command of the revenue cut
ter Rush. Captain Kilgore's home is
at Sag Harbor,' New York, but he was
stationed at San Diego for a long time
and has a great love for California.
After he had partaken of ripe olives
and raisins at the San Diego booth,
which brought back memories of the
delightful \ conditions there, he was
more anxious than. ever to reach the
Golden State. The cool breezes of the
Pacific will be quite a contrast to him
to the heat waves here.
ER WIN'S LECTURES POPULAR.
J. "W. Erwin's lectures In the San
Francisco building have proved so suc
cessful that he has consented to deliver
a series in the evening at the Cali
fornia building. The few he has al
ready given at the latter place have
been well attended.
D. M. Delmas. Judge Coffey, Edward
Coffey, M. F. Tarpey, Arthur Tarpey,
Al. McCabe and George Cleary, San
Franciscans, and all left over from the
Democratic convention, have been
among the energetic fair visitors.
They covered a great deal of the ex
position in a short time and got a look
at most of its wonders.
Marion de Vries, formerly Congress
man from the Second District of Cali
fornia, but now a United States Gen
eral Appraiser, spent one day In St.
Louis during the week trying customs
cases. He was given a hearty wel
come by the Californians here, as his
popularity never wanes. He will pay
the exposition a more extended visit in
September. \M .,-â¢
ernor wishes to -get the best display
possible for; the money.. This sura is
not much with which to make a show
ing, some of the counties
having . expended more than this on
their exhibits here. It is expected that
great numbers of practical farmers
from the Northwest and many from
the East will visit the Portland fair,
and they are deemed 'a good class of
people to impress with the beauties of
California. I Most, of them are well-to
do and many of them are filled with
a desire to move to some place where
the conditions are less severe. The
Journey to California is not so long a
one for the farmer of the Northwest.
Governor Pardee, while here, took a
great many mental notes in regard- to
exposition work to aid him in securing
proper representation' at- the Lewis and
Clark exposition in Portland * next
year. The State has appropriated $20,
000 for an exhibit there and the! Gov-
PARDEE TAKES NOTES.
DISPLAYING GREAT ENERGY.
Not only is the Sacramento Valley
making a great and successful effort
to show Its resources, but the city of
Sacramento â the central city of this
rich section â is doing something on its
own account. It has three paid repre
sentatives in St. Louis working for the
good of the whole valley during the
fair. The leader of these is General J.
G. Martine, and he is assisted by J.
H. Devine and H. P. Rowley. They
have headauarters and an office at the
Hamilton Hotel, and work there and
at the other large hotels of the city â
the Southern, Planters and Jefferson
particularly. Their efforts are confined
to meeting visitors of means and inter
esting them in the Sacramento Valley.
They talk with many of these, and
their work should bring good results.
They also assist in giving information
to visitors at the Sacramento Valley
displays at the palaces of Agriculture
and Horticulture.
Sacramento, Butte, *Colusa, El Do-,
rado, Glenn, Placer, Shasta, Sutter,
Tehama, Yuba and Yolo the coun
ties embraced in the association.
Equally effective work is being done
for each of them by the representatives
here.
The nut industry of California is re
ceiving full. exemplification at this ex
position and the result will probably
be the sale of many small tracts of
land to homeseekers who see possibili
ties in this branch of horticulture. The
nuts of California find a good sale in
the Hast, but the finer and selected
ones do . not usually reach the aver
age person and the masses of visitors
are surprised at the great size of some
of the walnuts and almonds shown.
It is the almond of which the greatest
display is made and the English wal
nut is a close second. There are also
filberts or hazelnuts, peanuts and
some other varieties, San Joaquin
County even showing pecans, which
are grown on an island ranch below
Stockton. ' The principal display of al
monds and walnuts is made in the hor
ticultural building, where stand pillars
of them two feet square, each surface
showing a different variety of nut.
Every county in the Palace of Agri
culture display exhibits nuts. In some
cases the ugly pillars that support the
roof of the building are encased with
glass frames, behind which are poured
nuts, the pillars thus being made or
namental and none the less useful.
Nuts are shown everywhere in cases,
both In the shell and also shelled to
show the excellence of their meat.
Mr. Kimball says that in the early
sixties a Chinaman brought from his
native country to Oakland some shad
dock seed, which he planted in the yard
of the home where he was employed,
and that there must be some shaddocks
standing there to-day. . â¢,. . ;r
The Sacramento Valley is going to
secure a total of more advertising out
of this fair than it has obtained during
almost all its previous existence. It haa
awakened to the fact that advertising
is necessary to draw homeseekers, and
it is entering into this fair with a de
termination to win. It will win. Re
sults are coming already, and the ex
position is not half over; neither have
the jbig crowds passed through its
gates. The three closing months will
in all likelihood make a new record for
attendance at world's fairs, and every
locality properly represented will reap
the benefit.
The new arrival from San Diego has
been given a place of honor in the Cal
ifornia display in the Palace of Horti
culture, and, as the venerable father
of the proud citrus family, It is gazed
upon with respect by all the other
fruits from their Jars and dishes.
The grape fruit, or pomelo, so gen
erally used as a ; breakfast dish, is but
a civilized shaddockâ a citrus hybrid
struggling on its way to the upper
tendom of the aristocratic orange and
lemon.
"By grafting and hybridizing," said
Commissioner Kimball, "the horticul
tural scientists have evolved the
orange and' other citrus fruits from
the shaddock. The Chinese did part of
this, and the shaddock's better flavored
children, finding their way across
Tibet and Russia to the Mediterranean,
were still further improved until we
have to-dav the perfected fruit grown
In California and other favored parts
of the world."
CALL BUREAU. PRESS BUILD
ING, WORLDS FAIR, July 18.âEx
position .visitors, who were fortunate
enough to drop into the San Diego
booth in California's main display, this
week, have learned something about
the golden orange that Is instructive
to them. Thev have learned that the
beautiful fruit has a genealogy that
extends far back through the cycles of
time into the veiled years that hold the
beginning of China in mystery and
that its ancestor was as rough as the
savage races of men that preceded the
present day civilized humanity. . Not
only the orange, but the lemon and
other citrus fruits owe their origin to
this common ancestor, evolution and
the science of horticulture having im
proved their flavor and given them
the prettv coats with which thev cut
such a dash in the world of fruits.
The humble shaddock with its rough,
thick rind and Its tough interior is the
ancestor of the orange. One of these,
of enormous 6ize, arrived for Frank
Kimball, the commissioner from San
Diego, and it was by Kimball and
through this Ehaddock that the visitors
were enlightened as to the family his
tory of the golden fruits that so de
light the eye and the palate, and
which every one firmly believed came
with all their golden glow and nectar
flavor direct from the garden of Eden.
"The father of all citrus fruits." said
Kimball, as he gazed affectionately at
the Â¦ homely shaddock, almost as big
as his head, that had made the trip to
St. Louis from the yard of W. H. Put
nam In the city of San Diego.

Jg Our Â«dle knowledge of the peo- ym
Â¥ pie on other worlds and how far 1
â¢ the people there differ from our \
inhabitants, can only be gnewed by
comparison with animal nature on this
small sphere of ours. More important
to us U a knowledge of ourselves.
"Kkow Thyself" was an old Greek
thought. How to take care of one's
own Dod j is not so simple as some think ;
the human mechanism is a wonderful
thing and requires watching.
One man who has done more to teach
the American people bow to care for their
bodies than almost anr other, is Dr. R. V.
Pierce, of Bufialo, N. Y., the Author of the
'Common Sense Medical Adviser.* He
says : It is not the quantity of the food
eaten which produces strength and health
(for some people can keep strong' on a very
meagre diet), but it it how much food is
absorbed and assimilated by the blood and
carried to nourish every organ of the body.
It is, therefore, vitally necessary for the
body that the storaach be in a healthy
state. If disease of the stomach, or what is
called "stomach trouble," prevents proper
nutrition then the heart, liver, lungs, and
kidneys do not get proper foodâthey are
not fed on rich red blood, and in conse-
qoence, begin to show signs of distress.
Outwardly these xignt may be pimples
and eruptions on skin, pale face, sleepless
nights, tired, lanpruid feelings, or, by reason
of the nerves not being fed on pure blood,
they become starved, and we receive a
warning in the pain we call neuralgia.
Rheumatism, too, is a blood disease. After
years of practice and study Dr. Pierce
found that an Alterative Extract, which he
named "Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Dis-
covery," made from the extracts of several
plants, invariably produced a tonic effect
upon the system. It helped the process of
absorption of the healthy elements in lbs
food and increased the red corpuscles of
the blood, as well as eliminated the poisons
from th<A>Tstem.
Business is business. No time for bead-
aches. Constipation causes them. Doctor
Pierce's Pleasant Pellets cure them by cur-
*m the cause. Laxative and mild.

In June the commissioners held their

YOSEMITE. July IS.â The fate of the
famous "Grizzly Giant," the pride of
all the stately sequoias of the Mariposa
big tree grove, has aroused much dis
cussion. The Yopemite Park Commis
sioners have already taken under seri
ous consideration the reports that the
biggest tree in the world, after its 5000
years of life, is at last dying and about
to fall. Just what to do to save the
giant is a question. Men highly versed
in forestry have advised the tricing up
of the tree, claiming that by staying
its tendency to tumble over its life may
be spared for many years to come. The
majority of the commissioners seem to
take this view, too, and have gone so
far as to order cables and plans for
holding the monarch in position. On
the other hand there are those who
point to the fact that, while the grove
contains the skeletons of many a fallen
giant sequoia, there Is not within the
memory of any one in the present gen
eration who ever saw or heard of one
sion was given to the "Grizzly Giant."
Owing to a serious accident which be
fell Commissioner J. C. Wilson and
necessitated his immediate return to
San Francisco the matter was held
over for further discussion.
State Road Commissioner Ellery was
delegated by the commission- to visit
the Mariposa grove of big trees and
to report his views on this subject.
Ellery after an Inspection stated that
with cables and guide wires he thought
that the "Grizzly Giant" could be pre
served for some time to come.
Commissioner J. C. Wilson states that
he has examined the "Grizzly Giant"
thoroughly and he thinks Â¦ that no
cables or wires will be necessary, as
the tree is only following the true
course of nature and beyond a slight
tendency to lean a bit is no worse, off
than twenty others of the Mariposa
group. of big trees, and is inclined to
let nature take its course, saying there
Is no cause to worry over the outcome,
as he firmly believes that it will be
many years before the "Grizzly Giant"
will have to' be braced up by unsightly
cable** and guy wires, marring the
picturesque beauty of the grove.

Secretary of> the Xavy Darling to-day
informed by letter R. H. F. Sewell of
New Orleans, the contractor who
made the arrangements with the Cu
ban Government to remove the wreck
of the Maine, that the Xavy Depart
ment has no authority either to aban
don the vessel or to permit its re
moval. He stated that Congress alone
can dispose of the public property of
the United States and that the Xavy
Department does not contemplate any
work upon the wreck. This is an ap
proval from the head of the depart
ment of the position heretofore taken
by Captain Diehl, judge advocate gen
eral, and ends, at least for the time
being, the controversy with regard to
raising the wreck.

CHICAGO. July IS.â Lack of t2l*

to caus* much uneasiness on * til* re

When the homeward voyage was bejroa
late in the afternoon all the passesffsr*
tried to find seats on the shady aid*
of the boat. This caused thÂ» steamer
to list heavily to starboard. Member*
of the crew hastened to close tha lowts
portholes, while many women sÂ«eurÂ«S
life preservers and crowded to thÂ»
steamer's ralL
This caused the boat to settlÂ» faxt&tr
to starboard and some of the pmnaÂ»
gers became thoroughly alarmed.
The crew was at once mustered %7
the officers and an attempt was martft
to reason with the frightened men and
women.
The passengers refused to obey or
ders and finally, in order to drive thesa
away from the rail, the fire hosÂ» was
used. It proved effective and tha
crowd went to the lower deck.
The women were persuaded Into 12ia
smoking-rooms of the cabin and were
reassured by the officers, while th.9
men were talked to outside by ether
members of the crew, j The ship held
to its course, despite the petitions of
the passengers to turn around, and

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESXO. Julv 15.â There is a big
upheaval in Fresno police circles and
as a result Mayor Stephens has called
an investigation for to-morrow night
that may result in the dismissal of half
of the department. Police Sergeant
Simpson, who was promoted to this
position but two weeks ago, is accused
of using his authority to exact tribute
from women of the tenderloin, Chin
ese and Japanese gamblers, to guaran
tee them immunity from arrest.
The charge is made also against
Patrolmen Frank Xelson, George
Welch, Charles Farman and J. S. Rob
inson. Most of the accusations are
made by other members of the depart
ment, particularly Officers E. B. Brad
ly and F. R.- Harriman. - The depart
ment has for some time been split into
two factions, and the appointment of
Simpson as sergeant has precipitated
the trouble that has just arisen. One
of the specific charges Is that on the
night of June 30, Simpson and Xel
son arrested R. S.- Faulkner for dis
turbing the peace. They started him
to jail, but in the courthouse park, it
is alleged, they offered to release him
if he would pay them twenty dollars.
He handed over the money, but told
the story to a relative the next day,
who In turn told it to Harriman.
Several Japanese, it is said, are
ready to testify that Simpson, Robin
son and Farman arrested them, but
released them on the payment of a
small sum of money. Sergeant Simp
son charges Harriman and Bradley
with neglecting their duty and behav
ing in a manner unbecoming an officer
so that they, too, will be on the official
carpet. Mayor Stephens has an
nounced his intentions of making the
investigation a public one and probing
the matter to the bottom.

life in the accident. By his own ad
mission Heller did not go back more
than 200 or 300 feet at any time after
his train stopped and had partly re
traced his steps. It had also been
shown that he held his flag rolled up.
Richards knew his signal was out of
order and uncertain of action and was
told by an engineer who was on the
station platform that it was clear. It
remained as it was and the crash fol
lowed.

INTERNATIONAL JURYMEN
MUST PAY OWN EXPENSES
Judges From Germany to World's
Fair Go to St. Ix>uis at Per
sonal Cost of $02,000..
BERLIN, July IS. â Some irritation
finds expression in the newspapers
here because the management of the
St. Louis Exposition declines to bear
the' expense of the international jury
men. It was assumed here, upon the
basis of the exposition publications,
that the expenses would be borne,
and the newspapers now speak of bad
faith in asking the Judges to take a
long and expensive trip at their own
expense to discharge a purely honor
ary function. One newspaper points
out that the expense of the hundred
German judges amounts to at least
$62,000. Other newspapers suggest
that the above outcome shows the
Germans acted too hastily in accept
ing the invitation to exhibit at St.
Louis.

doctor, "but nothing urgent. Never
theless he insisted that he was in
great pain. I found him in a nervous
condition."
During his trial Feld was noticeable
for his t-almness. He was the keenest
and most Interested person in the
courtroom, prompting his attorneys
and always alert to note material
points in his favor.
The tension caused by nerve control
in such cases has a strange way of

Miss Barrall, over whose small head
twenty-seven years have passed, is not
only interesting in her own diminutive
personality, but is a member of a well
known East Oakland family, being a
niece of Dr. C. G. R. Moutoux and also
of Mrs. Alexander Anderson, who
claims the unique honor of being the
only woman ever married on a war
ship in San Francisco Bay. Her mar
riage to Mr. Anderson on board the
Pensacola five years ago was an elab
orate affair, and conducted with all
the pomp and glory which guns, flags,
uniforms and a military band can give
to such an event.
Miss Barrall's father served as a
German officer during the Franco-
Prussian war. She has inherited the
vitality of her German ancestors and
has always enjoyed excellent health,
although it was some time before she
outgrew the pint cup, into which she
could be placed at her birth. She was
educated in Sari Francisco and speaks
and roads German as well as English.
Her debut will be made with the Ger
man Lilliputian Company, now in St.
Louis, which those clever midgets,
Franz. Ebert and Otto Zink, made fa
mous years ago.
OAKLAND. July IS.â The smallest
California woman on the stage, is the
distinction that must hereafter be ac
corded Miss Marie Barrall of East Oak
land. Barely four feet high, this tal
ented little lady will make her debut
shortly in St. Louis, for which place
she will leave in a few days. She has
a trim, graceful little figure and is
pretty as well as petite, her violet blue
eyes, shaded peculiarly with very long,
black lashes, lighting up her face ex
pressively whenever she talks. Miss
Barrall reads unusually well, and alto
gether the tiny Callfornian has much
in her favor and her friends and rela
tives here are sanguine of her instant
success.

OAKLAND, July 18. â Mrs. Eva
Turnbull, who escaped from the police
in March by sliding down a water pipe
from her room at the Windsor Hotel,
has been arrested by Policeman Me-
Sorley on a charge of larceny. The
complainant is E. Derosa, 845 Harri
son street, who says the woman stole
jewelry from him. When policeman
Murray and Sill tried to serve the
warrant five months ago they were
bidden to wait in a hallway until Mrs.
Turnbull had completed her toilet.
The patrolmen wearied after a long
delay and entered the room. They
found no occupant. Mrs. Turnbull
had climbed out of a window, let her
self down the water pipe and had dis
appeared. Policeman McSorley saw
the woman on the street to-day and
sent her to the Citv Prison.

Owing to the absence o' a number of
the members of the City Council, the
necessary eight members were not
present and nothing could be done to
ward taking steps to call a bond elec
tion. A quorum of the Council was
present.
"By the five-block provision" of the
statutes my people could use the Oak
land Transit Consolidated lines from
Fourteenth street to the water front.
There are, however, more cars . on
Broadway now than . it can well ac
commodate and the extra cars of our
line would crowd the street. In order
to avoid this the Oakland Transit Con
solidated made the proposition that iC
we would abandon our franchise over
the blocks from Fourteenth street to
the water front they would transfer
our passengers over all their lines. Thia
we have agred to."
The new railway is intended to play
an important part in the proposed de
velopment of a new part of the city.
If the proposed bond election carries
the Sather tract will be purchased for
a park site and this new road extended
out will tap that entire section. The
Adams people have agreed to build a
boulevard 110 feet in width across
Adams Point and a large section of the
city will thus be brought into touch for
a few minutes' r!de.
By the permission of the City Coun
cil the 'corkscrew" franchise running
through the heart of the city was
abandoned this evening by the Web
ster Street and Park Railway Com
pany. In consideration of the aban
donment of this franchise, the Oak
land Transit Consolidated has agreed
to transfer passengers from the Park
Railway to all of its lines. This agree
ment was reached between the two
lines in order to relieve the congestion
the cars would cause on Broadway, if
both lines operated upon this street.
Attorney George W. Reed, represent
ing' the Webster Street and Park Rail
way, said this evening:

NO HINTS OF SUICIDE.
The property of the deceased physi
cian remains at his. lodgings on Six
it enth street and nothing was found
There was a slight singeing of the
hair, but thÂ«Â»re were no powder burns,
having it probable that the pistol was
held pome distance from the body
vhen fired. The circumstance also that
the body was covered with freshly
cut twigs excites the authorities to sus
picion, but what will result from it all
can only be told by the action of the
Sheriff's office. The body was discov
ered outside the city limits and the
Chief of Police of this city cannot as
sume charge of the matter.
One point strongly in favor of the
murder theory is the fact that the pis
tol has not been found. Under Sheriff
Hanilin and Dr. O. D. Hamlin caused
the creek in which the body was found
to be drained to-day, but found no
trace of a weapon. If the case is one
cf suicide the %yeapon may rc?t in the
deep undergrowth nearby, but this is
improbable. Death must have been in
etantaneous.
One week ago yesterday Dr.
Hill informed Mrs. Burrall that
he could not depart on the date he
had stated and paid his rent until to
day. He was seen to return home last
Tuesday evpnirig and to take his de
parture on Wednesday morning. After
that time, and until his body was iden
tified, nothing was s=een of him.
There is much conjecture as to the
cause of death. The physicians who
performed the autopsy are positive
tile man could not have shot himself,
Blb the bullet passed in at the base
of the skull -and lodged in the center
of the frontal bone. The theory of
murder is aiso sustained by the fact
that the hat of the deceased was found
some distance from the spot vihcre his
body lay. and that the body was cov
ered with twigs that had been but re
cently cut from trees in the vicinity.
On an embankment six feet high and
shove the body were marks as of the
dragging of some object. It remains
for the investigation now started to
prove whether the physician was
dragged over this embankment after
being the victim of murder, or whether
his body toppled into the gully in the
Â«-vent that he committed suicide.
XO PISTOL FOUND.
Hill went to Mrs. Burrall's house and
rented a room for one month and at
the expiration of that time expressed
his desire to depart from Oakland. He
was a man of quiet disposition, de
parting from his room about 7 o'clock
in the morning and returning home
about 6 in the evening. He seldom spoke
to any one. and had few visitors. His
occupation was given as that of an
osteopath phypician and little atten
tion was paid to his affairs.
PAID RENT AHEAD.
The body recovered from the Pied
mont hills Saturday night was to-day
identified as that of Dr. Charles F. Hill
of Los Angeles.
The identification was made by Mrs.
M. L. Burrall of 614 Sixteenth street,
but the mystery of the death is un
solved- Theories of murder and of
suicide prevail.
The investigation has been under
taken by the Sheriff of Alameda Coun
ty, and Under Sheriff J. J. Hanifin Jr.
has been placed in charge. To-day he
made a complete search of the desolate
location where the body was found.
Marks on the bill side as if a body
might have been dragged down were
discovered.
Mrs. Burrall says she recognized the
picture of the deceased in the morn
ing i>apers and that she immediately
visited the Morgue, where she identified
the body. She says there is no doubt
that the man who was found in
the creek at the base of the Piedmont
hills is her late lodger. Dr. Charles

In order to stop the spread of glan
ders in the Niles and Centerville dis
tricts the Board of Supervisors to-day
adopted a resolution giving Supervisor
Horner the power to employ three ex
perts and destroy nil horses found af
fected with the disease. From inves
tigation already made it has been dis
covered that a number of 'horses in
the district are in an advanced stage
of the disease and it is believed that
with others the malady is in a state
of incubation.
A telegram. received from State Vet
erinary "Blemmer by the District At
torney ordering all horses found in
fected with the disease, to be destroy-,
ed was referred to the Board of Su
pervisors and it was upon this tele
gram that action was taken. Under
the law the Supervisors have this
power. Seven horses are now in quar
antine and it is expected trmt in the
investigation to be made many others
will be found.

Elbel's story reveals that his own
carelessness is responsible for the boy's
death. Against the wishes of the boy's
mother Elbel took him into the hills
back of Berkeley to shoot squirrels and
while both were looking down a squir
rel hole waiting for the animal to come
out the shotgun Elbel carried was dis
charged. Young Whitaker received the
full charge in the abdomen and was
literally torn to pieces.
In SDite of his wounds, however,' the
boy retained consciousness and walked
across a ravine until he reached a
road. There he lay until Elbel secured
a stretcher, upon which he was first
carried home and then to Fabiola Hos
pital, where he died at midnight while
being operated on.
There will be no prosecution of Wil
liam Elbel for the shooting of his
cousin, John Howard Whitaker, in the
Berkeley hills last night because the
police authorities are satisfied that it
was purely an accident. Coroner Mehr
mann will hold an inquest to-morrow
in Oakland, when Elbel will again give
his account of the tragedy.

The change means an abandonment
of the position taken last year by
Assessor Dalton when he raised the
assessment of the water company sev
eral millions of dollars. The total
assessment of the county cannot be
obtained. The work is incomplete and
while the pages of the books are
footed, the totals have not been added,
and there is no index to the work.
All the taxes of the Contra Costa
Water Company were protested under
the increased assessment last year and
the matter is now in the courts.
It was upon these increases that C.
S. MacMullan claimed commissions
from the county for $20,000 and now
has a suit pending in the courts for
the collection of this amount. He al
leges that the Supervisors agreed to
allow him half the taxes upon undis
covered property in the county. Upon
the increase of these millions MacMul
lan lays claim to half of the taxes,
while as yet the taxes have never been
paid.
Last year the water in Lake Chabot
was assessed in two equal parts to
Brooklyn and Eden townships at
$450,000 to each township. This year
the assessment is but $100 for each
half. The water in Lake Temescal,
assessed last year for {45,000, is now
assessed at $100, The assessment of
franchises of the water company has
also been put at a nominal figure.
Last year the franchise in Alameda
County was assessed at $75,000; in
Oakland, $300,000; in Brooklyn Town
ship, $100,000; in Berkeley, $75,000; in
Oakland Township, $250,000; in Eden
Township, $75,000; in Washington
Township, $75,000. This year these
assessments have all been reduced to
small sums.
The Contra Costa Water Company is
a big winner by the assessment placed
upon its water and franchises this
year by Henry P. Dalton. According
to the rolls turned over to the Board
of Supervisors to-day, water, which
last year was assessed at $94 5,000 is
assessed at $300. The assessment rolls
were surrendered by Assessor Dalton
at noon to-day to the Board of Super
visors, sitting as a Board of Equali
zation. They are in a very incomplete
condition, but from an examination of
different volumes the assessment of
franchises was found to be merely
nominal.

The first exercises of the new in
stitution will take place on August 16.,
and the school will continue in opera
tion until December 22, when it will
close for the regular Christmas vaca
tion, which lasts until January 9.
The first school year will end May 10,
1905. The full course of instruction
will be three years for university grad
uates and four years for others.
For the present the institution will
be under the direct control of the
American Unitarian Association. The
work will be so arranged that students
so desiring will be enabled to do a
considerable part of their work at the
University of California.
Through the generosity of Mr. and
Mrs. Francis Cutting of Oakland and
Mr. and Mrs. Horace Davis of San
Francisco, all of whom are well
known members of the Unitarian
church, a school for the training of
students for the Unitarian ministry
will be opened in the parish house of
the First Unitarian Church of this city
on August 12. The Rev. Earl Morse
Wilbur of the Unitarian Theological
College of Meadville, Pa., has been
appointed dean of the new school, and
he will be assisted in the work of in
struction by several well-known min
isters of this city.
While the new institution will be
under the patronage of the Unitarian
church and is intended primarily for
the instruction of students desiring to
enter the Unitarian ministry, its
founders do not intend that it shall
be a sectarian school, and its direct
end will be to prepare deserving stu
dents of every denomination for effi
cient work in the ministry. Xo tuition
fee will be charged.

NEW YORK, July IS.â Of the half
score injured in the tornado which de
\astated the Quaker settlement near
Chappaqua, X. Y., Saturday night all
are now expected to recover except
two. They are Mrs. Anna Washburn.
whose mother, Mrs. Mary Hibbs of
Philadelphia, was crushed to death in
the ruins of the Washburn home, and
Charles Dodfe, who was caught un
der the branches of a falling tree.
A search of the neighborhood shows
that the storm created great havoc
during the few minutes which it raged.
In the tree tops for more than a mile

Isabel Otis Bigelow, widow of Sam
uel C. Bigelow, who was president of
the Savings and Loan Society, yester
day secured an order from Judge
Troutt for a family allowance of $750
a month from the estate. Bigelow
died on January 7 and his will was ad
mitted to probate on February 2, at
which time the widow obtained an al
lowance of $1000 a month pending the
filing of the inventory of the estate.
The inventory was brought to the
court on May 26, showing the estate
to be worth $343,228, but under the
wording of the first allowance Mrs.
Bigelow has received nothing since
the inventory was filed. Therefore the
order of yesterday was necessary.
The chief items in the inventory of
Bigelow's estate were: Interest in the
Standard Electric Company, $74,189;
stock in the Oakland Bank of Savings,
$46,750, and shares in, the Gas Con
sumers' Association, $40,000.
Court Orders Payment of $750 a
Month to Isabel O. Biselow.

The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday adopted a resolution calling
on certain city officials to furnish new
bonds, aa those now on file are irregu
lar. Those who must give new bonds
include Fire Commissioner Parry.
$10,000; Police Commissioner H. W.
Hutton. $5000: Commissioner of Public
Works M. J. Casey, $25,000. They pro
vided bonds of the Empire State
Surety Company, which Insurance
Commissioner Wolf reported had with
drawn from the State of California.
Poundkeeper Irwln is also guaranteed
by the company, but the committee
does not recognize him as such and
took no action in his case.
The Union Surety Company, which
is now In the hands of a receiver and
whose certificate to do business was
revoked by the Insurance Commis
sioner, was on the bonds of Supervis
ors Bent and Finn, who must on that
account furnish new security.
The fact that certain employes had
furnished bonds running' in favor of
the city instead of the em
ploying boards was held by â¢ the
City Attorney to be sufficient, .as the
boards themselves are responsible
under their personal bonds.
Property Clerk Dinen must furnish
a new bond, as his three personal sure
ties have not Qualified for $10,000 each,
the full amount of his bond.
\ Chairman Brandenstein suggested to
the committee that a charter amend
ment be^ submitted to the people pro
viding that the age limit of eligibles for
appointment on the police force be fixed
at 25 years instead of 21. Chief of Po
lice Wittman thought the latter age is
too young for efficient service. No
action was taken on Brandenstein's
suggestion.
The committee accepted the state
ment of the United Railroads provid
ing for the payment to the city of $21,
649 56 as percentage on receipts ag
gregating $1,046,776 35.
The City Engineer was requested to
prepare plans for adding bronze lamps
to the safety station at Powell and
Market streets Bhould funds be avail
able for the purpose.
The petition of W. S. Harper for a
lease to a block on the ocean beach for
bathing purposes was denied and the
petitioner was referred the Park
Commission.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
received a report from Supervisor
D'Ancona taking the Health Board to
task for violating certain specific di
rections of the' budget in the salary
roll of the central office of the Health
Department relating to the selection
of subordinates from the civil service
eligible lists. â¢ The report also charges
the Health Board with exceeding its
salary allowances, as fixed by the
budget. The report follows:
The present salary roll of the central office
of the Board of Health violates the specific
directions of the budget as follows:
Budget allowance for executive office, $2400;
allowance as per salary roll, Board of Health,
$52S0.
Budget allowance â Chemists, laboratories,
bacteriologists, toxicologists and helpers, in
cluding expert testimony. $5700; allowance as
per salary roll of Board of Health, $10,140.
Of thÂ« allowance for food inspection by
civil seivlce appointees $9060 has been diverted
to pay the salaries of non-civil service ap
pointees in the executive office and newly
created positions of laboratory assistants.
The civil Â»ervlcÂ« suffers as much from the
actions of the Board of Health relating to
the salary roll of this fiscal year as from
the resolutions of January 8, 1904.
The attention of the Auditor should be called
to these violations of the restrictions Imposed
by the budget and he should be requested and
directed:
1. Not to audit any salary demand in the
executive office (the present designation being
health officer and deputy health officer) In ex
cess of $ < J400.
2. Not to audit salaries of F. G. Canney,
bacteriologist: A. C. Bothe, chemist and su
perintendent food department: H. C. Costa, as
sistant diemlBt; K. G. Kendall, chemist's
helper: A. S. Adler and F. J. Tlllman. labora
tory medical assistants (now aggregating $10,
140) in excess of the budget allowance of $5700.
3. Not to audit the salaries of W. J. Walsh,
J. B. Hannah. Inspecting physicians; H. B.
Miller, B. M. Hinkle, factory and workshop In
spectors, as these positions should be filled by
appointees from the eligible list of assistant
sanitary inspectors, the allowance in the budget
for inspection of factories, workshops, etc.,
having been made solely for sanitary inspec
tion by appointees from the eligible lists.
Mayor Schmitz objected to the im
mediate approval of the Finance Com
mittee's report, as requested by D'An
coaa, before the Health Board had
been heard regarding the charges con
tained therein. D'Ancona consented to
postponing consideration of the report
for one week.

der. He shot and killed Charles Hartmann on
Sunday, July 10. at 321 Third street- and
wounded his brother, George Hartmann, who
died from lockjaw at McXutfs Hospital last
Sunday.
The two other charter amendments
provide for an increase in the salaries
of lieutenants in the Fire Department
from $100 to $110 per month, of hos
tlers from $60 to $75 and of guards in
the House of Correction from $50 to
$75.
The petition of International Union
of Steam Engineers No. 68 and Marine
Engineers' Beneficial Association No.
35 that a charter amendment be sub
mitted providing for the raising of sal
aries of engineers in the Fire Depart
ment to $1680 was referred to the
Charter Amendment Committee. The
petition asserts that the skill and ex
perience required from the engineer,
the confining nature of his duties and
the fact that the present compensation
of $112 50 is much less than paid for
similar service by private concerns
prove the justness of the request.
Supervisor Braunhart yesterday
submitted to the Board of Supervisors
three proposed charter amendments,
which were referred to the Charter
Amendment Committee for considera
tion and report. The first of these
provides that subdivision 9, section 9,
chapter 2, article 3 of the charter be
amended to read as follows:
"Any owner or owners of lots or
lands fronting upon any street, the
width and grade of which have been
established by the Supervisors, may
perform grading work at his or their
own expense after obtaining permis
sion from the Board of Works so to
do, which permission shall not be
granted without approval of the
Board of Supervisors."
Under the present law the Board of
Works has sole power to grant such
permits and the amendment Is de
signed to require the consent of the
Supervisors thereto. Braunhart ex
plained that the amendment was in
tended to prevent Gray Bros, from ex
cavating lands when protests are filed
by surrounding property owners.
The Board of Supervisors held their '
final meeting as the Board of Equali
zation yesterday morning. The hear
ing of complaints on the alleged high
assessments was continued until noon,
when the functions of the board cama
to an end, as prescribed by law.
The Assessor has been working
night and day on the cases that have
been referred to him for further con
sideration, and It was almost 12
o'clock before he appeared with a list
of the property on which the assess
ments had been reduced. The usual
list of complaints was heard and all
referred to the Assessor for investiga
tion. Most of the complaints were
based on the alleged inequality of the
assessments in the same blocks. Be
fore adjourning the board passed a
resolution empowering the Assessor
to make or refuse reductions on all
complaints referred to him at the pre
vious sessions of the board. Among
those whose complaints were referred
to him yesterday were: P. F. Butler,

ing rules and regulations for the sani

ling of milk. Action was taken at the

An attorney representing certain
dairymen informed the board that the
proposed rules were too drastic and
would require such expenditure of
moneys in the alteration of dairies that
tho price of milk would surely be in
creased as a result. He stated that the
dealers desired to submit some amend
ments and with that understanding the
Â¦ matter went over until next Monday
at 2:15 x>. m. â¢ Supervisor D'Ancona

A New York convict recently released returned the
other day to his! prison home and begged a haven of
shame because after long imprisonment and the brand
of the malefactor upon him he found that in the world
of free people he must either steal or starve. Is this
an indictment of our charity and , oar civilization or
another lesson of that terrible law of cause and effect
which operates as well in the moral world as in the
physical? - - .
Germany is exercising every endeavor of national au
thority to convict the bands of anarchists that have
made their headquarters in leading German cities to
operate their schemes of death against Russia. This
effort of the Government of Emperor William must
meet with applause from every civilized people. How
ever nations may differ in their theory and practice of
national development 'they, must be one against the an
archist â the common. and cowardly enemy of them all.
THE SHIPTON PROPHECYâSub
scriber. Vallejo. Cal. What was
palmed on the public as the prophecy
of Mother Shlpton. who lived 14 S 3
1560. was written by one Charles
Hlndley and put in circulation in
IS 62. It is as follows:
Carrtag?s without horses shall go.
And accidents fill the world with woe;
Around the world thoughts will fly
In the twinkling of an eye;
The world upatde down shall bt
And gold be found at root of tree.
Through hills man shall ride.
And no hone by his stde:
Vnder water man shall walk.
Shall ride, shall sleep, shall talk;
In the air men rhall be seen
In white, m black. In green;
Iron in the water shall float
As easy aa a wooden boat:
Oold shall be found 'mid itsse
In a land that's now unknown:
Fire and water shall wonders do;
England shall at last admit a J-w;
And this world to an end shall come
In eighteen hundred and elghty-oae.
To the Editor of The Sunâ Sir: Below
is a translation of a letter to El Mundo
of Havana. c. e. Noxon.
Rochester, June 27.
"Within three or four years the United
States will find Itself involved in a dis
astrous war with Mexico, Cuba, France.
Germany and some other power, Euro
pean or American, the name of which
I am at a loss to give at present. As
a consequence of this war, the United
States will lose a great deal of its ter
ritory and power; in fact, nearly half
of that which It possesses to-day. Mex
ico will raise itself to the front rank of
nations, recovering some of its terri
tory lost to the United Statesâ such as
California, Texas and New Mexico.
And Porto Rico, Hay ti and Santo Do
mingo will solidify with Cuba into one
"nation."
The writer is not a Mexican, as you
may perhaps conjecture, but a Cuban
in full possession of his mental facul
tlon and a friend and admir
er of the Yankee people. and
one who believes, although he is
not a spiritualist, and for some reaaon
that he cannot explain, that for a frac
tion of a moment the veil of the future
has been torn aside and enabled him
to predict the events cited about. P.
Havana, June 11
A Cuban's Prophecy
river.
The original Columbia River jetty was completed in
1895. A channel thirty-one feet in depth was then af
forded unhindered by any obstruction in the river's
mouth. According to the Oregon Journal the unceasing
action of the littoral currents gradually piled up the
sand along the shore line south of the river's mouth
and caused the south shore line to move seaward until it
was even with Cape Disappointment on the north bank
of the river.
The jetty, under these conditions, no longer prevented
depositing of sand on the bar, which,' beginning near the
outer terminus of the original jetty, curves outward and
northward, lying, as the Journal says, "Like a great
crescent, one point buried in the shoals south of the
jetty and the other in the sands of Cape Disappoint

Portland is looking forward to the removal of the bar

A HERO and great man passed away when Paul
Kruger looked his last upon this world and folded
his hands in the last sleep. In the territory of the
Orange Free State and that of the Transvaal Republic
Great Britain has the material for a\South African em
pire. But it was taken from wild men and the wilder
ness by other hands than hers. Of all who wrought in
that mighty conquest none bore a higher part than Paul
Kruger. He was a heroic figure from his infancy. As a
child he marched by his father's side in the great trek of
1835, and by his father's side twelve years later he
fought at Boomplatz in 1847 against the British, who
had followed the Boers into their solitude where they
had sought liberty. So from his cradle he heard around
him the aspirations, for freedom, and was a part of that
most wonderful of all companies of men who sought it
in the wild country and founded there its institutions and
ordinances. This old South African was among the
great men of his time. He had not the benefit of courts
and capitals and colleges. His wisdom was primitive in
its derivation. It was native. In diplomacy and states
manship he was a match for any public man of his time.
In courage he was unequaled. Whether going single
handed against a savage lion or leading an inferior force
in battle against superior numbers, he was the incarna
tion of cool headed and steady handed and stout hearted
courage. Let men of all nations pause in their occupa
tions and pray that the spirits kindred to Paul Kruger
may be always found upon the earth.
THE DEATH OF OOM PAUL.
Blanc is popularly credited with an
income of 52.000.000 a year and the
probability is that it Is over rather
than under that figure. The story of
the origin of his millions is a familiar
one here, but it may be less generally
known at home. M. Blanc'a father,
Francis Blanc, was the actual founder
of Monte Carlo as it now exists. Blanc
purchased the Monaco concession,
Â¦which up to that time had been badly
managed, for what was then thought
to be an excessive price â 1330,000. In
his hands it proved an inexhaustible
bonanza. "Red loses and black loses,"
he said in that celebrated pun of his,
"but Blanc (white). â¢ always wins!"
And. thanks to the percentage in fa
vor of the bank. Blanc kept on win
ning to such an extent that when he
died about twenty-five years ago, with
turir.g the blue ribbon of the turf and
avenging Trafalgar, as ihs French
owner of Giadiateur by his famous
victory In 1S65 wiped out the bitter
memory of Waterloo. For Blanc has
the reputation of accomplishing what
ever he undertakes, especially on the
turf, ar.d he has set his heart on add
ing the Derby to his long list of vic
tories. His recent success in winning
Â¦with Ajax the Grand Prix, for the
seventh time, has convinced his ad
mirers that his star is still in the
ascendant. So phenomenal is his good
fortune considered that here the man
in the street swears "by the luck of
Blanc himself." Last year Blanc's
winnings on the French turf, in stakes
alone, amounted to 5240.000 â a sum
never before equaled by a continental
owner of race horses, and how much
more he made through bets no man
but himself knows. This year prom
ises to be a still more fortunate one
for him on the turf, for in stakes he
has already pocketed over 5200,000.
No theory of luck, however, will ac
count for a tithe of Blanc's successes
on the race track. It Is enormous
wealth, allied to brains and energy,
that has placed him so far ahead of all
of his turf compatriots. He sticks at
no money when he has made up his
mind to secure a crack steed and his
Judgment of horseflesh Is marvelous.
Even as a schoolboy a stable contained
far greater attractions for him than a
candy shop. It was a genuine pas
sion that caused him to name his
earliest mount First Love. He has
owned a legion of equine loves since
then, for he possesses what is reputed
to be the largest breeding establish
ment thoroughbred horses In the
world, but every one of his steeds has
had an equally warm place in his af
fections. He personally supervises
everything connected with the man
agement of his magnificent stud farm
and training quarters. Summer morn
ings find him up at 4 o'clock and un
til late in the evenings he busies him
self with the details of his vast estab
lishment. It Is a labor of love with
him. but it Is hard nevertheless. He
plays the racing game to win and
adopts the same methods that com
mand success in any commercial pur
suit- Though Frenchmen swear by
him. he is far from being a typical
Frenchman- Nothing disturbs his
sangfroid. Winning or losing he never
displays any emotion. His tempera
ment Is Anglo-Saxon rather than
Gallic. Â¦ -::*;,
At a recent Sunday picnic, according to sworn testi
mony following a tragedy,- the fighting of the merry
makers continued from 9 o'clock in the morning until
9 o'clock at night, the festivities reaching an appar
ently and certainly logical conclusion in a murder. This
incident seemingly removes Sunday picnics as a bone of
contention for many of our worthy fellow citizens. Re
creation at the cost of one's life is rather a stiff price to
pay.
That night the crowd at the perform
ance had to be turned away an hour
before the doors opened.
"You young men I have brought up
here to nothing but defeat- Here we
are, a thousand miles from home and
kind parents and upon me falls the
responsibility for this blight upon all
your young lives. I cannot stand it; It
is too much â too-00 much!"
Then the gaping crowd of townsfolk
which had gathered about the orator
was stunned to see him suddenly throw
off his coat and hat and dash for the
edge of the wharf, desperation writ
large on his countenance. Before he
could reach the water, however. Dick
TuIIy and Milt Schwartz seized him
and cried loudly to him to desist from
his attempt at self destruction. For
several minutes Morse was begging to
be released that he might end all in
the sound. Then by degrees he became
mollified.
California, even "Brick" was downcast
for the instant.
Then standing there in the midst of
the dejected group on the wharf, Clin
ton's presence of mind suddenly flick
ered Into a glow. With tears In his
eyes he addressed the crowd:
"Boys, you have all been my friends
and I thank you for your kind sup
port to me on this -hard trip. But one
failure after another has not failed to
have its effect upon me. We have been
against the hardest kind of luck and
I have felt it more keenly than you
all." *
Morse's voice shook as he wiped his
eyes.
Westminster died and his racing
string was sold, M. Blanc bought for
his stud the famous Flying Fox for
the record price of 5200,000. English
sportsmen generally considered that
he^had paid for the horse much more
than he was really worth, but M.
Blanc knew what he was about, as
much as his, father did when he
bought the Monaco concession, and re
marked that he would have no diffi
culty in regaining the money as soon
as the offspring of Flying Fox should
show their speed on the track. This
is the first year that he has been able
to race any of them and already they
have recouped him for what their sire
cost. Ajax's winnings alone now
amount to ; 125,000. Gouvernant. the
colt that lost the Derby, has $24,000
in stakes to his credit. Profane and
La Devote have acquitted themselves
well. Adam, Fier, Genial, Jardy,
Val d'Or and Saint Michel have not
yet run, but M. Blanc expects that
they will prove fully as worthy of
their great sire as AJax. With such
a string of fliers In his stable the pop
ular opinion that at 48 the most bril
liant period of his turf career is yet
before him seems fully Justified.
Qreat as have been his successes on
the turf, his chief ambition is to dis
tinguish himself by permanently im
proving the breed of fast horses. He
is the most trusted adviser of the
French Government in the matter of
horse breeding for cavalry mounts
and has made some pecuniary sacri
fices for patriotism. After refusing
560,000 for Vinicius, which failed to
win the Derby in 1903, he sold the
horse to the French Government for
half that sum. Quo Vadis, the win
ner of the Grand Prix that year, he
sold to Russia for 550,000, and for
his services to Russian horse breeding
the Czar has made him a grand officer
of the Order of St. Stanislaus.

Popular interest in the expected letter is of course
great, but it is an interest inspired mainly by curiosity.
To every sort of student of politics there is something
notable and amusing in the situation, and naturally
enough every one awaits with some eagerness to see how
the hitherto silent man of Esopus will meet the problem.
There is a general belief that the famous telegram to the
St. Louis convention, which forced the silver men to
virtually adopt a gold platform, was not original with
the Judge himself, but was inspired and perhaps actually
written by Hill or Belmont. One of the things there
fore which the public expects of the letter is some sort
of revelation of what manner of man Judge Parker is.
Up to this time it is not clear whether he is a real man,
with a man's convictions on political issues, or only a
dummy.
The Judge, in fact, can no longer play the part of a
sphinx. His letter of acceptance must reveal something,
for even should he strive to avoid dealing clearly with
the points of controversy in the ranks of his party, the
mere fact of his dodging them would be a revelation..
RARELY in our history has a Presidential candi
date had a more interesting or a more delicate task
before him in the writing of his letter of accept
ance than Judge Parker has at this juncture. He is him
self supposed to be a conservative Democrat, the plat
form given him by the St. Louis convention is virtually
made up of Republican planks out of which the native
strength has been carefully exhausted, while the party
to whose^ voters he must appeal is made up mainly of
radicals who object not only to the weakness of the plat
form declarations, but to the conservatism of the candi
date himself. To frame a letter that will serve to dissi
pate objections, harmonize the discordant and enthuse
the indifferent is certainly a task sufficient to tax all that
any statesman ever had of courage, diplomacy and lead
ership.
PARKER AND HIS TASK.
The Board of Public Works has issued peremptory or
ders that the streets and walks of the city in and out of
the business district must be cleared of their obstructions
to vehicles and pedestrians. What a strange feeling of
reckless confidence will take possession of us if the or
der is obeyed and we will be able to travel about the
town without imminent danger- to our neck or nervous
system. The usurpation of public streets for private
purposes has become chronic in San Francisco.
hear of the Immense popularity of that
candidate for United States Senator.
He is popular and conspicuous not be
cause of any rreat ability or particu
lar fitness for the ofilce, but because of
his peculiar industry in working for
the office â not because the people want
him, but because he wants the office.
This game has been played, especial
ly in the country counties, until it has
become sickening and disgusting. It
has been the means of pushing men to
the front who would never have got
there by reason of any special fitness
for the positions which they have pro
cured by this most objectionable and
even contemptible political trick. It is
time this kind of political work was
condemned, and that any man who re
sorts to it should be promptly retired
to private life. .
We want men to represent us In the
United States Senate who have correct
and broad ideas, and who have the
ability and courage to express them.
And the man who cannot stand up
openly and independently before our
people and show them that he is pos
sessed of these essential characteris
tics has no right to ask this great free
people to place him In a position where
we require, and have a right to ex
pect, the exhibition and use of that
ability which he does not possess.
We should choose men for the Legis
lature who have intelligence, discretion
and honor to select the very best ma
terial we have for the high office of
United States Senator, and should
leave them free to make such selection.
If they fail in this great responsibility,
they should be retired at the first op
portunity as unfit for legislative
honors. E. V. SPENCER.

endowment â the ability to take care

nothing of him. As soon as Blanc be
came of age he got together a racing
stable, displaying rare Judgment in his
selections, and purchased the Celle
St. Cloud stud farm on the heights of
Suresnes, near Paris. His require
ments soon outgrew this and he began
buying property on all sides. The
most notable accession to his domain
was made by the purchase from the
ex-Empress Eugenie of the Immense
park at La Celle St. Cloud. It con
tained a chateau in which royalty had
been content to sojourn and here M.
Blanc made his home for some years.
M. Blanc believes that it p"ays to get

The romancers who promoted the act in Congress
talked of the stewing millions in the city slums who
would rush for these irrigated lands and establish their
vine and fig tree thereon. So far there has been no
movement of that kind and none, organized or unorgan
ized, except the movement of the Mormons toward
every place where the United States is building a reser
voir or digging a ditch. The church once held Nevada,
but withdrew from the Washoe Valley and from Lincoln
County to the valley of the Rio Virgin because of the
cost of maintaining irrigation. Now the United States
is bearing the cost and toward the first region to # be ir
rigated in Churchill County the vanguard of a great
Mormon colony is moving. It is safe to say that in the
States and Territories where the Government is spend
ing thirty or forty millions on irrigation eight-tenths of
the land will go to the Mormons.
The church is never taken by surprise. It never
sleeps. When the first National Irrigation Congress
met in Salt Lake there were no Mormon delegates.
Most of the apostles were expiating religious lechery
in the Territorial penitentiary. The congress as an act
of grace and courtesy invited President Woodruff and
Apostle George Q. Cannon to address it and they ac
cepted. Witness the change since then. The last con
gress met at Ogden and was dominated by the Mor
mons. George Maxwell and Mr. Boothe found it neces
sary to make an alliance with them and the junction of
forces controlled the congress. The next meeting was
located by the open dictation of Apostle John Henry
Smith, and the church took charge of public opinion
and policy on irrigation so far as they are influenced by
the congress.
The romantic irrigators whose fancy saw eighty mil
lions of people dressed in purple and fine linen and far
ing sumptuously every day on the lands irrigated by the
Government did not take the trouble to think that to
get prompt occupancy of these lands organization and
urging are needed.
WHILE the husbandman slept the enemy sowed
tares. While the general public is sleeping off
its astonishment caused by the testimony in
Senator Smoot's case the Mormon church is reaching
far afield for political power. Its colonization scheme is
in the hands of the youngest of the twelve apostles, a
son of the late President Woodruff, who has all the
Yankee edge of his able father joined to a fanatical de
votion to polygamy and the political interests of the
church.
He is the son of one of a herd of wives acquired by
his father, and from the Mormon standpoint deserves
the religious honors that have come to him notwith
standing his youth. He is pushing colonization in Wy
oming, New Mexico and Arizona with great energy and
intelligence. The church is possessed of ample eapital.
Its annual receipts exceed those of the State of Utah and
it uses the money for the aggrandizement of Mormon
ism everywhere. In its colonization schemes in the arid
country the church treasury has been heavily drawn
upon to provide irrigation works. It was found that this
was so expensive that the hierarchy be"gan to flinch.
The first outlay was too much for the church nerve. But
its ambition to .control Wyoming, Idaho, the coming
States of New Mexico and Arizona, and to regain Ne
vada is not to be lightly given up.
In the dilemma disclosed by the cost of irrigation for
its colonies occurred one of those events that is re
garded by the church as miraculous. The Mormons be
lieve that Brigham Young had gulls created in midair to
destroy the grasshoppers that were devouring their
crops. They believe that the Lord hardened the Gen
tile heart of Buchanan to send Albert Sidney Johnston
into Utah with his force of regular troops to make a
market for their hay and grain, though it went there to
exterminate the church.
In the books of the faithful it will hereafter be written
that the sons of God were blessed in the preservation of
these ordinances by the act of the enemy, the Govern
ment of the United States, in providing at its cost the
means of watering the wilderness and the waste places
for the children of the Lord. The Federal irrigation act
will be applied almost wholly within the region that the
church covets. If the act had been entitled "An act to
provide the means for extending the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints and to increase the political
power thereof." it would have exactly expressed the sit
uation.
from the south. North of the jetty there is deep enough
water to float the largest vessel. The channel does not
begin to shoal until it passes out beyond the shelter of
the jetty. Therefore it is supposed that when the jetty
has beeti extended far enough to shut off the drift of
sand from the south the entire problem will be solved;
that thereafter the Columbia River will gouge out the
channel and keep it free from obstructions.
Within the past three months the jetty has been ex
tended 4374 feet and the rock work has been done for
that distance. Congress will probably be asHced next
winter to appropriate $1,500,000, which will provide for
the completion of the south jetty. The plans of the en
gineers include the construction, also, of a north jetty,
but it is not likely that any appropriation will be asked
for that work at the next session of Congress, because
the necessity for its construction is still undetermined.
The cost of the entire enterprise, including the north
jetty, is estimated at $3,465,000, of which $2,260,000 is
for the extension of the south jetty. Since April more
than 100,000 tons of rock have been placed. A force of
225 men, ir engines and 100 cars is constantly employed
and will be engaged in the work until the weather pre
vents.

Pedro Gestros was taken from the

by the police and charged with assault
with a deadly weapon. Gestros had
a fight with a man on Pacific street
two weeks ago and both were injured.
His antagonist, being the least injured,
was charged at the time. Gestros has
been in the hospital since the en

day to go to Jail.
Detective Thomas Ryan says that
he will charge A h Sow Â» the Chinese
woman who. it is alleged, tried to
poison her husband a week ago to

The police have endeavored to y get

The Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors held a session
last night to consider the proposed
amendment to the charter relating to
the acquisition of public utilities by
the city and county of San Francisco.
The entire evening, however, waa con
sumed in attempting to fix a rate, of
taxation and evenly distribute It for
the payment of the running expenses
of the city government. At one time
the committee seemed likely to decide
on a rate of not less than 10 cents
on. $1 -for public improvements, not
less than 5 cents for the repair of
streets and buildings, and 85 cents to
be used for maintenance of the de
partments. Objection was raised to
this on .the ground that it would ar
bitrarily bind the disbursement, and
the discussion broke out afresh. The
committee adjourned without reach
ing a decision on the matter.
Unable to Decide on Percentage of
Taxation to Be Used for Specific
Ends.
FINANCE COMMITTEE
FAILS TO FIX RATE
Douglas Sloane Watson, husband of
Mrs. Mai Moody Watson, refused last
evening to discuss any probable action
his wife will take In an effort to share
the fortune of the testatrix. His silence
is taken aa evidence in support of the
belief that Mrs. Watson will be found
listed with the contestants when the
"I. did not have the time to investi
gate the matter to-day, but to-morrow
will do so. I will consult with my
brother, v who resides In San Francisco,
and it is very probable that we will
outline a plan of action. As yet I have
not conferred with Henry about the
will and, of course, cannot say just
what he intends to do other than that
he means to make a fight for recog
nition when the estate is finally di
vided. I had not seen Miss Dolbeer
for some time and am not in a position
to say anything concerning her mental
condition or attitude toward her uncles
prior to her death.
".WATSON IS RETICENT.
The two Schanders, uncles of the de
ceased, who, like Mrs. Moody, the first
mentioned heir at law, are not included
in decedent's will and It is. they that
threaten to precipitate the battle over
the estate. Adolph Schander, who re
sides at 1917 Schiller street, Alameda,
a brother of the late mother of Miss
Dolbeer, said last night:
"The first I knew of how Miss Dol
beer had disposed of her estate I
learned from reading a copy of her
will. It appears that she has be
queathed almost all of her 'estate to
strangers, who have not the same claim
to her property as near relatives have.
My brother, Henry Schander, has re
tained Attorney Hiram Johnson to con
test the will. If he did not take such
action I and other relatives would, as
I feel that we are entitled to share in
the estate.
Attorney E. S. Plllsbury filed Miss
Dolbeer's will and applications for let
ters of administration upon her estate
were presented by William G. Mugan
and George D. Gray. The will was
filed early in the day, but was immedi
ately taken by the attorney to a pho
tographer's, where a photographic copy
was made. The petitions for letters did
not go into the question of value of the
estate, merely stating formally that it
was worth more than 510,000. Mugan's
petition recited the fact that Miss Dol
beer died in New York on July 9, 1904,
at the age of 27 years and that she left
a holographic will bearing date of
April 23, 1904.
It was stated in the petition that the
heirs at law are Mrs. Joseph L. Moody,
an aunt, residing in San Francisco;
Henry Schander, an uncle, residing at
Sacramento, and Adolph Schander, an
uncle, residing at Alameda. The lega
tees and devisees are set forth as they
appear in the will.
UNCLES WILL CONTEST.*
It is whispered that Milton Latham
was the man who held the key to her
heart. It is even said that an under
standing existed between him and Miss
Dolbeer to wed on her return. But if
the tale is true, the will bears no evi
dence of it.
Much astonishment has been ex
pressed that Miss Helen Wagner re
ceived so small a bequest, as it was
known that she was well beloved by
the heiress, who was not a maiden to
create friendships on an impulse. Her
friendships were real entitiesâ and they
lived.

And â contrary to a current story.
Miss Warren was the acknowledged
author of what little mirth found
lodgment in the Dolbeer home, urg
ing the heiress to entertain, to invite
congenial men to dine, to do the vari
ous things that normal girls k>ve to
do â thus putting to rout the ugly tale
of hypnotism, suppression of friend
ships and the breaking off of affection
ate relations with men for whom the
heiress expressed a preference.
As to Mrs. Moody and her daugh
ters. Miss Dolbeer always maintained
pleasant relations, although it is said
that John Dolbeer was not on speak
ing terms with them when he passed
awaj- â and this fact may have been
weighed in the girl's mind, when re
disposing of her father's money. She
may have remembered his bitterness
toward the relatives of his deceased
Â¦wiJe, as weighed against his fondness
for the Warrens, who, though unre
lated, had been famous friends for
years. And, indeed, it was the elder
Miss Warren who became Bertha's
governess when the little brown-eyed
maid was bereft of her mother. And
on the death of her governess, a few
year later. Miss Etta Warren became
the companion to the lonely girl â this
fifteen years ago.
And thus is there a logical, if un
usual, current underlying the wilL
Whether the document will stand as
the young: woman wished it to remains
to be seen. There are those that think
it will euffer the ignominy of a bad
blow. The testament is as follows:
WILL OF DECEASED.
FALSK STORY DISPROVED.
This unusual arrangementâ strange
as it teems on the surface â is not In
compatible, however, with the attitude
maintained by Miss Dolbeer toward
the people who made up her life. She
loved Miss Warren, who gruided the girl
as a tender mother, watchful for her
pleasures, heedful of her sorrows, and
the confidante of her hopes and fears.
And when the fears began to crowd
out the hopes from the poor girl's
brain, it was Miss Warren who stood
by to cheer her waning spirits.
The dread story of the tragedy will
be retold in the courts of California
and here will be recited the tale of
the trials that became too great for
this young woman to bear.
The last will and testament of this
unfortunate woman, filed yesterday,
tells a strange tale â the giving of a
fortune to Miss Etta Marion Warren, in
whose veins flows no drop of Dolbeer
blood, and when, almost within shadow
of her home, lives an aunt. Mrs. J. L.
Moody, and her two daughters, Mrs.
Douglas Sloane Watson and Mrs. Ray
mond Sherman, only one of whom is
mentioned in the will, and that only
as a contingent legatee. As the con
tingency has been defeated by the
early death of the testatrix none of
the heirs at law will share in the estate
unless the will is broken.

Somewhere In the wooded heights
of Montana, the police believe at
Hamilton, Benjamin F. Germain, of
the blood of the fatherland, is rusti
cating. A warrant was issued yester
day for his arrest on a charge of big
amy and if the detectives of the wild
mining: State can lay hands on him
the tan of the mountains will fade in
the gloom of the prison.
On May 17 last at Santa Barbara,
so Attorney C. M. Jennings of 214
Pine street, who swore to the war
rant, told the police yesterday, Ger
main wedded Virginia H. Barker,
keeper of a small but profitable com
mercial establishment in the city
named. One thing: he neglected to do,
and that was to inform his bride that
she was his second wife; that the first
was living in Eureka, Humboldt
County, and that no decree of divorce
had separated them.
Not content with this oversight, it
is alleged, Germain caused the sec
ond Mrs. Germain to sell her store In
Santa Barbara and dispose of property
in Oakland at a sacrifice. "With the
proceeds of these transactions, it is
averred, they set out on their honey
moon trip to Seattle. There Germain
is said to have secured $300 from his
bride, all she possessed, and fled to
Montana.
Astounded at his conduct, Mrs. Ger
main the seccmd Instituted an investi
gation and found that she was not a
legal wife; that the man that married
her was a bigamist, she his confiding
victim. Communicating with friends,
she secured sufficient funds to return
to this city, where she placed the facts
before her attorney. The police now
have the case in charge, with pros
pects of an interesting series of epi
sodes in the career of Benjamin F.
Germain.
After giving her valuable services
as general secretary to the Occidental
Board of the Presbyterian church for
fifteen years, Mrs. L. A. Kelley has
resigned the position and j was yester
day elected a vice president of the
organization.
The usual weekly meeting of the
Presbyterian Ministers' Association
was held yesterday at Presbyterian
House, Sacramento street. A paper
on "The Friendless" was read, and an
able plea for unfortunate humanity
made by the Rev. Edward A. Freden
hagen. The same clergyman also
spoke before the Congregational Min
isters' Association.
Religion energized and applied is the great
est uplifting power known among the ethical
and sociological Influences of modern lit*. Re
ligion Is to the modern malaria of a city what
sunshine is to the poisonous mists of marshes.
Religion -Is more than an emotional, spiritual
matter. It is also a cold-blooded civic propo
sition, based upon vital principles that count
for good citizenship. \
These are some of the conditions among
workingmen to-day. My words, however, but
faintly describe their condition or their atti
tude toward the church, the members of which
they generally characterize as "kid-glove
aristocracy" and "pusillanimous skinflints."
Men misjudee the church because they do
not know it. Much of the preaching of to-day
Is too far hÂ«avenword for the worklngman;
the high-flown music, with passages which
display the skill of trained choirs and pro
fessional singers, does not appeal to the aver

by thlB cla*a of men ia in the way of amuse
ment, as they watch the leader practice

ficiently clear that our methods have been
sadly derlcli-nt. In this country the masses
are the sources of power. We are concerned
not with aristocracies but with the people, and
when we say the people rule that to -ans that

Fraternal organizations have their part also
In the estrangement of workingmen from the
church of Christ. Many proudly assert that the
religion of their order is good enough for them.
The saloon Is the greatest enemy of the
church. It Is here that labor problems are
talked over and political schemes hatched out.
Recently in Union Square, New York City,
one of the foremost representatives of organ
ized labor In the United States, a man of na
tional reputation, poured out a lava stream
of vituperation against the church and its min
isters, both Protestant and Roman Catholic.
The Younar Men's Christian Association was
called "tbat scab institution," and Cooper's
Institute v.-aa said to do more grood In * week
than all the New York churches In a year.
And a certain New York dally paper, It was
d-sclared, "represented the spirit of true
brotherhood more in a single Issue than the
Christian ministers, parasites of society, could
do In an ata with their hired mouthing*."
These utterances were lustily cheered by the
large crowd of worklnjrmen.
In conversation with the workingmen I have
learned much regarding their grievances and
their prejudices. They do not appreciate the
fact that those outside of their own ranks who
are seeking to make secure the rights of labor
are Christian men and clergymen.
Hand In hand with the labor unions go the
labor organs. Th*se papers and magazines
come even closer to the- lives of workingmen
than the dally press. All who have read these
sheets will appreciate their vindlctlveneas,
selfishness and narrowness without further
comment.
This is a day of unions, from the bootblack
up. Every union has a stated time for Its
meetings, which are usually held on Sunday,
and In these meetings Ions pent-up feelings
are Kiven vent and voice.
It U here that the members declare that
capital must be crushed and that the employer
of labor la the hard taskmaster. It Is hero
that the sentiment Is created and fostered that
th- church is allied to capital.
"To-day the newspapers have more
to do with molding the thought of
workingmen than perhaps all other
influences combined," declared the
Rev. N. A. Kling of Oakland, yester
day morning, at a meeting 1 of the
Methodist Ministers' Association, at
Epworth Hall. Mr. Kling said in part:
SAN BERNARDINO. July 18.â The
lOryear-old son of Pedro Chavez, the
man who was brutally killed at Colton
last night by Clato Avila, played a
brave part in the defense of his father.
The murderer attempted to kill his
youthful assailant but fortunately the
boy escaped uninjured.
Avila sneaked up on his victim, who
was returning from a dance, and put
the pistol point blank to the side of
Chavez" head and fired a 41-caliber bul
let through his brain. Then he stopped
to slash at the wife of Chavez, but
the child had taken a hand in the fight
and was busily pelting the murderer
with stones, hitting the mark not a
few times. The enraged man fired
again, but the little fellow dodging
about escaped unhurt, hurling stones
whenever he could.
'Avila fled when people, attracted by
the fusillade, began to arrive, and the
boy was found squatting by the side of
his dead father.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"In years past it has been customary
for the Mayor of the city to be called
upon to confer degrees upon the grad
uating class of nurses. In the two years
just past, for reasons best known to
themselves, the former Board of Health
put that part of the programme to one
Fide. It is, therefore, the first time
since my induction into office, two
years ago. that I have had the pleasure
of conferring degrees upon the gradu
ating class of nurses. I assure you that
it is with pride that I avail myself
of this privilege."
The Mayor dwelt on the fact that the
nurses would make the best house
wives by reason of their excellent
training. He also commended the
Board of Health for its deep interest
in the training school.
When the diplomas had been distrib
uted, Dr. Ward called attention to the
fact that Miss Marie Ross and Miss
Maud Bristow had volunteered to care
for a patient who waa suffering from
a dread disease. He called public at
tention to the great heroism they show
ed and publicly thanked them for their
services. In order that their act might
be fittingly appreciated handsome
presents were given them. Dr. Ward's
testimony to the brave young women
brought blushes to their cheeks and
they accepted the gifts with becoming
modesty.
Rev. P. Casey, chaplain at the hos
pital, delivered the Invocation and after
a selection by the Elks' quartet Dr. T.
W. Huntington was introduced and
delivered an address that was filled
with kind thoughts and* sound advice.
He paid a high tribute to trained
nurses, who he said were heroines
and who received less commendation
for good deeds performed than any
other class. He appealed to the nurses
to be truthful, conscientious, painstak
ing and intelligent in their work.
Previous to conferring the diplomas,
Mayor Schmitz said in part:
Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz presented
the diplomas and as each graduate
stepped on the platform to receive the
coveted sheepskin she was rewarded
with applause. Francis Graham was
the lone man in the company and his
appearance on the platform waa the
signal for hearty approval. Each grad
uate received the school badge, which
was pinned on by Dr. F. H. Zumwalt.
In opening the exercises, Dr. James
W. Ward, president of the Board of
Health, expressed his gratification in
being able to congratulate the nurses
on the eve of their entering upon their
life's work. He pictured their impor
tant duties and told what nurses have
accomplished. He told what the Board
of Health had done and was doing to
improve the system In vogue at the
City and County Hospital and express
ed the hope that the graduates would
maintain a high standard in their
work.
Pretty nurses, garbed In the white
costumes of their profession, were the
center of attraction in the maple room
of the Palace Hotel last evening. The
occasion was the annual commence
ment exercises of the San Francisco
Training School for Nurses at the City
and County Hospital, tfhe graduating
class consisted of Rachael Allemand,
Madge Cess ford, Agnes Crowley, Mary
Irene Dc-yle, Ella Emerson, Amelia
Esteva, Hilda Fried, Bessie Green,
Anna Geary, Johanna Gau, Francis
Graham, Lillian Lodge, Stella McDon
ald, Geneva S. Orcutt, Barbara Par

I Mrs." Hughson," of Chicago, whose f
letter follows, is another woman in high
position who owes her health to the use of
Lydia R Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â I suffered for several years "with general
"weakness and bearing-down pains, caused by womb trouble, ily appe-
tite was fitful, and I would lie awake for hours, and could not sleep,
until I seemed more weary in the morning than when I retired. After
reading one of your advertisements I decided to try the merits of Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, and I am so glad I did. Ko one
can describe the good it did me. I took three bottles faithfully, and
besides building up my general health, it drove all disease and poison
out of my body, and made me feel as spry and active as a young girl
Mrs. Pinkham'8 medicines are certainly all they are claimed to be." â
Mbs. M. E. Huqhson*, 347 East Ohio St, Chicago, I1L
Mrs. Pinkham Tells How Ordinary Tasks Produce Displacements.
Apparently trifling 1 incidents in woman's daily life frequently produce
displacements of the womb. A slip on the stairs, lifting during menstruation,
standing at a counter, running a sewing machine, or attending to the most
ordinary tasks may result in displacement, and a train of serious evils is started.
The first indication of such trouble should be the signal for quick action.
Don't. let the condition become chronic through neglect or a mistaken idea
that you can overcome it by exercise or leaving it alone. :
More than a million women have regained health by^the use of Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
If the slightest trouble appears which yon do not understand
Â¦write to Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn, Mass., for her advice, and a few-
timely words from her will show you the right thin? to do. This
advice costs you nothing, but it may mean life or happiness or both*

health to women who thus suffer. It is a sovereign cure for
the worst forms of female complaints, â that bearing-down feeling, weak
back, falling and displacement of the womb, inflammation of the ovaries, and
all troubles of the uterus or womb. It dissolves and expels tumors from the
uterus in the early stage of development, and checks any tendency to cancer*
ous humors. It subdues excitability, nervous prostration, and tones up the
entire female system. Its record of cures is the greatest in the world, and
should be relied upon with confidence. |

The leper settlement is coi ducted i n
the lines of a very ltrge and scattered
village of private cottages for thosa
physically unable to maintain them.
These cottages number 450. There ara
hospitals for the helpless, and boys*
and girls' homes, churches, schcola
and means of entertainment are pro
vided. Athletic sports are common.
Every possible means is used to re
move the feeling arising: from re
straint. Medical attendance is con
stant. Men and women belonging to
religious orders devote themselves to
the care of these unfortunates. Every
provision for support and comfort is
made free of cost. No service is rp
quired of those able to work. Those
working receive suitable money re
muneration.
Deputy Health Officer Levy said last
night:
This matter recalls our own leper colonT.
Our city and South Carolina have thÂ« only
two leper colonies in the United States. la
the Leper Hospital of this city, which is lo
cated on the outskirts, are twenty-five in
mates. Of this number fifteen are Chinese, ths
rest Including four women, white and brown,
and five white men anil onÂ« boy. who hali*
from Tahiti. The place has been converted
Into a paradise by Supt- rlntendent Farrell. H-*
secured plants from jhe Park Commissioner*
and interested the inmates in cultivating
flowers Where at one time waa barren soil
filled with refuse, are now blooms of overy
description. Farrell has forced ihm Inmates to
keep the place in a good state of .sanitation.
He has whitewashed and painted the walls of
the institution until It now ranks with th*
best kept hospitals In the State. Although
leproey Is not contagious, visitors do not call
there, as the hospital adjoins the Smallpox
Hospital.
. In the last budget th* Board of Supervisors
allowed ${HiCO to run the Institution for on*
year. This 1Â» for salaries and maintenance.
The sum is much too small and the Board
of Health has to be economical. Ths inmate*
live as a happy family. The .Chinese keep trv
gether and take pride in their quar
ters. The fences are low and sometimes ih<Â»
Chines* take a notion to scale them and Â« Â¦Â»
into Chinatown for things they need. They
are usually caught by tha alert superintendent
and disciplined.
Deputy Health Officer Louis Levy is
in receipt of a communication from tha
Board of Health of the Territory of
Hawaii, requesting that the San Fran
cisco Board of Health do what it can
toward obtaining Government aid for
the scientific study and treatment of
leprosy and toward the adjustment of
the financial arrangements of the Ter
ritory of Hawaii with the Federal
treasury, so that humanitarian obliga
tions of Hawaii may be properly car
ried on without the present unduÂ»
strain.
The communication further says tho
statistics of 1900 show the following
numbers and nationalities affected:
Hawaiians. 951; Portuguese, 10; Eng
lish, German, etc., 10; Americans, 5; ne
groes, Malay, etc., 4; Chinese, S4; total,
1014.
The letter adds that the lepers arÂ«
segregated on the island of Molokat.
on a sea girt peninsula, containing
6348 acres of extraordinary scenic
beauty and shut out from communica
tion with the outrr world by practic
ally impassable perpendicular cliffs

Russia's Mixed Population.
The Russian population is perhaps
the most mixed of all nations, and 14
made up in large measure of con-Â»
quered peoples Who still remerabej
their overthrow with bitterness. Prob-Â«
ably not far from one-third of thai
â¢whole â from forty to fifty millions
are true Muscovites.
Around the central Muscovites ara
grouped Lapps. Finns. Germans,
Lithuanians, Poles, Little Russians,
Ruthenians, Roumanians. Greeks,
Georgians and Tartars, with Jews antf
Gypsies scattered through the south
"and west. These are all in European
Russia, and this is nothing to the med
ley in Asiatic Russia, where there is
an almost endless Variety of races.
Each of the races mentioned speaks a
different tongue, and there are at least
six different religions among them,
without counting sectaries, such as the
Doukhobors.
Bitter political hatred of Russia
burns fiercely among the Finns, Poles
and Armenians, while symptoms of ac
tive revolt are reported among: Geoi>Â«

An interesting railroad relic, reminis
cent of the first days of the steam lo
comotive, has been discovered In the
north of England. The Liverpool and
Manchester Railroad Company, the first
public road constructed, It will be re
membered, inaugurated a competition
in the latter part of the twenties of the
past century for a locomotive, in which
Stephenson and other inventors par
ticipated. Three enginesâ the "Rock
et," by Stephenson; the "Sans Pareil,"
by Hackworth, and the "Novelty," by
Braithwalte and Ericsson respectively
âparticipated in the trials that were
carried out in 1830. As is well known,
Stephenson's "Rocket" secured the
award of $2500 which was offered, aa
being the most suitable engine attain
ing a speed of twenty-nine miles per
hour. The "Sans Pareil" was second
with a speed of twenty-three miles per
hour, while the "Novelty" withdrew
from the trials owing to the joints of
the boiler giving way when the loco
motive had traveled only three miles.
Both the "Rocket" and the "Sans
Pareil" are now preserved in the South
Kensington Museum, but the "Novel
ty" mysteriously disappeared and was
never found again until quite recently.
It appears that Ericsson was so morti
fied by the failure of his conception
that he left it with his friend, Mr. Mel
ling, who possessed engineering work3
located upon a space adjoining the
Rainhill Station. These works were
subsequently dismantled and the prem
ises were occupied by the Rainhill Gas
and Water Company. The "Novelty"
was thus lost sight of, but it has now
been recognized working as a station
ary engine, the wheels having been
removed for this purpose, and its
identity thus somewhat disguised. At
tempts are to be made to secure this
third premier locomotive, and to place
it alongside of its two contemporaries
in the South Kensington Museum.âEx

Assistant Secretary Oliver of the
War Department has referred the
matter to the Secretary of Commerce
and Labor, requesting its reference to
the Commissioner of Fish "and Fish
eries for an expression of his views in
the premises, â Washington Star.
This report was forwarded to the
War Department by General Funston,
commanding the Department of Co
lumbia, who requested its reference to
some scientific authority for an expres
sion of opinion as to whether the
presence of petroleum in a stream so
large as the Yukon would adversely
affect the salmon. He cites cases
where oil has leaked from the tanks
of boats in small quantities and says
that several white men think that its
presence is disastrous to the very
young fish. "The destruction of the
salmon in the Yukon," says General
Funston, "or any conditions that
would cause those fish to cease to
visit the river for spawning would be
a most serious matter, resulting in the
starvation of hundreds of natives
along the lower course of that stream,
they being almost entirely dependent
on the salmon for their food supply."
Major R. H. Wilson, Eighth Infan
trj't commanding the post at Fort
St. Michael, Alaska, has reported that
the Indians of that vicinity have had
a very small catch of fish this year,
the run of salmon being next to
nothing, and, in consequence, the na
tives are not provided with the usual
stock of fish for winter use. The In
dians attribute the scarcity of fish
to the use of oil as fuel by the boats
of the Northern Commercial Com
pany plying on the Yukon, and ask
that its further use be prohibited. Ma
jor Wilson says that the general
opinion, however, is that the small
amount of oil spilled overboard by
the boats can have no perceptible ef
fect on the fish.

Biliy Delaney, veteran rra!ner and
astute coacher of pugilists, visited liu-
die Hanlon at his quarters at CroM's
Gardens in Alameda yesterday and em
phatically approved of the order issued
by Trainer Frank McDonald that here
after the little fighter shall not be per
mitted to extend himself in bis pre
liminary work as has been his prac
tice while fitting: himself for ring bat
tles in the past. Delaney agreed with
McDonald that Eddie had in his en
thusiasm been permitted to mix it more

the young trainer to tighten the lines
on his charge and hold him in, even
if he did champ on the bit.
When Eddie goes <-n the road this
morning he will be accompanied by Mc-
Donald for the first time. The trainer
eays that he has now decided what

The fauntins season for big game has
opened at last and the sportsmen are
seeking the mountains in pursuit of
deer and bear. One el the most inde
fatigable of these hunters is A. II.
Russ, called in the north "Geronimo"
Russ. Rufs started out a short time
ago from "Bear Wallow in Shasta Coun
ty accompanied by guides and dog^,
and has already succeeded in bringing
down three bears. One, a cinnamon,
weighed 700 pounds dressed; the other
two were black bears and weighed 550
:\nd 600 pounds respectively. On re
turning the party were nearly lost in
the snow and crossed and recrossed o-ne
creek before locating their camp. Russ
intends to stay in the mountains for
three months and will hunt bear until
the snowfall makes further sport im
possible.
W. H. Stanley of Alameda, in busi
ness in this city, is spending a few
days at Klamath Springs, Siskiyou
County. Day before yesterday, while
he was following a mc-untain stream
for trout in company with a chum and
a half breed Indian as a guide, the
party came very near stepping on an
old she bear and a six-months-old cub,
but Stanley fortunately had his rifle
hfcndy and killed the old bear at the
first fire. A second shot struck the cub
in the shoulder as it sought safety in a
tree and a fusillade brought it to the
ground. Both pelts are on the way to
this city to be mounted.
The deer season has lately opened
and reports of killings should soon
reach the city. The woods of Califor
nia are full of deer and all the moun
tain resorts boast of resolute hunters
who are preparing to go out and bring
them in.

BRIGHTON BEACH, July 18.â There
was only one stake on the card to-day.
Waterboy was to have started in the
mile and a quarter handicap, but the
rain and its effect on the top of the
ground caused his careful trainer to
scratch him.
Sheriff Bell was favorite for the
Nautilus stake, but was well beaten
because of the heavy track. The win
ner was E. R. Thomas' Duke of Ken
dal, which always runs well on just
such a course as was seen to-day. The
horse was ridden by Travers, in order
that he should receive the benefit of
an apprentice allowance, which will ac
count to a great extent for the boy's
engagement by his present employer.
Possession, with Hildebrand up, gave
Duke of Kendal a stout argument kt
the finish. Sweet Alice, one of the
early pacemakers, tired to nothing in
the last quarter and finished laat
Hildebrand perpetrated a piece of
riding in the third race which should
have brought at least a reprimand. He
had the mount on Tramotor, the early
pacemaker. Torchello, the favorite,
was catching Tramotor on the stretch
turn and Hildebrand then bore out,
carrying out Torchello. He gave
Buro,s on Agile a fine opportunity.
Burns had kept closely to the rail all
the way and when the other two went
out so wide he went vigorously to
work on his mount, but could not pre
vent Torchello winning by about three
parts of a leneth. Summaries:

CHICAGO, July IS.â -Tokalon, which
won the Chicago stakes at Harlem on
Saturday, was an added starter in the
Premier stakes, the feature of the
opening of Hawthorne to-day, and won
all the way, being pulled up to a gal
lop at the finish.
The filly picked up 117 pounds and,
because of a report that she could not
carry weight, she was as good as 4 to 1
in the betting at one time, being back
ed down later to 2 to 1. English Lad,
with 127 pounds up and always first
choice, but drifting from 7 to 10 to even
money, finished a distant third, being
easily beaten by the 16 to 1 shot, Miss
Crawford, for the place. The stake
was worth $2230 to the winner.
As four favorites and two second
choices won, the talent gave the book
makers another severe drubbing. The
track was fast, the weather clear and
hot and the attendance good. Sum

on Ashbury street, near Waller, fell yesterday
from a scaffold at the third floor. Both mm

taken to their homes.
Dr. Albert Abrams spoke before a
large audience at the Academy of Sci
ences last night on "Tuberculosis, the
Great "White Plague; Cause, Preven
tion and Cure.". After reviewing the
numerous methods adopted for the
cure of the dread ailment and telling
how most Inventions give a temporary
relief and hope in all cases, the lecturer
advised fresh open air, the ipdulgence
of the sun's rays and care. He urged
the practice of breathrng, saying that
long, deep breaths are the beneficial
ones, while those that are short and
quick have not the slightest beneficial
effect on the lungs.
The theory that it is good to exercise
with and uplift the arms while in the
act of taking a long breath the doctor
upset completely and advised that a
natural position with the chest expand
ed is the one favored from a medical
standpoint.
Dr. Abrams commended the local
Board of Health for its adoption of pre
cautions In cases of consumption and
also for its provision to disinfect where
a room or house has been vacated by
a sufferer.

hand-me-down attire and represented
himself to be a farmer from Antioch
when he purchased a drink of whisky

The defendants are John McNamara,
proprietor, and Ben Louderdale, bar

avenue, tired of touring the Barbary
Coast, dropped into a Pacific-street sa
loon and sought rest In a chair and the
longer he sat there the drowsier he

separation agreement by which she
was to give Swan $1000 as soon as she
obtained the divorce, his part of the
contract being a verbal promise to take
the money with him to Sweden and
stay in that country as long as he
lived. Swan said he was ready and
willing to live up to his pledge, but. to
his disappointment and digust Hannah
gave him the laugh when he went to

vinced Judge Conlan that they were
rot vagrants, but tourists, and blush

with a caution.
When the case of Mrs. Annie Lippe,
charged with peace disturbance and
battery, was called before Judge Mo
gan It was reported that the woman
had shown such unmistakable symp
toms of insanity that she was detained
in the Receiving Hospital for examina
tion by the Lunacy Commission. J

burglary, proved that the premises he
was charged with having broken into,
in the 300 block of .Howard street, con
sisted of a vacant lot. Then the charge
was reduced to larceny, and Judge
Conlan asked the prosecution what the
defendant had stolen besides the police
man who arrested him. The case will
be heard to-morrow.
Snow went to Slippery Ford, in
Placer Countv, and during his sojourn
there Goldman visited him three times.
Goldman's conduct on one of those
visits angered Snow to such an ex
tent that he took a stick two inches in
diameter and six feet long and swung
it at Goldman's head, but lowered his
aim ere the weapon landed so that it
struck a box upon which Goldman was
seated. In Snow's apartment in the
Queen House, on Mason street. Snow
beat Goldman several times with his
fists, and one day last February the
former Mavor beat Goldman because
the latter tried to prevent him from
going to dinner at his home in Oak
land. They took a five days' trip to
gether, and quarreled much of the
time. Goldman once destroyed bric-a
brac and other treasures in Snow's
room in the Adams Hojise, and then
paid Snow 1100 to make good the dam
age.
"Why did you beat him?" Mr. Mur
phy asked.
"Because he acted in such a way
that I could do nothing else," was the
answer.
"Did you consider him insane?"
"Yes; the insanity of a spoiled
child."
"What do you mean by that?"
â¢â¢Well, when he couldn't have every
thing his own way he acted Insanely?'
. "In what way?"
"He writhed on the floor and threw
money around and did other silly
things."
"Why did you beat him in Oakland? 1
"Because he would not let me go tÂ«
dinner at my home unless I took him
with me."
It . developed that on one occasion
Snow presented to Goldman a bill for
51000 for attendance during spells of
temporary insanity, and, asked what
he meant by that, Snow replied that
he did it as a "counter bluff," because
Goldman was trying to collect money
from him.
The defense will be heard to-morrow.
Cross-examination of R. W. Snow,
the former Mavor of Oakland, who
was shot by Adolph Goldman on June
15, at the Clarendon Hotel, was re
sumed yesterday morning: by Attorney
Frank Murphy before Police Judge
Mogan and a packed courtroom. Some
interesting statements hitherto un
published were wruns from the wit
ness, the aim of the defense apparent
ly being to show that Goldman had
been driven temporar^ry insane by ill
treatment received when he endeav
ored to collect money which he had
advanced the man whose life he finally
attempted to take.
Snow admitted that on several occa
sions, within a twelvemonth prior to
the shooting by Goldman, he had been
provoked to beat that person severely,
and once deemed it necessary to in
timidate him by firing, a pistol. In
March. 1903, Goldman and Snow were
in the latter's apartment in the Adams
House, on Eddy 6treet, and Snow beat
Goldman with his fists until one of
his (Snow's) hands was so severely in
jured that the surgeon's bill amounted
to $20. which Goldman subsequently
paid. In April of the same year the
two men were in Goldman's apartment
at 79 Grant avenue, and Goldman be
haved so badly that Snow fired a pis
tol shot to subdue him, the bullet pass
ing about eighteen inches above Gold
man's head. Later in the same month
they were again together in Snow's
apartment in the Larchmont Hotel,
where Snow again used his fists and
then dragged Goldman the entire
length of a corridor.

terrible disease, locomotor ataxla. Power to
balance, stand, or even sit down, entirely lost.
Two best doctors of San Francisco and Hot

ach, bowels and kidneys failed to work. I had
Jf". of Â¦ tom ach. head and bladder as a re-
suit of the dlÂ»ease; these troubles became
chronic. At times my heart would beat like a
drum, my eyes grew weak, my memory bad.
my nerves wrecked. .Three months ago I went
to Tuscan Springs. What happened since was
a pleasant surprise to me. Drank the waters.
took the baths â after three weeks' treatment
stomach, bowels, bladder and kidneys In per-
fect condition, eyesight perfect, nervousness
gone, memory good. After three months' treat-
ment, walked without a cane, with eyes closed,
and up and down steep hills; am cured of thiÂ«
dread disease, now walk with slight limp.
Have run stores in seventeen towns of the

It Is frequently the case that a party wishes .
to sell his holdings for the purpose of reinvest-
ing the proceeds in a different kind of property.
Our long experience in this business enables
us to often accomplish this doable purpose by
only one transaction. The only condition we
make Is that your property, if you wish us to
dispose of It for you. MUST BE GOOD OF* ITS
KIND AND IN A GOOD LOCATION. Don't
take up either our time or your own with
worthless offerings, or property so heavily
mortgaged as to leave no actual equity.
If it .has merit, whether you own real estate
or a mercantile or manufacturing business,
bring a description of same to our office, stat-
ing what kind of property you prefer In ex-
change, and you will be surprised how quickly
we can effect the result.
THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE UNDER-
STAND THE EXCHANGE BUSINESS and are
the only company In San Francisco making -a
specialty of same. We make no charge for ad-
vertising or any other purpose unless we pro-
cure an exchange satisfactory to you to ac-
cept.

Therese Munior was of a most af
fectionate disposition. She loved her
father and mother equally well, and
it was apparent to every one that tl>2
1 blow of the separation was more than
the little one could bear.
No one. however, expected that the
little child would dream of takinsr the
desperate ftep she took to-d;;;'. The
child had no money with which to
purchase poison, but she had deter
mined to die by lying on the grass a^d
eating a quantity of it Vhat had
been liberally sprinkled witrt poison
for bugs. Soon she was in great
agony, and suffered so much pain that
she was compelled to tell her mother
what she had done. A doctor was
hurriedly summoned, and it is just
possible that the child's life may be
saved.
Out of the tragedy that threatened
to destroy the Munior home happine33
has resulted, for. melted by the com
mon interest of their child's suffering.
and Mrs. Munior have settled their
differences.
KOKOMO. Ind., July 18. â Therese.
the 7-year-old daughter of Adolphus
and Mrs. Munior of this city, tried to
commit suicide here to-day. Never
was so great a tragedy expressed In
so few word3. Three lives entered into
the tragedy as dramatis personae â â¢
that of little Therese. her mother arsd
father. Some little time ago trouble
stalked to the Munior door' and en
tered without awaiting permission.
The c-our>Ie soon after separated.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
How they managed to keep the affair
a secret for such a length of time is a
mystery to ail concerned.
The old story that "love laughs at
locksmiths" is verified by the mar
riage of Miss May Hamilton of San
Jose and George W. Smith of Newman.
They loved dearly and young, but the
edicts of stern parents kept them
apart.
On December IS last, they^ hied them
selves over to San Rafael and there
plighted marriage vows that made
them husband and wife. The blushing
bride went back to San Jose, and the
youthful groom returned to Newman.
The relatives of both parties were in
entire ignorance of the. affair until
yesterday when the happy couple met
in town and happened to run across
some friends when thev were forced to
let the secret out.
From what can be learned it appears
that the parents of the young woman
objected to the man she had chosen.
Her father, A. B. Hamilton, who is a
prominent merchant of the Garden
City, is reported to have been greatly
averse to his daughter's marrying. 1 For
what reasons he has never stated. He
simply said: "I did not want Slav to
marry." Yesterday the bride took her
sister, Mrs. J. Hendy, into her con
fidence and begged her to help her
face the stern parent. Together the
two sisters have gone to San Jose and
there, this morning, on bended knees.
May will beg his forgiveness and ask
him to grant his blessing and wish her
long life and happiness. What he will
do is largely a matter of conjecture. It
is reported that he is of a stormy tem
perament and his friends say he was
"dead set" against the marriage. The
bride is one of San Jose's fairest
daughters. She is clever, brllilant and
popular. The announcement of the
wedding will cause a great sensation
in San Jose. The groom is equally
popular and is highly esteemed in the
district in which he lives.

Figs were the only description of deciduous
fruits that "were scarce, supplies of nearly all
other kinds beinz excessive. Receipts of Bare
lett Pears were suddenly heavy and even the
fanciest packed stock .was lower, with a heavy
surplus unsold at the close. Offerings In large
open boxes consisted chiefly of windfalls, which
were practically unsalable. Plums and Prunes
continued to drag, but good hard stock- was
firmly held In expectation of a good demand for
shipment to-day. Canners were offering $20
@25 per. ton for; some varieties, but they were
unable to procure any at those figures. â¢ An
outside, canner was bidding $35 per ton for 'fine
yellow Apricots and picked up several lots,
but Â¦ the leading packers would not pay over
$30. Offerings. In. small -â¢â¢ckages were very
scarce, the high prices of loose stock having
checked packing.' The market was not so
badly congested with Peaches as on Saturday
and the best stock cleaned up well, but
plles of ordinary fruit were still excessive/ Re
ceipts of basket Peaches from the river were
only 'fifty-two packages and they sold quickly
at SOc per basket. Cantaloupes and Nutmeg
Melons were in Increased supply and cheaper,
while Watermelons were steady and unchanged.

CHICAGO, July 18. â At the opening In wheat
there was apparently but one opinion, namely,
that the early news strongly favored higher
prices. To begin with, the Liverpool market
showed a marked advance prices there being
up over a penny. That of itself was sufficient
ly significant, but it was also accompanied by
a statement that the advance was partly due
to a bullish report of .the Russian crop - as
published by a London newspaper. In addi
tion the world's shipments were light and the
amount on passage showed a decrease of over
8.000,000 bushels. In addition to the foreign
situation, heavy rains were reported in the Rod
River Valley. ShorU were active buyers at
the etart. With light offerings. Initial quota
tions on September were %c to %c higher at
88%c to 88 %c As the session advanced buying
became general, the demands from foreigners
being of a . better character than for a long
time. Selling was largely in the way of profit
taking. After September had advanced to
8U%c the market experienced a ilight setback
as a result of bearish advices from the South
west. Harvest operations were reported again
in full blast. The close on September was at
SS t /hÂ©*8c. July sold between 96%e and- 98o
and closed at 97 %c.
In sympathy with the strength of wheat the
corn market opened quite firm, but sentiment
soon changed, an easier tone prevailing the
greater part of the day. September opened
unchanged to 'Ac higher at 4!)c to 49Vic, Bold
off to 48%2 and closed at 49%c.

WHEAT â The forelsrn markets were firmer,
with higher futures. ' The world's shipments
for the week were as follows. In quarters: Rus
sian, 220,000 bushels; Danublan, 32,000; Argen
tina, 101.000; Indian, 248.000; Australian, 24,000.
The American visible supply decreased SOU.OOO
buihels.-
Chicago advanced l%o on the higher cables,
reported Injury to the Russian crop and heavy
rains in the Red River Valley. The damage
to the Kansas crop was finally estimated by ,
one- authority at 25 per cent. There was con
siderable realizing, but the market absorbed it.
The Chicago wires of Mitchell, Mulcahy &
Co. said: "The principal Incentive to strength
was foreign markets, Â¦ which were up about the
eame amount. Broorohall cabled that the Liver
pool advance was due partially to the strong
I American markets. Weather through the winter
1 wheat section is fine. There were some rains
in Red River Valley, but more moderate tem
peratures through the Northwest and.condi
tions in that section are generally satisfactory.
All the reports from i the Southwest Indicate
general threshing and a general- inclination
to get wheat to market as soon as possible. In
order to take advantage of the high premiums
on cash wheat and on the July options. Re
ceipts in Kansas City and St. Louis were
more liberal. . and quite. a movement is likely
before the end ot the week. The Introduction
of lower consols and' the political situation Is
a disconcerting factor. We hardly believe, how
. ever. In any Euroi>can political complications
at this time. Assuming the market will, with
good weather, turn on .conditions of supply and
demand, we are Inclined to think that the be
lievers In wheat should pursue a rather con
servative course for4the time being. "Whether
the new crop of winter wheat. is large or small,
a free movement Is likely In the near future.
The short interest In the July option has been
very much. reduced, and it would seem reason
able that the millers will' buy sparingly and
from hand to mouth at these premiums. If
I we were, lone on July wheat and believers in
higher pricM.nhink we would let the July go
and buy something cheaper."
- This market was. strong and, active, with
higher futures and an advance in cash Club.
Spot offerings Â»were cleaned up and the mar
ket Is bare of round lots. -. The demand In the
4nterlor continues brisk. : ,

erable advance after the first hour. A strong
sentimental influence was exerted by the re
sumption of the advance in Pennsylvania after
a period of profit-taking following a previous
ac'vance. The realizing in United States Steel
preferred was facilitated by reports of the re
opening of the mills at Homestead. The trunk
lues were benefited by the favorable color of
the weekly traffic reports of officials in that
territory. Otherwise the risa in stocks had
little news to go on. Foreign markets were
suflerers from tU*_xeported diplomatic friction
which has resulted from Russian acts toward
the Â£hlÂ£>s of neutral nations, and the same
cause helj>ed tt> lift the price of wheat.
Officials ot Western railroads quite generally
admitted the halt in buginess revival which
has been caused by the reported damage to
the wheat crop and the danger that' another
period ot business hesitation be caused. This
did not prevent a 2-point rise in AtchUon,
which placed it in the leadership of the mar
ket. The irreconcilable attitude of the parties
tu the meat packers' strike disappointed hopes
held last wetk of an early adjustment.. Money

Roberts, the distinguished astronomer,

The Supreme Court decided yester
day that the Bakersfield and Fresno
Oil Company must pay taxes on land
obtained from the Government as a
mineral claim. The corporation leased
the property to several oil companies.
The argument against taxation was
based on the Dlea that the land was
still Government property, as it had
not been fully proved tip, or that the
lessees should be made to pay the
taxes in case there was assessable rea!
estate. The court holds that the cor
poration's rights in the land consti
tute "property" in the meaning of the
law.

Meanwhile H. S. Crocker had ac
cumulated immense wealth and it is
supposed that he leaves several mil
lions. Ho was the last of four broth
ers, the other members of the original
Crocker family being Charles, E. B.
and Clark Crocker, all of whom were
connected with railroad projects in
California. For nearly ten years H.
S. Crocker had not been in good
health and this fact resulted in his
son taking his father's place at the
head of the firm as its active man
ager. The Crocker family was among
the first to move into the new St.
Francis Hotel ' and during [ the resi
dence of its members there H. S.
Crocker had been confined almost
continuously to. his rooms. In his last
hours he wacs attended by his devoted
wife and his son,' j who had been pre
pared for the end for a week. The
funeral will take place to-morrow at
2 p. m. from" Masonic Temple under
the auspices of Golden Gate Com
mandery, Knights Templar, of which
Mr. Crocker had been a member for
years. Interment" will be private.
In the early days of California Henry
S. Crocker went to Sacramento, where
he founded what later developed into
the. largest stationery concern in this
State. Through the influence of his
brother, Charles Crocker, one of the
trio of millionaires who built the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad, the printing firm
in Sacramento obtained a contract for
the stationery and printing supplies for
the great transportation corporation
and enjoyed the latter's patronage un
til late in the SOs, when the railroad
company concluded to do its own work.
By that time the stationery firm had
practically gained a monopoly of the
printing business on the coast and con
tinued to maintain its lead for many
years until Â¦ Eastern competitors en
tered the field.
Henry S. Crocker, a pioneer of Cali
fornia, who, for nearly half a century,
was ' prominently identified. with the
stationery business in this city and
Sacramento, died yesterday in his
apartments at the St. Francis Hotel.
He had been ill for a number of years
with organic troubles, and during the
last few weeks he had been at death's
door several' times. Deceased was a
native of Troy, N. Y., 72 years of age,
and is survived by a widow and a son,
Charles H. Crocker, who has been as
sociated with his father In the man
agement of the firm of the H. S.
Crocker Company for more than ten
years.

PIONEER MERCHANT WHO DIED
IN THIS CITY YESTERDAY
AFTER A LONG ILLNESS.
Ever since the murder of Policeman
Eugene C. Robinson at Sixteenth, and
Valencia streets on the morning of
January 21. 1302, the pollc* have been
keeping up a dogged and determined
search fcrr Allen Goucher alias "Kid"
Goucher, one of the crooks implicated
in the crime. H* disappeared immedi
ately after the murder and all efforts
to get a clew to his whereabouts failed
till a few weeks ago. when Chief Witt
man received information that a young
man answering Goucher's description
was an inmate of the. StatÂ» peniten
tiary at Stillwater, Minn.
The Chief at once wrote to "Warden
Henry Wolfer inclosing a photograph
of Goucher. Yesterday the Chief re
ceived a reply from the Warden in
closing a photograph of Roy Williams,
one of the convicts, who was serving
a term for grand larceny committed in
Jackson County. Minn., on December
13, 1902. His sentence expires on March
19. 1905. The Chief is satisfied that Roy
Williams is "Kid" Goucher and on tb.3
expiration, of the sentence- Goucher
will be brought here to stand his trial
on the charge of murder.
There were six crook3 implicated In
the murder of Robinson. Frank Woods,
alias "St. Louis Frank," was arrested
in Portland, Ore., was tried and con
victed of murder in the first degree and
sentenced to be hanged. The case is
pending on appeal in the Suprema
Court. William Kauffman, alias "St.
Louis Fat." was arrested In Port Ar
thur, Canada, was tried and convicted
of murder In the second degree and
sentenced to serve twenty-five years in
San Quentin. John Courtney, alias
"Leadville Jlmmle," was arrested in
Tracy, Cal., pleaded guilty to a charga
of manslaughter and was sentenced to
serve six years in San Quentin- Wil
liam B. Kennedy, alias "Tellow," -was
arrested in Grants Pass, Ore., was tried
and coA'icted of murder In the second
degree, was granted a new trial by the
Supreme Court, was released from cus
tody by Judge Cook and is now waiting
trial before Judge Lawlor on a new
indictment. William H- Henderson
turned State's evidence, was allowed
to- plead guilty to manslaughter, but
has not yet been sentenced owing to
the Supreme Court's not having ren
dered a decision on the "Woods ap
peal. Henderson vras arrested at the
time by Policeman Taylor.
The complaint alleges, in the first
place, that the defendant corporation
was engaged in the banking and ex
press business and was the owner of
real estate and franchises on the first
Monday in March,' 1903, when the as
sessment was levied. A demand was
made u^on the corporation for a writ
ten statement of its property by the
city and county Assessor. In response
to the demand Dudley Evans, presi
dent of the company, made the fol
lowing return: Money, $550,169; sol
vent credits, $4,450,772; solvent debts.
$4,470,020; 85 harnesses and saddles,
$1190; 128 horses, $6400; 6 trucks.
$900; 70 wagons, $5720; 20 pairs
scales, $200; IS safes. $840; office fix
tures, 5 15. OS 1; two typewriters, $80.
To the above Hat was attached the af
fidavit of Mr. Evans that it was "true
and correct. list."
It was set forth In the complaint
that Mr. Evans did not value the real
property or the company's franchise.
When the Assessor got around to it
he decided that the real estate was
worth $81,500 and the improvements
thereupon $280,600. and he also as
sessed the company's franchise at
$450,000.
The complaint of the Attorney Gen
eral recites every detail of the action
of the Assessor and the State Board of
Equalization, which boosted property
values 30 per cent and fixed the State
assessment at $0,561, making, -when
the city and county tax was tacked on,
a total rate of $1,076 on the hundred
dollars. The whole story of the as
sessment is told up to the point of at
tempting to sell the Wells-Fargo real
estate. When the injunction wa3 ob
tained by the- banking and express
company the real estate was saved
and the taxes against the company for
Its franchises were still in the air.
The complaint Is a model one in itsj
recitation of the causes leading up to
the necessity of. litigation and in set
ting forth, in detail, every official ac
tion of the city and county and State
officers since the issue was first raised.
The State of California has decided
to find out on its own account whether
or not the Tax Collector of the city
and county of San Francisco has the
right to sell at delinquent tax sale the
real property of corporations holding
franchises beyond the city. "Within
the last few months the Tax Collector
of this county, advertised for sale the
realty of several franchise-holding
corporations, including Wells, Fargo
& Co. and the Central and Southern
Pacific companies. All of the corpo
rations, at the proper moment, se
cured injunctions from the Superior
Court preventing the advertised sale.
There was no provision in the law for
setting the sale for a further date and
it was supposed that the Incident
would close for this year.
Yesterday, however. Attorney Gen
eral U. S. Webb, on behalf of the peo
ple of the State of California, filed an
action in the Superior Court against
Wells, Fargo & Co. for the collection
of $30,600 53 due for unpaid taxes,
penalties and costs of litigation.
A Parker and Davis ratification
meeting will be held in the Alhambra
Theater on the evening of Thursday,
July 28. Judge Dooling of Hollister is
slated to pronounce the eulogy on
Judge Parker of Hsopus. There will be
other orators, but Dooling is to be the
star speaker. Tim Spellacy.^chainnan
of the Democratic State Central Com
mittee, will occupy a conspicuous place
on the platform and shed the light of
his angelic countenance on" the audi
ence. It is said to-be a sure go that
Thomas J. Geary of the Jeffersonian
Democracy will address th? meeting
and perhaps J. V. Coleman, who has
rendered the party illustrious service as
an orator and angel, will consent to
speak. The silvery voice of Franklin
K. Lane will not enrapture tjje local
war horses of the party on that occa
sion, as he is listed to speak to the
Oregonians at a Parker and Davis
gathering in Portland.
The special Pullman train chartered

It seems to be definitely settled that
the Republicans will renominate J. N.
Gillette for Congress in the First Dis
trict. J. C. Needham in the Sixth and
James A. McLachlan in the Seventh.
It is also clearly foreshadowed that
Joseph R. Knowland will be nominated
in the Third and Duncan E. McKinlay
in the Second District. In the Eighth
there is a sharp contest in the Repub
lican camp between M. L. Ward of San
Diego and S. C. Smith of Kern. v
The political atmpsphere In the
Fourth and Fifth districts is hazy.
There is a rumor in political circles
that the Republican nomination in the
Fourth District has been promised by
somebody or by some' so-called "organ
ization" to G. B. Benham. Reference to
the State blue book shows that Ben
ham ran for Congress in this district in
1900 as the nominee of the Social Dem
ocrats' and received 969 votes, against
17,111 for Julius Kahn, 11,742 for R. Por
ter Ashe and 1116 for Dr. C. C. O'Don
nell.
The report goes that R. H. Country
man of San Francisco has a good
chance of winning the favor of the Re
publican convention of the Fifth, but
party sentiment seems to favor the se
lection of a candidate- from the Repub
lican hosts of Santa Clara County.
There are many indications that the
Congressional and Senatorial district
conventions will not take orders from
small bosses who have elected to speak
of themselves as the "organization."
The trustees are; John Partridge,
J. S. Hutchinson, A. L. Lissak, E. P.
Heaid, H. S. Holmes, Martin Stevens,
H. W. Thorp, Captain J. M. McDonald,
G. M. Mitchell, G. D. Shadburne. Dr.
C. B. Currier, J. H. Duncan, Henry
Peters, G. A. Smith, A. R. Fredericks.
The finances of the society are in
excellent condition. The sum of
$6648 07 was expended during: the
year and a cash balance of $15,336 30,
some Spring Valley Company and gas
company stock remain in the treas
ury. The number of animals involved
in the year's work was 6379, of which
3594 were afforded relief.
As a general thing, death is the only
occasion for the election of new mem
bers to the board of trustees. The an
nual nominations and elections are cut
and dried affairs, the result of which
can usually be told offhand a year in
advance. The monotony was broken
yesterday.
Some time ago Secretary Holbrook
arrested the drivers of several fash
ionable rigs for using burr bits.
Bristles were used in some instances
and tacks in others. Convictions in all
of the cases were secured in the Police
courts. Subsequently Secretary Hol
brook went to Sacramento and secured
the passage of a law by the Legisla
ture forbidding the use of burr bits
of any description.
Dr. Dalziel had been summoned by
the defense in one of the cases where
tacks were used in the bits and tes
tified that in his opinion the device
was not cruel. Other members of the
society thought the veterinary ought
to know that sticking the business end
of a tack into a horse might cause
the animal pain and they were con
st queutly im-ensed at his testimony.
Accordingly the nominating com
mittee in making out the list of can
didates for the board of trustees yes
terday, just a few minutes before the
annual meeting, omitted the name of
Dalziel. The slighted member, who is
also a director, might have named an
opposition ticket, but he did not find
the three seconds of time allowed suf
ficient. â¢ <â¢"
The Humane Society gave Dr. I. B.
Dalziel a surprise when he appeared
at the annual meeting yesterday, when
he was dropped from the board of
trustees. The veterinary felt very
much hurt about it and made a short
speech to that effect before the i as
sembled members. The slight was put
upon him because he testified in op
position to the organization's wishes
in a court case several months ago.
t United States Immigrant Commis
sioner North received by mail yester
day a decision from the Department of
Commerce and Labor dismissing the
appeal of Yee Ching Ton from the
judgment of Mr. North denying him
a landing. "Tee arrived on the steam
ship Doric on May 12 of this year, and
claimed to be a native of the United
States. The decision as promulgated
by Secretary Metcalf will render it
very difficult for a Chinese immigrant
to prove that he was born in the
United States. The following is the
text of the decision:
This record presents the usual stereotyped
conditions cf such cases. Two witnesses tes
tify with remarkable consistency as to the
fact and date of appellant's birth- in this
country, as to the time of his alleged depar
ture for China with his parents, and as<to his
identity with the person who it Is claimed was
horn, under the circumstances â¢ narrated,
twrnty-six years Â»ro. Neither of the witnesses
displays any knowledge of events contem
poraneous with the alleged date of birth, nor
do they show any reason for displaying such
a remarkable exactness of memory in regard
to such a -remote event and one In which it
does not appear that they had any personal
Interest. The only reasonable explanation that
the <lpr>artment can discover lies In the fact
that both witnesses have, within the past few
years, been to Chine, have there met the
father of. appellant, discussed . the subject, of
the latter's birth in the United' States and
thus acquired this precise Information, which
it Is contrary to all reason to assume that
they could have obtained soltly from their rec
ollection. . Â«-.-.-
It is true there are certain contradictions
upon comparatively Irrelevant points, but this
alone would not .justify the rejection of the
evidence as unworthy of credence. . Such re
jection, however, is justified upon the. broader
grounds already stated. If the department .were
to accept as proof of the claims made such
testimony as that contained in this record it
can see no reason why, by the exercise of a
little ingenuity, any Chinese person in the
twenties may not both secure admission to the
United States, but. as well, establish his stand
ing as an American citizen. Without assigning
further reasons, the department dismisses the
appeal, although it believes that such a case,
where a child Is born of alien parents, already
having offspring in their own home abroad, and
leaving shortly after the birth of such child
for a permanent residence In their own home,
and where the child so born in the United
Staten waits- until he Is 2H years of age, es
tablishes himself in his own country and mar- [
rles before he attempts to claim his birthright,
is not within the reasoning upon which the
Supreme Court reached its decision In the
V.'ona; Kim Ark cas*. This point it Is not :
necessary to elaborate, the evidence being 1 In
sufficient and Incredible aÂ« regards the birth I
of appellant In the United States. .
The appeal Is accordingly dismissed. '#

Dr. Whitney was called, but the pros
tcution objected to his testimony as he
did not attend the defendant at the
time the alleged fraudulent transac
tions took place. During the argu
ment as to the admissibility of his
testimony the jury was excused. At
torneys Ach, Dunne and Shortridge
contended that Dr. Whitney could prove
by the defendant's present physical
condition that he was not able to at
tend to the business of the firm at the
time the deal with Beck was made.
The prosecution, on the other hand,
argued that as fifteen months has
r.lapsed such evidence would not be
competent.
At the conclusion of the arguments
Judge Lawlor took tne matter under
advisement and announced that the
case would be called at 9:20 this morn
ing and that a session would be held
this evening.
"Did you ever have any conversa
tion with Josua Eppinger on the sub
ject of loaning money on California
xvheat?'
Â¦"No, sir," he answered.
"Did you ever have any conversation
with any member of the firm aside
from Jaoob Eprunger on the subject of
loaning money on wheat?"
"Positively not."
RETROACTIVE EVIDENCE.
Counsel for the defense in the case
cf Jacob Eppinger yesterday afternoon
made a strong plea to have testimony
as to the former grain king's present
physical condition introduced in evi
dence, arguing that by this means it
could be proved that the al-
If-ged fraudulent deals were made Ep
pinger was not capable of conducting
the affairs cf the concern. The prose
cution argued, on the other hand, that
this evidence would prove nothing, but
v-iis being introduced simply to influ
ence the minds of the jurors and work
on their sympathies. During the day
Colonel F. E. Beck, manager of the
International Banking Corporation,
was recalled to the stand and flatly
-contradicted Josua Eppinger, who
last Friday testified that he had dis
cussed the subject of loans with Beck.
Color.el Beck asserted positivsly that
no such conversation had ever taken
place ajid that his talk with Josua
had related solely to the collection of
money on an insurance policy and the
purchase of bills of exchange.
Josua Eppinger was the lirst wit
ness 'called yesterday morning: and he
â¢was again questioned as to his method
of making out the list of assets of the
firm prior to April 14. 1503, when the
Joan was negotiated with Colonel
Beck. He could give no lucid expla
nation of the sudden increase in the
value of certain pieces of property,
nor could he explain why in some
cases he used the book values as
ehown by the ledger and in other in
stances jotted down the original cost,
as. for instance, in the case of the
IT'ixon. property, which was rated in
the ledger at $10,000, but valued by
Josua at IIS, 000.
JUST HAPPENED TO FORGET.
â¢ To a series of questions asked by
Attorney Campbell the only reply of
the witness after much deliberation
and rereading: of questions was, "I
don't know."' He did not know wheth
er the assets of the firm could be told
from the books; he did not know how
many of the bills receivable figuring
in h!s list were outlawed by the stat
ute of limitations, and he did not
know how much ca?h. if any, was on
hand. He had '"just happened to for
pef the cash.
At this Doint the witness did remem
ber one thing â he had on one occasion
negotiated a loan with the London,
Paris and American Bank and also a
loan with Mr. Conn. Last week he
ewcre that he had never negotiated
any loans with any bank.
Josua testified that Colonel Beck
had never mentioned the loaning of
money on California wheat until April
10. 1903, and at that time Colonel Beck
said he had already mentioned (the
subject to Jacob Eppinger.
Colonel Beck was next called to the
ttand and asked:
