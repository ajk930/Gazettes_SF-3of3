Westerner's Warning Assures ''Fren
zied Finance" Author of Ei
citing Half-Hour.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Ca.IL
NEW YORK, Dec. 12.â Colonel W. C.
Green, the well known mininsr man,
has come out with a flaming excoriation
of Thomas TV. Lawson. These are some
of the things that he calls the Boston
author of "Frenzied Finance":
"A fraud, a wrecker of widows' for
tunes, a liar, a faker, a. charletan."
Added to this. Colonel Green declares
â with significant emphasis that he is go-
Ing to pay a visit to Lawson in the lat
ter's Boston office. Figuratively, the
Western miner says "Look out!"
Green figured three months ago In a
sensational hold-up in an "L" train,
when a Westerner by the name of
Goodman kept the mining man covered
with two big revolvers all the way
from Colonel Green's hotel to Green's
office. The man was released from the
Tombs a f-Â±\v days ago, the charge
against him having been dropped.
This is what Colonel Green has to say
about demanding satisfaction from
Lawson in his office:
"To-morro-w, in Boston, I shall call
on you. I for many years have stood
ax a \Turker, as a man who has built up
and who has created, and I know that
the savings of a lifetime of many hon
est investors have been swept away by
the falsehoods that you have spread
abroad through the public press. To
morrow, at your office, I shall denounce
you for what you areâ a liar, a -faker
and a charlatan. The Master long ago
eaid: 'By your works ye shall be
Judged.' Fersonally, I shall call upon
you for your answer to-morrow."
Colonel Green, like Lawson, delivers
himself of the foregoing through the
medium of half-page advertisements
that will appear in to-morrow's news
papers.
LAWSOX RENEWS ATTACK.
BOSTON, Dec. 12.â Thomas W. Law
eon renewed his attack upon the stock
market to-day, using Amalgamated
Copper as a club to hammer Steel and
Sugar, and 'the street" has it that he
will continue his tactics to-morrow. It
is understood that another half-page
broadside will be sprung upon the pub
lic in the morning advertising columns
end that he will continue this form of
attack more or less throughout the
week. Last week, Lawson claims, he
spent JS2.000 In advertising, while tele
graph tcrlls and circulars brought the
total up to $100,000. In an interview
to-day he said:
'â¢The frightened leaders and agents
of the 'system' spread reports that I
was In league with the leading plung
ers and manipulators of Wall street;
that I was making a mere stock raid;
that I was trying to shake down Mr.
Rogers. The truth is that I have no
partners. Not a soul knew my plans
until my first advertisement appeared.
I have no srice, for there can be no
peace now until the whole rotten
echeme of finance is smashed. I am In
deadly earnest. The Government is
bound to take notice of the great
crimes against the people."
Lawson says that If no Federal ac
tion is taken toward prosecuting the
Btock waterers, stock jobbers and fin
ancial manipulators he will take it him -
Belf. In a statement this afternoon he
said: "v^'
"I believe the 'system* for the first
time realized that this battle is going to
be fought with facts, and that such
fakes as were spread broadcast on Fri
day and Saturday, -which heretofore
have been the 'system's' principal am
munition, must be abandoned. It will
be well for the insiders of great cor
porations which buy their own securi
ties from the public, after having sold
them to the public at higher prices,
and after their directors and insiders
have Fold theirs, to get in all such work
at once, for this class of business is
going to end."
J WAIJj STRECT HARD HIT.
NEW YORK. Dec. 12.â Beginning
with heavy declines in Amalgamated
Copper, to-day's market was weak
throughout the entire session, the oc
casional rallies failing to hold prices
for more than a few minutes at a
time. Although values crumbled away
rapidly, there was little excitement in
the street. Brokers seemed to have
nothing" but selling orders, they said,
and they did not look beyond that fact!
the recent reckless speculation and the
campaign by newspaper "advertisement
against a- copper stock, to find reasons
for the drop in prices. Monev was
easy and loans were made freely, but
collateral was scrutinized very care
fully. The market closed weak, with
prices generally at the lowest.. '
More than two million shares of
stock changed hands during the day.

LONDON. Dec. 12.â Sterilized milk

The City Council is losing money by

the public could well afford to make

in the city.

LEGAL WAR
IS WON BY

Western Union Poles
May Be Taken
Down.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.â The Su
preme Court of the United States to
day decided the case of the Western
Union Telegraph. Company vs. the
Pennsylvania Railroad! ' involving the
right of the Pennsylvania company to
remove the telegraph company's poles
from its right of way, in favor of the
railroad company. The opinion was
handed 'down by Justice McKenna. in
the decision the court held that the
Congressional act pf 1866, which gov
erns the case, does not grant eminent
domain to telegraph companies over
the private property of railroad com
panies.
The Supreme Court also decided the
case of the Western Union Telegraph
Company vs. the Pennsylvania Rail
road Company involving the right of
the telegraph company to condemn~a
part of the railroad's right of way in
Western Pennsylvania and appropriate
it for its lines in opposition to the tele
graph company's contentions. This is
a second case in the controversy be
tween these companies.
Responding to contentions " on the
part of the counsel for the telegraph
company in the first case that rail
roads are not essentially different from
other highways. Justice McKenna
said:
' "This argument would seem to make
a railroad ,- right of way public prop
erty. To that extreme we cannot go.
The right of way of a railroad Is prop
erty devoted to public use and has
often been, called a highway and as
such is subject to a certain extent to
State and Federal control, but it has
always been recognized that a railroad
right of way. is so far private property
as to be entitled to that provision of
the constitution which forbids its tak
ing except under the power of eminent
domain and upon payment of compen
sation.
"It follows from these views that
the act of 1S66 does not grant the
right to both companies to ehter upon
and occupy the rights of way of rail
road companies except with the con
sent of the latter or. grant eminent
domain. Nor does the statute of New-
Jersey make those rights of way. pub

such occupation under the provisions

IN CELL OF
A POISONER
Recalls the Trial and
Suicide of Dr.
Convicted Murderer Writes
ol Visitations by Vic-
Impelled to End His Life ty the
Knowledge That Hi? Kind Is .

Special Dispatch to The Call,
DENVER. Dec. 12.â Before Dr. T.
Thatcher Graves committed suicide in
the County Jail, more ' than eleven
years ago, he left a statement of his
reasons for doing so. The statement re
mained undiscovered until a few days
ago, when a plumber in making repairs
in the cell formerly occupied by the
physician found a letter tucked in a
crevice in the wall behind a section of
pipe.
Dr. Graves was sentenced In this city
to bÂ« hanged on the last Friday in July,
1893, for having poisoned Mrs. Jose
phine B. Barnaby, widow of J. B. Barn
aby, the millionaire merchant of New
York, Providence, R. I., and Boston.
His case was one of the most sensa
tional ever tried In the Denver courts
and extended over two years.
After his conviction an appeal was
taken to the Supreme Court, which
granted him a ne,w trial. On the eve of
this trial he- committed suicide by
drinking" water In which he had washed
flypaper, which he was â¢â¢ allowed to dis
tribute] about -his" cell. . â¢'*"Â»'
"WRITING IS THAT OF GRAVES? -
v The. finding; of "the letter, which' was
turned over to" Warden Hudson of the
County Jail, was kept secret until the
officers, attorneys and others who had
participated in the case had inspected
the statement arid decided' that the
writing was that of Dr. Graves. The
statement follows:
"I have determined to commit suicide.
As a physician I have always preferred
death to madness, and I am convinced
that If I am compelled to remain here
much longer I shall go insane. I am
so afraid, and yet no one, not even my
self, seems to think me a coward. I
dread my trial more every moment that
I live, and yet it| might come out all
right for me.
"But I'm afraid to take any chances,
and even if I did get free my character
is ruined, so I figure that I might as
well end my misery now. I have, be
sides this, another reason for what I
am about to do, and as no one will ever
see this I will tell it, as it relieves my
mind in some measure.
HAUNTED BY A GHOST.
"The ghost of Mrs. Barnaby appears
to me even 7 night and seems to- call
me. I am not ashamed to confess that
I am afraid to see that awful white
face again. I don't know why she
should come to me, but she does, and
upon that I am afraid, and even when
I think of It my hand trembles so I
can hardly write.
"It won't be hard to commit suicide
and I. am not afraid of death. I be
lieve there is a merciful One, and into
his hands I commit myself. All my
life I have tried to do right, and surely
that will count for something now.
'Tempus fugit.' Soon they will bring
me something to eat and then they will
leave me, and when they come again. I
shall be no more.
"To write this has made me feel blue.
They will take my pen away when they
bring me food, and I must hurry and
hide this. I told them I was going to
write a letter,. but they. will think I am
opening my wrist. I have the feeling
now that I always have when Mrs.
Barnaby appears. I am cold all over,
and^ I am afraid. But I must give up
my pen.
"I wish to add that I never murdered
Mrs. Barnaby."

Nearly a dozen firms were caught by

they were taken to the Los Angeles

to the checks .of that company long
enough to take a copy of them. The

WASHINGTON*, Dec. 12.â Three wit
esses were heard to-day in the case
f Senator Reed Smoot before the Sen-
te Committee on Privileges and Elec
:ons. Thcf first witness was Rev. J.
.L Buckley, editor of the Christian
Vdvocate of New York, who told of a
>lonr>o:i meeting he attended in Salt
last summer, in which President
osei'h F. Smith declared he would not

estilicd in regard to the ceremonies

tical divorces granted by the church.
and John Henr: Hamlin told of the
plural marriage of his sister. Lillian.
toVApostle Abram Cannon, which cere
mony he raid he understood to have
boea performed by President Smith
sinct.- the marifeslo of 1830.
Dr. Buckley told of visits to Utah
in 1901, and again last June. At that
time he attended a joint convention of
the Young Men's and Young Women's
unions of Mormonism. Those who
spoke were Brirhani H. Roberts, El
mira S. Tailor and President Smith,
Dr. Buckley read from an article he
had writtoci concerning the convention
end cixbtcd from the speech of Presi
dent hinith on the subject of marriage.
The witness said that for ten or lif
teen minutes President Smith had
talked of the responsibilties of mar
riage and how the contract was re
garded by many persons.
LOYAL TO HIS WIVES.
"Then." raid Dr. Buckle;-, "President
Fmith drew himself up to his full
heieht and ppoke on the subject x>f di
vorce. He said that the mothers of
his children had been given him by
God iir.d were saints of God. He de
plored the mother-in-law jokes, and
said that his own mothers-in-law were
the be^: fru-nCs he ever had; that they
were true women worthy of their
daughters."
Dr. BucUiey read from another ar
ticle on this meeting which said that
President Smith's voice rang out "as
strong as William J. Bryan's'* as he
dc-fer.dt-d the Mormon marriage. Pres
ident Smith was quoted by the wit
ness as sayirs that he could not give
up any of his wivesâ that it meant
eternal damnation to abandon a multi
plicity cf wives.
Dr. Buckley said he had made in
quiry concerning Senator Smoot. and
he hiid fou;:d no one who said one
word agair.st him. Everywhere, the
witness said^ Senator Smoot was given
an excellent character.
MARRIAGES WITH TI1E DEAD.
George Reynolds, a Mormon living
in Salt Lake, testified that he was the
first assistant superintendent of the
Mormon church Sunday-school and
secretary of the missionary committee
of th^ apostles and formerly clerk, or
recorder, of the Endowment House.
This relation was severed in about 1S71.
The Endowment House was torn down
in 1550, but the Temple is now used for
the same purpose. Reynolds told the
committee that he has given certifi
cates of marriage since he ceased to
be recorder of the Endowment Kous?,
In cases where widows sought to ob
tain pensions. He made the certificates
from records in his possession, but
these records, he said, had since been
removed to the Temple and he had
no access to them now.
In answer to questions by Senator
Overman. Reynolds said marriages
were performed with dead persons in
the Endowment House. Taylor then
asked if divorces were granted in the
Endowment House.
"The church grants divorces to those
who have been married for time and
eternity, but does not divorce legal
marriages until the courts have acted,"
said Reynolds, "Plural marriages are
not recognized by courts, and therefore
the churrh docs not consult the courts
In granting divorces in cases of such
marriages."
Senator Forakcr asked if such di
vorces are granted from dead persons.
"In a few instances only, I should
eay." said the witness.
"For something done after death or
before?" the Senator asked.
In life time."
"Is the dead person given an oppor
tunity to be heard?" the Senator asked.
"No. sir; it is becauseO such cases
are hc-ld to be unjust to the dead ac
cused, so that few divorces of this kind
are granted," said the witness.
"Is any one appointed to defend the
accused?"
"Never; but the complainant is given
a hearing if satisfactory evidence is
supplied to the church."
wrrxivss a polygamist.
Reynolds testified that the president
of the church always had the authority
to issue ecclesiastical divorce.

of separation between George T. and
Ellen Watson, which Reynolds ' ac
knowledged he executed In 1897. He
said that he did not know now whether
the marriage he dissolved was a plural
one or not.
"Are you a polygamist?" Tayler
asked.
"Yes, sir," answered Reynolds.
"Have you any children married in
polygamy?"
'I believe soâ one daughter."
"To whom is she married?"
"If married, it is to Benjamin
The witness explained that the mar
riage had taken place in Mexico, but
that he had no knowledge of the cere
mony and never had made any in
quiries concerning it.
Reynolds testified that he had twen
ty-six children. He gave the names of
the seven presidents of the Seventies,
of which he is fourth in rank.- Three of
the seven were polygamists. He (Rey
nolds) had two wives now.
"lf you were to marry any woman to
morrow, which would be your legal
wife?"
"The one last married."
Reynolds . said that he understood
that the manifesto of 1SS0 permitted
him to live with his plural' wives with
out violating the law, but that no fur
ther wives could be contracted. Witness
acknowledged that he had had chll-
dren by two wives since the* manifesto
of 1890. Witness had never preached
against polygamy, nor had ,he tried to
gfct others to do so. He said he did
rot know of any effort made by any
officials of the church to carry out
the provision of the Woodruff mani
festo putting an end to polygamy.
INSPIRED WORD REVISED.
Reynolds said that he was one of
the advisers who aided in perfecting
In? Woodruff manifesto, which was
lirst submitted In President Wood
ruffs handwriting. He testified that
the committee had revised the mani
festo.
"I believe the manifesto is said to
have been inspired?" asked Chairman
Eurroughs.
"It was a revelation from the Al
miphty.^Â»
"And you changed it?"
"Not the meaning."
"You just changed the phraseology?"
"Yes, sir."
"Then, as I understand it," paid Sen
ator Burroughs, "when this revelation
came from the Almighty the gram
mar was bad and you corrected it?"
The witness said the phraseology had
not been inspired, but \yas President
Woodruff's own. The testimony kept
the committee-room in an uproar.
John Henry Hamlin of Salt Lake
City, the brother of L.illian Hamlin,
whom the protestants have tried to
show was married to Apostle Abram
Cannon on the high seas in 18S6, said*
it was the family conviction that his
sister was married to Cannon in â¢ the
summer cf 1336 and that the ceremony
vas performed by President Smith
on the Pacific Coast. Lillian was saM
by her brother to have been an at
tractive young woman. He had not
heard from her for four or five years,
and did not know where she was now.
She had one daughter, he said, who
went by the name of Martha Cannon.
"Well, nobody doubts that the child
is Abram Cannon's daughter?" asked
Tayler.
"No, sir," Tvafe the reply.
On cross-examination j the witness
taid he had no positive proof that his
sister had married Cannon. His ' sis
ter had attended the funeral services
of Cannon and her child inherited the
estate cf Cannon.

Senate Favors Removing Large Tract

WASHINGTON. Dec. 12. â Senator
i Perkins to-day called up and secured

to the Sierra forest reserves.
The territory has been a matter of
contention since it was incorporated

DEBATE IX THE SENATE
Short-Argument on the Pure
Food Bill and Measures
Necessary to End Frauds
Special Dispatch to The Call,
WASHINGTON, â  Dec. 12.â The - Ren
ate had under consideration to-day the
pure food and the Philippine Govern
ment bills. . Debate on the former v/sys
con.ined to calling .attention to the
inadequacy of the protection .accorded
the people of the United States against
impure foods and drugs. ; - ,
The discussion of the Philippine bill
related solely tp tlm cuestion oC the
guarantee .: by the Philippine Govern
ment of the income or .interest on
bonds of railroads in those islands.
In explanation of the pure food bill,
Heyburn said that it was directed at
the evil of adulteration of foods and
drug's. Every State had enacted a pure
food law, covering: in its general pur
pose the scope of the proposed legisla
tion. He declared' that some of the
most injurious articles coming ' from
foreign countries were manufactured
in violation of the domestic laws of
those countries, but prosecution was
evaded because the goods were made
especially for American trade.
Stewart of Nevada said that to se
cure the bfst results sufficient money
should be given the Secretary of Ag
riculture to n'ake a proper investiga
tion and publish the results to the
whole world. Private parties, he said,
particularly the press, would not pub
lish an expose of the frauds in foods
and drugs, because "the patronage is
on the other side."
Heyburn and McCumber made an
earnest plea for early action on the
bill, the latter deploring the fact that
in four years the pure food advocates
had been unable to secure a vote.
When the Philippine Government bill
was taken up Spooner attacked the
provision relating to the guarantee of
income or Interest on bonds of rail
roads in the Philippines, and said the
Philippine Commission should not , be
authorized to make such a guarantee.
Replying to a suggestion by New
lands that the Philippine Government
build the railroads itself, Spooner said
he was not much captivated with the
idea of Government ownership of rail
roads." It the Government under any
circumstances was to -guarantee divi
dends ontstpek the^ railroads ought not
to be permitted to put on that prop
erty a mortgage or lien without the con
sent of Congress.
Disclaiming that, he had become a
convert to Government ownership of
railroads, Newlands said It would be
worth something to try the experiment
of Government ownership of the pro
posed road, because, if unsuccessful,
ownership of railroads in
the United States need no longer be
considered.
FORESTRY NOW AGRICULTURE.
Transferred From the Department of
the Interior.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. â The
House transacted a large amount of
miscellaneous business to-day, starting
with pension bills and considering the
Hill financial bill later in the day.
The bill transferring the forest re
serves from the Department of the
Interior to the Department of Agri
culture, which has been pending in
Congress for several years, was passed.
When the House took up Hill's
financial bill Hill said this nation must
get back to the gold standard, which
ho learned from very high authorities
had^ been "irrevocably established."
Williams of Mississippi said there was
an influence at work to displace Gov
ernment-provided money with bank
provided money and thereby enable
the banks to make the profit on it.
During a heated colloquy with Hill,
Williams said the bill under considera
tion would double ' the possibility of
the perpetration of this "iniquitous
wrong." He predicted that it simply
would lead to socialism. The bill was
then laid aside, after being made a
continuing order after the Swayne
resolution, which is the special order
for to-morrow.

HE SUCCEEDS METCALF
Knowlaiid Given a Place on
the Weights and Measures
Body by Speaker Cannon
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAtj, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.âRepresenta
tive J. C. Needham of California was
to-day named by Speaker Cannon for
the place on the Ways and Means Com
mittee made vacant by the resignation
of Victor H. Metcalf, now Secretary of
the Department of" Commerce and La
bor. The Ways and Means is the most
important committee of the House, and
membership upon -it carries more than
ordinary weight and ! influence. Compe
tition for the place has been keen,
especially among the Western members,
to whom It was conceded it should go.
< Needham has been a favorite in the
race from the start, not only because
the place was made vacant by a Call
fornian, but because of his good record
and known quality as a legislator. He
is a sturdy stand-patter on the 'tariff,
and this- is known to weigh with the
Speaker, who has no use for tariff re
vision at this time. Needham is a mem
ber of the Public Lands Committee,
upon which he has done Important
work, and also of the Committee on
Insular Affairs. Speaker Cannon said
he would retain him on both these com
mitteej for this session, as he Is fa
miliar with the legislation now before
them, but at the next session he would
have to resign one of them. He Is in
line for the chairmanship of the In-
Bulf r Affairs Committee, and will
therefore probably drop out of the Pub
lic Lands Committee.
Upon the announcement of his acces
sion to the Ways and Means Commit
tee, made just before adjournment to
day, Needham received the congratu
lations of all the coast members of the
House, as well as the present members
of the committee.
Representative J. R. Knowland of
Oakland, who succeeds to Metcalf's
seat in the ,'House, was placed on the
Committee on Coinage, Weights and
Measures. Other committee announce
ments made by the Speaker were:
Wood . of . New.:.' Jersey, to Coinage,
Weights and Measures; Webber of
Ohio, to insular Affairs; Heflln of-Ohio,
to Mines and Mining; Thomas. of Ohio,
to Militia, and Education; Crost of

person. They also agreed that eighteen
Republican ballots had been written by

HOW OXE THOUSAND DOLLARS
MADE A MILLION*
Mr. Vanderbilt Tells " an Interesting
Story of Fabulous
Profits.
NEW YORK, Dec. 12.â A novel book
let is creating a sensation in financial
circles here, and Wall street is deeply
interested In It, particularly as it is
being circulated by W. G. Vanderbilt.
He tells how he made a million dollars
by investing a thousand, and the story
is. intensely interesting.
Mr. Vanderbilt was interviewed at his
offices in No. 100 William street, N.
Y., and stated that he was pleased that
his booklet had been so well received.
He said: "I met so many people who
were groping in the dark about finan
cial matters I decided to publish some
of the things I have learned about
business, and send it out as a tribute
to my personal friends'. But, dear me,
my friends told everybody about it,
and my mall is flooded with requests
for the booklet. Therefore I have de
cided that I can do nothing better for
my fellow man than to send a copy of
it to any one who will write to me at
No. 100 William street."
"Do you intend to distribute these
free?"
"Certainly," he responded, "because
I know no one will be interested in the
matter except those who have saved
enough money. and want to know how
to make their savings earn more than
simple interest, hence I willbe doing
the best sÂ«rvice for those who need it
most, and that is the. real essence of
true philanthropy. I would like to have
applicants for this book write me fully
and I will be pleased to send any one
a copy."
At least a score of bankers and fin
ancial men, who were interviewed sub
sequently, all agreed that Mr. Vander
bllt's book should be in everybody's
hands who desired to improve their
condition financially.
sharp rebuke to them for their bravado
and apparent unconcern.
"It is not amiss to note," he said,
"that during the progress of this trial,
as well as in previous cases, some of
the respondents brought In here seem
to think that the pollution of the bal
lot-box is simply a pastimeâ something
that does not call for condemnation.
They seem to be amused when testi
mony is being introduced clearly estab
lishing their guilt..
"The testimony Is undisputed that
these respondents added upward of 200
ballots to the box after the polls were
closed. They show from the folds that
they could not haVe been put in the
box in the usual wayâ that is, passed
through the opening In the top of the
box. They show, to the extent of at
least 176, that they were written by the
same person. Such conduct as that is
reprehensible."

FIVE PIANOS
Or Practically Nothing, Compared
to Their Worth, for They Are
Factory Samples to Goat
Factory Cost.
One Elaborate "Conover," Worth
$575, for $295. One Magniii-
cent "Reed & Sons,"
Worth $550, for $3C8.
Three Elaborate, Hand Carved
"Needham" Pianos, Two
Worth $550 Each, for $295;
the Other, Worth
$500, for $255.
The above five sample pianos are ex-
tra exhibition styles, very elaborate, in
both design and hand carving (except
one. the "Reed & Sons," which is with-
out carving, but rarelv handsome in
design and curly walnut veneers), but
in the prices here quoted there is no
consideration for carving. They must
be sold before to-morrow night, at
which time this sale closes, and the
figures made here will sell them, we
feel positive, if only five customers call
to-day who would pay anywhere near
$300 for a piano. It is almost a pity to
sell a piano so fine as either of the
above five samples below $300, on terms
of $25 down and $10 per month, or any
other terms, but being fine and costly
samples, not in our regular line, we
cannot afford to carry them in stock
at any price, hence this unusual sac-
rifice.
Just a few of those celebrated "V7e-\
ber" pianos yet to close out at $163 to
$260 below their standard price tha
world over, and to-day and to-mornrw
ought to finish them. Don't fallâ rain,
or shineâ to see the Weber before to-
morrow night, if you want the very
best at a nominal sum. We no longer

closing them out at cost, on terms, $50
down and $10 per month. Other fine
makes from $295, down to $106, on
terms of S25 down and $10 per month.
Make no mistake; this is the only
genuine "cut price" piano sale now go-
ing on In this city. We have a legiti-
mate excuse for closing .out our Weber
line at cost, and we are not asking or
expecting a dollar profit Every piano
we offer here Is brand new, and ac-

When a citizen right here at home
makes a public statement like the fol-
lowing all room for doubt disappears
and the most skeptical doubter must
be convinced. It's pretty hard for our
readers to prove a statement made by
a stranger living in some far-away-
point of the Union, but the indorse-
ment of neighbors, friends and citi-
zens is the best of proof; no better
evidence can be had.
J. A. Kell (retired) of 605 Broad-
way says: "For a year or more my
batrk was weak and ached continually,
not severely enough to lay me up,
but it certainly was very disagree-
able. I knew the cause of my trouble
from the action and condition of the
kidney secretions, but what to do to
flop it was a mystery. I came to
California in 1853; tho greater part
of my life has been spent in mining,
an occupation decidedly hard on the
constitution, and when attacks of
kidney complaint affect a man it is
more difficult than ordinary to re-
move. Doan's Kidney Pills certainly
stopped my backache. It is now some
seven or eight months since I stopped
the treatment, and at the present timo
I have not a sign of anything' wrong

WOMAN TWICE INDICTED.
CLEVELAND. Dec. 12. â Trouble
for Mrs. Cassie L. Chadwick increased
at a rapid rate to-day. She was twice
indicted* by the Grand Jury of Cuya
hoga- County and her old time friend,
Iri Reynolds, took the stand in court
and made eVident his intention to
shield and protect her no longer.
The aged secretary of the Wade
Park Bank presented a pathetic pic
ture as he answered question after
question which brought out his im
plicit faith in the woman whose fin
ancial transactions have well nigh
ruined him in fortune and* caused
him such Infinite trouble. He gave
evidence, too, that he still believes his
trust was justified. Oifty one query
he attempted to evade. This was
when he was asked how much of his
personal estate had passed into the
possession of Mrs. Chadwick. His
eyes filled and he requested that he
be excused from answering.
The formal indictments voted
against Mrs. Chadwick this afternoon
are based, one upon the Carnegie note
for $250,000, which was ma'de pay
able at the office of A"ndrew Carnegie
in New Ycrk City, and the other upon
the Carnegie note for $500,000, which
was made payable at the National
Bank of Commerce in New York. Un
der each Indictment are two counts,
one charging forgery, the other the
uttering of a forged paper.
Information of the indictments was
at once wired to New York by County
Prosecutor Keeler, and % he requested
that Mrs. Chadwick be immediately
rearrested If. she had obtained ball on
the other charge hanging over her..
IRI REYNOLDS TELLS ALL.
The examination of Iri Reynolds be
fore Referee Remington In the bank
ruptcy court to-day failed to disclose
any asset that might be secured by
Receiver Loeser, appointed by the
Federal court. In reply to a question
he said:
"She told me she was the illegiti
mate daughter of Andrew Carnegie."
Later Reynolds, in detailing his
transactions with Mrs. Chadwick,
said:
"In all my transactions with Mrs.
Chadwick I believed from what she
toM me that Andrew Carnegie was
backing her and that all her indebted
ness would be Daid."
He then added: "And I have not had
anything yet to make me doubt it/v
In detailing how he came Into pos
session of the $5,000,000 note bearing
the name of Andrew Carnegie, he said:
"Mrs. Chadwick called me to the
house â 1 think it was on March 5, 1903
âand said she wished to intrust to me
Eome securities. She said she had been
advised to place them in the possession
of a third party and she, wanted me to
take care of them." -, â  vJLvJ*
This is the package that was opened
last Friday night, in the presence of
Mrs. Reynolds and Attorney Steam,
by Attorney Andrew Squire. The pack
age was produced in court and Rey
nolds identified the Carnegie note, the
mortgage deed and the copies of an
alleged trust agreement. Continuing,
the witness said:
"She then handed me a paper to
sign." Y, vj $>Â£{â :
This paper witness did not have with
him but, as nearly as he could remem
ber, it read :
"I cfkify that I hold in trust for Mrs.
Cassie L. Chadwick securities and a
note for $5,000,000."
The note was not Indorsed, but he
had no doubt that the alleged maker
of the note was back of the woman.
ONE CASE OF DECEPTION.
Asked as to the other transactions
subsequent to 1903, Reynolds said:
"There Is one. It is a little banking
secret, but I am willing to tell it. She
came to me â I think it was In 1904 â
and said she had 512,000 in paper pay
able at the Prudential Trust Company.
If I would let her have the money she
would put up United States Steel bonds
In the morning as collateral. I con
sulted my company and with their con
sent loaned her the money. The next
day she brought a package which she
said contained $200,000 in United States
Steel bonds and a $250,000 certificate,
â Hrhich I was to hold in trust for her
under the same conditions as the previ
ous package. I held these until a
month ego, when, in the presence of
ceveral gentlemen, - they â  were opened.
It was about the time Newton began
his suit. They contained bonds all
right, but they were not steel bonds."
When asked what they were Rey
nolds said:
"There were five $1000. bonds of the
Home Telegraph Company of Niagara,
N. Y., and six certificates of the Buck
eye Fish Company.' 1
Repeated efforts 'on Reynolds* part
tc close up the dealings with Mrs.
Chadwick met with excuses and de
lays. He was put off time after time,
yet Me did not lose confidence.
Several, notes of $10,000 each, payable
to Dr. Chadwick, had been taken up by
Reynolds. He declared they were pay
able out of any moneys that might
have been on credit to Mrs. Chadwick
In the First National Bank of Cleve
land. Some of these were paid and in
February or March, W04, money was
placed to her credit In this bank. Rey
nolds believed the money came from
the East to pay all these and, felt as
sured that what he held was all right.
INTRODUCED BY 'PHONE.
He. was furthe/ assured when Judge
Olcott of New York came to Cleveland
and was introduced to him over the
telephone by Mrs. Chadwick. Judge
Olcott assured him that he would re
lieve Mrs. Chadwick, from her unen
viable position- HeTtnew Judge Olcott
was here. because he was assured by a
check for $1500 signed, by Judge Olcott
he received the next day. -,; ,
He last saw her November 10. She
desired to go East and had no money.
He cashed a check on the Lincoln
Trust Company of New York. It was
returned marked "account closed." He
took it out of, the Wade Park J3ank,
paid It and has It in his possession.
He brought the Newton' f debt to Her at
tention and advised hereto go' East and
raise the money and settle the whole
affair and he thought she went 1 East to
see Andrew Carnegie. â¢
â  Reynolds came away from New York,
THE ; SAN FRANCISCO CALU 'TUESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1904.
h<i says, because he did not have money
enough to stay there two hours.
"She has fooled me and many
smarter men than me; she has pulled
the wool over everybody's eyes," said
he. Then,' with a faint smile, as though
the humor appealed to him despite his
troubles, he said: :;. v : ; l
'â¢'Once she wrote to me to ask If I
needed help because of the 'run' on. the
bank."
United States Attorney Sullivan de
clared to-night that he would not in
sist upon the personal attendance of
Carnegie at the session of the Federal
Grand Jury on Wednesday.
DR. CHADWICK'S DENIAL.
. PARIS, Dec- 12. â Dr. Leroy S.
Chadwick of Cleveland, whose wife,
Cassie L. Chadwick. is held a prison
er in New York, said to-day:
'There Is no truth in, the report
that Mrs. Cha&wick settled a larere
sum on me. Do I look like a man of
millions?" he added, s caliingr attention
to his appearance. "Any one would
be able to see that I am 'not a man
who had received millions from his
wife."
Asked whether Mrs. Chadwick is In
reality Lydia Devere, he answered:
"The first time that I ever, heard
the name of Madame Devere In this
connection was when I saw it recent
ly in the papers. Only once before
had I ever heard the name Devere.
That was twenty-nine years ago, at a
post mortem examination at which I
assisted, on a woman of that name,
who was said to have been a fortune
teller. I only recall this from, a pe
culiar surgical feature which the post
mortem developed."
The doctor was shown a publication
stating that the Chadwick securities
embraced notes for several million
dollars signed or Indorsed with the
name Andrew Carnegie.
"I do not know Andrew Carnegie,
personally," replied the doctor.
"Does your wife know Mr. Car
negie?" the doctor was asked.
"I would rather not discuss Andrew
Carnegie," said Dr. Chadwick.

from the Comptroller of the Currency,

the transfer was made In order to make*

not fancy the territory to which he was
assigned and expressed his dissent by
offering his resignation, which was ao
cepted. " i* , . â¢ '
He rated in banking circles as an
alert, resolute man, who Is familiar
with the banking business. He does

on making a personal Investigation of

Making a Strange Request
DATE OF TRIAL IS SET
Prisoner Becomes Impudent
to Jailers and Sheriff Or
ders All Favors Stopped
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
AUBURN, Dec. 12.â Judge Prewett
to-day set Adolph. Julius Weber's trial
for the murder of his mother for Janu
ary 23. Attorney Grove I* Johnson
argued for a later date, but the court
thought the date set would give ample
timo to all concerned. Weber was also
arraigned on the Grand Jury indict
ment charging him with the murder of
his father.
When asjeed by the court if Adolph
Julius Weber was his true name and if
ha wished to be tried under that name,
young Weber, who wore a white ribbon
in the lapel of his coat, arose and made
the statftllng announcement that he
wished to be tried under the name of
Adolph Weber. Julius was his father's
name.
Monday next was the time set for
hearing Weber's plea, to the -charge of
killing his father. The indictment
charging Weber with the bank robbery
wag not brought up.
The contest for letters of adminis
tration on the Weber estates was com
promised. Public Administrator W. A.
Shepard taking two estates, those of
Bertha and Earl Weber, the* children,
and John Adams, guardian of Adolph
Weber; the estates of the parents.
Young Weber has been so Impudent to
the Jailers of late that Sheriff Keena
has given orders that he be shown no
more favors. Attorney, Johnson ap
pealed to the court to-day asking that
the liberties the prisoner has been en-
Joying be continued. Judge Prewett re
fused to interfere, saying the prisoner
was in charge of the Sheriff. Keena's
action Is being favorably commented
on by Auburn's citizens. They say that
the Sheriff has been entirely too good to
the prisoner and should have cut oft
his liberties before this.
â¢ It has leaked out that during the
Investigation before the Grand Jury
it was ascertained that Julius Weber
had frequent dealings with the bank
in carrying on his buslnes of loaning
money and that a short time before
the tragedy he borrowed quite a sum.
This is thought to completely dispose
of the theory that the money found
behind the barn was burled by him, art
unlikely thing In any event, as his
business was loaning money at inter
est, not hoarding it.

lenge of California to an intercollegiate
freshman debate. This decision was
made in view of the fact that so little
interest was taken by the first year
men in debating.
The general opinion is that to es
tablish an intercollegiate freshman
debate would have a bed effect, aa the
men would not have sufficient train
ing to make the contest worth while.

Rumors of impending Boxer troubles
are prevalent throughout North China.
Information from several sources
points to the fact that the Chinese are
drilling everywhere and that the con
ditions are similar to those that pre
ceded the last outbreak,', but thai the
trouble is more widespread and the
organization much better. It. is be
lieved that large nurhbers of Japanese
officers are drilling troops in the in
terior and commanding; detachments of
General Ma's army northwest of
Peking and that a Japanese reverse
would be the signal for a general rising
of the Chinese, led by Japanese offi
cers, against Russia. Many residents
here fear that such an outbreak could
not be confined to its original limits
and would endanger foreigners
throughout China.
These reports have been in circula
tion since August and are now preva
lent evc-r}"Â«"here. I was informed by
an old Shanghai resident, who is thor
oughly familiar with the conditions,
that minute preparations have been
completed for attacks on leading Euro
pean settlements in the event of anoth
er rebellion. I was unable to verify
this?, but I suspect it is partially true.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
REN'O, Dec. 12.â A cunning and suc
cessful robber entered the Wells-Fargo
office at Truckee last night and car
ried away $1500. The crime was dis
covered this morning by Agent Wint
ers, who on entering his office found
the safe open and the money drawer
empty. He Immediately notified the
officers, but the robber had done his
work well and left no clews which
might give the officers a hint as to
his identity.
The robber must have been well ac
quainted with the office and been an
expert at lock-picking, as he gained an
entrance through the door of the build
ing and opened the safe without the
use of explosives. He was careful to
take only the cash and to leave all
the papers In the safe. The office is
situated in the Southern Pacific depot
in the center of town- There are al
ways a .number of railroad men near
the office and how the thief . escaped
discovery Is remarkable.
Constable McDougal and Assistant
District Attorney Moody are working

been made.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; TUESDAY. DECEMBER 13, 1904.
Grant" Wallace .Re
tells Storn of Liao
i Bang Battle.
! Half a hundred 'officers of the army
of the United^States listened last even
ing, at the Press Club to a technical
discussion by Grant Wallace of the, op
erations of the Japanese and Russian
armies in Manchuria, Wallace, through
the: skillful : application of strenuous
journalistic theories, witnessed the bat
tip of Liaoyang from the* first boom of
the gruns to the closing thrust of the
bayonets. In consequence he was in a
position to tell the distinguished mili
tary experts that listened to his talk
many things they wanted to know since
the little empire of the Far East forced
the Western world to sit up and take
notice.
Though Wallace's remarks were cbn
flned primarily to the terrible struggle
at J^iaoyang, which has been told and
retold from a hundred different, view
points, his statements never flagged in
interest, and . his preliminary and side
remarks contained information that the
interested followers of the accounts of
the war had not been able to obtain
before.
Heretofore the news that a division
of Japanese troops had been engaged
and had attained certain results 'left
no greater impression on the reader
tha,n that a result had' been attained
by 'a unit of the Japanese army, which
might be anything" from one to a mil
lion men. Wallace in giving the "nu
merical formation ' of the army, last
evening supplied a long felt want.
IlESOURCES OF JAPAX.
First, he said, the resources of the
Japanese, from .the standpoint of men
and other resources of war, had been
largely underestimated. In his opin
ion (and his opinion was based on in
formation he could see no reason to
discredit) the Japanese could put into
the field, if finances could be found to
sustain the troops, an army of from
four to five millions of men. The regu
lar army, including the first and sec
ond reserves, totaled 500,000 men and
after those were exhausted came the
national army, which raised the figure
(always, of course, dependent upon the
question of finance) to the enormous
figure named.
He had been told, he said, by cred
ible authority, that in the arsenals of
Tplfto there were munitions of war for
a million men outside of the army at
present operating In Manchuria and
that with little difficulty another mil
lion men could.be put into the field to
battle for the Mikado and the em
pire.
Referring directly to the formation
of the Japanese army, he said the unit
of the fighting force was called the sec
tion. The section ; is ; e&mposed of
efghty-flve men/ the 'company of from
240 to 263 men, the battalion of 1000. or
practically four companies; the regi
ment of three- battalions, the brigade
of two regiments and the division of
two brigades. These figures, he said,
placed from 13,700 to 14,000 men in the
division. Including the smaller
branches of artillery, cavalry and pon
toon platoon. / These figures were ap
plauded by the military men present
because in them they began to see the
dawn of understanding break, so far
as numbers are concerned, in reports
that are to come of yet unfought bat
tles and reports of battles that have
been fought. %
LIAOYANG A BARREN VICTORY.
Wallace hazarded the opinion that
the war in the Far East had now
dwindled down to a question of finance,
and, he said, it was his view that
Russia* would best be able to weather
the storm from this standpoint, at
least until she was able to throw such
forees into Manchuria that she could
"save her face," If nothing more. The
battle of Liaoyang, he concluded, was
at best a barren victory for the Jap
anese; it gave them nothing but terri
tory they did not want, save for the
fact that it deprived the enemy of a
strategic base, but he acquitted the
Japanese of the charge that error on
their part had been responsible for the
safe retreat of the Russians to Muk
den.
VFor ten days," he said, "the. Jap
anese had fought against the .in
trenched , enemy. Of my personal
knowledge the Takushan army under
Nodzu had fought for five days and
fivp nights without sleep and with lit
tle food.' When Liaoyang fell and the
excitement of the contest was gone the
men fell asleep at their posts. Kuroki's
army was equally exhausted. Human
endurance had gone the limit and the
Russians, driven from . their magnifi
cently fortified base, were suffered . to
escape. Sleeping men lay prone beside
the dead, both happy. The dead had
given their lives for the Mikado, the
sleeping had lived to see the enemy
flee, beaten from the field."

TRACING COURSE
OF THE BULLET
Human Skeleton Again in
Evidence ' During Trial
of Miss "Nan" Patterson
EXPERT OX THE STAND
O'Hanloirs Testimony Indi
cates That Young's Wound
Was Not Self-inflicted
. NEW YORK, Dec. 12.â A headless
human skeleton- played, an .Important
part to-day in the trial, of "Nan" Pat
.terson-for the murder of Caesar Young.
The exhibit' was used in the examina
tion of 'Dr. PhiliD* O'Hanlon, the Cor
oner's physician,'' who performed, the
autopsy on Young's body.' The prose
cution contended that the, bullet that
killed- Young had gone straight to the
spine, which proved that Young did not
kill himself. -;
' Assuming that Young, with the pistol
in his right hand, had crossed it over
his chest;' and 'shot into his left side, the
prosecution "contended that the bullet
would have traveled to the left. The
fact that it flew; straight inward to .the
spine was advanced as proving that the
wound .was . not self-inflicted. Dr.
O'Hanlon .was positive that the bullet
had taken, a straight course to the
right!; ' ; . . . ./
, Lawyer' Levy, , for the defense, tried
to gain an' admission, that the muscular
parts covering the. ribs at the point of
entrance of the bullet ! may have, de
fected Its course, but Dr. O'Hanlon de
clared that there had been no deflection
until the bullet had -struck the spine. â¢
Dr. . O'Hanlon testified that he had
found powder marks on Young's fin
gers. His testimony as to the course
of the bullet was corroborated bv Dr.
â¢ Rigims of the Hudson-street Hospital.
Justice Davis said from the bench to
day that a gross impropriety had been
committed by a newspaper In publish
ing what purported to be the views of
the wives of the jurors concerning the
case^. He cautioned the Jurors not to
discuss the testimony, even In their
own families*

NEW YORK. Dec. 12.â "Nan" Pat

way from $500 to $1000 a week. Plays
have, been written for her and more
than one theatrical firm is in the fight
for her services.
"The Mystery of a Hansom Cab" Is
one of the creations that has been of
fered. It purports to tell of the ride
that was fatal to Young and reproduce
on the stage the details of the tragedy.
"The Bookmaker's Sweetheart" is the
effort of another playwright. This is
a tale of the trial, and as a climax
"Nan" Patterson * goes uncomplaining
to the electric chair rather than offer
testimony to the dishonor of her sweet
heart.
Other plays have been offered and
agents attempt almost daily to obtain
interviews with the prisoner.

CAPTAIN OF THE SAX PABLO
GETS DIVORCE FOR CRUELTY
Mrs. Dunnlgan Neglected' Her Chil
dren â Mrs. Guion Says Husband
Wants to Marry Another.
Lawrence A. Dunnigan, captain of
the Santa Fe boat San- Pablo, yester
day-obtained a divorce ' from, his wife,
Louise, on the ground of cruelty. Mrs.
Dunnigan first brought the suit for
separation, charging the captain with
cruelty, but he filed a cross-complaint,
accusing her of mistreating and neg
lecting her children, -* keeping her
home In an unclean condition and in
discreetly receiving men when her
husband was absent on his vessel.
Mrs. Dunnigan did not appear to con
test the cross-complaint. - t .4.. '
Roaie. Guion filed a. cross-complaint
to the suit of L. H. Guion for divorce.
She denied his accusations of Infidel
ity and said he had been cruel to Her.
She declares that he compelled their
children to call him "uncle" so he
would appear to be a younger man
and single. She says, too, that he told
her he loved a girl named Bess, whom
he would " marry when he got a di
vorce. " â¢
Judge Kerrigan divorced Rose Ped
igo from Grason Pedigo.for desartion,
and Ida M. Rogers from Granville. L
Rogers, cruelty; Judge Seawell ' di
vorced Annie J. Jordan from Wll^am
J. Jordan on a cross-complaint for de
sertion, and ' Judge Graham divorced
Ella de'Joia from Matteo de Jola for
Infidelity.
Gustavine C. Bachman began an ac
tion for divorce against Charles F.
Bachman for cruelty.
Max Detringr, who married Clara
Detring in 1888, alleges that she de

Friends of Fanners.
Dr. C. Hart Merrlaxn gave ah inter

United States Biological Survey. Dr.
Merrlam said that many birds and
animals regarded by the farmers as
pests and ruthlessly slaughtered by
them were really destroyers of pests
and should be protected instead of
killed. He enumerated the birds and
small animals that are most helpful
to the farmer and illustrated his talk
with stereoptlcon views.

Uncle Sam's Sailors Vainly Attempt
to Establish Wireless Teles*Â»ph
Station as Commanded.
The United States navy, which
found it an easy task to lay low Cer
vera and Montijo, is meeting defeat in
Its attempt to install wireless tele
graph apparatus on the Farallon
Islands. Four times within the last
few days Uncle Sam's, sailors * have
gone out Into the ocean to establish
the . station, in accordance with or
ders from Washington, and'pn each
occasion' they; 1 returned: : 'wlthout ac
complishing their mission.
The Unadilla was selected for the
work yesterday, and four mrt.-j were
finally landed. It was not "men, but
apparatus, that the Navy Department
most wished to set on the rocky isl
ands, and there was consequently
much disappointment at Mare Island
last evening when it was learned
that the last trip had been practically
fruitless.
The ocean Is so rough and â¢ Jthe
shore is so precipitous that a landing
can hardly be made with safety. The*
Washington authorities, however, do
not want excuses Instead of a wire
less station, so the navy-yard peopla
will persist In their attempts to ful
fill orders. â¢ Another attempt to land
the apparatus will be made to-day.

"CAPRICE" PLEASES
ALCAZAR AUDIENCE
Pfay Deals W tfi Smpfe Lives and the
Presentation Is Smooth and
Buoyant : . Throughout..
POPULAR AND "ACCOMPLISHED ACTRESS WHO WILt, BE SEEN IS "THE
DARLING OF THE GODS." WHICH BEGI.VS AN ENGAGEMENT AT THE
GRAND OPERA-HOUSE CHRISTMAS WEEK.
"Caprice," written for Mrs. Fiske â
then Minnie Maddernâ was revived last
night at the Alcazar. The play had
the honor of being introduced to the
Alcazar by Mrs. Fiske, who starred In
it during the stock and star regime at
the O'Farrell street house. Further,
the play was written for Mrs. Fiske
by Howard P. Taylor. It was curiosity
to learn what was supposed to fit the
Fiske personality of that dateâ 1S87â
that took me to the Alcazar last night.
There is some resemblance in the char
acter of Mercy Baxter, simple, un
learned, country lass, to that of An
gela, etc. Belcfcamber in "A Bit of
Old Chelsea," but the play is a comical
ly far cry from the scKool with which
Mrs. Fiske is now identified. On the
whole it carries its age well. Of the
rural type, the piers do not camp in the
foreground and old man Baxter re
frains from washing his hands at the
pump. The story is probable if im
probably treated, and of the kind called
pretty. It has tha favorite old motive
of the grub turning butterfly, -begun,
perhaps, with "Cinderella," and used
Just yesterday by Mr. Zangwlll in his
"Merely Mary Ann." It is a story
beloved of children and cookdom and
there Is. by the way, a "real gentle
man" in "Caprice" that might have
been haled bodily from Laura Jean.
Here is r.-here the play shows wrinkles.
Jack Henderson, the city gentleman
who has condescended to play the Co
phetua to Mercy Baxter's beggar maid,
Is a delightful cad. He insults his wife
before his friend, whines about his
sufferings when she lisps "plctur," per
mits her to gq out to fasten up the
pigs, orders her to get his pant â hose,
and then grumbles that she is no lady.
Amazingly she accepts his dictum and
goes out into the lone, lone world to
learn to be one. When she has learned
she goes b~.ck to the martyred gentle
man and they live happy ever after
ward. An odd environment for Mrs.
Fiske!
Miss Lillian Lawrence was quite
charming as Mercy, sincere and earn
est, her performance rarely smooth for
stock art. She shows a grateful reserve
and ease in everything she undertakes,
and in notable measure here. Mr. Hll-

THE S AN . , FRANCISCO ,i,CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1904.
Hard, who took John Craig's part by
reason of that actor's indisposition, was
a buoyant Jack Henderson, doing his
mopt agreeable in an unpleasant part.
The most finished work of the evening
was, however, George Osbourne's as the
father of Mercy. Naturally, Mr. Os
bourne was Mercy's father In the FIske
production! But it is an excellent
characterization, human, full-bodied,
and entirely convincing. Harry McAu
liffe is distinctly clever as Wally Hen
derson, and Miss Woodson piquant and
girlish as Edith Henderson. The whole
performance is smooth and buoyant,
and the majority" will enjoy the play.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Miss Blanche Bates will shortly be
seen in David Belasco's wonderful
production of "The Darling of the
Gods" at the Grand Opera-house. The
clever actress who made the first
great successes of her dramatic ca
reer in this city will open an engage
ment of three weeks at the Grand
Opera-house on the evening of Mon
day, December 26, In the titular role
of the great Japanese drama.
The character of the Princess Yo-
San demands an artist who can run
the gamut of human emotions. In
the first act of the play Miss Bates
appears as an Innocent girl who has
spent her life In a Japanese temple
doing honor to the gods. Before the
curtain falls on the last act love has
made her a woman. The trials
through which she passes because of
the great affection she bears her lover
have metamorphosed her from a smil
ing, winsome maiden into a suffering,
heart-torn woman.
From the reports which have pre
ceded her to San Francisco it is fair to
presume that Miss Bates' local ap
pearance will 'be cm event of .singular
importance to the playgoers- of this
city, among whom she already num
bers so many admirers. The seat sale
for the' engagement will begin at 9
o'clock Thursday morning, December
22. :--:: : â  : :^^:<; : : â  '

only with questions affecting persons

W. Calvin Chase, a negro lawyer and

I to resent such treatment. Weller ac
i cepte.l the chairmanship with the stip

] ing the first 'McKinley inauguration,

BILL TO RAISE SALARIES.
Stewart Favors Giving President

WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.â Senator
Stewart to-day introduced a bill to fix
Presidential and Congressional salaries.
It proposes to raise the salary c-f the
President to $100,000 a year; of the
Vice President and Speaker of the

thoroughly convincing. His per
formance last night adds another to
the many triumphs .that he has won
at the Majestic this season. With
the exception of the character of Lady
Sarah Annerly. portrayed by Eleanor
Gordon, the women of the cast are not
called upon to do anything very
strenuous or emotional. Adele
Block's Ida Potter and Elsie Esmond's
Ethel Lincoln are conscientious bits of
work. Howard Gould held the sym
pathies of the audience throughout as
the unfortunate lover, son of Ralph
Errol, the convict. Richard Lambart
made a strikingly grotesque character
of B. Sydney Van Cott of New York,
and with Mr. O'Hara, the Lubblns of
the cast, furnished the amusement, of
the play. George Woodward's Brac
kett, Frank McVicar's Baron Lincoln
and Harry Mestayer's Arthur Lincoln
rounded out a highly successful per
formance.
Columbia.
Again "The Chinese Honeymoon"
holds the boards at the Columbiaâ
this time with a cast almost entirely
new. Joseph E. Miller, in the part
of Lord High Chancellor, appears to
be the only one of the. cast whose
face is familiar. Mr. Kearney in the
part of the errant .bridegroom, Mr.
Broderfck as the Emperor and Miss
Georgia Bryton as the captivating
cockney waitress, are new to San
Francisco In these Darts. This does
not militate In the least against the
presentation of Dance .& Talbot's
clever musical comedy. It goes with
the same snan and the audience is
pleased. yV; -
Tivoli.
"King Dodo" is having a splendid
run at the Tivoli. The opera Is an un
usually fine one and the players do it
justice. The features which last
night's audience appeared to. appre
ciate, most were the amazon march
and Willard Simms' "chicken song."

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
LICK ASTRONOMER FINDS
RILL ON THE MOON.
THOUGH NARROW IT 18 EIGHTY MILES LONG
Professor J. B. Perrine Writes Interestingly of Nebulae
BERKELTSY. Dec. li.-The discovery
cf a. great crack or rill on the face of
the moon which extends length
wise throcgh the valley of the
Alps for a distance of eighty
idle* is cue cf the facts announced In
the latest bulletin issued from the Lick
Observatory. The bulletin contains five
articles by Assistant Astronomer J. B.
Perrine. all deemed of unusual Interest
by scientific men, and by astronomers
In particular.
The ri'l on the moon was discovered
by Mr. Perriue with the 26-lnch tele
scope. The rill is in the nature of a
crack in the moon's cruat. or of a dry
iivÂ«r bed, only a few hundred feet in
v idth and tome eighty m;!es in length,
*xtendi2s through the center of the
valley* It ran lxÂ» seen orJr under good
atmospheric conditions and when the
n:n iÂ« rhinlnc uix>n it at the proper
angle. Through telescopes less than
twelve inches In diameter it would
probably not be visible at any time.
The Lick Observatory is cot now mak
ing a study cf the moon, but this dis
covery was made en a Saturday night
In April last while fhowing- some visit
ors through the observatory.
The first cf Mr. Pcrrinc-'s papers deals
wJtb-the number of nebulae. Previous
to Professor Keeley's work with the
Crossley reflector of the Lick Observa

Treverton, a nine-year-old lad livinj?
In San rrancisr-u at 22S4 Mission street,
came to Berkeley to-day armed to tho

North Berkeley of whom he desired
information as to "where game coulfi

The tiny youth carried a 3S-calib2r
revolver as he faced the housewife at
her front door, and in his hand was
b sack that bulged with tools and im
plemtnts of war. The woman gasped
In amazement at the sight of the min
iature Kit Carrun, and, standing with
arms akimbo, paid:
'"What d<* you expevt to do with
game if you should find it? Why aren't
you at home with your mother this
vwy minute? Tell me that."
Master Roy Treverton told her. H-Â»
was looking for an audience. The
housewife Mfved his purpose.
"I." s<aid tho wee youngster, bran
ciEhinK his big revolver, "live in San
FrancliH-o, but I am going to stay in

And h<tre Master Treverton produced

and he estimated that If it were extend
ed over the whole sky at least 120.000
nebulae would be detected by the
Crossley reflector. Professor Keeler's
programme of photographing 104 of the
principal nebulae and star clusters, un
fortunately incomplete at the time of
his death, was completed last year by
Mr. Perrine. Upon these plates he has
found 7<5 new nebulae. If the same law
of distribution should hold over the en
tire eVr the number of nebulae discov
erable with the Crossley reflector un
der the eame conditions would be ap
proximately half a million. It is prob
able, further, as photographic plates
become more sensitive the long expos
ures with this instrument would show
the number of nebulae within its reach
to be cf the order of a million.
Astronomers hold the view that the
c!ottd!fke masses known as nebulae
contain the material which will eventu
ally condense to form additional stars,
planets, etc. The number of the nebu
lae Is therefore an item of unusual in
terest in the problems of -celestial evo
lutions.
Attention Is called by Astronomer
Perrine, in one of his articles, to the
interesting and perhaps^ignificant fact
that in the principal star clusters vis
ible to observers in the northern hemi
sphere the stars are divided roughly
into two classes of magnitude, one
clsfs from the eleventh to the thir
teenth magnitude and the other of
about the sixteenth magnitude. It is
unknown why the magnitudes from the
thirteenth to the sixteenth are not

flector, for this purpose, in the winter
of 1S00-1SOL It has beÂ«n determined,
both by iir. Perrine and bv astrono
mers abroad, that the Lick photo
graphs Jire capable of determining this
distance with great~*Srcuracj'. Delay
in measuring and reducing these pho
tographs has been due to a lack of
furds to employ assistants for the pur
pose. The number of Lick plates taken
on thfj. occasion is comparable with the
number secured at ail other observato
ries, and a cot?d foreign astronomer,
who is especially interested in this
prob!em, has been led to say that, if
the Lick :>!ate8 could be measured and
reduced, it v.ou!d matter very little
whether or not those taken elsewhere
v.ere studied.
In the last of his article Mr. Perrine
records five observations of the ninth
satellite of Faturn. discovered by Pro
fessor WiilSam H. Pickering, the
brother of the director of Harvard Col
lege Obe<?rvatory, in the year 1S$. The
discovery was made from photographs
obtained at the Harvard station in
Peru. The satellite was WA observed
for several vears following the an
nouncement of its discovery, and not
until the past summer have confirma
tory observations been secured by
other observers.
The Mount Hamilton photographs
were made with the Crossle'y reflector.
This satellite, as announced by Pick
ering, revolves once around the planet
Saturn in eighteen months, and,
strange to s3;\ in a direction opposite
to that of the other satellites. The new
satellite is of the seventeenth photo
graphic magnitude, and lies very near
the limit for visual observations with
the most powerful existing telescopes.
PRESBYTERIANS
HOLD ASSEMBLY
Clerical and Lay Delegates

Convene in the Isle City
ALA11EDA. Dec. 12.â Thi'rty-five
clerical and lay delegates representing
Presbyterian churches in Oakland,
Alameda, Berkeley, Fruitvale, San
Leandro. Haywards and Pleasanton
participated in the deliberations of
the winter session of the Oakland
presbytery, held here to-day in the
First Presbyterian Church. Rev. Ar
thur Hicks of Oakland acted as mod
erator.
After some discussion it was de
cided to delay until the spring meet
ing of the presbytery the vote on the
question of receiving back into the
parent fold th* Cumberland Presby
terian church, which originated as the
result of a schism in the church just
prior to the Civil War. At the meet
ing of the general assembly of Pres
byterians held in Buffalo last May the
sentiment was in favor of readmitting
the Cumberland Presbyterians, but it
was then decided to give the district
presbyteries throughout the United
States an opportunity to vote on the
question. If two-thirds of the presby
teries are for admission it is expected
thru the next general assembly, which
is to convene at Winiona Lake, Ind..
next May, will receive the Cumber
land Presbyterians into the fold. From
the trend of remarks to-day it ap
pears that the present sentiment of
the Oakland presbytery is against
such action.
The following were elected dele
gates to represent the Oakland pres
bytery at the general assembly next
May: Rev. J. E. Anderson, San Le
andro: Rev. Arthur Hicks. Oakland-
J. C. Christ and J. C. Bee. The spring

REV. FATHER KING'S LIFE ENDS
Aged. Clergyman Is a -Victim of Pneumonia
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
101S Broadway, DA:. 12.
The Rev. Father Michael King, pas
tor of the Church of the Immaculate
Conception, died of pneumonia at his
residence, 616 Seventh street, at 10:40
o'clock to-night. The aged clergy
man had been close to death for some
hours, and the physicians gave his
friends no assurance of recovery.
Father King's illness was caused by
a cold contracted last Thursday while
celebrating mass at the church. On
Thursday evening he v.'as attacked by
a severe chill and Dr. Hamlln was at
once summoned, but owing to the en
feebled ; condition of the patient the.
cold rapidly developed into pneumonia.
Sunday night Father King began to
sink rapidly and , for a time it /was
feared that the end had come, but after
a time he rallied and to-day was ap
parently much better.
Toward evening, however, he grew
weaker and gradually faded away. As
a last resort oxygen was given to stim
ulate the failing vitality, but it was
too late.
Father King had been pastor of St.
Mary's parish for more than fifty
years. having come to Oakland
from San Francisco on February 20,
1855, as the successor of the Rev. John
Qulnn, the first pastor of the parish.
On July 3. 1903, Father King celebrated
the golden anniversary of his admis
sion to the priesthood. When the ven
erable priest first came to Alameda
| County Si. Mary's parish was not con
i fined to a portion of Oakland, as it is

RECIPROCITY
IS THEIR AIM
Australian Colonies Send a
Representative to Wash
ington to Discuss .Matter
Among yesterday's- arrivals on the
steamship Ventura from the 'Antipodes
was Auckland's senior member of the
New Zealand Parliament. Hon. J..H.
Witheford, who is. registered at the
Occidental Hotel. He Is on his way to
Washington, where he hopes to interest
the officials of state In a plan for a
reciprocal tariff between this country
and the Australian, colonies, with a
view of strengthening the" relations be
tween the two and stimulating trans
pacific trade.
Witheford has for many years been
prominently Identified, with various
measures in the colonies for promoting
friendly relations between this country
and Australasia. Ten years ago he
visited Washington on a mission with
that, end In view.' At .that time he
sought to have the United States In
crease its subsidy for the mail-carrying
steamers, and although not claiming
the credit /the Government finally In
creased -its- subsidy to $52,000- His i
plans, however, eventually failed of '
their full purpose, for Just as the col- I
or.ies were considering the advisability- [
of increasing their subsidy the United j
States declared the ports of Hawaii j
closed against colonial vessels plying j
between the colonies and this country, |
and the move- created considerable}
prejudice among the people of British
dependencies. In discussing this mat
ter last night Mr. Withefoxd said:
None one could dare question the right of
your Government to enforce the maritime law
nor would we doubt that it wu a Just move
ment, in Â«o far za the United States was con- â 
cerned. At the same time the people of the
colonies felt a bit hurt, for they were pavinr I
subsidies t or â¢ an American service and were
â¢low In keenly appreciating the cause for clos
ing the port of Honolulu against their flat
In other words, the act of the United States
while consistent, was. from the colonial point
of view, anything but* reciprocal. I siniclv
mention this to show that we have had a
prejudice to overcome. At the same time the
people of the colonies were united In the 'idea
that all countries must have an ally, and with
our people the feelin? is strong that if we 'have
to be allied with any nation It should be thl
American. With us It is England first and thÂ«
.United States next. ... * UB
Our plan Is to open the way for. still further
strengthening* the. relations between the cole
nies and your. country. â¢ V am going to Wash

MAY BE CITY'S
DEPOSITORIES
Supervisors Plan to Loan
Temporarily to Banks the
Cash Collected for Taxes
APPEAL TO LEGISLATURE
-Watcfc Companies to Furnish
Statements -Preparatory to
the Fixing of Rates
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
referred to the Finance Committee a ;
resolution reciting the Intention of the
board to memorialize the State Legisla
ture to submit to the people an amend
ment to the constitution permitting
municipalities to authorize the deposit
of public funds in banks and, similar
financial institutions on condition that
a reasonable interest be' paid on cur
rent balances. and adequate security be
given In the form of â  United States
bonds or i bonds â¢ of the â¢ municipalities
whose funds are" so deposited.
Supervisor â¢ D'Ancona said the pur
port of the resolution was to relieve the
stringency of the money market result
ing from the tying up of cash paid Into
the city .treasury for taxes. He said
it would add some. $40,000 to the reve
nue of the city and would help the is
suance, of municipal bonds, as it was
intended to require as securities fo&ths
loans only municipal and United States
bonds. Braunhart thought State ""bonds
or other adequate securities should be
included in the list, and his m*otion\to
refer to *a corn"mittee' prevailed. The
effect of the resolution, k if adopted, will
be to make banks depositories for the
city's funds.
CITY GETS JCDGMKXT.
,The City Attorney reported that the
Superior Court had rendered judgment
in favor of the city and against ex-
Treasurer S. H. Brooks for 52559 SS,
representing fees collected /on collateral
inheritance taxes. Similar actions af
fecting other fees collected by Brooks
are pending in the courts.
As .a preliminary to the annual Inves
tigation for the fixing of water rates
the board adopted a resolution direct
ing all companies supplying water to
furnish statements concerning their
financial operations and a list of Jhe
properties actually used In their- busi
ness. The Board of Public Works was
also directed to submit an appraise
ment of the properties of the Spring
Valley Water Qpmpany, to enable the
Supervisors to establish a basis of val
uation upon which to fix water rates.
Two. ordinances, one prohibiting the
carrying of swiil, offal, or other refuse
matter in the same vehicle with ashes,
unless separate compartments are pro
vided therefor, and the other providing
that refuse from vegetables and other
decayed matter" be deposited in sepa
rate receptacle from ashes, were re*
ferred to the Health Committee.
The Finance Committee formally al
lowed the bills of F. 1L Torke & Co.
for repairs to bituminous streets during
September. The August demands have
been disallowed, and the courts will be
evoked to determine their legality.
The committee cut down the bills of
B. Hays for transportation of voting
machines, aggregating SST2, to $686 15
aftei*hearing expert testimony that the
charges were excessive.
The Chief of Police was cited to ex
plain why requisitions had not been
filed for harness, bills for which were
approved by the Police Department.
Payment of the bills was withheld. â¢
MAXY VOTES NOT COUNTED.
During the discussion over some bills
for the Department of Elections Dep
uty Registrar Zemansky remarked that
In one precinct eighteen ballots that
should have been counted as voted had
been placed with the unused ballots by
negligent election j officers. - Zemansky
said that If the same proportion was
kept up in all the other precincts there
were SOOO votes that, had not been
counted at the last election. This was
construed by the committee as a strong
argument In favor of the voting ma
chines.

NIECES ATTACK
CARROLL WILL
Say Kindness of Sisters of
Mercy Unduly Impressed
: Weak Mind* of Old Uncle
NOVEL POINT IS BAISED
Contention That Member^ of
.Order, Under. Vow, Cannot
' Own Property for Herself
The five. nieces. of the late Patrick
Carroll, to each of whom he left only
$100 in his will. . have filed a contest
against the testament, alleging that
Carroll was unduly influenced by Mary
C. O'Kelly, sister superior of the
Sisters of Mercy in charge - of St.
Mary's Hospital. Practically all . of
an 58000 estate was left to the sister.
The- nieces, who are the daughters
of Carroll's deceased brother, are
Mary and Margaret "Carroll, Johanna
Sullivan, Elizabeth Doran and Bridget
Dawson. They charge that the tes
tator,' who had passed hi3 -eighty
fourth year when the will was made,
was unable to distinguish between the
kindness that is*paid for and that
vhich might have been given him by
disinterested persons.- In this behalf,
they say, that in 1889 he pa^d J3000
to the Sisters of Mercy, whereupon
they agreed to receive him at St.
Mary's Hospital and nurse him for the
remainder of his life. The sister su
perior and the other: attendants were
very kind to him and, in his state of
mind, say the contestants, the klnd
r.ess was unduly impressed upon him.
It is charged that the influence was
willfully exercised arid that the sisters
refused to allow his relatives to see
Carroll or converse with him for some
time before his will was made. Then,
they say, he- was induced to believe
that his relatives did not care for
him. jit-":V
A point of law is. raised in the con
test. It is declared that the sister su
perior is, st|U bound by the vows of
her order ttt& cannot own or hold any
property as her own, but only in trust
for the order. The Sisters of Mercy,
it is contended, are an eleemosynary
society and under the law a man can
hot leave more than one-third of hi3
estate to such # an order. Therefore, it
is said, the will -was -so prepared that
upon its face all the estate was left to
Mary O'Kelly, with' the Intent that,
should she succeed in ' probating the
document, she should hold the prop
erty in trust for the orderi'in violation
of the law. W. H. Barrows is attor
ney for the contestants. ,v : i
CABANISS PAYS XO HEED
TO PROTEST OF HUTTON
Safes Seized From Chinese on Search
Warrant Opened and Coin Therein
Handed to Owner.
Police Judge_Cabaniss, the. Police
Comrnissianejs,7iCh.ieÂ«;Â«"WittmanT and
others gathered in the property clerk's
office yesterday afternoon when the
three safes taken. from 820 "Washlngr
ton street on a search. warrant at the
time of the raid j by Commissioner
Hutton were to be opened. Judge Ca
baniss having decided that they
should be returned to Chin Kim You,
the owner. â¢-'.":.
Hutton was the last one to arrive
and he said that bo far as he was con
cerned he was satisfied the proceeding
was illegal and void and that he
would not be a party to anything that
was done. He thought the court had
no jurisdiction to make such ah order.
A proper proceeding In a proper
court should be brought. After ex
pressing his opinion he walked out.
He was followed by the other Com
missioners and the Chief and after a
consultation they returned without
Hutton.-
Commissioner Howell entered a for
mal protest against the safes being
opened or taken put of the custody of
the police', and Commissioner Drink
house said they would not be held re
sponsible If the money in the . safes
were handed to the wrong man.
The Judge said 'the Commissioners
were simply present, out of courtesy
and no responsibility would attach to
them. He then ordered the safes
opened. The money was handed to
Chin Kim You and the papers r .to the
Commissioners to.be used in their in
vestigation, as agreed to by Attorney
Collins.

Government likely to Win.
United States Circuit Judge Hunt,
sitting for Judge Morrow, decided
yesterday that uncontested adverse
possession by the Government of the
marsh lands at and contiguous to
Mare Island, if proved, would be a
valid defense in the 1 suit brought by
E. H. Sawyer vs. Bowman H. McCal
la. The case will therefore go to trial
on this point. The defendant in his
answer sets up that the Government
has been in continuous peaceable pos
session of the property for more than
five years immediately preceding the
filing of the suit in ejectment.

TUESDAY DECEMBER 13, 1904
PROPOSED GAME LAW.
THE president of the Fish and -Game Protective Association
has answered some of the criticisms of the proposed game law
that have been made, and some that have not been made. There
is no room for disagreement on the desirability of preservings the
game, that, if protected, will always find food and cover upon lands
that can be put to no other use than sheltering the wild. It is not
necessary to support this policy by statistics showing tlje profit of
hunting the preserved game that goes to the gun and ammunition
makers. What concerns the people is the use to which the preserved
game is to be put.
By denying the right to sell game and still permitting it to be
killed it is obvious that all the legal machinery of the State is invoked
to preserve game for the benefit of very few people. It is probable
that there are not more than a thousand sportsmen in the State. If
each divide his bag or catch with one friend, that means that about
two thousand people may enjoy game out of a population of i,8oo,ooo.
It is this feature that makes the proposition unpopular. It .is not
condemned for any other reason. The popular decision is that game
if preserved is preserved for all. If its slaughter is prohibited it is
prohibited for all. Equality, no more, no less, is what the people will
insist upon. It is nothing to them that any number of States deny
market to game. The people of California are willing to prohibit
both the sale and the slaughter of game for a ternf^of years. But
they will not consent to a preserve law which gives the right to kill
to a few to the exclusion of the many. â¢
The president of the association whose defense of exclusiveness
we have published refers to the present law limiting the number of
deer that may be taken! Now it is notorious that deer have never
been so scarce as they are under this law. Under its provisions hun
dreds of deer have been taken and the venison permitted to spoil.
Two of the finest bucks ever taken on the coast hung in the California
market last year, forbidden sale, until the carcasses became revolting
and had to i>e removed, unfit for food. The deer law has increased
the slaughter and made it useless. Therefore, let us have not only
prohibition of the sale but also 1 of the slaughter of game for a term
of years.
The president of the Protective Association quotes the decisions
of our courts, which place ownership of the wild in the whole
people. The people acting through their representatives can deny
the right of any to kill game and the right of all to sell it or to buy it.
That is the correct p'rinciple. The law runs to equality of ownership
and equality of right in the whole people. Denial of equality is
always offensive. For more than a year there has been a feud in the
Adirondack's against Mr. Rockefeller, who has a game preserve there
of tens of thousands of acres. That Mr. Rockefeller has the legal
right to punish trespass and poaching on his land there is no doubt.
No one disputes his title to his forest estate or his ownership and
control of it. But the' "natives." as they are called in the dispatches,
the people of the mountains, are in revolt against his right to monop
olize the wild game that runs through the forest. The law is on his
side, but there are things lawful that are not things expedient.
In the British Isles the policy of game preserves is very old, but
has never become popular because it argues exclusiveness, to which
the people object. There is no reason for believing that a law of the
State of California preserving the game for the exclusive use of
sportsmen will be any more popular. There is a widespread opinion,
expressed by the country press, that it will be better to deny both
the marketing and the slaughter of game for a term of years, to the
end that it may recuperate. Surely such a law would be entirely
effective. The game would multiply and at the end of the closed
term stringent laws to limit the bag would serve to^keep it increasing
for a long term of years.
We have great facilities for game. Our extensive mountain
ranges furnish food and cover for it of the best kind. In a closed
season of five years we could restore the elk here as well as greatly
increase the smaller members of the deer family. The hunters would
find outdoor recreation in pursuing the predatory animals. The wild
cat, lvnx and mountain lion prey upon deer and birds. They hold a
close second to man in exterminating game. They surely offer more
sport, excitement and danger in, the pursuit than the edible game,
and our hunters could materially assist the increase of game by
warring upon them.
TO EXPEDITE CHINESE INSPECTION.
IN his first annual report, submitted to the President, Secretary
Metcalf incorporates recommenSations affecting the existing sys
tem for the inspection and registration of Chinese immigrants.
Acting upon the recent suggestion of John Goodnow, American Con
sul at Shanghai, the Secretary has advised that treaty arrangements
with China be perfected which will permit of the location at various
Chinese pc*ts of departure of department officers who shall perform
the major part of the duties of inspection now incumbent upon the
officials at the port of landing.
When Consul Goodnow first offered this amendment to the ex
isting order of things to Commissioner of Immigration F. P. Sargent
he urged the expediency of the change uponthe grounds of economy
of labar and of securing more fairness' for Chinese seeking entry
into this country. According to the Consul's view, the examination
of prospective voyagers to America who claim to be of the exempt
class can be carried on in the ports of departure more expeditiously
than in the port of arrival and with far more certainty of the detec
tion of fraud. Not only that, but bona-fide exempts, against whom
the shadow of suspicion might easily be cast here in this country,
could with the more certainty prove their case before an examining
board in their own country and the chances of injustice being done
them would be thereby minimized.
Upon the score of economy, if on no other, Secretary Metcalf's
recommendation should commend itself to favorable- legislation.
Under the. existing regime the Chinqee Bureau here in San Fran
cisco alone is kept at high pressure with work and suspected cases
occupy the major part of Court Commissioner Heacock's calendar.
If the matter of identification of the individual with that one de
scribed in the franked certificate of the special examiner in China
was the sole thing to occupy the attention of the local immigration
inspectors the work of passing upon returning Chinese would be cut
bv a half. . * i
THE PRESS OF THE NATION.
The fact that revival of business is on a conservative basis Is cause for
congratulation, as it assures continued improvement. In the months since
the checking of the "boom" the values of business enterprises have been re
adjusted; prices have receded to the point where demand meets them; a better
proportion has been established between cost, profit and a price that will
effect sales. A readjustment of scales that will enable the consumer to carry
out his plans, give the manufacturer a fair but not exorbitant profit and
furnish the workman steady employment at living wages is a feature of. the*
business revival so far as it has gone, and will no doubt characterize the
movement as It spreads though the various ramifications of Industrial and
commercial enterprise. â Cleveland Plain Dealer.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1904.
ADAM AND EVE
BY OTHO B. SENGA.
fs DAMâ Adam Peyton Randolph lay
l\ stretched at full length under a
JT\ dwarf pine tree. He was big and
/ blonde, and good to look at. He
sang "Oh, Maryland, My Mary
land," in a heavy bass which was not
at all musical, and then laughed at his
own failure. '
"I reckon I wasn't around when
singing voices were being distributed,"
he said alound,, "but this certainly is
Paradiseâ an Eveless Paradise! And
that's what makes it Paradise â how a
woman would spoil all this! I hope
the new owner of Sunny Slope doesn't
intend to live there."
He turned over lazily, and lay on his
chest, supporting his chin in his hand,
and gazing off toward the blue Chesa
peake from which the breezes brought
the bracing saltiness of the inland sea.
His Eve was coming, but" of this he
was blissfully unaware. She sauntered
up the avenue of pines, looking de
lightedly about her.
"A perfect Paradise!" she mur
mured. "I wonder if my land ends
with my driveway, or does it extend
to that one over there."
She pushed her way between the rose
bushes and entered the debated terri
tory, wandering aimlessly along, sing
ing softly and caressing' the rose she
had plu,cked in passing.
At an unexpected turn she almost
stumbled over the long sprawling legs
of Adam Peyton Randolph.
"Oh, pardon me!" she gasped In con
fusion, "I did not know " and then
summoning the courage of possible
possession, she demanded, "Doesn't
this strip of land belong to Sunny
Slope?"
"No, madam," replied the recumbent
one, gravely, "it belongs to Peyton's
Paradise." . Â«
She laughed g&yly, and looked about
her. "So this really is Paradise, is it?
And where are Adam and Eve?"
"There is no Eve. madam; Adam is
the owner of the place â Adam Peyton
Randolph."
"Oh, ves, I knowâ he is the horrid,
cantankerous old thing who was so
determined I should not buy Sunny
Slope. My agent told me how this old
miser kept bidding and bidding until
I had to pay twice what the place is
worth." *
The "old miser" sat up with sudden
interest.
"Oh, then you are Miss Endicott? I
am so glad. I feared it was a North
erner who had bought the dear ola
place."
"What possible difference could that
make?" curiously.
"Oh, a great deal," vaguely, "I do
not want them here."
"May I ask," with sudden hauteur,
"why I should interest you?"
"Because â well." rising and holding
out a big hand cordially, "because.
Miss Endicott, I am the "horrid, can
tankerous old thing,' Adam Peyton
Randolph, at your service; and I con
fess to a decided preference for South
ern women. I hope we shall be
friends."
She put her slender hand in his de
murely. "I am very sorry," with pre
tense of contrition, "but you see, I
couldn't help being born in Massachu
setts."
"A thousand pardons. Miss Endicott,
I beg. Your name should have *varnect
me, but you look so like a Southern
woman!"
"I consider that a compliment," smil
ing.
"You mav well â the Southern women
are the most beautiful under the sun;
and I repeat that you look a true
Southerner."
The gravity of his manner saved the
remark from the slightest flavor of im
pertience, and the girl smiled brightly.
"And I am forgiven for being a
Northerner, and for buying Sunny
Slope?"
He smiled In friendly fashion, but
his tone was very serious as he re
plied, "I am sorry I made it hard for
you, but you see, I really wanted the
place. It once belonged to my father.
I was born there. Under pressure of
circumstances, he sold that, as my
mother preferred to keep Peyton's
Paradise, where she was born. My
mother was a Peyton, he added
proudly.
The girl seemed troubled, and It was
several seconds before she spoke.
"I can't help being glad that I suc
ceeded in buying the place, but I am
sorry you failed. I realize that it must
be very dear to you."
"You had more money than I, or you
couldn't have,, bought it," he said, try-
Ing to speak lightly, "however, I thank
you for vour considerate thought. Let
us be friends, anyway, and perhaps
you will let me come often to my birth
place."
"You shall play it is yours," cor
dially, "as the children doâ they are so
Danger in Smoking.
*It is estimated that about 20 per cent
of the young men who recently applied
to enter the naval academy have failed
in the physical test, and the failures
were largely due to the use of tobacco,
resulting in the irregular beating of the
heart. Nowadays, says the Baltimore
Herald, physicians speak of "the to
bacco heart," a trouble caused by the
excessive use of the weed. When the
smoker develops into a "cigarette flctid"
the services of. a physician are neces
sary, but before this point is reached
the heart may be permanently Injured.

happy 'making believe," you know.
And will you let me come Into your

"There is a path leading from your
garden into mine. Come, let me show
it to you. There, this little gate at my
end of the path shall be securely, fast
ened back/ so," fastening it *as he
spoke, "and now, whenever you
choose," with a sudden, strange ten
derness' In. his tone, "you shall enter
into. Paradise."
Three months later Adam stood at
the gate of Paradise, bitterly despond
ent and unavaillngly regretful.
There had been a sudden growth of
friendship during the long bright sum
mer, and a leap into love. Then had
come ; the tempter in the guise of a
rich and suavely spoken Senator from
the North; and Adam's heart had been
sore beset with Jealous rage. Hot with
Southern anger, he had accused the
grirl of trifling with himâ of making
him the sport of her summer pastime
when she had not heart to give him.
She had stood straight and tall ana
white, looking, in her clinging white
gown, like his boyhood's idea of a
ghost.
Then she spoke, and her voice was
"Oh, pardon me!" she gasped j
In confusion. j
cold, and touched Adam's heated im
agination like sharpened icicles.
"1 should certainly never give any
man something for which he had not
asked." and turning, she had disap
peared down the path leading away
from Paradise.
Manlike, it was hours before Adam
realized the true meaning of her words*
Then he had hastened to Sunny Slope.
"Miss Eve done gone," the old
mammy had said, 'her'n' Massa Pratt
done gone together. No, Miss Eve neb
ber said as when.she'd come back."
He had wandered through the beau
tiful grounds of Paradise, visiting the
"Rosary" where he had fostered and
trained the most glorious beauties that
Eve might have her choice each day
of the glad, sweet summer, realizing
with a sharp pang that the whole place
seemed to share in the loneliness that
possessed his heart. Without Eve,
Paradise itself were desolation.
Now, in the soft twilight, he stood
at the garden gate, looking toward the
dim, old mansion half hidden in the
pines, at Sunny Slope.
He caught a glimpse of a light in
her window â mammy was likely put
ting the room to rights.
"Oh. Eve," he cried, stretching out
his arms toward the faintly gleaming
light. "Eve, darling, how could I be
so blind, and so unjust, when I love
you so â I love you so!"
A quick, light step sounded on the
garden path, and a slender, white-claa
figure rushed wildly toward him.
"Adam, oh, Adam!" she panted. "I
tried to go away, but I couldn't. Am 1
too late, Adam? Is the gate closed to
Paradise?"
And he held her in his strong arms,
whispering tenderlv. "It could never
be too late. Eve. We will go together
into Paradise."

IN UNITED STATES
LESS THAN 10,000
MILLIONAIRES.
There Is a great misapprehension as
to the number of millionaires In New
York and in the world. Chauncey M.
Depew said recenlty that there were
100,000 millionaires In the United
States. According to a great commer
cial agency, which Is probably nearer
right, there are only 700Q. The Fi
nancial Red Book, a most carefuly
compiled publication, gives the names
of practically all the person's in; the
United States who are-suppose'd to be
worth more than $300,000. Anâ¬ there
are only 15,000 names on the list. No
claim Is made that \he name of, every
person worth that amount or more is
given, but the proportion of those left
out is extremely small, for a most ex
haustive investigation has been made.
In the last few years there has been a
marked tendency among man of wealth
to conceal the amount of their world
ly possessions. The first incentive in
this respect is the vulgar prominence
given to the man that has lots of money,
There are other reasons men have for
suppressing knowledge of the amount
of their wealth. Some wish to avoid
heavy taxation and give false returns.
Another man may have made hi3
money in a business not commonly
supposed to be especially lucrative
and he doesn't care to have his af
fluence blazoned forth to arouss
competition.

The engagement of Miss Leontine
Blakeman and Lieutenant Robert
Franklin McMillan, U. S. A., is a mat
ter for widespread congratulation, the
prominence and position of both young
people commanding a large number of
friends. The shafts of the little god, al
ways interesting, .do not always pro
duce emotions of genuine pleasure In
the generality of interested onlookers.
This engagement, however, is an excep
tion to the rule, for society is delighted.

a maid of education and travel. She

DEPUTY COROXER ENTERS
CASES IX WRONG BOOK
Carious Error Gives Rise to Belief
That Two Bodies Had Disap
; V r v peared From Morgue.
Considerable agitation waa dis
played by two local firms of under
takers yesterday morning over the
mysterious disappearance of two
corpses which had been taken to the j
Morgue. They were the bodies of j
William Howe, who died in the City 1
and County Hospital last Sunday
evening, and D. Hurley of 418 Powell
street, who was accidentally suffocat
ed by illuminating gas. The under
takers telephoned to the Coroner's of
fice â  yesterday morning asking when '
the bodies would be delivered to them. '
The deputy on duty consulted the rec
ords and was unable to find any state
ment of either case and notified the
undertakers that the bodies had not
been brought to the Morgue. The
bodies on the- slabs were later checked
up, with the result that those of Hur
ley and Howe were found.
Further investigation disclosed that j
the deputy who brought the two cases I
to the Morgue had in a moment of
absent-mindedness entered ' them in
the November record.
THE SAN: FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. DECEMBER 13, 1904.
PLACE WITNESS
IN BAD LIGHT
Proponents in Dolbeer Case
Attack the Credibility of
Mrs. Phillips' Testimony
TELL OF HER DEMANDS
Jury Hears of Her Threats
to Aid Contestant if a
Large Sum Was Not Paid
The proponents in the Dolbeer will
case yesterday bent all their energies
to an attack on the testimony of Mrs.
Elizabeth C. Phillips. She is the bene
ficiary under the testament who Joined
forces with the contestant and testified
that Bertha Dolbeer was of unsound
mind at the time the instrument was
executed. George D. Gray, one of the
executors, and W. F. Williamson, his
attorney, were called to corroborate the
statements of William G. Mugan, the
other executor, that Mrs. Phillips had
persistently demanded a bonus of $15,
000 to be added to her bequest of $10,000,
and threatened in seeking to enforce
that demand to go on the stand and
give testimony that she said would
break the will.-
Mrs. PhilliDs wis the strongest wit
ness brought forward by Contestant
Schander, for she was the only person
who testified that Miss Dolbeer was
unquestionably insane. Mrs. J. L.
Moody's testimony tended to raise a
question as to the mental condition of
the testatrix, but she did not meet the
issue squarely by a declaration that
Miss Dolbeer was deranged. The testU
mony of Mrs. Phillips was very largely
the basis of the contest, and the en
deavor was therefore vigorous to con
vince the jurors that her statements
and opinion were unworthy of the cre
dence that should- influence them.
The cross-examination of William G.
Mugan took the greater part of the
morning session, and he reiterated his
testimony as to Interviews in which
Mrs. Phillips told him that she must
have $15,000 in addition to her bequest
or she would give aid to the contestant.
The witness was followed by Attorney
Williamson, who related the conversa
tions held with Mrs. Phillips at two in
terviews, one on August 8 and the oth
er on August 19. His testimony/ was to
the same effect as that of Mugan.
Executor Gray said that when Mrs.
Phillips called on him he suggested that
she had been cared for in the will, but
her reply was that a bequest of $10,000
was inadequate.
MAKES VIGOROUS DEMAND.
"I want 525,000 â as much as Mrs.
Warren received," Mrs. Phillips had
said, according to the witness. "It's
money I'm after, and I'm going to get
it out of Miss Warren," was one of the
picturesque statements ascribed to her.
Mrs. Phillips appeared very much
angered because Mrs". Warren,., mother
of Miss Warren, should have been be
queathed $25,000â515,000 more than had
been left to herself. If the money waa
not forthcoming, she had threatened
the witness, she would "tell what she
knew and help out the contestant."
Mrs. Phillips also told him that the at
torneys who were about to file the con
test were trying at that time to have
an interview with her.
Gray answered Mrs. Phillips, he ex
plained, that he could do nothing in re
gard to her demand further than to
present It to Miss Warren for consider
ation if the opportunity should present
itself.
Mugan was recalled to produce a
number of letters received from Miss
Dolbeer after she left San Francisco.
In one of them, written in Paris, she
tells of being ilL Miss JollifTe. Rudolph
Spreckels, Miss Josselyn, ' James D.
Phelan and others have testified that
they saw Miss Dolbeer on dates subse
quent to the writing of the letter and
that she was then in good health, which
she must have regained. The following
was the letter:
WRITES OF ILLNESS.
My Dear Mr. Mugan: By the time this
reaches you you will be married. I cabled
you the other day my congratulations and now
that I am writing- I cannot express as I would
like to all the good wishes I send you for your
future happiness. I am so sorry that I am not
there to send you both a wedding present, but
as I would like to pick It out myself I am
afraid it will have to wait until I return,
which may be vÂ«ry soon.
I think Mies Warren wrote you that I had
been ill. I was feeling- very well in London,
although not quite myself, but since I have
Rrrived here I have been very Ul and some
times think home would be the best place for
me. 'I am tryln<- to have a little patience and
see what this doctor can do for me first. I
did* not intend to write you this, but thought*
you ought to know If we started for home, as
you suzcested Wlm (William Carson) coming
over. Just at present I don't think he ought
to start, but you will hear from us again soon.
With much happiness to you both, always
very sincerely. . BERTHA M. DOL.BBER.
]>. 8 Please don't mention to a soul what
I have written about myself.
The transcript of testimony of Adolph
Schander taken at a preliminary hear
ing in the suit was read to the Jury,
showing that the contestant admitted
having never been across the threshold
of the Dolbeer home since Mrs. Dol
beer, his sister, committed suicide in
1879.
The deposition of Miss Ethel Postley,
taken in NÂ«w York, \raa read, in which
she described a visit with Miss Dolbeer
at the Waldorf- Astoria before the lat
ter sailed for Europe. In the opinion of
the deponent the testatrix was at that
time perfectly rational and sane.
The trial will be resumed this morn
ing.
Ago Improve^ Canned Fish.
R. D. Hume & Co. yesterday sued
the Morton Draying and Warehouse
Company for $485 damages and an in
junction preventing the removal of
663 cases of canned salmon from the
warehouse and restraining -the de
fendant from libeling the quality of
the fish. The plaintiffs contend that
canned salmon improves with age. In
October, 1901, they placed 2819 cases
of forty-eight dozen each of salmon
In the warehouse. They were to be
held until ordered delivered. Of the
â¢lot 192 cases leaked and. became
classed as "do-overs.", These were set
aside to be sold at reduced prices and
'when sold the' defendants mixed
eighty-nine good cases with them. The
plaintiffs demanded settlement for the
difference and it waa not paid. â¢ Now,
It is contended, the defendants say
663 cases remaining are not of good
quality and their removal from the
warehouse is threatened.

MIBB LOUISE SMALLEY. A .TAL
ENTED PIANISTE, WHO GAVD
i. INITIAL CONCERT LAST NIGHT.
Louise Smalley
, Shows Much
Talent. .
Miss Louise Smalley gave her intro
ductory piano recital at Lyric Hall last
night. Her effortB in handling difficult
numbers met with rounds of applause
from an audience that j crowded the
house and she was the recipient of
many handsome floral tokens.
Miss Smalley shows an excellently
developed talent. Her touch la artis
tic, her technique brilliant and her in
terpretation shows an individual char
acter. These qualities were shown par
ticularly in her Interpretation of the
Beethoven sonata in G for piano and
violin, In which Harry Samuels, the
well known violinist, played his part
masterfully. A nocturne by Field was
given with much delicacy; "Poeme de
Mai," by Moszkowski, with marked
virtuosity, and a nocturne and bolero
by Chopin with full understanding of
the! characteristics of this master.
The climax' came with, the rendering
of the, "Hungarian Fantasle," by Lizst,
the orchestra part being arranged by
Professor Genss for a second piano. In
it unusual strength and endurance
wero shown and the young pianist also
found ample opportunity to display her
delicacy of touch. Â»
Harry Samuels added to the pro
gramme a superb rendering of the
"Faust Fantasie," by Wieniawski.
Comstock Companies Dissolve.
An official passing of Comstock
names that were used to conjure with
in the making and breaking of for
tunes a quarter of a century ago was
started yesterday with the filing In
the County Clerk's office of five
petitions for the dissolution of
corporations. Seven more will proba
bly follow to-day, the companies af
fected being those that were recent
ly reincorporated with the name
"Brunswick" added to the old titles.
The relncorporatlons were in further
ance of the plans to work the Bruns
wick lode in Nevada. The concerns
that gave up their corporate ghost
yesterday were the Potosl, organized
in 1879; the Exchequer, 1865; the
Sierra Nevada, 1860; the Union Con
solidated, 1872. and the Bullion, 1874.
When the members of the police
force accompany the Liberty bell on

Mothers of Helpers of the
Holy Souls Pay a Visit
to Presbyterian House
TO WORK \ WITH CHINESE
Inquiries Are Still Coming
From East Relative to
Big 'Church Convention
The Rev. Mother Guardian Angel
and the Rev. Mother St Bernard, of
the Helpers of the Holy Souls, St.
Louis, paid a visit yesterday to Pres
byterian House, 920 Sacramento
street, escorted by the Rev. Father
Henry I. Stark, C. S. P., of St. Mary's
(Paullst) Church.
Miss Wheeler, superintendent of the
Presbyterian Mission Home, received
the visitors, who, Father Star ex
plained, desired to inquire into the
methods of the Institution.
' Father Stark said that it is the
intention of the mothers to occupy a
convent, as soon as erected, on Stock
ton street, near Washington, where
missionary work among the Chinese
will be conducted.
During the visit of the mothers and
Father Stark the Rev. J. W. Laugh
lin, president of' the Presbyterian
Ministers' Association, and perhaps
one of the most noted missionaries
who have visited China, unconscious
of the visit, was giving his brethren
of the ministry an account of
energetic missionary labors of-- Pres
byterians In China.
An interesting address was delivered
before the Congregational Ministers'
Club yesterday by the- Rev. E. O.
Tade of Berkeley, in which he set
forth Dr. Marcus Whitman's services
to the United States in saving the
"Oregon country" to the republic.
The speaker recounted the trip
made by Dr. Whitman across the
mountains in the midst of a severe
winter. This act brought to the at
tention of President Tyler and his
Cabinet the value and importance of
that region of the Northwest Terri
tory, which resulted finally in making
it a part of the United States Instead
of trading it off to Great Britain for
a mere sonsr. â¢
The energy with which the Chris
tian Church Ministers' Association Is
working on the preliminary arrange
ments for its national convention was
again evidenced yesterday at a large
meeting of the generffl committee. The
Rev. P. C. Macfarlane presided. Let
ters are still being received from ' all
parts of the East relative to accom
modation and other matters pertain
ing to the occasion.
Though the 40,000 which attended
the convention in' St. Louis will not
be duplicated here, yet from the
communications and promises so far
it is confidently expected by the com
mittee that something like 10,000 will
visit San Francisco.
At the Methodist Ministers' Associa
tion, held at Epworth Hall yesterday,
the Rev. F. A. Keast read a paper on
the growth of Methodism in the city
during the last eleven years.

FIVE FAVORITES MOWED DOWN BY OUTSIDERS AT OAKLAND
BRITT GETS A TIP
FROM A FAN.
KNOWING FRIEND TELLS 'Â¥.
HOW TO STOP "BATTLER"
Rival Fighters Are Training Faithfully
Mr. Britt is beginning to suffer now
from an overabundance of advice. No
matter how good a pugilist is or how
much he knows there is always a
bunch of wise gentlemen willing and
rea-dy to volunteer suggestions. They
vary from dieting to delivering new
fangled punches, but the victim Is
forced to listen to them Just 1 the same,
for It does not do to become a bit
peevish or angry when one of the "ad
vice kids" is in action.
Before James started to do his reg
ular stunt yesterday afternoon he was
approached by a gentleman who ex
tended his mitt and told Jimmy how
Clad he was to see him again. The
newcomer Quickly settled down to
work and in a few seconds ,he was
springing a new one on the native son.
"Say, Jimmy," quoth he, "I got a
hunch and if you kind o' follow it out
you can get this feller Nelson. It's
this. When he begins to get sassy and
roughs it in the clinches, you just grab
him and when he ain't ready turn him
round and round like a top. Pretty
Â»oon he'll begin to get dizzy. Then
you let him . down quick and when he
is thinking about grabbing a rope or
something to steady himself, bring the
right over to the Jaw, and then it's
curtains."
That was a hot one right off the
bat and James was winded for a mo
ment. When he cot into condition he
found breath enough to remark, "Sup
pose I get dizzy when I am doing the
whirly-gig act with Mr. Nelson, what
then?"
"Oh, you can get used to it," said
the adviser. "You can practice this
stunt every day, and if you don't get
enough around the gym, why Just get
a rowboat and ride around on the
breakers for a while. You'll soon get
so that you can stand the gaff fine and

Stable Mate. Tim Payne,
See His Heels at Finish
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12.â Sais, Blute's
good three-year-old, made his first ap
pearance to-day in the fourth race and,
coupled with Tim Payne in the betting,
was made a strong favorite. He won
handily from his stable mate, with
Judge Denton third. Aside from this
race there was not much feature to the
card. The day. was rather disagreeable,
owing to a strong wind that " blew
clouds of dust down the stretch.
Patsy Brown won the first by half a
dozen lengths from PrJncemont, with
Dusky Secret third. El Verracco, the
favorite, was not prominent In the run
ning.
Tyrolean croved the best in the sec
ond, beating Light of Day and Cotillon
in a drive.
Chub, the favorite in the third, won
easily from Jingler and Diamante.
Heather Honey was' heavily played to
win, but failed to get in the money.
Dan Collins was made an odds-on fa
vorite for the fifth, but Dollie Weithoff
upset calculations and won at 10 to 1,
the favorite second and Golden Light
third.
Canejo took the last from Phyz and
Anirad. the favorite. In â¬he order

Whether Mr. Britt will follow the
gentleman's suggestion or not remains
to be seen. However, he did not take
any rowboat . rides, yesterday. He
compromised with two into
the surf and a lot of lively work. in the
gymnasium. It was hardly an ideal
day for beach strollers, but neverthe
less Jimmy had quite a crowd of
lookers-on gathered round -,him when
he began to do his work. .â 
It was the same old programme â
four lively rounds with Frank Rafael,
one wrestling period with "Tiv" Krel
lng, a long session with the punching
bag and an extended bout with the
medicine ball. Britt rushed matters
at a becoming gait and earned the
approval of Master of â  Ceremonies
"Spider" Kelly, who was on the side
lines to offer a few suggestions which
Eritt will be apt to follow when he
faces Battling Nelson.
T^he rain and the heavy condition of
the roads did not hinder Battling Nel
son taking a spin to San Rafael
and return, a distance of fourteen
miles, yesterday morning. The great
Dane left his quarters at Larkspur
clothed in a large oilskin coat and
heavy hunting boots and returned as
cheerful as though attired in a tennis
suit. Bat says he don't mind the rain
and slush, as it^ reminds him of home.
.In the afternoon a strenuous hour
was spent in the gymnasium. Bat
punched the bag, tossed the medicine
ball, skipped rope and pulled the
weights. A couple of rounds each
with Eddie Santry and "Stockings"
Kelly constituted the day's work.
After a brisk rubdown Bat weighed
about 133 pounds. Nelson says he
feels as strong as a bull and intends
to give a good account of himself
when the gong sounds.

PELHAM SCORES ANOTHER VICTORY,
DEFEATING POORLY RIDDEN GATEWAY
Komombo With Knapp
Up Gives Form Play.- 1
. ers Shaking JLJp. '
BY FRED E. MULHOIiLAXD.
No doubt exists, but that Pelham is
a mighty useful two-year-old, but the
Henshall colt was fortunate indeed
to win the last event at Oakland yes
terday. Had Travers, who rode
Gateway, infused the same amount of
vim and animation into his work' that
he did on Dusty Miller in another race
Pelham would have be,en second. It
begins to look, though, as if Gateway
and Bronze Wing were destined never
to win a purse. Pelham can do better
over a fast track at that, still he pos
,sfts"ses considerable class, and even
though the course was muddy he went
to the post favorite over Gateway. .
It was the first seven and a half fur
long number of the season, and Kunz
soon showed in front with the favor
ite. Doctor Leggo, a measurably well
bicked outsider, ran up on Pelham a
furlong from the stand, but .failed
when put to the Government ' test.
Then making a ridiculously late move,
Travers arrived with Gateway. in time
to be beaten by a neck, the favorite
s\Cerving to the inner rail when
brought to a drive. The show went to
Dpctor Leggo.
All but one public choice went by
the board. None of the different win
ners were "eagle birds" for the books,
however, for each received more or less
support. Despite the ./threatening
weather the attendance was large. Sol
Lichtenstein and Cardinal Sarto were
the longest priced winners.
Although in her previous races at
Oakland Komombo had shown nothing
to warrant an investment of 30 cent3
on her chances, there was sharp action
about her in the betting on the Intro
ductory sprint. From 12 the price re
ceded to 5, and with "Big Bill" Knapp
in th* 1 saddle the filly won all the way.
I^Jrank Reed on the 20 to 1 shot Instru
ment put up quits an argument at the
finish, losing by half a length only.
The Lieutenant, installed favorite,
was never much of a hand in muddy
going, but managed to beat Harka out
of third place.
Walter Jenninqp furnished the favor
ite for the two-year-old scramble in the
smart looking Amy J. She was served
out at od*s of 8 to 5, and, after breez
ing out in front for a few panels, fin
ished among the also rans. Larsen
rode an excellently judged race on Car
dinal Sarto, an 8 to 1 shot, and in a
mild drive came home more 4han a
length before Head Dance. , Lady Good
rich, at 40 to 1, ran-thlrdv ,,
On his preceding race Sol Lichten
stein looked a sweetly scented 8 to 5
chance, but because T. Clark had the
mount 7 and 8 to 1 in profusion could
be obtained about the black sprinter.
Clark rode a race that could not have
been surpassed by any of the fashion
able riders,' gradually overtaking and
beating Pickaway half a length. Davis
did not distinguish himself by his ef
fort on the favorite, Matt Hogan,
which finished a close third. '
The mile and fifty fifty yard selling
number was responsible for the
prettiest finish of the afternoon,
Elliott, San Nicholas, Vesuvian arid
Little Wally crossing the line , a
half length and neckj apart. WhHe
not partial to the mud,' San Nich
olas was fn so light and the foot
ing seemed so good that the books set
him up favorite. He ran remarkably
well at that, for It was only at the
paddock that Willie Daly got up with
Elliott and in a whipping finish won by
half a length. Davis got down In the
poorest going with old Vesuvian, and
then only lost the place by a'neck. Lit
tle Wally was bothered by the two
leaders the last part, or he might have
won. â¢ V
Follow Me, the favorite for the mile
and a sixteenth selling affair, never had
a chance. He drew the inside position
and Knapp found himself beaten' to
the club house turn . by Travers on
Dusty Miller. This compelled him , to
stay .In the heaviest going, and his
mount was beaten when the stretch
turn was reached. Major Tenny, back
ed from 4 to 2%, ran over Dusty Miller
the last eighth, splashing in first by a
couple of lengths. Michaels, on Scher
zo, came from the clouds, taking the
Bhow. T'':~?Â« ' ' ' '

such 'a sharp reversal that the Judges
at Oakland decided to apply the X-ray.

ANGELS MORE ADEPT
AT MAKING ERRORS
Eleven Misplays Help Tigers
Baum Fans Ten, but Five Runs Come In
X.OS ANGELES, Dec 12.â To-day's
game appeared to be a contest to show
the largest total In the error column.
Tacoma was in fairly good form In this
respect, but^ the locals finished fast and
outclassed the* visitors In the number^
and variety of misplays. -The totals
were 11 to 6 In favor of .the Angels as
regards errors, and 5 to 4 against t^m
In the run column. ' The game was a
farce. Heavy wind and blinding dust
were much to blame, but there was a
feeling of "let's have It over." Baum.
Keefe and Thomas pitched, and the lo
cal lad was much the best. The score:

*:apUin H. F. Astxup and the crew of
the wrecked barkentine Addenda were
brought back from Auckland yester
tiay on the liner Ventura. The Ad
denda went ashore during a hurricane
early In the morning of October 14 on
the beach of Palliser Bay. Five other
vessels were piled up on the land In
that vicinity by the same hurricane.
Lives were lost on every vessel but
the Addenda, which is said to be the
first wreck on this part of the New
Zealand coast in which all hands were
saved.
That any of the Addenda's crew es
caped is due t(Â» the pluck and powerful
â¢ physique of Second Mate A. Lundin.
who. in the full roar of the hurricane
which had stranded the vessel, swam
through the breakers to dry land, car
rj-lns with him a line by means of
which all hands were dragged ashore.
The distance of Lundin's swim was
rot great, but the difficulty of it may
be imafrincd from the fact that twice
after his feet had felt solid ground be
neath them thÂ» swimmer was thrown
back and sv.ept against the Addenda's
tide. He persisted and was successful.
After recovering his wind he signaled
those aboard the barkentine and the
youngest sailor in the bight of a bow
line made in th^ line was thrown over
board pnd draprp-ed ashore by Lundin.
1 hese two pulled a third ashore, and

to leave, was sately through the break-
The shipwrecked sailors underwent
â¢"rrible hardships before they found
thelter. K. Englund. who shipped as
;-.n able seaman, but is only a young
ster of some sixteen years, lost con-
Feiousnoss and would have perished
had not I^undin generously placed his
rurplus strength at his disposal. For
eight miles, through a wind that filled
the air with gravel fe.nd sand, through
rain little less dense" than the waves
through which all hands had passed,
ever a rucged, rocky country, Lundin
carried his young shipmate. For the
greater part of the trip Englund was
delirious, struggling in Lundin's arms
ar he raved and adding many fold to
his sturdy rescuer's self-imposed task.
All hands were exhausted when shel
ter was reached. A dry shirt for young
Englund and a change of clothes for
Captain ABtrup was the limit of ward
â robe relief the railors 1 hosts could at
fonL There was plenty to eat, how
ever, and a place to sleep.
They returned to the Addenda and
stayed by her for a month. The wreck
vas sold to a Mr. McDougall of Piniroa
for JiOO. and the United States Consul
at Auckland sent home on the Ven
tura all of the Addenda's people that

A stowaway was discovered on board the
liner Ventura shortly after she left Auckland.
"Put him ashore." ordered Captain Hay-ward.
purser Bucknaza found that the ttowaway bad
coin to the value of about f.V>. "Accept his
$50 for jiart payment of his passage, put him
to work and let him make .up the balance that
way." was the modification or the captain's
order. The Ventura by this time was â  wen
clear of the harbor. The stowaway saw this
and. knowing something of the vaJue of. time
to a. mail boat, tried to save his money.'
*'Sui?r>ojie I refuse to pay a cent for my
passage?" /
"Then you go afchore."
Noting the distance from the harbor, the
stowaway grinned a confidential smile. "AH
rirht." he paid, "put me ashcre If you can."
"Gi*e?s that'll hold his Nibs on the bridge
for awhile." remarked the stowaway while
his mesfaÂ«re was being conveyed to Captain
Hay ward.
But it didn't. The stowaway had over
looked a narrow neck of barren land whirh
Juttrd farther out to sea than the Ventura had
reached. There the stowaway was deposited
and when the people on the liner lost sight of
him he was dickering with a fisherman with
a free ride back to Auckland.

owners or to reject such offers, and it
directs the City Attorney to Institute

I There's Only One Way to
Get the Best of Whisky
And that Is to let It alone. If you try
any other way It will get tha best of
you. If you can't let It alone you need
Dr. McKanna's treatment. Dr. McKan-
na cures the liquor habit by destroying
the dcslro for liquor and putting: th*
system in lta natural condition, where*
liquor is not needed to help the machin-
ery of the body to do Its work. Dr.
McKanna effects a complete cure In threa
days without the use of dangerous hy-
podermics, annoying confinement or bad
after effects. Dr. McKanna's treatment
is absolutely safe and cannot harm the
most delicate constitution. Why wasÂ»tÂ»
time and money In drinking whisky
when you can be cured of .the liquor
habit In three days with no chance, ot'
failure, no risk and no unpleasantness?
Think It over and call or write Dr. Mc-
Kanna for full information. Address 14

"HE SAV1SD MY LIFE" LAST WEEK.â
Throujrh eating tainted meat I suffered th*
most awful, â  excrutiatlng torments from
PTOMAINE POISONING. Every moment
seemed as if It would' be my LAST. I
writhed In exquisite anguish all the time.
There was constant violent vomiting and
purging with Inconceivable, intolerable tor-
ture all over my body, especially in stom-
ach and bowels. I felt I must surely - DIE
unless speedily helped, but nothing relieved
me in the least. 1 was collapsing from the
most cruel agonies and exhaustion. Then
came Rexradio, whose '-first" treatment (In-
stantly) gave me extraordinary relief. It was
like passing from hell to heaven. The second
treatment fully and permanently stopped all
the dreadful pains, vomiting and purging,
with no return since. That night I slept
soundly and ever since have felt like a new
man, entirely painless, easy and hearty, anj
able as. usual to attend to my business. 1
cannot speak too highly of Rexradio and his
truly "marvelous" humanized radium treat-
ment, which I earnestly recommend to all
sufferers. Before I was a "skeptic," but now
Rexradio has not a more enthusiastic, grate-
ful advocate than I am. He healed me as
if by magic, and undoubtedly saved my
life. Call on me any time. â Richard J.

Investigate Alleged Assault.
Detective J. A. Fitzgerald, who was
detailed to investigate the death of
William Howes .Sunday night; at the"
City and County Hospital, made,a,re
port to Captain Burnett last night
which tends to lift the â¢ mystery from
the affair. The autopsy shows tha^
Howes died from a ruÂ»ture of the
bladder, but the statement that he was
kicked In the stomach gets little cre
dence from the police. At both the
Central Emergency. Hospital 'and the
City and County ; Hospital, he .made
such a statement, but 'could show " no
bruises to bear it out. He also re
fused to say where "the assault oci'
curred. He was an elderly man.
lived at 7 1 3 Ellis street, and had oh
many occasions boasted of;participat
ing: in saloon' brawls that â¢ never Oc
curred.
RATS FRIGHTEN
GRAIN BROKERS
Squealing Rodents Make a
Biisy Pit Look Like Scene
From a Girls' Seminary
JOKE IS ON THE JOKEE
Terried Animal Ascends
Trouser Leg of the Man
Charged With the Jest
A basketful of rats yesterday made
the pit at the Grain and Produce Ex
change look like a seminary populated
by hysterical femininity: As the
squealing rodents scurried across the
floor staid and stout brokers climbed
chairs or attempted â wall-scaling: stunts
that would stall a celling walker.
The rain of rats came Just when the
grain pit was in a turmoil, A basket
tumbled out of the square hole through
which the telegrams are passed and
out popped the little animals. It was a
case of any port in a storm with them.
The more valiant of the brokers faced
the invasion and waged a stern rat
hunt, but' the majority entrenched
themselves as' best they could.
Andrew S. Moseley of Cutter & Mose
ley, who Is suspected of having put up
the Job, was the first victim of the in
vasion. He attempted to crush. a whis
kered rodent with his heel. With an
agonized squeal the rat escaped, leav
ing his tail. The animal ascended
Moseley's trouser leg, squeaking pro
fanely. Moseley seized a chandelier
and attempted to perform that gym
nastic feat known as binding the crab
in an endeavor to dislodge the rat. But
the animal took refuge between the
man's shoulder blades and squealed de
fiance.
Recalling even in* that exciting mo
ment the story of the Pied Piper of
Hamelin, Moseley, attempted to charm
the little brute from his lair with mu
sic. He whistled "Good-by. little girl,
good-by." The rat only squeaked. He
thought he made a wrong guess at the
animal's sex and tried, "Bin Bailey,
won't you please come home?" The
rat clawed a few inches of skin from
his back. "Kill him!" shrieked Mose
ley, pointing to where the rat was be
ginning to gnaw into his spinal column.
An obliging but excited friend seized a
chair and swung it, intending to crush
the rodent, but he just missed flooring
Moseley. The rat was dislodged only
after Moseley had been partly disrobed.
All but five or six of the animals es
caped. There were nearly eighty in all.
Some of the brokers saw about eight
hundred.
PIE FACTORY
SUES UNIONS
Thorp, & Co Say Boycott Is
Result of Refusal to Dis
charge a Platewasher
< The business of manufacturing pies
for the trade conducted by Thorp &
Co. at 504 Post street was interrupted
on November 27 by a strike and boy
cott inaugurated because the firm de
clined to discharge an apprentice plate
washer who did not^ belong to the un
ion. Yesterday Bush Flnnell, attorney
for the Citizens' Alliance, began suit
for an injunction against three labor
organizationsâ Bakery and Confection
ery. International No. 21, Pie Bakers'
Local No. 274 and Salesmen of Bakery
Goods Local No. 106. '
. Pickets numbering at times as many
as twenty are said to have gathered at
the place of business, and according to
the complaint waylaid the non-union
workers and threatened them with
bodily harm. Among the words attrib
uted to the djsturbers are, "You are a
scab. If you do not'quit this Joint we
will beat your brains out.'-' ,
It is charged, too, that the? union men
are engaged in frightening . the plain
tiff's customers, and the names of five
firms who handle. Thorp & Co.'s goods
are given as having been threatened
with boycott unless they- withdraw
their patronage. A Mrs. Corngtock, who
runs a bakery, was told that ghe^, would
have her bread j supply cut off unless
she discontinued her trade Iwith the
Thorps. The union sent out circulars
stating that Thorp had persistently vio
lated - union rules, employed more apV
prentices than' allowed, refused to pay
overtime and discharged 'old harrds,
putting new men in their places.
CHICAGO EXPRESSMAN'S HUG
FRACTURES RIB OF ACTRESS
Is -Embraced in Windy City and Dire
Result Is Discovered at Central
1 Emergency Hospital.
. The hug of a Chicago expressman
brought Mrs. Victoria Tooker to the
Central Emergency Hospital yester
day w^th a. fractured rib. The hug
was ; received In Chicago, but no un
pleasant effects were felt from the
embrace until the lady arrived in this
city. â¢
Mrs. Tooker, who is a basker in the
footlights' glare, determined . to win
ter in San Francisco. As she neared
the Chicago depot snow began to fall.
A gallant expressman offered to carry
the distressed woman over the drifts
to her train.' She accepted the offer.
With the coy tenderness of a grizzly
bear his arm encircled her waist" and
the lady, was carried to the Pullman.
Mrs. Tooker felt the lingering pres
sure qf the brawny ami during the
journey to this 'city, but it was not an
unpleasant sensation. , Shortly after
her arrival here,- however,: she expe
rienced' a sharp pain in her side and
sought relief at the Central Emer
gency Hospital. Dr. Glovfcr discov
ered that a rib had been : fractured
and that she had literally been almost
hugged to death.

OAKLAND FULL
OF POLITICIANS
Attorney Treadwell Says
That That City Holds the
Record for Statesmen
Case of the Contra Costa
Water Company Begun Be
fore Commissioner Heacock
W. B. Treadwell, one of the attor
neys for the Contra Costa Water Com
pany, said yesterday before United
States Commissioner Heacock, master
in chancery, that he had never in his
life heard of a city that had so many
politicians ln.lt as Oakland.
"Almost every man, woman and child
in Oakland is a politician," he added.
"Some of them are In the employment
of the Contra Costa Water Company.
Because of the agitation, of these poli
ticians there was a feeling that that
company was a bad thing for the city.
The people thought that the company
ought to be cut down, just as Â«thjey
want individuals cut down who have
anything more than they."
Judge Heacock, by instruction of Cir
cuit Judge Morrow, was hearing Mr.
Treadwell's* argument on his exceptions
to- the answer of the city of Oakland
in the suit brought by the water com
pany to restrain the City Council from
enforcing the schedule of water rates.
Mr. Treadwell expressed the hope that
the assertion of the answer that the
Oakland / City Council was corrupt was
not true, butÂ» whether true or not it
was not proper" for the defendant to
scandalize itself. He did not believe
that corruption could be proved or that
evidence tending to show corruption
could be produced.
R. M. Fitzgerald, William R. Davis
and City Attorney J. E. McElroy rep
resented the city. Mayor Olney dropped
in for a few moments, listened awhile
to the legal argument and left with a
bored expression. At the conclusion of
Treadwell's argument Fitzgerald said
he was in doubt as to the relevancy
and sufficiency of some things in the
answer filed on behalf of the city of
.Oakland, and he might eliminate them,
but he was of the opinion that . the
other answers were correct.
The other side will be heard on De
cember 27, at 2 p. m.
DETECTIVE IS UNABLE
TO DISCOVER A CLEW
AATiat Become of Soldier Brnshland's
Checks for $1600 Remains a
Mystery.]
Detective Thomas Ryan, who spent
yesterday in endeavoring to ascertain
what had become of $1600 in checks,
the property of Soldier John Brash
land, who died at 2612 Lombard
street Saturday night, has reported
little success. It has been discovered
that Brashland deposited $100 in gold
coin with Captain Burgess . of the
Coast Artillery, and that on December
9 he was permitted to draw $5 of that
amount. The unfortunate man de
sired more, but, owing to the fact that
he had bean drinking, Burgess exer
cised discretion in the amount he
gave him. Brashland deposited the
ADVERTISE3IENTS.

STOCKS â The renewed irregularity and
â¢Jrefh weakness whi''h the stork market showed .
to- day was due prim'ii>ally to liquidation, the j
. pt^icral markrt sentiment being further ad- |
v.rfily affected by th* re^uinptitm of aKe r eÂ»- j
f:v* bear activity under the leadership of the
- ISciFton speculator, who again favor^'l the J
- ;â ..!â¢:â ..â¢ Â»-ith tUleped inside information regard- j
ir.< the rntxcnr.rff o' the position of the mar
leef and the "eyi'tPin." I'eople who have not
hitherto regarded this operator's assertions
serious!}- could nÂ»t fall to be Impressed to
<ia> by the way the market arted under the
renewed attack from this tource and the Â«*f
/ fÂ«Â»ct on outride sentiment. \\> thought the j
market weak enoush aiound the noon houj Â»
' Us advise iiurebases for a turn, but like a
trood many others we were disappointed at
its failure to materialize. The weakness of
the liquidation jxxils have lately constituted 1
the principal menace to the market, and this j
will be tntlrely removed with their elimina
tion. The market rhouid then take a turn I
lor the better. "
COTTONâ Trade to-day was light, but not j
ur.der much pressure and rallied some. No. ;
faying, from a speculative standpoint, that |
j-ctton will Â»ell lower, but with the outlook
before us celling cotten short at 7'ic in the
New Vork market seems pretty dangerous,
considering the pricÂ« of the actual stuff in
the South. The market at the cIosm! was very
Cm'.I around the prtoes and It all lies on the
Ftock market, which is very weak. .

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, Dec. 12. â The speculative de
tnsnd for stock* seemed to be completely
paralyzed to-day and confidence entirely de
rirted irom ail of those who were such eager
buyers up to a week ago at prices far abovi
tboM prevailing to-day. The feeling of doubt
has spread more and mere to holders of stocks
during the course of to-day's market and the
I retsure to sell long stocks . steadily Increased.
1hf= only buyers in evidence were those who
had first sold, mostly bear operators who went
ehort of the market and then bought to cover
at the Inviting profits accrued on the subse
quent declines. The range of the declines
tompared respectably with that on last Thurs
day's panicky break, but there was far less
RkQcBC* to the market. Prices hardly got
M low to-day as the low prices touched on
Thursday, but owing to the violent recoveries
on that day and the weak closing of to-day
et the lowest prices the range of prices is
Fiibetantially lower to-night than It was on
last Thursday night. . The most striking fact
â In to-day's market was the utter lack ot
resitting power. It only needed a slight ln
01 ease la tie rate of activity to start prices
rrecipitately - downward. Prices on the curb
Â» ere as violently disturbed ' as on the cx
' rhar.ge. the slump In Greene Consolidated Cop
l*r in that market rivaling the break. In
Amalgamated Copper on the exchange. But
th,- day's losses io stocks of all classes run
p. . the way from 2 to over 6 points. The tone
at the closir.g was as weak as at any time
â¢ during the fiay.
Bonds were weak. Total sales. $5,340,000.
United States bonds were uncharged on call.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and ; Provisions.
CHICAGO. Dea" 12.â Extreme weakness was
THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL. TUESDAY. DECEMBER 13, 1904.
manifested in the wheat market at the open
ing. Initial quotations were %@TÂ»c lower at
*1 Ci>?i to |1 10 for May. Several elements
tended to create a bearish sentiment. One of
the facts was the largeness of the world's
shipments especially the liberal total from
Russia. Another Influence *was the snow that
had fallen on the dought-strlcken fields of the
Southwest. The cause of the opening weak
ness was the remarkable large receipts In the
Northwest, arrivals to-day" being nearly double
those of the corresponding day a year ago.
From the start there was persistent selling.
The market lacked any good support. A heavy
tone prevailed throughout the day final quo
tations on May being $1 09-%(gU 09%, a de
cline of 1%<&1Uc
Considering the weakness of wheat the corn,
market held â  remarkably firm throughout the
tntlre session. May closed %c higher at
44%c.
Oats were firm. May closed %o up at
30% c.
Karly in the day the provision market was
firm owing to small receipts of hogs at the
yards. At the close May pork was oft 15c,
lard was 2%c lower and ribs were up 7%c.

WHEAT â The foreign futures were lower.
The world's shipments for the week were as
follows, in quarters: .Russian, 518.000; Da
nublan. 32,000; Argentine. 60,000; Indian. 121,-
OCO; Australian, 51,000.
Chicago was l%c lower. Wires from there
said: . - 'â¢
"The bulls of three months ago have
changed their views on the outlook. The
tremendous movement in the Northwest has
hardly been sufficient to offset the . Western
shortage. The passing of the Argentine . crisis
has led some of the more powerful interests to
withdraw their support from the market. The
Government report . is a surprise because of
the moderate acreage. The percentage starts
lower than that of last year and the crop pros,
pect Is 34,000,000 bushels less than last year's
showing."
The Chicago wires of B. F. Hutton : & - Co.
said:
"At the opening this . morning there was
much news to confuse traders. The, Govern
ment report of â¢ Saturday was construed mod-,
erately* bullish in view of the large increase
in acreage. This was offset by the breaking
up of "the drought through the winter Wheat
country, particularly In thÂ« Ohio Valley. Sec
retary Shaw's decision as announced after the
close of Saturday's market to grant conces
sions In the ' Import duty of Manitoba Wheat
caused a bearish feeling to ' run through the
trade and was a distinct shock to those bull-'
ishly Inclined. Aside from these' facts.- the
general situation remains ' practically -. un
changed. There Is absolutely no improvement
In the domestic situation ". and. with . reports
of reduction in* the price of â¢ Flour.t it Is hardly
holding Its own. ' ThÂ« Argentine crop Is being
harvested under ' favorable conditions,' and
while still, a factor, . U losing much 'of its
force for the - bulls. To our- mind, the real
strength of the situation Is' the ' concentrated
holdings by large interests, presumably Â» New-
York. . They continue to support prices on all
sinking spells, and It takes orders in the shape,
of selling to - cause â  an .' oversold "' condition '. In
the market.' W r e continue to feel, In view of
this Interest's continuing â¢ to hold the market,
that it Is unwise to sell at present. The trade
Is extremely dull.". ' , .â -.-. â 
In this market the cash . grain continued
aulet, as usual at ' this ' time â  of "the " year."
Although futures declined In sympathy with
Chicago, the undertone was. steady on' dry
weather and .brokers said that the market
would biiak on a good rain; ;

closely, connected with the 'handling of . the
bonds ' said yesterday that the Interest could
have been paid at the time If ; necessary. The
company, ; however, has six months' margin in
which to meet the' Interest. -Anyhow, whether
the decline was the result of manipulation' or
not. the bonds went down because M; the non

ELECTION OF DELEGATES
NOT TO BE RESTRICTED
Representatives to American Federa
tion of Labor Convention Can
Belong to Several Unions.
The seamen's convention at yester
day's session defeated a resolution
providing that in the election of dele
gates to the American Federation of
Labor convention no more than two
shall be chosen from any one affiliated
body. It was decided not to restrict
themselves in that way, but remain
free to choose the four best men, re
gardless of whether they belong to
one organization or more.
I A resolution was adopted providing
that crews shipped on American ves
sels under contract to carry foreign
mail shall be sUrned in the offices of
the United States Shipping Commis
sioners in order that the requirements
of existing law in regard to citizen
ship of the crews of such vessels may
be enforced.
. A resolution to establish a perma
nent office of a secretary-treasurer to
the international union was discussed.

DENIES HAVING
SO LD BEER.
Tells How Three Policemen
Lured Her to Supply Drink
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Mlss Bonnie Karl, a gude-lookin'
bit lassie no' lang frae th' Clydeslde,
Indignantly denied Parolman McMan
us* assertion that she voluntarily and
unlawfully sold to him one bottle of
beer In her apartments at 139 Taylor
etreet. â¢ â¢
"Hoot, mon!" she exclaimed, em
phasizing the expletive by thumping
Police Judge Conlan's bench with a
clenched fist. "Ut's a pack o' lees!"
McManus was in disguise and ac-
companied by two aids when he
played It "low down" on Miss Earl.
She testified that the trio obtained
admittance to her reception-room by
alleging they were bearers of a mes
sage to her from a long lost mascu
line admirer, whose name they de
clined to disclose, however, until they
had simultaneously refreshed their
inner man and toasted her with malt
liquor. Eager to ascertain what they
had to communicate, she hastened
forth and soon returned with a bottle
of beer, of which all present imbibed.
Then she requested McManus to de
liver his message, but he refused to
do so unless she permitted him to re
imburse her for the pecuniary outlay
and trouble to which she had gone in
providing the beverage. 'Twas thus,
she averred, he inveigled her into ac
cepting half a dollar after she had
repeatedly said, "Keep yer siller, mon,
an' gie us th' bit message."
McManus' contradiction of that part
of the defense provoked Miss Earl to
thump the bench and she walloped it
yet more vigorously when he cast re
flection on her fair fame.
"Mon, mon," she shouted, "hae ye
nae shame tae say sic' things aboot
a lady? Ut's a braw pack o' lees yer
tellin.' Alf ut's my carakteer his
wairshup wants I'll bring a wheen o'
wutnesses tae tell him mair aboot ut
than ye e'er kenned."
Her witnesses will be heard this
morning.
Lawrence O. D. Alexander, the car
conductor who obtained a licenes to
wed Miss Edith Heyde after he had
married Miss Madge T. O'Callahan,
was sent by Judge Mogan to answer
in the Superior Court the perjury
charge sworn to by the former lady.
It was not Miss Heyde's fault that the
defendant failed of dismissal, for af
ter placing him in prison she relented
and worked earnestly to obtain his re
lease, which she might have succeeded
in doing if the other woman had not
jumped into the breach and clinched
the commitment. Miss Heyde, who is
cashier In a. Fourth-street candy
store, visited Alexander at the
jail twice a day until the prosecution
had the tete-a-tete stopped and then
sent him coffee and angel cake' until
that attention was also prohibited by
an unsentimental District Attorney.
Deprived of the girl's words of cheer
and the offerings of food, the prisoner
became despondent and wrote letters
to her, which were duly intercepted
by the! '. jailers. On' December 7 he
wrote: T
My Darling Girl: I hear you cannot come
up here and see me no more, as tne .Judire
hag left word not to let you. see me no more.
My God, what will I do; this will flnleh me.
I know it. Edith, if any one asks you ir

but put It . away and show it to no one. as
they are trylne to find this out. so keep it
out of eitht until I am free. I. may not pet
to eee you again for some time, but try and
see me this 'evening about 7 o'clock. Come
down and try. Don't let them know who
you are. â¢ â  â¢ Edith, my God. keep your
word, as they are all tryinr to part us but
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1904.

by you, until death parts us. â¢ â¢ â¢ An
swer this letter by return. Babble. ' If . I
can t see you soon It will cause my death,
but be sure and send your mama, as I want
to see her. O. my God, you know not how I
am feeline over this, but answer. Your true
love ' / LAWRENCE.
p . S. â Answer this and tell me will you
always stay by me until death parts us. as
I trust you and believe you. I am In here
for you and will die for you. so be true,
little irirl. be true to one who will be true
to you until we meet again.
In her efforts to communicate with
the prisoner Miss Heyde was aided by
Mrs. Kate Pettie, manager of the Uni
versal Service Society, and ; that lady,
too, came under detective displeasure.
In default of furnishing a $2000 bond
Alexander remains in Jail.
Albert Case was intoxicated last Sun
day when he disturbed the peace of
Mrs. Matilda Williams' household, at 12
Twelfth street, nor had he entirely re
covered from inebriety when he entered
the court of Judge Fritz yesterday
morning. He held animated converse
with the complaining witness and sev
eral ladies who had been summoned to
testify for her. and when called to face
the bench he burst into tears and sob
bingly averred that the primal cause of
his trouble was a better half who
eclipsed him in age and weight and
ability to "nag," she being aided and
abetted by his stepdaughter, a maiden
almost as old as he and much more
combative of nature than himself. He
was ordered Into custody for detention
until he is sober enough to speak with
out blubbering.
Mrs. Abbey Kelleher, middle-aged
and portly, responded with an unintel
ligible mumble when Judge Cabaniss
requested her to narrate the incident
upon which she based her complaint
accusing Edward Walsh of having rout
ed peace from her domicile, 339 Tehama
street. His Honor repeated his request,
and again the lady muttered something
which he apparently failed to compre
hend, for he instructed a bailiff to sum
mon Mr. Becsey,- the German inter
preter, from the corridor. Mr. Becsey
trotted into court and at once proceed
ed to address Mrs. .Kelleher In the lan
guage of the Fatherland.
"Gehe zu," he said, "und erzehle
deine geschicht," the literal transla-
4 : _
tion of which is,- "Go to it and relate
your story." j
But instead of complying the lady
glared at Mr. Becsey and exclaimed,
"Phwat dlz ye mane? D'ye take me for
Dootch?"
Mr. Becsey fled, and Mrs. Kelleher's
tale was told in English as she is
spoken where the Shannon rolls. It ap
peared that' Mr. Walsh had broken a
window in the Kelleher home, and his
assurance that the damage would be
repaired at his expense resulted in dls-,
missal of the case.
Captain T. P. Reynolds, attached to
the medical department of the Presidio,
hired a colored valet in the person of
Harry Redd, and Harry stole about $179
worth of the captain's clothing, de
camped and was captured, but the
plunder remains hidden. When the cap
tain engaged Harry he did not know
much about the man's character, which
is blackened by a previous arrest for
robbery. Testimony will be heard next
Thursday by Judge Mogan. . :
Henry Miller's eloquent pleading
resulted In a, gradual diminution of
his prescribed imprisonment from 1
three months to fifteen days. He was
convicted of vagrancy before Judge
Cabaniss, and when the three-months'
sentence, was pronounced he raised
his voice in earnest promises to re
form until h's Honor reduced it to
two months, then to one" month, then
to twenty days, then to fifteen days,
and might have wiped it out entirely
if Bailiff Cirmichael had not abrupt
ly removed the orator.
John Johns, N^ vagrant, spent last
Friday night reclining on a gridiron
of telegraph wires high above the sur
face of Rincon Hill. Saturday night
in a detached water main/ and Sunday
night in the basement of No. 9 engine
house, at Harrison and Main streets,
where he was so Indiscreet as to make
a blazf and thus endanger destruction
of the firehouse. He spent last night
in the City Prison, and Judge Mogan
may decide to order that he: be kept
there several more nights.
It having been proved that John
Carter was a peacemaker, instead of a
disturber at the glassblowers' ball last
Saturday night in Eintracht Hall, the
charge of disorderly behavior against
him was dismissed by Judge Mogan.
The man who inaugurated the â  "rough
house" proceedings, it was explained,
is undor repair in the Receiving Hos
pital and will be, conveyed; to court as
soon as his condition permits his safe
removal. He it was, several witnesses
testified, who "joshed" the t young
lady, who complained of jhls 1 impu
dence to the floor manager," and John

Young Wife Is Made to Tell
of Her Quarrels With Her
Husband After 3Iarriage
ATTEMPT TO END SUIT
Contestant's Counsel Fails
* to Prove Wine Merchant's
Widow Guilty of Contempt
Mrs. Violet Monnier, wife of George
Monnier, who is fighting for a- portion
of the estate left by the late wine
merchant, George Monnier Sr.", to his
wife, Anna Monnier, spent an un
comfortable hour on the witness
stand yesterday under the sharp
cross-examination of George D. Col
lins, counsel for the proponent of the
will. ~r?
The morning session in Judge
Graham's, court opened with an at
tempt by Matt Sullivan and Theodore
J. Roche, counsel for the contestant, to
show that Mrs. Monnier Sr. was guil
ty of contempt of court by amending
and correcting her deposition, taken
before a' notary, and changing ques
tions as well as her answers to them.
It subsequently developed that Mrs.-
Monnier made the corrections before
she signed the deposition, and Judge
Graham overruled the petition.
-The cross-examination of Violet
Monnier was continued from Thurs
day afternoon, and yesterday she went
on telling of her relation with the
Monniers, her husband's treatment of
her and her admission into the Mon
nier home to live. During the cross
examination Collins held in his hand
a copy of the witness' testimony at
the time of her defense in a divorce
suit brought, by her husband, in
which she swore that young Monnier
had obtained money from his father
and spent it in saloons.
Plaintiff's attorneys objected to the
use of the witness' testimony In her
divorce trial, ; and a lively tilt oc
curred between counsel. The young
wife was also forced to admit that
none of the quarrels between herself
and tho Monniers occurred before the
signing of the will and that they
could have had no effect on that docu
ment. Collins will to-day attempt to
show that it was the son's conduct
alone that led to his father's disin
heriting him.
T. J. Curtis, the policeman who was
called in at the time of the Monnier
quarrels, testifio-.l that the elder Mrs.
Monnier had threatened to poison
Violet and the two grandchildren, and
that Monriier Sr. attempted to quiet
her. John T. Harmes. who for many
years had business dealings with . the
late winemaker, identified Monnier's
signature on the baptismal record of
thÂ«* French church. Receipts given
the witness by Monnier were admitted
as evidence. The case will continue
this morning. ' . {, â --*. â .,â â <- K' .

FIND LIVING BABY
IN POTTER'S FIELD
no cLew to its parentage
Waif Is Placed in Basket and
Laid Near Pauper's Grave.
BRIGHT BOY BABY THAT WAS FOUND YESTERDAY AFTERNOON IN THE
OLD CITY CEMETERY. BASKET IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN CAREFULLY
PLACED AND YOUNG WOMAN WHO TOOK THE DESERTED INFANT IN.
In "the dismal public cemeterv near
the ocean beach a tiny living baby was
found- yesterday.. Swathed in woolen
bandages it lay in the section called
the potter's field. Not a scrap of pa
per nor any mark of identification was
near.it. In grim incongruity the aban
doned living, newly, born, was placed
beside the abandoned dead:
How long it had lain in the grew
some company of the white-washed
headstones of the paupers nobody
knows. It is now safe in the San
Francisco Foundling Asylum. There
it was given a 'name in the same man
ner that Oliver Twist received his. The
custom at the asylum is to give a
child a name as soon as it reaches the
place. Myrc-11 Alfred Wallace they
called this one, and It is probably the
one he will always bear. . -.'â 
The startling discovery of the baby
In the cemetery was made by A.
Paget and James H. Kline. They were
strolling through the place on their
way to the beach -when they saw the
basket through â  the mist that envel
oped the dismal potter's fleM.
â¢ One of them carelesslv flipped back"
the cover, of .the. basket with a stick.
.Something bundled^ in a roll of cloth
squirmed and a feeble wail arose. The
waif was uttering its early complaints
at the pain of existence. Quickly the
two meti ran. to the nearest house, -the
home of. Miss , Minna Ketel, 400 -Thirty
fifth avenue, and notified her. of the
discovery. .....
Miss Ketel gathered the pitiful little
bundle of humanity. Into her arms and
carried it to the- house.- The baby was
placed near &' warmflre, for the chilly
fog had penetrated Its wraps, , and it
was nearly dead from exposure.
Everything â¢ that -wrapped the child
was faultlessly" neat. > The "clothing
found in the basket indicated that pov
erty was not the motive of abandoning
the child. The basket contained a hot
water bottle, a little-blue dress, a pink
one,, two silk shirts and a woolen wrap.
All these were of the finest material.
But nothing else was 'found , in the
basket. ,:,' .- , ; ; > , . '., â  ']
At Miss Ketel V suggestion the baby
was taken to' the San Francisco Found
ling Asylum by the â ; two; young men
who found It. They placed it in charge
of Matron" Mol ton and with'" her thor
oughly searched the basket In hope of
finding some clew to the child's Identi
ty. Not a line was found. The cloth
ing had been newly;., purchased and
there were no marks of, any. description
upon it.
The men were about- to leave the
hospital '.when the â¢ matron , said, "Wait,
you . cannot leave - a . baby here unless
you Â«rive it a. name."
Paget and Kline decided -that they
must comply.;; with!- the. rule*. .. After a
short consultationj-they decided upon
Myrell Alfred Wallace. That name,
hastily given, .will' stay _? with the child
throush . life : unless *' its unfortunate
mother can at "some time claim it.
Fromthe baby's appearance and the
garments -on it ; those who have seen
them are ; certain : that the i baby' is not
a child of the.; slums.^ They are:certain
that; if the parents ~ot) the waif of the
cemetery. ' were found some v one- *of
wealth "would be implicated; ' . . -
."But "at present" there. 1 is no-clewto
the mystery. An effort to solve it will
probably be made by the police. The
baby is now at the Foundling Asylum,
where the attaches pronounce it a
marvel of health and beauty.

WONBERFULToRiT
OF SORE HANDS
By Cutlcura After the
Most Awful Suf ferine
Ever Experienced.
EIGHT DOCTORS
And Many Remedies Failed
to do a Cent's Worth
of Good.
â¢â¢ About five years ago I was troubled
with aore hands, so sore that when I
would pat them in water the pain-would
very nearly get me crazy, the sMa voald
peel off and the flesh woald get hard
and break. There would be blood flow-
In e from at least fifty places oa each
hand. Words conld never tell the suf-
fering I endured for three years. I
tried everything that I iras tola to use
for fully three years, but could g;t no
relief. I tried at least eight different
doctors, bat none of them seemed to do
me any good, as my hands were as bad
when I got through doctoring as when
I first began. I also tried many reme-
dies, but none of them erer did rae one
cent's worth of good. I was discour-
aged and heart-sore. I would feel so
bad mornings when I got op, to think
I had to go to work and stand the pain
for ten hours, and I often felt like giv-
ing up my position. Before I started
to work mornings I would have to
wrap every finger up separately, so
as to try and keep them soft and then
wear gloves over the ragg to keep
the grease from getting on my work.
At night I would have to wear gloves
in bed. la fact, I had to wear gloves
all the time. But thanks to Ccticura,
the greatest of all great skin cures.
After doctoring for three years, and
spending ,much money, a 50c. box of
Cuticura Ointment ended all my suffer-
ings. It's been two years since I used
any and I don't know what sore hands
are now, and never lost a day's work
while using Caticura Ointment."
