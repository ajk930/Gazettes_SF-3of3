The tears were running down Du

nod.
"How can I atone for all thisâ I. a
loyal soldier, who love my Emperor?"
he groaned, when he had recovered a
little. "How can I atone to you and
Miss Metcalf, who have risked so much
for me?"
"By placing yourself entirely in my
hands, and helping me to cause these
desperadoes to be wiped out," replied
Fortescue earnestly. "After to-day's
experience I will not permit Miss Met

day longer than necessary. Your

and I propose to end the affair In
France for several reasons. In the

am going to let this old assassin run
loose a little longer till we get him on
a more congenial soil." He spoke in
pood English, merely altering his voice,
knowing that Dubrowski was ignorant
of the language.;
Fortescue nodded assent, and passing
his arm through that of his
would-be preserver drew him , away,
catching as he did so. a glimpse of the
baffled assassin on his back among the
ferns,*- hel^ -down by two of Volborth's

blurted out:
"Thank God, monsieur, you are safe.
I did my best, but your fellow-country

Fortescue, with acurtness .that .was
perplexing. "The ; man was not a

booksellers all over the coun

Perhaps its chief strength
lies in the fact that it is not

said to be a biography of the
author's own life. The world
is clamoring more than ever

JAMES METCALF'S ancient
lineape placed him above sus
picion of snobbery, but he had
the true Highland hospitality,
a-r.'i rordlally assented without a sec
hVj thought. He vanished in the <li
r^<'tfon of the Ftablrs without even
\yu;?ing to be introduced to his new
g-uesl.
â¢ Thr interval had Riven lima time to
Efc-t herself well under control, and
guesting from a knowledge of her im
jiorial rr.istress" ways that Boris had
not been informed of the nature of his
rnicslon did the best thins possible.
S.he bec\on?d him to her a:;d put the
Tsarina's loiter into his hand, simply
caving, in French:
"Lady Metcalf is good enough to
JTn* room."
FcTteseue, while sympathizing with
the .awkward position in which lima
was placed, was amused as well as in
terested in the little comedy, that was
Going forward, and he Ftudied'Boris as
he read. The young officer's face was
very Gruve till he came to the end,
then he handed the letter back w:th i
courteous smile, and a request to be
Introduced to Lndy Metcalf.
"There 1e good Fluff in tl.e lad yet,
tvhlch fhowr now that the evil influence
has slackened," was the attache's men
trf*. comment; and. though he knew It
not. there was at that moment born In
his brain the nerm of an idea that was
to mark the difference between life and
death to come.
The two princ.'pals having so com
ported themselves cs to save a contre
temps, everything on the surface went
smoothly. Boris was introduced right
nnd left, and made much of, while lima
gallantly played her part of being
quietly pleased at his arrival. Luckily
for her the people staying at Blalrgel
die were of the class who hold that
iovw-Hke behavior in a betrothed
couple is bad form, and the last thing
that was expected of her was to
monopolize Boris. The most difficult
moment was when Laura made her ap
pearance, and Ehowed undisguised as
tonishment; but Fortescue was at
hand, and leading her aside quickly ex
plained the position. On which the
daughter of the house wer.t up, and,
cm the . Etrcngth of their previous
strange meeting at Breslau. welcomed
thÂ« new gurst as though the scene in
the ctreet had never been. The bronze
on the young Russian's check deep
ened a little an they ehook hands,
showing that the incident was not for
gotten, but the keynote for all-roand
civility had been struck and it -pre
vailed.
At the earliest opportunity Laura and
Fortcccue strolled away together, and
the confirmed Volborth's account of
vhat had befallen her. Amid the fa
miliar flowers and shrubs of the old
Scotch garden, with the gray walls of
licr childhood's home in the back
cround, the girl was not cÂ»sy to pÂ«r
cuade of her danger, nnd Fortescue had
to ppeak rather more- plainly than he
had Intended. She . wasn't going to
"funk" before a lot of ckulkers who had
bolted from one man's pistol at Bou
logne, she' protected; and It was only
when he pointed out that the flight of
the Nihilists on that occasion was not
due to cowardice, but to a desire to
paper into the hand held out for it be
low the level of the table.
"The same boy â Widow Ferguson's?"
asked Fortescue under his breath.
"No. sirâ another one. unbeknown to
us," was the reply, and Meldrum was
gone.
Fortescue was too old in the world's
ways to examine the missive at once,
but presently, when Fitz Harding was
absorbing attention with a tiger story,
he unfolded It on his lap. It was from
Volborth, written in French to. this
effect:
"Take care. Olga knows that he is
at Blairgeldle. She has communicated
with him since 6 o'clock."
Thrusting the billet into his waistcoat
pocket he' was , in ; time ' to Join the
chorus of polite appreciation at the
c!ose r of the ex-Judge's narrative. It
was useless to speculate on the Princess
Palltzln's reason fpr resuming corre
spondence with' Dubrowski; all he could
do was to watch closely and await de
velopments, and these came sooner
than he expected.

In the drawing-room a move was al
most immediately made by most of the
younger members of, the party to the
billiard-room. Finding that' there were
more j would-be players J in the pool
than there- "were balls, Fortescue, -as
almost a member of the family,; de
clined to take a cue; and settled' down
on the settee as a spectator.' Some one
âhe knew very welPyÂ«who it was,
though he was too wary; to turn his
headâ promptly took a seat at his side.
As soon as the 'clatter and racket "of
the came were in full swing, he felt
browski's eyes open with a sndden
horror, his stalwart figure stiffen, and
in a moment the young Russian had
leaped forward toward the dark fringe
of shrubbery. â¢ Turning on his heel,
Fortescue was In time to see a pair of
fierce eyes, the gleam of a knife, and
Dubrowski's hand outstretched to
grasp the lurking form of Weletski,
the graybeard Nihilist, who at that In
stant was seized from 'behind and
pulled back into the gloom of the
trees. There was the sound of a scuffle,
a stifled oath, and Volborth, still in his
German disguise, stepped out from the
bushes. '
"That should bo proof that you are
well looked after," he said. "Though
to do him justice the decoy would him
self have frustrated the crime he was
intended to bring about. You had bet

a tap on his arm, and Boris said In, a
strangely fluttering voice:
"I wish a few words with you In pri
vate, monsieurâ without risk of being
overheardâ if your kindness will ac
cord them. I will not detain you long."
Ke made an unconscious gesture to
ward the French windows which, as
the night was warm, stood open, show
ing a vista of lawn and garden bathed
in moonlight that only failed in the
shadows of the dark shrubbery be
yond. Here, thought Fortescuo, was a
chance to learn where the next blow
was to be expected, and he rose at once
and led the way out, Boris following
and pacing at his side. It was not till
they were some distance from the win
dows that the, Russian spoke, slowly
and' haltingly, giving the Englishman
the impression that he was repeating
a lecson by rote.
'. "I wish through* you, monsieur," be
gan Dubrowski, "to tender an apology
to Miss Metcalf for the language
which I unfortunately used to her, and
before her, at Breslau. At the same
time I am requested by â by a friend,
to Implore her not to disclose the crime
attempted by the man Delaval at the
house of the Baroness von Lindberg.
My friend, who wrote that letter of In
troduction, was deceived in him, and
sheâ that is I->-would be ruined if it
came to the ears of the Russian po
lice." - â¢ ,
Fortescue , was Intensely puzzled.
Fortescue said carelessly. "The only
point was how it got here â by a mes
senger from Ballater, I suppose?"
"Yes, sir; one of the Widow Fergu
son's lads brought it Just before the
first gong sounded," was the reply.
"Ah! thank you, Meldrum; that-ex
plains everything most satisfactorily,"
said Fortescue, and he returned to the
drawing-room devoutly wishing that
his last assertion had a little more bot
tom to It. What cc-uld this communi
cation be, he wondered, that had
wrought such a wondrous change in
Dubrowski's manner?"
The change endured throughout din
ner, growing, If anything, more
marked despite a palpable effort on the
part of Boris to throw it off. Lady
Metcalf had appropriated him to her
self, and he was clearly struggling to
seem Rmused by and to respond to her
platitudes, but though he may have de
ceived his amiable ho6tess, there were
at least two pairs of sharp eyef upon
him which noted his embarrassment
and preoccupation.
When the ladies had left the dining
room and Meldrum had arranged the
array of decanters, before Sir James,
the old butler slopped on his way. to
the door and stooped to whisper in
Fortescue's ear:
"I was to give you this, sir, without
any fuss. Brought to tne back door
half an hour ago by a boy." At the
same time he thrust a folded scrap of

chief that she looked grave. Even then
ch* was not perlcus long.
"But there is the umqultous Herr
Wlnckei as a protector." ehe said.
â¢'And, by the way, what la Herr Win
dee!, and how la it he Is on Deeslde
now? I can put two and two together,
you know. It isn't coincidence."
"No more than my presence at Bres
lau wa3 a coincidence," replied Fortes
cue. "He is a secret service man, on a
mission for his Government connected
with the Tsar's tour, and he knows a
good deal. "Were It not for him, and
my confidence In his vigilance, I
sho-uld put the English police on to
Palltzln at once. I am not at all sure
that I shall not do so as it is."
"What! and have us all dragged into
the police court or the Old Bailey or
somewhere as witnesses, and most
likely set Uma's affairs made public
and Captain Dubrowski locked up Just
when he's- behaving so nicely!" cried
Laura breathlessly. "Indeed you
mustn't do anything: of the kind, Spen
cer. You're clever enougn to find a
better way than that, I know; and I
will promise to be careful and not go
about alone. And you will be careful,
too, de'ar, won't you â though after the
way you cleared them out at Boulogne
I am sure if you say 'Bo!' they'll all
run like mice."
With that he hud to be content, rec
ognizing that all he could say would
never make her really afraid after the
discomfiture she had witnessed. But
her persistence in holding the danger
so cheap confirmed his decision that,
Volborfh willing or not. matters would
have to be brought to a head before the
Russian party was
back at St. Peters
burg. There was the
Paris visit, followed

stay at Darmstadt, to

Laura, subjected to
lurking perils during
the whole of that
period when a little

ised himself to' crack
with the aid of tobac
co and solitude, and
that was a combina
tion which the ameni
ties of country-house
life would not permit
till he had retired for
the night.
The remainder of
the afternoon passed
uneventfully at Blair
geldle, with not so
much as a ripple to
tell of the undercur
rents below. Under
the Influence of Lady
Metcalf's specious at
tentions Boris Du

make himself quite
at home. He paid the

least bit shy. but with
Fortescue. who seized
every opportunity of
cultivating him, he
was soon on the best
of terms. When the
first gun boomed from
the hall door the stal
wart young Russian
was as gay as any of
the house party that
trooped in to dress
for dinner.
And then a change came, swift and
mysterious, which Fortescue could not
understand. He had parted with Du
browski at the door of the bedroom as
signed to him, leaving him with a mu
tual jest and laugh to go to his own
room. Twenty minutes later he was In
the hall on his' way to the drawlns
room when he 8 â¢? Dubrowski .de

But there was a greater alteration in
the aide-de-camp than that effected by
the change of clothes. His face waa
cold and set, and he replied to For
tcscue's offer to Guide him to the
drawing-room In as few words as were
compatible with the barest politeness.
In' the drawing-room, while making a
visible effort to appear at his ease, he
was plainly quite the reverse. Had he
not been a foreigner his silence and ab
straction would have excited general
remark. .
"What's the matter ?'\ whispered
Laura to her lover. "He looks as If he
is afraid there was going to be aspara
gus and didn't know how to eat it."
But Fortescue only smiled, and see
ing that there was likely to be a long
"wait" slipped out into the hall. Has

holed the old butler.

â¢JHasn't he got it, sir?" replied the
butler sharply, - scenting ia breach of
duty among his subordinates. "I told
Charles to see that the bedroom maid
placed It on his dressing-table."
"Oh. yes, it reached him all right,"
It was somewhat of a shock to hear
that she was here In Scotlandâ that

money is nothing to required by
the monarch of a friendly power "do-
Ing" a friendly capital. ' Though the
last day of the visit of "Le Grand Pe
tit Nicholas" to Paris' had arrived,
there remained the art treasures of the
Louvre, to be Inspected, the venerable
Rosa Bonheur to be interviewed, and
decorations to be sorted out .wholesale
to hungry Republican officials before a
start could be made for the crowning
ceremony at Thus It was
not till nearly 2 o'clock that the pro
cession of carriages, with its escort of
cuirassiers, filed away from the Rus
sian Embassy In the Rue de Grenelle.
At Sevres a halt was made to enable
the visitors to see the porcelain fac
tory, and here the absence of Vilborth
first excited remark. As usual it was
the police agent's bete noir. the Coun
tess Vassili, who dragged the fact from
the obscurity In which he had wished it
to remain. The suite were clustered to
gether at the door of the furnace-room,
while the Tsarina went through the
pantomime of starting one of the fires
with a decorated torch, and the old
lady passed the time In her favorite
amusement of "counting heads."
. "All here but Paul Volborth," she
whispered, nudging Boris Dubrowski,
who chanced 'to be standing next to
her. "As a social success that man's
days are numbered. Can you explain
how it is that he has more license than
any of the rest of us?"
lima, at her mother's elbow, heard
the question, and involuntarily her
eyes sought Dubrowski's face. For the
first time for weeks their glances met
with something akin to friendly sym
pathy, and though her eyes were In
stantly averted she awaited his reply
with eagerness.
"I am sure that none of us â that is,
very few of usâ appreciate the import
ance of Volborth's worK," he said.
"There must be many things that he
has to do, and toâ to discover, that we
can have no idea of."
The aide-de-camp had no trick of
easy speech, but, clumsily expressed as
was the double entendre, lima under
stood its meaning.
'Â¦" Volborth's connection with the Third
Section was, she knew, one of the few
points on which Fortescue had not en
lightened Boris. The latter had no
suspicion of the Identity of the mian
who had appeared so opportunely in
the grounds of Blalrgeldle when the
attache's life was threatened. But she
recognized with a flutter at her heart
that his reply to her mother was really
meant for herâ as an admission that
her warnings at Vienna were accepted
at last. And it pleased her to think
that that acceptance' had- come spon
taneously without proof from outside â
that day of all days.
In the meanwhile Volborth was more
than Justifying Dubrowskl's opinion
that he was busily employed elsewhere.
So closely and cleverly had he In
vested the shop of the Veuve Grigot
with his spies, that every movement of
the t conspirators was known to him,
while they themselves remained In
ignorance* that their rendezvous had
been discovered. At an early hour, as
a result of a newspaper report, Serjov
had been traced to the Morgue, whence
he had returned Immediately to the Rue

She shook the papers playfully in his
face, then stood un tiptoe, and. drawing
down his head, whispered the names of
several personages well known In Rus
sian society.
"There, you foolish boy, that ought to
allay your suspicions," she laughed.
"They are not like poor me, under an
undeserved cloud, but they prefer to
share my incognito for the fun of the
adventure. And now tell me the ar
rangements, Borisâ when the T*ar la to
arrive at Versailles, what he is to do
when he is there, and where is the best
score against that ruffian Delaval as it
is. but it would be unbearable if the
suspicion incurred by me on his behalf
debarred me from the pleasure of the
spectacle which I have come specially
to see. I only occupy this garret so as
to enjoy unmolested the delight of
viewing my beloved sovereign among
the splendors of Versailles."
"Well, you will have your whim,"
said Dubrowskl. "But once more let
me ask â you are quite sure of these
friends of yours V

"Yes," he said, "I have got the

your own. It is a big risk to run

signed "Mohrenheim" by the Russian
Embassador and bore also the vise of
the Prefect of the Paris police.
"Have no fear; I will be discretion it

Dubrowskl flung open his cloak and
produced several slips of paper, which
he laid on the table. It was a Ions ta

floor of the dwelling-house. The Prin

â¢Bon solr, monsieur," he gurgled, dof
fing a floury cap of rabbit's Ekin. "You
come not often, like some of them, and
nt first I did not recognize you. Pass
up. if you please; Madame waits."
â¢She is alone?" asked the visitor, and,
being answered in a leering affirmative,
he ascended the stairs and knocked at
On the south side of the Seine, in a
quiet street not a stone's throw from
the Boulevard Saint Germain, there is
a baker's shop which In. the early days
of October, 1896, prospered exceedingly.
Let us call the street the Rue Casse-
Tete, and assign the name of Griatâ
Veuve Grigot â to the proprietress of
the shop. Neither of those appellations
is to be found in the directors, but this
will be the kinder course in view of
possible inquiry by the police into the
nature of the aforesaid prosperiiv.
On the face of things this took sliape
in an increase of the number of the
widow's customers. The street is fo
quiet, so shy and retiring in its habits,
that perhaps none of the neighbors
noticed it; but had they done so they
would have wondered at the frequency
with- which the half-glass door swung
to and fro admitting strangers who
were not of the Rue Casse-Tete. They,
the neighbors, devoured the Vruve
Grigofs moldy loaves, with maledic
tions, because they were cheap and
near. It would not have occurred to
them that the fame of the dingy bak
Â«>ry was such as to attract- outsiders
from other streets, least of all outsiders
in fur overcoats and shiny silk hats.
Not that the dwellers in the Rue
Casse-Tete would have had real cause
for wonderment on that head, for the
good widow made no addition to her
"bake" to meet an extra demand, and
the sudden influx of customers did not
even cause a diminution of her normal
stock. And, what was still more
strange, "these others," the new cus
tomers, though they undoubtedly went
into the shop, were not to be seen
coming out again â at least without an
unconscionable long wait â by those
who saw them enter. And all day long
and far into the night Pierre Grigot,
the widow's black-browed son, with
whose name rumor coupled wild do
ings In the far-off Commune days,
stood tuard at the foot of the stairs
beyond the inner door that separated
the shop from the house.
About the time of street-lamp light
ing, in the late afternoon of Tuesday,
the 7th of October, a tall man, envel
oped from head to heel in a military
cloak, but wearing a~ civilian hat well
pulled down over his eyes, entered the
shop, and, paying no heed the
frowsy old woman behind the counter,
walked straight through to the Inner
door. Opening and shutting. it behind
him, he was for a moment in darkness.

CHAPTER XI
stump of his tenth cigarette into the
grate in his bedroom and produced his
writing: materials.
"That. I think, ought to fall into line
neatly," he muttered, "and It has the
advantage of leaving a loophole for
that poor beggar to crawl through."
The letter which he proceeded to
write was addressed to a firm in Pall
Mall, and ran as follows:
Dear elrs â I require Â« of chain mail
to fit under clothe* for a man 5 feet 9 Inches
in hHcht, chert measurement 30. - I will call

SPENCEH FORTKSCUt:.
"You have stood my friend, whatever
be the result," he said warmly. Then,
as his host began to unlatch the door
for him, he added: "Forgive me for
wanting to be reassured again. In the
arrangements which you have made
with Restofski- for the arrest, you are
certain there is no danger to the Tsar?"
"Rest easy on that score," replied
Fortescue, patting him on the shoulder.
"At the eventful moment his Majesty
will be resting after the labors of the
day in the security of his apartments in
"Come, come, my friend, you must
have courage, and not depreciate your
self too much," Fortescue was begin
ning, when an interruption occurred in
a rat-tat on the outer door. Thrusting
a revolver which lay on the table into
the "pocket of his coat, he kept one
hand on the weapon, while with the
other he drew the latch and opened
ever so slightly. Then he flung the
door wide, exchanged a few words with
the messenger, who had brought a
bulVy parcel, and reshot the bolt.
"A needless precaution, as it hap
pened," he smiled. "If you will excuse
me I will carry this Into the other
room." And he disappeared with the
parcel Into the sleeping apartment, re
turning Immediately.
"And now, Dubrowskl, you have done
your part, and It remains only for you
to witness the result," he said. "What
I am doing, as you are aware, Is aimed
at putting an -end to Miss Metcalf 's
danger, but if you benefit Indirectly by
what happens no one. will be more
pleased than I."
There was a hint In Fortescue's voice
that his departure was desired, and Bo
ris adjusted his cloak and wrung the
attache's hand.V- ' ->->
Running up to the second floor, Du
browski knocked at the outer door of
one of severcl small suites, and was at
once admitted by Fortescue In person,
who for good reason had rented a com
fortably furnished sitting-room and
bedroom In preference to going to a
hotel. Ostensibly the mission ~ whlqh
had brought him to the French capital
was the same as that which had taken
him to Breslau. though if his business
was to watch the Tsar's reception with
official British eyes he performed his
task in a singular manner. Since his
arlval in Paris three days before, he
had not once left his apartments, his
meals being brought to him from a
neighboring restaurant by the con
cierge.
"Well, my friend, you have been to
ithe baker's shop? You have given
them the passes?" he said, proffering
bis cigarette-case. "That is well. And
you do not think that the Princess was
dissatisfied with your behavior? You
made it sufficiently cordial?"
"I am no play actor, but I did my
best," replied Boris stoutly. "I came
near to spoiling: it all, though, at the
end, when she spoke scornfully of lima.
False lover as I have been, it raised my
gorge to hear that pure name slighted
by those murderous lips." .
"I am glad to hear you say that,"
said Fortescue, "but I trust that you
concealed your feelings at the time,
Dubrowski. and did not scowl as you
are doing at the reminiscence?" The
familiarity of the Englishman's man
ner was now that of one friend for an
other, and lacked the contemptuous
tone which he had used at Blalrgeldie.
That the Russian understood in his
slow, heavy way. and was duly grate
ful for not being held by his new ally In
as great loathing as that in which he
held himself, was apparent in hl3 mel
ancholy smile.
"She did not notice: I was leaving
her when I felt like that," he replied.
"And she would only deem me sulky
because of her recent neglect. Thi^ Is
a new experience for Olga Palltzln. She
is too sure of her mastery over men to
fear rebellion from one whom she has
once held in thrallâ especially from
such a blind fool as I."
"It is not fitting that you and I should
discuss Mademoiselle Vassili," he re
plied gravely. And without waiting to
hear the half-mocking retort which was
flung after him, he closed the door and
descended the stairs, guided only by a
stream of light from the 'lantern of the
villainous sentinel below. So. scarcely
returning Pierre Grigofs hoarse "Au
revoir, monsieur," he passed through
the shop into the quiet street.
But it was not to the Russian Em
bassy that he first turned his steps.
Crossing the river by the Pont des Arts
he passed the Louvre, and, plunging in
to the network of streets behind.- en
tered the courtyard of a highly respect
able apartment-house a few doors from
the Rue Marcel. As he disappeared
under the archway, a dark shadow
which had flitted in his wake all the
way from the Rue Casse-Tete hovered
for a n\oment on the pavement and
then made off with all haste to the
Russian Embassy.
"He Is not looking quite himself," as
sented Boris, and he proceeded with
much detail to catalogue the pro
gramme of the visit to Versailles on the
morrow, which was to be the closing
function of the Tsar's stay in Paris.
The Princess put to him many trifling
questions, as when she asked with a
merry laugh if the Emperor would wear
the grey overcoat which had become so
familiar to the Parisians in the last few
days. For this Dubrowskl would not
vouch, though he expressed the opinion
that it was probable. At length he rose*
to go. His demeanor now, as it had
been throughout the interview, and a
previous one that they had had. was
brusque, despite an obvious' struggle to
be civil. Doubtless Olga accounted for
this by the three weeks' break In her
correspondence with him.
"Farewell." he said. "I must return
to the Embassy, or I shall be missed."
"By the beautiful lima, eh?" the
Princess murmured with a heartless
laush. "How are things between you
now, my Boris? I had forgotten to ask."
He was bending over her hand, and
she must have noticed that his touch
was Icy cold.
spot to get a close sight of him and the
dear Empress? They tell me that his
Majesty is looking thin and worried."
"A ' prospective danger is not more
enjoyable than a present . one, when it
threatens the" woman you -loveâ you
must understand that, Volborth," he
said. "However,, you have' refused to
remove that danger by arresting these
people till it suits you; and, being in
honor bound, I could not go, behind
your back to have them" arrested In
"You need feel no alarm about Miss
Metcalf at present," he said. "All the
active agents of the gang are here in
Paris, and they are under close sur
veillance. The Palltzln herself, Anna
Tchigorln, Weletaki, Serjov, Krasno
vltch, and Delaval, are being watched
to and from the Rue Casse-Tete by
Restofskl and his men In conjunction
with the French police. When they
fall here, as they have failed before, It
will be time enough to : get nervous
about. Blairgeldle â and then' only .^f*
they succeed in scattering."
Fortescue made a wry face, and. re
plied with an impresslveness which
gained its object In being' remembered;
afterwards. â¢ â¢-{'Â¦/:
"They probably know It -now that
they have had Dubrowskt's brains to
pump,l>repUÂ«d ; Volbo>th..,Â«^'It was .ito
warn' -you on Â£hat account ; tif~f edouble
vigilance -that t I liaatehed hither. -I
wish you had not come to Paris. Spen
cer, on this quixotic errand; your pres
ence Increases my -anxieties tenfold."
For the excuse of a government "mis
sion" would not have sufficed _for Vol
borth. and Fortescue had accounted for
his trip to him by a wish to draw off
the Nihilists from Laura to himself. In
this he spoke the truth, though hardly
"the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth."
"Well. I am keeping pretty close," he
said. "And what is your theory as to
Olga's plans, Paul? What does her re
union with Dubrowskl portend, think
you?"
"Mischief, undoubtedly; though
whether they are flying at you or at
higher game. I have no evidence yet,"
was the reply. "Probably both." Vol
borth added after a pause, as though
he had decided to impart a â¢ further
confidence. "For this. I may tell you.
relying on your secrecy. Dubrowski
has obtained passes In false names for
the entire gang to be admitted to the
park and terraces at Versailles to
morrow. His Majesty and the conspir
ators v.ill be so tightly hedged apart
that I do not apprehend any danger to
him; but I trust that you will not go
there, Spencer."
"As I have told you before. Paul, I
am not partial to being hunted," For
tescue replied; and "before Volborth
could press him for a more definite
statement of his intentions, ..he changed
the subject to his anxiety about Laura
"Metcalf. He had instructed an emi
nent firm of private detectives, to keep
an eye on Blalrgeldle, but he protested
that he wished he could be. as certain
that Laura would be as careful as he
should be himself. With , this and
much more on the same head he so
contrived to swamp the non-committal
answer as to his own intentions, that
Volborth. who was very sensitive at
any Insinuation of having . exposed
Laura to danger, hastened to -reassure
him. â¢ '
"I was aware of that," came Vol
borth's startling assertion, which, how
ever, he qualified somewhat by adding:
"At least, that was a natural deduc
tion from his occupation this after
noon. He came straight to you from a
half-hour's call upon Olga Palltzln at
their Number 4 Centre."
Fortescue had fl'in^ himself upon a
couch, but at thift be raised himself
upon his '!bow. ."That is not very' com
fortable hearing," he said, putting what
he could of fear" into .the gaze with
which he regarded " his informant.
"How long are. you going to subject me
to the sensation of belnjx hunted, Paul?
I was hugging myself with the notion
that they had not discovered my ad
dress'in Paris." "'., \ â¢
As soon as the aide-de-camp had gone
Fortescue retired Into his bedroom and
Inspected, without unfastening, the
parcel which he had received. It was
rather bulky, and tied with stout
string, the knots of which he noted with
satisfaction were"sealed. âThe , paper,
and general neatness of the package,
suggested a purchase from some high
class tradesman who was In the habit
of serving wealthy customers. After
measuring the parcel with his eye, For
tescue placed it in the. bottom drawer
of the chest and turned the key. There
was barely room for it.
"It will be safer there; for, if I â¢miss
take not, there will be sharp eyes about
directly," he said to himself. "That re
pentant youth is pretty certain to have
been shadowed from the Rue Casse-
Tete, and Volborth will be here hot
foot to learn the cause of his visit."
And in prompt confirmation of his
surmise, there came a tap at the outer
door; and using the same caution as be
fore, he admitted the chief agent, of the
section. He wore no disguise, and by
the gardenia in his button and jaunty
cane, looked for all the world as if he
had been idling away his afternoon on
the boulevards. Whereby he did him
self less than Justice, for that was far
from being the case.
"Dubrowskl has been hare?" he said,
after a brief salutation.
"Yes; sit down ar.d I will tell you
about it." replied Fortescue, adding
mentally: "I've got to dish you, Paulâ
for your own goodâ without lying to
you, and it will take me all my time."
But aloud he proceeded: "Our Boris
was Inquiring, about my movements to
morrow â whether he was likely to see
me at Versailles."

scene. You, who know the preclseness
with which his programmes are ad

"And you' yourselfâ shall you be pres

and her ganfetf" â
"I shall endeavor to be, but you must
not look for me with any . certainty,
since my position in the affair is unoffi

corner when something happened that
held him spell-bound. , Two tall forms
glided past, the shimmer of steel catch
ing his eye, and a moment later, as
they met Delaval, he heard the muffled
words In a rich Irish tongue â
"Traitor! That is for Boulogne."
And in another voiceâ
"And that for those whom you be
trayed at Antwerp." , . "
There followed a faint groan, and, un
able to contain himself, Fortescue
looked from his hiding-place and saw
his late pursuer limp and lifeless on the
pavement. The two men were return
ing on their own tracks, and Fortescue
would have drawn back, but perceiving
that he had been seen he waited in the
mouth of the entry not knowing what
to expect.
As the men came up the nearest
raised his hat and said
"We have saved you some inconveni
ence, sir, you will have noticed. It Is
not my business to be inquisitive about
his reasons, but that gentleman wanted
to give you what he has got himself.
Is it too much to expect that you will
repay us by abstaining from raising an
alarm?"
"I shall consider that I have seen
nothing, but I should advise you to
make yourselves scarce," replied For
tescue. "You have certainly relieved
me from a dilemmaâ not, I presume,
out of any affection to myself?"
' "We know nothing of you, sir, except
that any man who has incurred that
dead scoundrel's enmity is entitled to
our respect," replied the spokesman.
"This is the fruit of an unfortunate al
liance between purely Irish and Con
tinental politics. He preferred the in
terests of the wrong half, and betrayed
his .compatriots to the English police â
firstly, we believe, to save his own
skin; secondly, to further a plot by
which only aliens would benefit. You
have not witnessed a murder, sir,' but
an execution â by order of the Revolu
tionary Brotherhood."
Again he raised his hat theatrically,
and taking his companion's arm flitted
away into the gloom of the opposite by
street. Fortescue also made haste to
quit the dangerous neighborhood of the
heap on the pavement..
"What queer beggars these Fenians
are," he reflected as he presently turned
into the Rue Montmartre. "He. didn't
want me to split, but in case^I did he'
couldn't resist throwing in that adver
tisement of the 'I. R. B.' Well, this
shows that Melton's theory as to the
giving away of that cheap lot at
Boulogne and Antwerp was tolerably
accurate. And what is more to the
point, it leaves me one less to deal with
to-morrow."
It is unnecessary to describe the. tur
moil of Gallic Â¦ hysteria and interna
tional sentiment that marked the visit
? of the Tsar and Tsarina to the Theatre
Francals on the night of October the
7th. The only part of the performance
. with which "we have to do is the point
when Mounet-Sully was gesticulating
wildly on the stage in front of the red
cloaked artists grouped around the
busts of Mollere, Racine and Corneille.
When the ecstacy of the. audience had
been raised to fever heat by the bare
faced adulations of, the odel which the
rhymester was .-hurling: at the Russian
monarch8. Fortescue slipped from his
fauteuil and made his way round to
the lobby at the back of the grand-tier
boxes. There he -found lima Vassili
awaiting him. >

box. Â¦ '..-_ Â¦

.'"Then go^od-night. Mademoiselle Vas
sili, and may to-morrow bring luck,"
said Fortescue, bowing low, for the
benefit of- the. few spectators .of their
meeting, as he left her to return to his"
sej/t.
He remained till the close of the per
formance, seeing nothing or Volborth,
either in the private bo?: ds "allotted to
the imperial suite or among the obvi
ous mouchards â Russian and French â .
who thronged the lobbies and corridors.
But In the portico, as he was* leaving
the theater with two attaches of the
Embassy, he was touched on the arm
and some one thrust a crumpled paper
into his hand. It bore the words:
"Take care. We have lost track of
Delaval."
On reading this he smiled a rather
ugly smile for a mild-mannered man,
and Immediately excused himself from
further accompanying his companions.
"So! my friend Volborth," he mut
tered, as he turned his steps toward the
telegraph office. "I am not sorry that
to-night. of all nights you should be
taught that you are not infallible. But
I must warn the detectives at Blalr
geldie In case the 'Yank,' as Laura
calls him, has doubled back in that di
rection."
The contingency made him self-con
centrated, and it was not till he had
walked several blocks that he remem
bered the necessity of paying attention
to his own surroundings. Almost sim
ultaneously was borne in upon him the
consciousness that he was being fol
lowed, and turning his head, without
slackening his pace, he perceived that
his visit to the telegraph office was not
an Immediate necessity. "A convenient
lamp shot its rays full on the face of
the man. behind, and showed the broad,
pretentiously genial features of Delaval
himself. -
. The - street through which - Fortescue
was taking a short cut was a quiet one,
leading to still quieter byways, in
which he anticipated that the attack
â¢would be made. As he walked on with
seeming carelessness he formed | his
plan and proceeded to put It in prac
tice by turning the next corner, and
diving into the first dark entry he came
to. Therehe would wait, he told him
self, till, his pursuer had passed, when
he would slip out, while Delaval was
halting . in perplexity, and make the
best of his way back to the glare of the
boulevards, where it would be easy to
lose himself in the crowd.
Twenty, forty, sixty seconds sped by,
and pld-pad round the corner came De
laval, Â¦ brushing so close to his in
tended victim that the fumes of his
whisky-laden breath were distinctly
noticeable. He .went on a dozen -paces,
then.' paused , In . doubV and began [ to
come slowly .back, peering in to entries,
and' stopping at every -step tojisten.
Fortescue saw that the time was
come for beating a retreat, and he was
on the point of making a" 1 dash for the
England, W we : need* not. discuss it
further.".' s . Â¦'"Â¦ -'.-' 'Â¦'Â¦'}
The topic was not congenial 'to Vol
borth, and with a renewal of his warn
ing he rose to go. Fortescue made no
attempt to detain him, excusing the
alacrity with which he went to open
the door by the announcement that
they would probably meet later, as he
was. going to dine at the British Em
bassy, in order to accompany the staff
to the gala performance at the Theatre
Francals. " 'VJ- -.,-,
"I have a mesage for Mademoiselle
Vassili from Miss Metcalfâ no treason,
only a girl's message; and it will be'an
opportunity of delivering? it," he ex
plained.
"I am glad that I ain not your moth
er; though you ought.to be safe enough
with the Embassy follc." said Volborth.
"Inside the theater there is no possi
bility of risk, but watch yourself on
the way home."
When he was gone Fortescue threw
himself into a chair, and Indulged in a
hearty laugh.
"For sheer, cold-blooded squandering
of the average man in the interests of a
cause, commend me to the Russian po
lice system," he sa&i to himself. "Here
is this fellov.-. who I really believe has
as much affection for me as he can feel
for anything/quite aware of my, peril,
yet he wont lift a finger to abate it, be
cause, forfoo'h, it would entail a breach
of his methods."
He sat still for sofcne minutes, think
ing- deeply; > and then as he rose to
change into evening dress, he added:
"At least, I have not lied to him. I
think that any impartial Englishman
would allojv that my end Justified my
means."' â¢ â¢ . - * .'._.-
Casse-Tete with the news of Delaval's
death. At the same time Volborth had
been apprised that the man who had
eluded espionage on the previous night
was lying cold and stark and unclaimed
on the marble slab.
It soon became evident that the loss
of their comrade was not to altar the
plans of the Nihilists for the day. In
deed, such signs of activity became ap
parent that Volborth, in making the*
usual division of his forces, decided to
attach himself to the wing that was to
keep in touch with the enemy, leaving
to Restofskl the command of those
who were to hem in the Tsar. Keen as
ever, not only to protect life, but to
preserve the Empress from the horror
of an attempt, he could not but be
specially anxious on the last public ap
pearance of his Imperial charges in the
neighborhood of a populous center. If
that day passed off quietly he promised
himself an easy task at sleepy Darm
stadt, and then, hey for the sweets of
victory! It made him impatient to think
of itâ of the scene which he pictured of
Restofski's grip fastening on Olga Pa
litzin's white arm as soon as the Tsar
was safe on his way to Holy Russia
once more.
Some such thought was in his mind

quality, since the first was published In

WILLIAM had said he would
come at 2:30 sharp. The
races at the Country Club
course began at 3, and It
would take a good half -hour to make
the drive.
Beatrice Hans.com, fidgeting Impa
tiently on the broad veranda, glanced
at the clock on the tower of St. Mark's.
It was 3:30. An hour late already! It
was so like William! It would be haz
ardous to speculate when he might ar
rive now. Ve,ry probably the unimpor
tant fact that he was to drive her out
to the races had quite slipped his mind,
for William's memory was of a decid
edly uncertain variety, as Beatrice
knew from countless precedent cases.
She would wait no longer. She would
go over to the links and take it out of
one of the caddies. Some one must feel
as out of sorts as did she. She rose
angrily, and as she did so there was a
great clatter of hoofs on the winding
driveway. A pair of cobs, pulling a
smart trap, were drawn up before the
stoop, and William, very shame-faced
and apologetic, sprang from the seat.
"Oh, I say," he began.
"Well, what have you to say?" said
Beatrice, turning on him wrathfully.
"Whatever it is, it should have been
said before 3:50."
William coughed in embarrassment.
"We haven't any time to losÂ«." he
urged.. "Jump In and I'll try to explain
on the way out."
"Out where?" she said coldly.
"Why, out to the track, of course,"
said he.
"No, thanks," said Beatrice. "The
last few races are always tame af
fairs. I'm not going.**
â¢ "Not going?" he questioned In dis
may. "You saidâ"
"I said at half-past two," she re
minded him.
William stared at her blankly. Then
his face brightened.
"May *I stay here with you then?"
he asked.
"I was just starting for the links,"
said she. â¢
"But you'll let me explain, -won't
you?"
Beatrice shrugged her shoulders.
"If it won't take too long," she said.
William hitched the cobs and came
up the veranda steps.
"Look here," he said contritely, "I'm
horribly sorry about this, butâ butâ "
I "But you forgot, as usual," said Be
atrice.
"Well," he Bald, "Barrows and Mor
ton came in to talk up that lumber
deal-"
"Just say you forgot," said -Beatrice
wearily. A "It's the on'.y explanation."
"I did remember It, though, at three,"
he said hopefully.
"So like you to shut the stable door
after the horse has gone." she said
savagely.
William locked pained. He said noth
ing..
"If this were the first offense I might
overlook it," continued the girl. "But

every five. The exact number of times

WHEN Herbert Bascom's effects
were moved into the Holbein
studios the other occupants
gathered in the front win
dows and Jeered openly. Bas
com, whose hearing was singularly
acute, caught the comments as far up
&m the third floor.
The only trouble with Bascom's ef
fects was that they were new â distress
ingly new. From the oilcloth for the
tiny kitchen to the Persian rugs and
Turkish hangings, they all came from
flrst-hend etores. The Hdbeinites
were unaccustomed to such extrava
gances. They had bought second-hand
things when they had first set up, and
thereby had acquired merit in the eyes
of those already established. It was
unbobemian, as Tolliver expresed it, to
have glaring new furniture and things
In one's studio. It argued the posses-
Bion of unseemly quantities of money
and email artistic merit. From the
moment that the first delivery wagon
backed up to the door Baecom lost his
surname, bo far as his fellows were
concerned, and gained the title of The
.Aristocrat. It was Tolliver's nlck
"name, but it spread rapidly, and no
French Communist ever hated the name
more than the Holbeinites. . .
As soon as the place had been set
tled Bascom went around one morning
delivering invitations for a studio tea
that afternoon. There were many
moved to accept the invitation, for the
delivery wagon of a leading grocery
Jmd unloaded much that looked attract
ive that morning.
But Tolliver made a personal canvass
and when Baecom hurried home that
afternoon, laden with additional pack
ages, he was met by a neat pile of re
grets carefully pinned upon his door.
As a result of Tolliver's activity it had
been decided to snub this aristocrat
who sousrht by means of the tea to
flaunt his rich possessions before th'ir
Â«yes. It was unboh^mian, and whliÂ«r
â¢ bis presence had to be tolerated, friend
ship and fellowship should be withheld.'
Bascom was no fool. He readily per
ceived why he was being snubbed an<l
quietly accepted the situation. He nod
ded friendly to the men when he mÂ»t
them In the halls and gravely removed
his hat when he passed the women.
For the rest he went to work and
found in this an absorption which did
not permit him to worry about the at
titude of his neighbors. He missed
their companionship, but he had letters
In plenty. Since the artistic colony re
fused to recognize him he devoted him
eelf to his society engagements when
tin-.e permitted, thereby bringing forth
.additional comment as to the gorgeous
nps-s of his garments.
Then came Miss Alice CaswelL She
was but a decorator of china, but her
effects v.ere pitifully meager and she
was at once accepted by the rest of thÂ»
inhabitants as a Bohemian.
She wes a bright, brisk, even tem
pered girl, and before the week was out
eh* had made friends even with the
Janitor, a feat hitherto supposed to be
impossible. She had the studio across
the hall from Bascom, and before ehe
had learned of his isolation had already
formed a friendship with him. She had
reeded pome material which she did
not heve time to go out for. and he had
peneroufly supplied her wants. -She

Bascom's Aristocracy
By Jasper Collingwood
A few weeks later she had a birthday
party. Early in the morning the occu
pants of the other studios began to ar
rive, each with some little token and
the invariable inquiry as to whether
Bascom had been invited to the evening:
festivities. It seemed odd to her that
they should be bo interested in his pos
sible appearance, but she readily an
swered that he would. No objection
being offered she personally rounded up
Eascom when the time of the party ar
rived and got him across the hall on
the plea that she needed help in the
preparation of the Bupper. â¢
Bascom had interposed many objec
tions when she had invited him. but
6he had pleaded with him and on her
assurance that the attitude of the oth
ers had materially changed he decided
to risk It because she wanted it.
She never realized that the abate
ment of the crltlclBm was because she
was openly his champion and the rest
had decided to respect her "delusion."
as .they termed It. She was so happy
getting the spread ready that she never
noticed the clock- until all of the prepa
rations had been made.
''Why. it's 3," she said wonderinslv.
"I asked them to come In about 8. I'll
take a little run down the hall and re
mind some of them."
Bascom sank into the easy chair In
front of the cannel coal fire. Cannel
coal was a luxury in the Holbein flats,
but he had sent two scuttlefuls that
morning in honor of the event. Alice
ran down the hall to Tolliver's door.
There, pinned to a panel, was the sign,
"Gone to the theater." She retraced
her steps to the stairway. On every
door was some card giving notice that
the owner had (rone out. She descended
to the lower floors, apparently not a

tiny figure that darted in and sank
sobbing upon the home-made cozy cor
ner.
It took small questioning to get at
the trouble. The cause he already
knew. The form the opposition had
taken was 8 11 he needed to ask.
"I vouldn't have minded so much,"
she sobbed, "only I did so want them
to . meet you and see how .' nice you
really were."
"Did you get It all up for rap," he
demanded eagerly.
Fhe nodded. "That Isn't the worst of

By the time the other dwellers in the
Studio building had thought to warn
her of the intruder in their colony the
intruder had become her mentor, and
she grieved greatly as one after an
other the rest of the artists let slip
some caustic fling.
"But he is a really clever man," she
assured Tolliver one day as he sat
perched in the window seat declaiming
against the aristocrat. "I assure you
that his paintings are very much above
the average."
Tolliver snorted contemptuously. "My
dear child." he remarked patronizingly.
"You do some very clever china work.
Don't try to get beyond it and set up
ns a critic. There never was a man
came into this place with new furni
ture. He can't be an artist." Then the
conversation dropped. There was no
arguing with Tolliver when he called
one "dear child."

ing!"
SU11 William said nothing. Ha
looked across the trim lawn with Its
winding driveway and Its flourishing
shrubs.
"And so. hereafter," she went on.
"you need make no appointments with
me."
"You don't mean " he began In
expostulation.
"I do mean just that," said she.
"This is about the last straw. I don't
Intend to be subjected to such heed
less annoyance again."
"You won't go anywhere with ma?"
he asked.
"I shall make no appointments to
go anywhere with you. If we go. It
will be on the spur of the moment;
and even then I shall not be surprised
If your treacherous memory allows me
to come home alone, as I did the day
of the river carnival."
William thought deeply for a mo
ment.
"Perhaps you're right," he said at
length. "I haven't fully realized until
now what I have Inflicted upon you.
I'll stay away as much as possible
until I can educate my memory Into
something like normal condition. 1
won't bother you any longer now â
you said you were going over to thÂ«
links. I believe. I'm really more sor
ry about all this than I can make you
understand. Good-by."
He ran down the steps, and a mo
ment later the cobs whirled down the
driveway In a cloud of dust.
Beatrice sat on the veranda lost In
thought. She knew she had hurt him
deeply. But, he deserved it. she told
herself grimly. Still, she was rather
sorry she had been so disagreeable
about It; he was so bis and good
natured, and so absurdly helpless.
She was roused by the clatter of
hoofs on the driveway. The cobs
were again pulled up before her, and
William ran up the steps.
"See here, Beatrice," he said, hur
riedly, "I came here this afternoon with
a firm determination to tell you some
thing important, but in the confusion
of being late and el> that, you knowâ'*
"You forgot it, of course/' she
laughed.
At the sound of her laughter William
was evidently relieved.
"Exactly," he said. "I meant to tell
you that the deal in Lakeside real es
tate has been closed and that I've made
a tidy bit out of it. I meant to ask you
âhang it! It sounds cold-blooded, but
I don't mean It so â if you'd marry me."
The girl gasped. She looked at him
steadily for several moments.
"Oh, Â¦\V:*,liam. William, you Incorrigi
ble man!" she said.
"Will you?" said he eagerly. "Marry
me, you know?"
She laughed nervously.
"You'd forget," she declared, "and
marry some one else within a month."
"I know I've no right to ask you," he
said, humbly.
Beatrice was absorbed In a bit of try
she was assiduously picking to bits.
"Still," she said, "you do need a guar
dianâso Derhtips I'll rlÂ»k it."

papa meant well, but he's old and. well
âI hated him. So I just determined to
run away."
Young Wilton was staring at the girl
In silent amazement. "Why." he stam
mered, "why. when did your father
change his mind? When did he tell
you that you must marry that man,
that Mr. Glade?"
"Papa never told me whom I was to
marry. He said 'Never mind* when I
tried to. question him, but I know that
it was to be Mr. Glade. I know, be
cause he always looks at me so funny,
and then he >vas invited to breakfast,
and to lunch, and to dinner to-day.
Anyway, who else could it possibly be?
No one el3e would marry Just poor,
plain me!" â¢
For a moment Harry Wilton was
silent, then drawing a step nearer he
looked down into his companion's face.
"Mr. Glade was not to be your hus
band. I was to be the man."
"You?"
"Yes, but when the time came I
couldn't do it. I felt that I. was being
fcrced upon you, and, well. I Just de
cided to leave you In peace and go
away!"
"You?" Eloise repeated. "Why, I
never thought that you cared about
rael"
"Yes, I cared so much that I could
not bear to hurt you. I supposed, cf
course, your father told you."
"No," Eloise fingered her boa nerv
ously. "No, if he had perhaps I might
haveâ"
"Yes," Harry drew closer to the girl's
side.
Her cheeks were flushed and sho
dared not raise her eyes to the young
man's face, for she knew that he was
looking at her. When she again spoks
her voice trembled.
"What are weâ that isâ I mean, what
are you â ?" But Eloise did not finish
her speech. Her voice suddenly failed,
and she hid her face in her muff.
"Going away, did you say? Why, I
understood that youâ youâ were to be
married thl3 evening. Why dosen't
yourâ your huaband buy the ticket?"
Eloise flushed scarlet. She turned
her face away and looked across the
room, then out into the train-shed,
where bells were ringing, smoke puff
ing and whistles screaming. Mr Wil
ton was waiting for her answer. When
she again turned her face toward him,
Harry saw that her eyes were filled
with tears.
"I couldn't do It," she whispered.
"I couldn't marry that horrid little Mr.
Glade. Perhaps he is nice. Perhaps
Eloise Thickerton looked around the
waiting room of the depot, a fright
ened expression in her large, gray
eyes. She held her muff tightly in both
hands and watched the people coming
from and going to the ticket windows.
Eloise had not fully made up her mind
Just where she wanted to go.
When Harry Wilton, carrying his
satchel, came into the waiting-room,
the first person he saw was Eloise
Thickerton. The young man looked
at her in amazement, then he slowly
drew out his watch: it was eight
o'c?ock. Of course, she must be look
ing for himself. Poor girl, the idea of
being deserted was intolerable to her.
Walking quickly across to Eloise's side,
Harry touched her lightly upon the
arm. The girl gave a little, startled
cry.
"Oh, Mr. Milton, I'm so nervous.
Iâ Iâ really am so glad to see you. I
want you to buy me a ticket, will
you?"
Harry was bewildered.
"Thickerton," he cried when he had
gained control of his voice, "my son
has gone!"
Franklin Thickerton looked at the
Judge as though he had never before
seen him. "So has my daughter!"
When Eloise's father had read this
note he seated himself before his desk
and for fully ten minutes opened and
closed the drawers in rapid succession.
He seemed to be searching for some
thingâperhaps Eloise. At this mo
ment the door swung open and Judge
Wilton hurried into the room, his face
pale, ' his hands working with ex
citement.
This note Informed the lawyer that
his daughter would not be married that
night. She had gone away and would
never again trouble her father's busi
ness arrangements. She expressed the
hope that he would be successful with
his Russian business transaction, then
she bade him good-by.
not returned and the housekeeper â¢ had
found a note in her room addressed to
Mr. Thickerton;
(Copyright, 1904. by S. L. Tinsley.)
TO-MORROW then at the lat
est, but it would be worth
a thousand dollars more to
you if you could leave on the
midnight train."
Mr. Factore took up the roll of pa
pers and started toward the door.
"If you change your mind so that
you can manage to leave to-night,
why call me up, will you?"
Mr. Franklin Thickerton. who was
opening and closing the drawers of
his desk, turned around hastily.
"Yes, yes. I'll see, my boy, I'll see!**
Pierce Factore nodded his head, and
vu about to leave the room when
Mr. Thickerton whirled around sud
denly in his chair, with an expression
of dismay upon his thin, smooth face.
"Eloise! what will I do with
Eloise?"
Pierce Factore uttered an exclama
tion of impatience.
"Marry her to some one!" exclaimed
Factore in exasperation, hardly know-
Ing what he was saying. To his amaze
ment Mr. Thickerton seized upon his
Idea with delight.
"By George, the very thing! Glad
you thought of it. I'll attend to it at
once. Perhaps, after all. I'll be able
to leave on the midnight express."
Then, "whirling his chair around. Mr.
Thickerton applied himself to work.
Having finished his letters, Mr.
Thickerton hurriedly rang the bell and
then impatiently awaited the arrival
of his daughter. Eloise. Eloise Thick
erton was a tall, slim girl, with a pale
face, large gTay eyes, and short, curly,
light-brown hair. When she entered
the room in answer to her father's
summons she looked about her with a
frightened expression. A summons
from papa meant something extra.
Mr. Thickerton was always too busy
to cay more than good morning or good
night to his daughter. When Eloise
.had closed the door, her father began
speaking.
"My d*ar. I must leave at once for
Russia on business. I may be gone
months, and I may be gone years."
Eloise grasped her father's arm in
surprise.
"Papa!" ehe exclaimed.
"Yes, I must go at once. This deal
means much money for me. Therefore,
I have sent for you to yell you that
you are to be married at once; thia
evening by 8 o'clock at the latest. That
is all, my dear. You run away, I ana
busy, very busy!"
Poor Eloise! The room swam before
her eyes. She sank into a chair, be
cause she could not trust herself to
stand.
"Papa, dear; dear papa, what do you
mran?"
Her voice was so pitiful, that even
her busy father found time to turn
amund and look at her.
"There, there, my dear, don't fret; it
wll! soon all be over."
Eloise shuddered. "Papa, dear, you
don't mtan it, do you? You're just
teasing me, aren't you?"
She clasped her hands. He did not
look at her. but shook his head and
drummed nervously upon the desk.
"There, there, my dear, run away
now and don't bother me. I am very
busy; but remember, be ready by 8."
Eloise waJked sadly toward the
door. Then she hesitated, and looked
back timidly at her father.
"Whom am I going to marry,
papa?"
Franklin Thickerton did not under
stand his daughter's question, and he
was too busy to ask her to repeat it.
So he answered absently: "Never
mind, my dear, never mind!"
Eloise silently left the room.
One hour later, Franklin Thickerton
was sitting in Judge Walton's office.
The Judge listened while Mr. Thick
erton talked. The conversation con
cerned Judge Walton's son.
"You have always favored a mar
riage between Eloise ana Harry. As
I start for Russia to-night, and
have no one with whom I could leave
my daughter, why not let us have the
marriage performed this evening.
What def you say?"
The lawyer looked at the Judge.
"What does Eloise say?" replied the
Judge.
"She will do what I say!"
"Very well, Harry shall be on hand
at eight o'clock to-night."
The two men Fhook hands, and Law
yer Thickerton hurried away to make
the final arrangements for his
journey.
.At a quarter before eight o'clock the
Thickerton household was in a state
of excitement. Eloisc was missing.
The housekeeper was weeping in the
sitting-room. The lawyer had looked
himself in the library. The servants
â¢were huddled together whispering in
the kitchen.
Eloise had left the house an hour
before and her father had expected her
to return in a few momenta. She had

THE SAN * FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.

THE INTERRUPTED FLIGHTPhillips is a writer of affairs. His
"Master Rogue" and "Golden Fleece"
showed the broad, hurried current of
modern life; the muddied, cloudy cur
rent is his province. In his last story
he has gone down deeper into this
turgid flood, followed it to its sources.
Not only does he trace the flow from
its Inception down through the tortuous
channels of present day circumstance
and opportunity, but he makes an
analysis, almost chemical in its com
pleteness, of the mud and the silt which
darkens and soils the surface of the
stream. Money, what It does for its
possessor; power, what an influence for
good and for evil it swings; the vanity
of society, what a hollowness and a
mockery its tinsel enfoldsâ these are
the materials out. of which Phillips
molds "The Cost." The materials . are
not new; they have been . used time
and time again by other hands. "The
Honorable Peter Sterling," "The Octo
pus" and "The Pit," "The Thirteenth
District," Gertrude Atherton's latest;
"Rulers of Kings"â all of these stories
of recent years have been bullded on
the same themes, yet Phillips has
evolved something new and vitally
alive from this well handled lumber.
PHILLIPS HAS
Triumph in "The Cost."
DAVID GRAHAM PHILLIPS,
whose rise as a novelist has been
accomplished with the rapidity
characteristic of the'present day swing
of fiction and fiction makers, has put
the capstone on his recently erected
pedestal with his latest story, "The
Cost." Have there been any doubts of
his powers up to now they must assur
edly waver before the direct assault of
this remarkably compelling novel. A
story such as "The Cost" raises itself
head and shoulders above the zone of
commonalty and stands out > pre-emi
nent among the fruits of a year's wide
writing.

White's latest story narrates the in

there is the unceasing battling with
the grim forces of nature â a struggle
that assumes' the proportions of . the
heroic under the skillful pen of White.
Strong, remarkably intense, is this nar
rutlve of almost superhuman struggle.
The early part of White's story,
wherein is pictured the stretches of
green woods and shimmering waters,
has all the rare freshness of the wood
land that makes the author's other
stories of the trail so redolent of the
large free spirit of the great wilder
ness. Following the two woodsmen,
Sam Bolton and Dick Herron, up wind
ing water | courses, over portages and
through g piney thickets, the reader
catches the sound of the white water
and scents the musky odor of the
spruce needles with a startling vivid
ness.
Then when the trail of Jingoss leads
Into the heart of winter's fastness there
is pictured a grim and terrible panor
ama of desolation and of the naked,
primordial play of nature's forces, bru
tally overwhelming. White's narrative
rises here to a" tragic pitch, which fol
lows beat for beat the terrific swing
of, the winter cruelty that strikes its
way into the reader's very marrow.
The . strange love story which
threads its. way through the talÂ« offers
itself as a good ensample of the au
thor's restraint In the handling . of
something that .might prove a fatal
weakness. Indian girls who have a
love for, white men have been features

for ,: a deal | of sickly sentimentality ;
White's girl, May-May-Gwan, is, as

the legend of the, Holy Grail, is, with
Sargent'.s companion study, "The

markably artistic series of allegorical
panels, the one with its Incarnate mys

ideal of man's spiritual existence, have
an importance In the world of art that

Sylvester Baxter, an authority upon art
criticism, has written* an interpreta

the title "Edwin A. Abbey's Conception
of the Holy Grail."
An interesting fact' concerning Ab
bey's scheme for the delineation of the
grail cycle, which Baxter gives promi
nence at the outset of his book, is that
the artist's decision concerning the sub
ject of his frieze came quite unexpect
edly. Intending to create a series of
panels whose scheme should be the
sources of ', modern literature, just as
Sargent had depicted the sources of
modern. religion, Abbey began to make
researches preparatory' to working out
his conception when the all-pervading
influence of the grail legend In early
literature caught his immediate atten

this relation is that the story of a

English publisher as unlikely to appeal
to his public, because it was so Ameri

studied their subject sympathetically;
they have gone to the spot to search
for the soul of Japan, and seem to love
auch glimpses of the elusive thing as

Japanese women, we are told, have
no legal rights; they cannot obtain a
divorce, no matter how bad their hus
bands, may behave. It is Intimated
that the ladies live as if they accepted
as sacred truth that which is written
in '"The Greater Learning of Women" :
"A -woman shoulJ lock ~ her hus
band as if he were Heaven itself, and
thus escape celestial punishment."
About these wonderful little ladies we
are informed that so shy and intensely
reserved are they to men who are not
of their race that occidental men know
them not except most vaguely. It is
intimated that even the better of the
geishas, the highly trained entertain
ers, "the life and soul of Japan," as
the writer calls them, are not for bar
barian occidental investigation.
A curious item in the accounts of
manners and customs is the habit of
carrying from household to household
what is called "the honorable live fish,"
in tubs of water. Each housewife in
turn orders a slice cut off the honorabk
live fish, and then the unfortunate fish
is chucked back In the tub to keep his
remainder fresh until another house
wife wants another slice. We wonder,
upon hearing this, what kind of cruel
soldiers the^e unmerciful mothers
would breed. Surely it would be ter
rible for the Cossack to be caught in
the clutches of the sons of such mothers
and they happened to take a notion
to deal with them as if they were no
better than honorable live fish.
All in all, it is an interesting hour
the book gives in telling of this em

THE Japanese naval men have
never been in the habit of invit

target practice aboard their war
ships, but it was the writer's luck to
witness by accident a realistic exhi
bition of Japanese skill at gunnery..
This v.as shortly after the Spanish-
American war. The . American troop
transport of which I was then a petty
officer was lying in the naval dry
dock at Nagasaki. This kept us there
a long time, and our captain had be
come intimately acquainted with vari
ous Annapolis trained officers on the
Japanese battleship Yashima, also In
port.
One morning I was sent aboard the
Yeshima with a message to one of her
officers from our captain. When I had
delivered it the Japanese officer said:
"It's Impossible for me to send my
answer just now. We are going out
side the harbor for a couple of hours'
target practice. If you have the time
to spare, you may stay aboard till we
come In again."
The Invitation was accepted. The
officer left me alone in a chartroom
on. an upper deck, while he hurried off
to his duties.. >^
From the big yellow funnels of the
battleship huge banks of smoke tum
bled up, rolling over the green hills
that surround the harbor. The cap
tain and his staff stood on the main
bridge. There was a simplicity in their
neat blue and white uniforms that
made it difficult to distinguish their
ranks, nor was there that pompous
ness of manner in them peculiar to
many European naval officers. " One
little chap came into the chartroom
for something and bowed very polite
ly. I took him to ' be a wardroom
steward until afterward he turned
out to be the navigating officer.
A bell clanged faintly somewhere
down in the bowels of the 6hip. They
had been weighing anchor. : but :so
noiselessly that I had failed to be
aware of it. Shrill whistles came from
various parts of the. ship, and groups
of men moved about the decks with
automatic regularity. Sentries with
muskets sprang up in unexpected
spots as though they were shoved up
they gave that muffled cheer, or again
their oblique eyebrows became xnors
oblique still and the corners of their
mouths went down.
Again the target swung ahead, and
again came the thunderous roar of the
smaller quick firing guns. The white
wings of the target almost disappeared
In a boiling circle of milky foam. In
stinctively my hands went up and cov
ered my ears; the atmosphere seemed
to crystallize and break up Into pow
dered bits. A big gun In some for'd
turret interpolated its gigantic roar
at regular intervals that set the big
ehlp trembling.
We were coming closer to the tar
get now, and the firing increased.
Slowly we passed it. Those gun crews
not engaged in flrins stood stolidly by
their guns, staring fixedly at the tar
get. Their t-xcitement had passed â
their faces were as expressionless as
that of the average Chinaman when
he overcharges for the wash.
Again the engines began throbbing
and the green hills about the harbor
mouth rose on both bows. In >*Â»if
an hour the Yashima's anchor cable
was rattling out.

tr. The small, black mustache of the
lieutenant went upward as he jotted
down some figures on his pad.
The first shot' evidently made the
gunner overconfident. The four suc
ceeding shots were comparatively poor.
Not a word was spoken, but the gun
crew scowled.
There came an interval In the firing.
The target swung ahead. Then a small
gun up In the foretop began sputtering
nervously, the reports rolling above us
like thunder. A" tne officers on the
bridge were gazing intently at the tar
get through binoculars. A circle of
angry white foam appeared about It.
The ship's course was describing a
huge figure eight. As the target
swung around on the other beam an
other six-inch gun on that side opened
fire. > After each firing the men slipped
back the breech lock, pulled out the
empty brass shell and slipped In a load
ed one with the regularity of automa
tons. There was not a trace of their
repressed excitement in their move
ments. Only their faces showed the
keen rivalry between the men who
manned the different guns. Sometimes
"He! Mahomet All?"
"I ordered him to say nothing. I had
a score to settle with you. But we

"Yes. sir; I did what I could."
"What did you do?"

"He said nothing."
"What was he like?"
"A tall man. sir. Rather a desperata

"Any way by which we could ldantlfy
him?"
"A long, black beard, sir. Gray eyÂ«a.
And a nervous way of twitching his

. "Well, Captain Joyce." said the gen

"Yes, sir." /
"I have no doubt that your colonel }
will be glad to see you fulfilling your,

Hilary Joyce's heart waa too heavy
for words. He was silent.
"I will let you know my final decision
to-morrow morning."
Joyce saluted and turned upon his
heel.
"You can sleep upon that, you beau
ty, and a good night's rest may It give
you."
Joyce turned in bewilderment. Where
had those words been used before?
Who was It who had used them?
The general was standing erect. Both
he and the Chief of the Intelligence
were laughing. Joyoe stared at the
tall figure, the erect bearing, the In
scrutable gray ayes.
"Good Lord!" he gasped.
"Well. well. Captain Joyce, we a#e
quits!" said the general, holding out
his hand. You gave me a bad ten min

horseshoe of yours. I've done as moan

"But, sir; but f"
"No, sir."
"Yes, sir, and your own best riding
camel as well. There is a slit cut in
the tent, and he got away unseen In
the early morning."
The Bimbashi acted with all energy.
Cavalry rode along every track; scouts
examined the soft sand of the wadys
for signs of the fugitive, but no trace
was discovered. The man had utterly
disappeared. With a heavy heart Hil
ary Joyce wrote an official report of
the matter and forwarded it to As
souan. Five days later there- cam* a
curt order from the chief that hÂ»
should report himself there. He feared
the worst from the stern soldier, who
spared others as little as he spared
himself.
" And his worst forebodings were real
ized. Travel-stained and weary he re
ported himself one night at the cen
tral's quarters. Behind a table piled
with papers and strewn with maps tn*
famous BOldler and his Chief of In
telligence were deep In plans and
flgure3. Their greeting was a cold ona,
"I understand, Captain Joyce," said
the general, "that you have allowed a
very important prisoner to slip through
your fingers."
"I am sorry, sir."
"No doubt. But that will not mend
matters. Did you ascertain anythinj
about him before you lost him?"
"Gone?"
clusion it would be to tEe incident! He
lay upon his angareeb still debating it
when the question suddenly and effect
ively settled itself. All Mahomet
rushed Into his tent
"Sir," he cried, "the prisoner U
gone!"
"Well, you can sleep upon it, yon
beauty, and a good, night's rest may it
give you!" ; V
He adjqurned the court, and the pris
oner, as imperturable as ever, was led
away by the guard to his supper of
rice and water.
Hilary Joyce was a kind-hearted man
and his own sleep was considerably
disturbed by the prospect of the pun
ishment which he must inflict next day.
He had hopes that the mere sight of
the koorbash and the thongs might
prevail over his prisoner's obstinacy.
And then, again, he 'thought how
shocking it would be if the man proved
to be really dumb after all. The pos
sibility shook him so that he had al
most determined by daybreak that he
-would send the stranger on unhurt to
Assouan. And yet what a tame con-
"Tell them to undo the man's gaJa
beeah. Order them to put a horseshoe
In the fire and make it red-hot."
The prisoner watched the proceedings
â¢with an air which had more of amuse
ment than uneasiness. He never
winded as the black sergeant ap
proached with the glowing shoe held
upon two bayonets.
"Will you speak now? asked the
Bimbashi. savagely."
The prisoner smiled gently and
stroked his beard.
"Oh, chuck the Infernal thing away!"
cried Joyce, Jumping up in a passion.
"There's no use trying to bluff .the fel
low. He knows we won't do it. But I
can and I will flog him, and you tell
him from me that If he hasn't fond his
tongue by to-morrow morning I'll take
the skin off his back as sure as my
name's Joyce. Have you said all that?"
"Yes. sir."
"Perhaps," said he, " if the Bim
bashi thought fit"â 1 - He looked at the
prisoner and then at the burning wood.
"No. no, It wouldn't do. No, by Jove,
that's going too far." -
"A very little might do It."
"No, no. It's all very well here, but
it would sound Just awful if ever It got
as far as Fleet street. But. I say." he
whispered, "we might frighten him a
bit. There's no harm in that."
"No. sir." /
-"He has come far, sir. A trotting
camel does not die easily. He has
come from Dongola, at least.'
"Well, we must get him to talk."
"It Is possible that he is deaf and
dumb."
"Not be. I never saw a man look
more all there In my life."
"You might send him across to As
souan."
"And give some one else the credit?
No, thank you. This is my bird. But
how are we going to get him to flnd his
tongue?"
The Egyptian's dark eyes skirted the
encampment and rested on the cook's
"No clew of any kind?"
"Look here, Mahomet All, we've got
to get some sense out of this fellow.
You say there are no papers on him?"
"No, sir; we found no papers."
"Well, I'm blessed!" cried Hilary
Joyce. "Of all the Impudent scoun
drels! He keeps on twinking at me.
Who are you, you rascal? Give an ac
count of yourself! D'ye hear?"
But the tall Arab was as Impervious
to English as to Arabic. The Egyptian

eyes and occasionally twitched his face
at him, but never opened his mouth.
The Bimbashi scratched his head In
bewilderment.

as it was, he had a rare chance of Im
pressing the authorities. He would
love to show his capacity to the head
of the Intelligence, arid even more to
that grim chief, who never forgot
what was smart, or forgave what was
slack. The prisoner's dress and bear
ing showed that he was of Importance.
Mean men do not ride pure bred trot

with cold water, drank a cup of strong
coffee, put on an Imposing official tar
boosh Instead of his sun helmet and
formed himself Into a court of inquiry
and judgment under the acacia tree.
He would have liked his people to
have seen him now, with his two black
orderlies in waiting, and his Egyptian
native officer at his side. He sat behind
a camp table, and the prisoner, strongly
guarded, was led up to him. The man
was a handsome fellow, with cold gray
eyes and a long: black beard.
"Why." cried Joyce, "the rascal Is
making faces at me."
A curious contraction had passed
over the man's features, but so swiftly
that it might have been a nervous
twitch. He was now a model of Ori
ental gravity.
"Ask him who he is and what he
wants."

pace. However, ever, two and a half
mil^s an hour mount up In time, and
at last, on the third evening, from the
blacken slarr-heap of a A ni1I which is
called the Jtbel Kurkur, Hilary Joyce
looked do\rn upon a distant clump of
palms, and thought t--"t- this cool patch
'of green in th? midst of the merciless
blacks and yellows was the fairest color

later he had ridden into thÂ« little- camp,
the guard had turr.ed out to ealute,
him, his native subordinate had greeted
him in excellent English, and hi had
fairly entered into his own.
It was not an exhilarating place for
a lengthy residence. There was one
large, bowl-shaped grassy depression ,
sloping down to the three pits of brown
and brackish water. There was the
grove of palm trees also beautiful to
look upon, but exasperating in view of
the fact that nature had provided her
least shady trees ony the very spot
where shade is needed most. A single
widespread acacia did something to re
store the balanc?. Here Hilary Joyce
slumbered in the heat, and in the cool

epindlc-t-hanked Soudanese, with their
cheery black faces and their funny lit
tle pork-pie Forage caps. Joyce was a
martinet at dnil. and the blacks loved
being drilled, so the Bimbashi was soon
popular among them. But one day was
exactly like another. The weather, the
view, the employment, the foodâevery
thing was th2 same. At the end of
three weeks he felt that he had been
there for interminable years. And then
at last there came something to break
the monotony. *"
One evening as the sun was sinking
Hilary Joyce rode slowly down the old
caravan road. It had a fascination for
him, this narrow track, winding among
the bowlders and curving up the mul
lahs, for he remembered how in the
map it had gone on and on, stretching
away into the unknown heart ..of Afri
ca. Th^ countless pads of innumerable
camels iJjrough many centuries had
beaten i&mooth, so that now, unused
and deserted, it still vound away, the
strangest of roads, a foot broad, and
perhaps two thousand miles in length.
Joyce wondered as he rode how long
it was since any traveler had journeyed
up it from the south, and then he
raised his eyes and there was a man
coming along the path.
For an instant Joyce thought that it
might be one of his own men, but a
second glance assured him that this
could not be so. The stranger was
dressed in the {lowing robes of an Arab,
and not in the close-fitting khaki of a
soldier. He- was very tall, and a high
turban made him seem gigantic. He
strode swiftly along, with head erect
and the bearing of a man who knows
no fear.
Who could he be, this formidable
giant coming out of the unknown? The
precursor possibly of a horde of savage
spearmen. And where could he have
walked from? The nearest well was a
long hundred miles down the track. At
any rate, the frontier post of Kurkur
could not afford to receive casual vis
itors. Hilary Joyce whisked round his
horse, galloped into camp and gave the
alarm. Then, with twenty horsemen at
his back, "he rode out again to recon
noiter.
The man was still coming on, in spite
of thtse hostile preparations. For an
Instant he had hesitated when first he
saw the cavalry, but escape was out
of the question, and he advanced with
the air of one who makes the best of a
bad Job. He made no resistance, and
said nothing when the hands of two
troopers clutched at his shoulders, but
walked quietly between their horses
Into camp. Shortly afterward the pa
trols came In again. There were no
signs of any Dervishes. The man was
alone. A splendid trotting camel had
been found lying dead a little way down
the track. The mystery of the stran
ger's arrival was explained. But why,
and whence, and whither? These were
questions for which a zealous officer
must flnd an answer.
Hilary Joyce was disappointed that
there ivere no Dervishes. It would

Hilary Joyce, seconded from the lioyal
Mallow Fusiliers and temporarily at
tached to the Ninth Soudanese, made
his first appearance in Cairo.
Napoleon had said, and Hilary Joyce
hai noted, that great reputations are
only to hi made in the East. Here
he v.T-s iu the East with four tin cases
of baggage, a Wilkinson sword, a
Bond's slug-throwing pistol and a copy
of "Green's Introduction to the Study
of Arabic." With such a start and the
blood of youth running hot in his
veins, everything seemed easy. He was
a little frightened of the general; he
had heard stories of his sternness to
young officers, but with tact and suav
ity he hoped for the best. So. leaving
his effects at Shepherd's Hotel, he re
ported himself at headquarters.
It was not the general, but the head
of the Intelligence Department, who re
ceived him, the chief being still absent
upon that business which had called
him. Hilary Joyce found himself in
the presence of a short, thick-set offl
cei, with a gentle voice and a placid
expression, which covered a remarka
bly acute and energetic spirit. With
that quiet smile and guileless manner
he had undercut and outwitted the
most cunning of Orientals. He stood,
a cigarette batween his fingers, looking
at the newcomer.
"I heard that you had come. Sorry
the chief isn't here to see you. Gone
up to the frontier, you know."
"My regiment Is at Wady Haifa. I
suppose. Eir. that I should report my
self there at once?"
"No; I was to give you your orders."
He led the way to & map upon the wall
and pointed with the end of his cigar
ette. "You see this place? It's the
Oasis of Kurkurâ Â«. little quiet, I am
afraid, but excellent air. You are to
get out there as quick as possible.
You'll find a company of the Ninth and
half a squadron of cavalry. You will
be in command."
Hilary Joyce looked at the name,
printed at the intersection of two black
lines, without another " >t upon the
map for several inches around It.
"A village, sir?"
"No, a well. Not very good water,
I'm afraid, but you soon get accus

two weeks ago. Reckon she thought
she'd better stay at home for Christ
mas. Back in God's country they have
Christmas just about this time of year.
Watch out to-night, Jim. I'm going
home. It's a wind for your life."
Callahan was making a meeting point
for two freights when the door closed
behind Bucks; he didn't even sing out
"Good-night." And as to Merry Chriâ
well, that had no place on the West
End anyhow.
"D-i. D-i. D-i. D-i," came clicking
into the room. Callahan wasn't asleep,
Once he did sleep over the key. When
he told Bucks he made sure of his
time; only he thought Bucks ought to
know, Â¦Â¦'â¢
Bucks shook his head pretty hard
that time. "It's awful business, Jim.
It's murder, you know. It's the peni
tentiary, if they should convict you.
But it's worse than that. If anything
happened because you went to sleep
over the key, you'd have them on your
mind all your life, don't you know â
forever. Menâ andâ and children.
That's what I always think aboutâ the
children. Maimed and scalded and
burned. Jim, if it ever happens again,
They look old now. The Ink is faded
and the paper is smoked with the fire
of fifteen winters and bleached with
the sun of fifteen summers. But to this
day they hang there in their walnut
frames, the original orders, just as
Bucks scratched them off. They hang
there in the dispatchers' offices In the
new depot. But in their present swell
surroundings Bucks wouldn't know
them. It was Harvey Reynolds who
took them off the other end of the
wire â a boy in a thousand â for . that
nigjit and that minute, j The instant
the words flashed into the room he In
structed the agent, grabbed an ax
and dashed out into the waiting-room,
where the Sheriff, Ed Banks, sat with
his Â¦ prisoners, the cowboys.
' "Ed," cried Harvey, "there's a run
away train' from Ogallala coming down
the line In > the wind. If we can't trap
lt-here, ifir knock 59 into kindling
wood. Turn the boys loose, Ed, and
save 'the passenger train.. Boys, show
the. man and "square yourselves right
now.' I" don't know what you're here
for, but I. believe It's to . save 69. Will
you, help ?'! â¢ : - â¢
The three men sprang to their feet;
Ed Banks slipped the handcuffs off in
a' trice., /."Never mind the rest of it.
Save the Â» passenger train first." he
roared, i Everybody, from Ogallala to
Omaha knew. Ed Banks.
Â¦'.' Which way.? , How?" cried the cow
boy s, Â¦ in * a ' lather of â¢ excitement.
-; ; Harvey -x Reynolds,-.: beckoning as he
ran, â¢Â¦ rushed out the door and up the
track, his posse at his heels, stumbling
into the gale like lunatics. '
"Smash in the toolhouse door," pant
ed Harvey as they neared it.
Ed Banks seized the ax from his
han.'s and took command as naturally
The worlds flew off his fingers like
sparks, and another message crowded
the wire behind it:
"To Agent: Go to east switch; open
and set for passing track. Flag 59
and run her on siding. If can't get
59 into the clear ditch the runaways.
"BUCKS."
would be together. Could he save the
passenger? Callahan didn't believe it.
A sharp, quick call brought Griffin.
We had one of the brightest lads on
the whole division at Griffin. Calla
han, listening, heard Griffin answer.
Bucks rattled a question. How the
heart hangs on the faint, uncertain
tick of a sounder when human lives
hang on It!
"Where are your section men?" ask
ed Bucks.
"In bed at the section-house."
"Who's with you?"
"Night agent. Sheriff -with two cow
boy prisoners waiting to take 59." ;
Before the last word came Bucks was
back at him:
"To Operator: Ask Sheriff release
his prisoners to save passenger train.
Go together to west swltchhouse track;
open and set it. Smash in section tool
house; get tools. Go to point of house
track curve; cut the rails and point
them to send runaway train from Oga
lalla over the bluff into the river.
S ,"BUCKS."
with the word. Bucks boarded four
blocks away. Callahan, slamming down
the window, took the key and began
calling Rowe. Howe is the first station
east of Jackson; it was now the first
point at which the runaway coal train
could beheaded. ;
"R-o R-o," he rattled. The operator
must have been sitting on the wire, for
he answered at once. As fast as Calla
han's fingers could talk he told Rowe
the story and gave him orders to get
the night agent, who, he knew, must
be down to sell tickets for 69, and pile
all the ties they could gather across the
track to derail the runaway train.
Then he began thumping for Kolar, the
next station east of Rowe, and the sec
ond ahead of the runaways. He pound
ed and pounded, and when the man at
Kolar answered, Callahan could have
sworn he had been asleep â just from
the way he talked. Does It seem
strange? , There are many strange
things about a dispatcher's .senses.
"Send your night man to west switch
house-track and open for runaway
train. Set brakes hard on your empties
on siding, to spill runaways If possible.
Do anything and everything to keep
them from getting by you. Work
quick."
Behind. Kolar's O. K. came a frantic
call from Rowe. "Runaways passed
here like a streak. Knocked the ties
into toothpicks. Couldn't head them."
Callahan didn't wait to hear any
more. He only wiped the sweat from
his face. . It seemed forever before Ko
lar spoke again. Then it was only to
say: "Runaways went by here before
night man could' get to switch' and
open it."" ;
Would Bucks never come? And if he
did come, .what on earth could -stop the
runaway train now? They were head
ing Into the worst grade on the west
end. It averages one per cent from
Kolar to Grifflti, and there we get down
off the Cheyenne Hills with a long re
verse curve and drop into the canyon of
the Blackwood with a I three' per- cent
graded ; Callahan, almost beslde.him
self, threw open a . north Â¦ window to
look for Bucks. Two men .we're flying
down; Main street toward the station.
He knew them; It was Ole and Bucks.
But Bucks! Never before 'Â¦Â¦ or since
was seen 'on a street of McCloud such
a figure as 'Bucksâ in his trouaers and
slippers, with his night shirt free as

after an eight-hour trick, and on such
a night; by such a messageâ the mar
vel was he could think at all, much
less Â¦ set a trap which should save 59.
In {twenty minutes from, the time
Bucks ' took the ; key the two trains
He came up to the dispatcher's of
fice and sat down. Callahan wondered
why he didn't so home and to bed; but
and 59 moved out stealthily, evenly, re-
Flstlessly. into the teeth of the night.
In another minute only her red lamps
gleamed up the yard. One man still on
the platform watched them recede; it
was Bucks. Â¦ '
The engineer swung out of his cab
with the silence of an abused man. His
eyea were full of soda, his cars full of
nand, his mustache full of burrs and his
whiskers full of tumble weeds. The
conductor and the brakemen climbed
sullenly down, and baggageman shoved
open his door and elammed a trunk
out on the platform without a pretense
of sympathy. Then the outgoing crew
climbed aboard, and in a hurry. The
conductor-elect ran downstairs from
the register and pulled his cap down
hard before he pushed ahead against
the wind to give the engineer his copy
of the orders as the new engine was
coupled up. The fireman pulled the can
vas Jealously around the cab end. The
brakeman ran hurriedly back to exam
ine the air connections and gave his
signal to the conductor; the conductor
gave his to the engineer. There were
two Ebort. choppy snorts from the 101,
; No. Â£9, the California express, was
late that night. All the way up the
valley the wind caught her quartering.
Really, the marvel is that out there on
the plains such storms didn't blow our
toy engines clear off the rails; for that
matter, they might as well have taken
the rails, too, forgone of. them went
over sixty pounds. No. 59 was due at
11 o'clock; it was 12:30 when she pulled
in, and on Callahan's trick. But Bucks
hung around the office until she stag
gered uz> under the streaked moonlight,
as frowsy a looking train as ever
choked on alkali.
There was always a crowd down at
the station to meet 53. She was the big
arrival of the day at McCloud, even if
Fhe didn't get in until 11 o'clock at
night. She brought the mail and the
express and the landseekers and the
traveling men and the strangers gen
erally; no the McCloud livery men and
hotel runners and prominent citizens
and prominent loafers and the city
marshal usually came down to meet
her. Hut it was not so that night. The
platform v.-as bare. Not even the hardy
chief of police, who was town watch
and city marshal all combined, ven
tured out.
Bucks was assistant superintendent
and master mechanic and train mas
t*r ar.d chief dispatcher and storekeep
er â and a bully good fellow. There were
Forae boys in the service; among them,
Callthan. Callahan was seventeen,
with hair like a sunset, and a mind
quick as an airbrake. It was his first
year at the key. and he had a night
trick under Bucks.
"Three hundred thousand dollars is
a good deal of money, Callahan," I ob
jected.
"Figure it out yourself. To begin
with, fifty passengers' lives â that's
JauOO apiece, isn't it'.'" Callahan had
a cold-blooded way of figuring a pas
senger's life from the company stand
point. "It would have killed over
fifty passengers if the runaway had
ever struck 69." There wouldn't have
been enough left of 59 to make a de
cent funeral. Then the equipment, at
lea'st $50,000. But there was a whole
lot more than ?300,000 in it for
Buck*."
"How so?"
"He told me or.ee that If he hadn't
paved 59 that night tie would never
have signed a.nother order anywhere
on any road."
tkyy
Why? Because, after it was all over,
he found out that his own mother was
aboard 69. r.Â»idn*t you ever hear that?
W^l, sir. it was Christmas eve, and
the year was 1SS1."
Christmas eve everywhere; but on
the West End it was Just plain De
cember -4.
"â¢High winds will prevail for ensuing
twenty-four hours. Station agents will
use ftxtra care to secure cars on eid
injrs; brake-men must use care to avoid
being blown from moving trains."
That is about all Bucks said in his
bulletins that evening; not a word
about Christmas or M<:rry Christmas.
In fact, if Christmas had come to Me-
Cloud that night they couldn't have
held it twenty-four minutes, much less
twenty-four hours; the wind was too
high. All the week, all the day, all the
night it had blown â a December wind;
drj as an August noon, bitter as pow
dered ice. It was in the early days 'of
/nir Western railroading, when we had
only one fast train cm the schedule â the
St. Louis-California express; and the
only fast engine on the division â the
301; and only one man on the â¢whole
West Endâ Bucks.
Now, I myself never knew Bucks.
He -left the West End before I went
on. â¢ Bucks is second vice president â
which means the boss â of a transcon
tinental line now, and a very great
swell. But no man from the West
End* who calls on Bucks has to wait
for an audience, though bigger men
do. They talk of him out there yet.
r>iot of General Superintendent Bucks,
which he came- to be, nor of General
Manager Bucks. On the West End
he is Just plain Bucks; but Bucks on
the West End means a whole lot.
"He saved the company $300,000
that night the Ogalalla train ran
sway," mused 'Callahan. Callahan
himself is assistant superintendent
When the multitude of orders was
out of the way Bucks wired Ed Banks
to bring his cowboys down to Mo-
Cloud on CO. Sixty was the eastbound
passenger due at McCloud at 5:30 a.
m. It turned out that the cowboys
had been arrested for lassoing a Nor*
weglan homesteader, who had cut
their wire. It was not a heinous of
fense and after It was straightened out
by the Intervention of Bucksâ who
was the whole thing thenâ they were
given Jobs lassoing sugar barrels In
the train service. One of them, the
tall fellow. Is a' passenger conductor
on the high line. yet.
It was 3 o'clock that morningâ the
25th of December In small letters, on
the West End â before they got things
decently straightened out; there was
so much to doâ orders to make and
reports to take. Trucks, still on the
key in his flowing robes and tumbling
hair, sent and took them all. , Then
he turned the seat over to Callahan
and, getting up for the first time In
two hours, dropped Into another
chair.
The very first Â» thing Callahan re
ceived was* a personal from Pat Fran
cis, at Ogalalla," conductor of 69. It
was for Bucks:
"Tour mother Is aboard 59. She
was carried by McCloud in the Den
ver sleeper. Â¦ Sending her back to you
on 60. Merry Christmas." f
It came off the wire fast. Callahan,
taking it, didn't think Bucks heard;
though. It's probable he did hear. Any
way Callahan threw the clip over to
ward him. with a laush.
"Look there, old man. There's your
mother coming, after all your kicking
âcarried by on 59."
As the boy turned he saw the big
dispatcher's head sink between his
arms on the table. Callahan sprang
to his side; but Bucfcs had fainted.
It was easy after that. Griffin ia
the foot of the grade: from there on
the runaway train had a hill to climb.
Bucks had held 250, the local passen
ger, sidetracked at Davis, thirty miles
farther east. Sped by the wind, the
runaways passed Davis, though not at
half their highest spaed. An Instant
later 250's engine was cut loose and
started after them like a scared col
lie. Three miles east of Davis they
were overhauled by the light engine.
The fireman, Donahue, crawled out ot,
the cab window, along the footrall
and down on the pilot, caught the lad
der of the first car and. running up.'
crept along to the leader and began
setting brakes. , Ten minutes later,
they were brought back in triumph to
Davis.
But it is one thing to order a contact
opened, and another and very different
thing to open it, at two in the morning
on December twenty-fifth, by men who
know no more about track-cutting than
about logarithms. Side by side and
shoulder to shoulder the man of the
law and the men out of the law, the
roughrlders and the railroad boy, pried
and wrenched and clawed and strug
gled with the steel. While Harvey and
Banks clawed at the spikes the cow
boys wrestled with the nuts on the
bolts of the fish-plates. It was a baffle.
The nuts wouldn't twist, the spikes
stuck like piles, sweat covered the as
sailants, Harvey -went Into a frenzy.
"Boys, we must work faster." he cried,
tugging at the frosty spikes; but flesh
and blood could do no more.
"There they come â there's the run
away train â do you hear It? I'm going:
to open the switch, anyhow," Harvey
ihouted. starting up the track. "Save
yourselves."
. Heedless of the warning. Banks
struggled with the plate bolts in a
silent fury. Suddenly he sprang to his
feet. "Give me the maul!" he cried.
Raising the heavy tool like a tack
hammer he landed heavily on the- bolt
nuts; once, and again; and they flew
in a stream like bullets over the bluff.
The taller cowboy, bending close to his
knees, raised a yell. The plates had
given. Springing to the other rail.
Banks stripped the bolts even after the
mad train had shot into the gorge
above them. They drove the pick un
der the loosened steel and with a pry
that bent the claw bar and a yell that
reached Harvey, trembling at the
switch, they tore away tne stubborn
contact and pointed the rails over the
precipice.
The shriek of a locomotive whistle
cut the wind. Looking east, Harvey
had been watching 53's headlight. She
was pulling in on the siding. He still
held the switch open to send the run
aways into the trap Bucks had set. if
the passenger train failed to get Into
the clear; but there was a minute yetâ
a bare sixty seconds â ana Harvey had
no idea of dumping ten thousand dol
lars' worth of equipment into the river
unless he had to.
Suddenly, up went the safety signals
from the east end. The 101 was cough
ing noisily up the passing trackâ the
line was clear. Banks and tho cow
boys, waiting breathless, saw Harvey
with a determined lurch close the main
line contact.
Iii the next breath the coalers, with
the sweep of the gale in their frightful
velocity, smashed over the switch and
on. A rattling, whirl of ballast and a
dizzy clatter cf Â¦ noise, and before the
frightened crew of 59 could see what
Â«ras up against them the runaway
train was passed â gone!
"I wasn't going to stop here to
night," muttered the engineer, aa he
stood with the conductor over Harvey's
shoulder at the operator's desk a min
ute later and wiped the chill from his
forehead with a piece of waste; "We'd,
have met them in the canyon." ."â¢" -
Harvey was reporting to Bucks.
Callahan heard It coming. "Rails cut,
but 69 safe. Runaways went by here
fully seventy miles an hour." *,
as Dewey. -~
"Plck up that tie and ram her." he
cried, pointing to the door. "All to
getherânow."
Harvey and the cowboys splintered
the panel in a twinkling and Banks;
with a few clean strokes, cut an open-
Ing. The cowboys. Jumping together,
ran In and began fishing for tools in
the dark. One got hold of a wrench;
the other a pick. I Harvey causht up
a clawbar and Banks grabbed a spike

of the curve on the house track. It
lies there close to the verse of a lime
stone bluff that looms up fifty feet
above the river.

care in the matter of bathing, together
with the wise application of a pure
skin food, accompanied by systematic
massage. Do not be alarmed about
the rough condition of the skin at
the backs of the arms above y the
elbows; the pores are rather large on
this part of the arm, hence, the pre
disposition to coarsen if the regular
functions, are impaired, whether by ill
ness or general sluggish circulation.
The first thing 1 to do is to relieve the
congested, morbid condition of the en
larged pores;, a flesh brush Is an in
valuable aid in this work. Bathe the
arms* with hot water and then make
a lather of castlle or other bland soap
and then, with the brush or finger tips,

the gown is the most fashionable waisx

by a tall, slender woman It is extreme

choice for /women: of naturally short
waist line or those inclined to stout

Its soiled look, which contrasted sharp

That was entirely too much of a lux

â¢m alarming rate, and such frequent
tubbings told seriously upon the fab

which were always undone and a per

finally straw sleeves, which were the

to the mark and besides It was dis

Hemstitched aprons are al.vays
popular and becoming. And really
they are not such a trial to make, for
t' -Â»se days materials may be purchased
machine iitched; and, not only this,
White is always pretty, but unless
an office is well kept it is somewhat of
an extravagance. Dimity in pale pink,
blue and lavender made with a !>aby
waist and great bishop sleeves, finished
with a band of beading, if sweet and
pretty, but It Is not overly practical.
Office aprons really should be made of
a stout material that will tub and be
none the worse for it, and while deli
cately colored dimities and lawns are
pretty they do not wear as well as per
cales, India llnons and even prints.
Calico Is . not to be despised these
days, for there is such an endless va
riety that the practical girl may appear
to quite as good advantage as her
more flowery sister. A peculiar shade
6f blue, with a dash of white, looks
well, and the apron may be made
by goring the front breadth, insert-
Ing the gores to give width at the
bottom. The apron is not sewed up all
the way, and the sleeves may be put
In the space left for them In the seams.
Ruffles may be added and finished with
a tiny white braid, but really they are
neater and more comfortable when en
tirely devoid of trimmings of any kind
or description.
Another apron that Is particularly
fetching for the stenographer who
daily comes In contact with Inks Is
made of a good quality of percaline.
It is light weight and looks very much
like moire silk, which are good points
In its favor. The slender girl runs a
number of lengthwise tucks in the
waist, letting them out here and there
to give her a round effect. The
strings, which are rather short, are
inserted at the waist line on either
side, and this in itself brings the apron
well in at the back. The ruffles, pock
et and ties are pretty if briar stitched,
which, by the way, is the latest im
provement on old fashioned feather
stitching.
Black India silk and pongee make
eoft, clinging aprons, which are not
only picturesque, but decidedly useful
as well. The girl who has plenty of
time and who cares enough for her
personal appearance may make a
charming one by fagoting the deep
flounce at the bottom, the ruffles at
the neck, at the wrist and on the
pocket Then In order to make it
more fetching she may catch the ties
just a little above the waist line in
front and bring them' to the ."back*
empire fashion, in a big bow with long
ends. Perhaps It is the bows that fly
about in such a saucy. Impertinent

She does not consider it her bounden

neither does she care to have comment

Not. so the girl of 1C04. She dresses
neatly and prettily and as she has

colls but wears quickly, she has wel

but as a protector for the 'dainty frpek

a second glance, and she was soon

every chi'd should avoid. Such a child
Is evidently almost entirely lacking in
those mental powers which every child
should Dossess.
Children have many different kinds
of fears. Some are governed more by
one bind, and others by entirely differ
ent kinds. Some have reasonable fears,
others have unreasonable fears. The
sensible child will ' fear the â¢ fire * which
has burned him, or anything else which
has Injured him In any way. If talked
with and shown that at a certain dis-
tance,. and under certain conditions,
no unpleasant consequences will follow,
it-is quite easy to train him to be no
more ; fearful - than â¢ he should . be.
A great many of the child's fears
are the natural result of a vivid imag
ination, which has been '. unduly stimu
lated by â¢ senseless | stories of nurse t or
parent. Of all fears . these \ should be
dealt with most tenderly. .
The , children of nervous tempera
ments are | generally Â¦Â¦ those most sensi
tive to such fears. Many of them suf-
fer almost dally. and nightly such an
guish as would drive their parents
Into Insanity. Greatly are such chil
dren to be pitied if their parents, be
cause of real, acquired or pretended
lack | of fear, have no sympathy with
these fears.
There is no use telling children that
they are unreasonable.
How terribly many children suffer
from . the awful dreams which awaken
them from the, deepest sleep! Indeed,
it is hardly possible for us to sympa-
Wm.J. Shearer's ThirtietKTalR to Parents
thize with such if we should. What
parent cannot remember some terrible
dreams which -unnerved him, even
after he was old enough to know that
so far as Is known there was absolute
ly nothing in dreams? Surely such a
parent should be most patient with the
fearful apparitions which are intensely
real to every, child.
Many a child has been Injured for
life and condemned..to become a nerv
ous wreck because^of the parents' dis
regard of these fears of imagination
which run riot when we are asleep
and Judgment is off guard. Like the
Insane person, the child in his sleep,
to a certain extent, sees the images as
if they were real. In too many cases
the exciting, arid terrible stories told
by parents to their children are the
direct cause of many of the worst
dreams of children.
Some parents have never given any
consideration to -'the claims of their
children when they are about to retire
for the night. Is this not. a mistake? It
may be argued that children should
learn to go to bed when they are told
and to go to sleep promptly. Let It be
acknowledged that this is the case.
The fact remains that there -are times
when they cannot do so. Often young
children will lie for hours thinking cf
hobgoblins and a hundred other things
which excite and scare- them. If re
ports can be believed, many time*
thoughtless or selfish parent! and
nurses try to scare children to sleep
by telling them terrible stories of what
may happen if they do not go to sleep
at once. Such treatment Is barbarous,
and, if It cannot be stopped In some
better way. It Justifies attention from
the Society for the Prevention of Crual
ty to Children. f â¢
Surely if there fa on a time that a
child should hear only kind, quieting
words, it is when it Is about to go
to bed. The last -thoughts before go-
Ing asleep are likely to be the ones
which not only determine the kind of
rest the child will get, but even the
character of the child in the future.
If you have kind words of approval,
give them now. See that, except In
extreme cases, the nervous child Is not
put to bed with harshness. The hour
before going to bed will be remembered
long after others have been forgotten.
If you no longer stop to give a kiss
to your boy or girl after he or the is
in bed or ready for bed, do not wonder
that that child is getting to think less
of the blessings of home.
With such something is radically
wrong. While it is not expected or
best that all should be as fearful as
are those who have lively imagina
tions and sensitive emotion, yet is is
best that children should have some
fear. If they have not, at every turn
they -will be meeting with accidents
which most children* would avoid. Chil
dren who have no fear would not hesi
tate to go near many places 'which
Sometimes innocent children are
brutally whipped for the purpose of
making them less fearful. From what
has been said upon the emotions and
the imagination of children It will be
seen that no treatment could be more
unwise. Surely the time has come
when those having the managing of
children should have some idea of the
significance of childish fear. All should
see clearly that it is not cowardice,
and that the child may really be braver
than the man who fears death In the
front line of battle, and yet be fearful.
Fear is the perception of danger. Cow
ardice is being afraid to brave the
danger.
Some children seem to fear nothing.
It is of treat importance that the
fears of children be dealt with in great
tenderness and with much considera
tion. Yet, how often the thoughtless
parent makes then a subject of ridi
cule.
â¢* "T EARLY If not all children quite
/\ I early show signs of fear. How-
I N ever, the very young child prob-
V^ ably has no fear whatever. Such
a child^2oes not hesitate to go Into al
rhost every kind of danger. That such
Is the case most will admit.
**" The more nervous a child is the
more fearful he is likely to be as he
gets older: however, If proper care is
taken fears may be prevented from
gaining more than temporary control
over children. If not dealt with proper
ly they may injuriously affect them all
through their lives. Foolish the parent
who thinks that fears are the signs of
weakness. They should be considered
as the natural result of living in the
world of imagination in which the child
exists. A* 6uch they will hold sway
over the child's mind until developing
reason and careful treatment remove
the causes.

HOW TO PACK
A TRUNK
SORROWS AND FEARSComplaints of all nature come to
the Health Department. Photographs
sometimes . accompany the complaints
to prove beyond peradventure of a doubt
that the complaint is just. One 'man
sent samples of vermin captured in a
cheap lodging-house to prove that the
place was unfit for habitation. One
indignant citizen wanted -.a rooster re
moved because it crowed at the wrong
hour; another wanted cheese con
demned because the odor was jipt to
his liking; still another complained
against a house cat that held noctur
nal concerts outside his window," de-
pours coaloll over it and the grocer Is
warned to err no more.
At the present time the Health De
partment is gathering samples of
jellies, honey, vinegar, olive oil and
drugs for chemical analysis, and if the
goods 'do not come up to the standard
the balance of the stock is condemned.
This has its good effect Pure food is
what the people desire and It Is the
aim of the present Health Board to
see that they obtain that what they
pay for.
spite all efforts to shoo it off.
Scores of complaints of a just kind
come to the .office daily and these are
abated as quickly as possible. When
a complaint comes in, It is turned over
to the inspector V and he visits the
place, and if the nuisance is caused by
filthy premises orders the place to be
put in a. sanitary.. condition. If the
nuisance is caused by unsanitary
plumbing* the' complaint is turned
over to the plumbing department and
an expert visits the premises and
makes a careful investigation. Should
he find ft lack* of darinage
or a dozen and one * things
that may cause sickness, ascertains
the name of the owner of th,e prem
ises and a notice is sent him to begin
work immediately. Unfortunately
owners are slow to obey and a second
notice is sent. In the meantime the
occupant of the house' rails against
the Heaith Department for not doing
its duty,' â¢ whereas the delay is actually
caused by the landlord's disinclina
tion to do the work. If. after the last
notice is sent and nothing is done, the
department has tne power to arrest
the owner for maintaining a nuisance.
The Police Court Judges usually up
hold the department, as they appre
ciate the necessity of sanitary plumb
ing.
The plumJbinsr department of the
Board of Health has supervision over
all buildings in course of erection or
repair. Before plumbing work can be
done on the building the master
plumber must go to the Health De
partment and secure the necessary
permit. If he fails so to do and does
the work not according to lawful re
quirements Is liable to arrest and can
be compelled to tear out all faulty
plumbing and do the work over again.
No one has the right to do plumbing
unless he ha.3 passed a proper exam
ination and is registered.
The Board of Health has inaugu
rated a system of daily school inspec
tion that promises magnificent results.
Physicians have been assigned to the
various schools of this city and dally
examine children who are suffering
from "all the ills that flesh is heir
to." If a child has tonsllltis, whoop-
Ingr cough or unsightly sores on the
face or hands or has any contagious or
infectious disease, he or she is sent
home for proper treatment. The doc
tor gives the pupil a printed blank on
which he has written what ails the
scholar and also advises the parents
to consult the family physician. When
the latter signs the card stating the
child has recovered and Is fit to return
to school the pupil is allowed to re
join the class. This system is work
ing great good. Incipient cases of
diphtheria have thus been discovered
and the danger of a spread of a con
tagious disease passed, as the system
of inspection is very rigid.
If a child has suffered from a con
tagious disease and desires to return
to school, he or she must apply to the
Health Office for a permit and this
is handed the principal, who allows
the child to resume study.
The Board of Health is actively en
gaged in a campaign against unsanl
tation. Barber shops will soon be
compelled to exercise creater caution
in handling cups, brushes, razors and
other appliances used in tonsorial
work. The danger of infection
through the use of articles that have
not been properly sterilized ia appa
rent to all. Rules and regulations for
their guidance are being prepared and
will be placed in* every barber shop.
paste are placed on boards in the
sewers of the city and the rodents
are dying in great numbers. Cubes of
bread covered with Pasteur virus, a
poison that Is harmless to human be
ings or animals other than rats, are
being spread over Chinatown and In
places where rodents are plentiful,
and the Health Department is pleased
to report that hundreds of rats are
being destroyed. N
It is, therefore, apparent that the
Health Department is keeping a
watchful eye on the sanitary condi
tions of this city. It can only do good
work through the co-operation of its
citizens. All nuisances should be re
ported to the Health Department,
either by letter or telephone, and it
will be the aim of the department to
see to it that they are abated.
and It la earnestly hoped that citizens
will assist the board In th* enforce
ment of these rules. Ths telephone
company has been appealed to to
place sanitary mouth-plecas over their
telephones to prevent the spread of
disease. Bacteriological examinations
of phones have shown the presence of
diphtheritic and tubercular germs and
the danger of contracting these germ*
Is great In case the public phones ara
not properly protected. The Health
Officer has ordered all lung testing
machines taken out of tha so-callad
"penny arcades^" on account of tha
danger of contracting contagious dis
eases. The streetcar companies and
tha railroads are dlsinfectinr their
cars under the direction of tha Health
Officer, expectoration on streets is
ilso prohibited and tha Chief of Pollea
is enforcing the ordinance.
Chinatown is being placed In a sani
tary condition. This reeking quarter
Is cleaner and healthier than ever be
fore in its history. The Board of
Health has a wrecking crew and dls-
Infectors In the Celestial quarter and
these men are actively engaged In
tearing out areas, pulling down rotten
walls and forcing the owners to clean
up their cellars. The board has ths
power to force the owners to vacate
the premises and place them in proper
condition. The owners complain, but
their protests are unheeded, as tha
health of the community is at stake.
The Chinese live in squalor and seem
to thrive, but the danger of the spread
of contagious disease Is too great and
the Health Inspectors are constantly
on the alert to prevent a violation of
the sanitary laws.
It Is & well-known fact that rats
spread disease and a crusade against
the rodents Is also In progress. Dainty
rare-bits coated with phosphorized
supervision by the Health Department.
In order that milk may be sold, a per
mit must be secured. This costs noth
ing-, but to soil lacteal fluid without *a
Permit makes the proprietor amenable
to the law. Inspectors visit groceries
and delicatessen â¢ stores and depots
where milk is sold and bring in sam
ples. Sellers are warned to shake
their cans each time before selling
milk, so that the butter fats in milk,
which give sustenance to the body, are
properly distributed. If this was not
done /he first buyer would receive all
the cream and the next customer would
only obtain skimmed milk. -
Every particle of meat that comes
from the slaughter-houses inButcher
town is examined by an expert of the
Health Department. If he finds that
the carcass Is diseased or unfit for
human consumption, he is given the
power to condemn It and if an attempt
is made to dispose" of it the seller is
liable to arrest. These inspectors are
apprised by the wholesalers when
there will be a "killing" and on the
day set the officer visits .the-slaugh
ter-house and watches the killing with
a very critical eye. Tubercular cattle
are seized and condemned at once. As
a result of this watchfulness the meat
consumed in this city is W a high
quality.
Food inspectors go from stor* ,to
store and examine the products on
sale and when they find food unfit for
consumption they condemn It. Gro
cerymen are compelled to* keep their
places in. a sanitary condition. They
must of necessity do this, or lose their
customers. The inspector has the au
thority to go behind the counter and
examine the foodstuffs for sale or go
Into the, basement, where the stock Is j
stored, and If In his judgment the
article is unfit to eat, ' places a quar
antine label on the stuff and brings a
sample to the Industrial Chemist. If
the latter, after a careful analysis,
finds the fo'od unfit, the inspector

shown that these are liable to con
tract and carry the disease. If isola
tion Is to be effective, no person ex
cept the attendants should be allowed
to enter the room. These should wear
clothing that may be boiled in water.
The hands of the attendants should be
rinsed in a disinfecting fluid each time
the patient is handled, and in case of
diphtheria, if the patient coughs In thi
attendant's face, or carries any of the
discharges from the throat to the
hands of the attendant, these surfaces
must be thoroughly washed at once
with a disinfectant solution. The floor
of the sick room must not be swept
dry. We have learned %>l the dangers'
of dust, hence the rule should be to
mop or wash the floor, baseboards,
window sills and frames with clothes
â¢wrung out of the disinfecting fluid.
"All dishes, table utensils, etc., used
in the sick room must be placed in
boiling water or In disinfecting fluid
before being taken from the room.
Flowers brought to the patient ill from
contagious disease should not be per

It must be conceded *' all good cltl
rens that a better qua! y of milk is
r.ow being sold in this city than here
tofore. This is due to the crusade at
present waged by the Health Depart
ment. The ordinance of the city fath
ers provides that there must be three
and two-tenths butter fat in milk. If
after a chemical test the milk falls be
low this standard the dairyman or the
party selling the tame is liable to ar
rest and fine. At least a score of sam
ples are taken each day from milk
wagons by the milk and food inspec
tors of the Health Department. In each
Instance where a sample is taken from
a can, a like sample Is handed to the
driver, so that there may be no cause
for dispute. Both samples are sealed
and one is turned over to the Indus
trial Chemist, who makes what is
known os a Babcock test. As a rule
the butter fat in milk runs above the
standard set by the Supervisors, and
the dairyman Is unmolested. Should it
fall below a warrant is sworn out for
tha arrest if the milkman and he is
haled into the Police Court.
The Board of Health has recommend
ed to the Supervisors that they raise
the standard to three and a half and If
this is done the nubile will get a still
better quality of milk. .
All stores selling milk are subject to
Health Officer D. P. Ua^an. M. D..
has laid down the following rules to be
Applied in the household management
of contagious and infectious diseases:
"The patient. should be placed in a
room cpart from the" rooms occupied
Uy cthr-r members of the family. This
Is Isolation. All doors opening into the
I'StHfriit'K room should be covered with
* tbttt kept wet with a disinfecting
Kor the first time in the history of
the department steps are taken to pre
vent the spread of tu^-rculcr'? Should
a person suffering f om consumption
be r-jcoved from one place to another
or should succumb to the disease, the
room occupied by such patient is at
once dibinfected in the same manner
as above ttated. It is a well known
fact, which cannot be disputed, that
healthy people have *..itracted the
disease by occupying the Â»â¢ .1 used hy
the- deceased years afterward.
The diseases In which quarantine are
enforced are chicken-pox, measles,
mumps, whooping-cough, scarlet fever,
diphtheria, typhoid fever, yellow fever,
typhus fever, plague, leprosy and
smallpox.
Whenever a person is affected with
cmall^ox or there is the least suspicion
that the patient is suffering from the
dread disease, the City Physician is im
mediately sent to the house and in
forms thfc oface when he verifies the re
port. A Tan Is sent from the smallpox
hocpital and the patient removed to
the hospital. The house Is then Im
mediately disinfected and whoever
hs* come In contact with the victim
Is crJy too willing to bare the arm
for the purpose of vaccination. Vac
cination Itself Is a great preventive of
this dreadful disease, as In most Jn
t-tancee those who have smallpox were
never vaccinated. Such vaccination
should be performed at least every
eeven years.
Under and by virtue of the ordin
ances of the city and county, physi
cians must report to the Health De
partment all contagious diseases. The
doctor notifies the office by letter or
trtephonu- and one of the corps of in
t; ecting phyecians \ is t3 the noire. anJ
verifying the report, quarantines the
premises. A placard warning the pub*
lie Â«â¢--â¢ there Is eicknees in the house
is placed on the door t- d the house
holder is warned not to allow the chil
dren, if there are any, to return to
school until the danger period is v a s se< i.
In cases of diphtheria the physician
takes a swab, which is a piece of steril
ized cotton fastened to a piece of steril
ized wire, and sweeps the patient's
throat and at once inserts it into
a sterilized test tube, which is
closed by a piece of cotton and
this is at once sent to Dr. Can
ney, the city bacteriologist, who
makes a culture, and if he finds
the presence of diphtheritic germ or
bacillus, the patient is isolated during
the duration of the Illness. When the
patient is reported fully recovered by
the family physician the house is thor
oughly disinfected by employes of the
Board of Health, without cost to the
householder. Formalin is used and the
yepors arising from the heated fluid
fill the room with gases which destroy
ell germs that may be lurking In the
carpet, hangings, clothing or bedding
and even destroys flies and mosquitoes
that are In the room.
In order that the reader may better
appreciate what is being done to pre-
V^TVQ the health of the people, the fol
lov.ing facts are set forth:
The powers exercised by a Board of
Health are many fold and in the ex
excise of those powers, good Judgment
must be used. It is therefore the duty
oi the Health Officer, D. F. Ra?an. M.
L>., c? the executive officer of th*
hoard; to carry out thÂ»> dictates of the
brard, and the results being achieved
proves his c-fflclency.
PROBABLY the most important
branch of a city's government i?
its Health Department. The
.health of its citizens must b
protected and in the preservation of
jLhe health of a community many
things must be accomplished. The
present Board of Health of San Fran
cisco. Is actively engaged in this dif
<icult task and during the short period
Jt has been in power, measures and
methods have been adopted that have
brought greater security to this grow
ing metropolis.
* With the crusade against adulterated
<ood # 6tufffs. Impure milk and unsanitary
plumbing; dcily school inspection and
abatement of nuisances, f board is
obtaining good results.

The next time he sa-w it. five years
later, it was in the residence of one
of New York's wealthiest collectors,
Another man there is in town who
can tell a tale of a stein which he
wishes he hadâ Mr. Xavler S. Mar
tinez, the local artist and society man.
He was a student for many years in
Paris under the great painter Gerome.
A student episode of this time had to
do with one of the most famous steir.a
in America to-day.
It was during the Wagner operas at
Beyreuth that a party of students of
the Latin- Quarter decided to maka the
tear and take in the mu3ic of the
master. Fourteen of the boys, all of
them French except Mr. Martinez, who
was more than half French through
long association with the Parisians,
made the trip frcrn Paris to Beyreuth
afoot. It. was a long tramp, but walk
ing is cheaper than rail, even third
class, and money was scarce â as it al
ways Is in the Quartler -Latin.
Through the provinces of France to
the Belgium frontier, across into Hol
land to the North Sea, then the stu
dents hired a crazy craft that had
barely seaworthiness to cross the In
land sea, and mada the trip up the
Rhine to their stopping place.
Satiated with the magnificent music
of Wagner, they began making short
pedestrian tours to the neighboring
towns, and 'one day found themselves
in tha little city of Nuremberg, where
Albert Durer, famous in art as Wag
ner In music, was born and made his
name. A pilgrimage -Â»Â¦> hl3 birthplace
was the natural result of artistic en
thusiasm, and the subsequent visit to
the brewery for which the town is bet
ter known to the world at large, came
as naturally.
While the students were seated
around the old oak tables Xavier Mar
tinez' eye lighted upon a stein on the
wall that especially attracted his at
tention. It was a beautiful specimen
of ancient German workmanship, and
he. experienced in such matters, knew
that it was a product of the sixteenth
century.
Saying nothing to hia associates ha
waited his opportunity and drove a
neat bargain for its possession.
Throughout the subsequent tours of
the pedestrian Mr. Martinez carried
his treasure safely hidden beneath his
student cape and tot one of his com
panions knew that he possessed it.
From Nuremberg the party returned to
Paris by third class rail. Tired out. al
most exhausted by the long walks of
the previous few week3, Mr. .Martinez
sank into a deep sleep shortly after
the wheels of the train began moving
towards France. Several hours later,
when he aweke, the stein for which he
had sacrificed so much was gone.
Where he never knew.
Bides, she "looked so like our dear
queen," and Indeed, though this may
be the fact, it's Queen Welhelmlne who
must feel flattered.
Dr. Charles Levison oa Van Ness
avenue Is proud in the possession of
a stein which he values more than. Its
market value, even were its weight in
goldâ for It was his friend and com
panion through Heidelbergâ given to
him by a fag, a young man who was
at that time In the employ of our wiz
ard Edison and who was spending some
spare time perfecting himself in chem
istry at the German university.
Many were . the secrets which
changed hands over a genial midnight
glass. â¢ Not a drop of beer can be
bought in the town after 12 o'clock, as
every Inn and shop are closed at that
hour.
The brother of the secretary to the
Minister, Stamboulof, boarded at th r
same house as Dr. Levison and ma:.y
a Bulgarian question of state was set
tled In consequence.
Suspended from pegs are the various
Bteins and tankards.
One beautiful design comes from
Budapest, another from Vienna, with
its striking coat of arms; another from
H&uXbrauhause, which was once a
romantic old castle now fallen from Its
high .estate to a mere beer hall, but
retained In its former splendor as
Broth' as possible. The coat of arms
*f the ancient aristocratic family em-
Jblazons the face of the stein.
From another deserted castle cornea
ft Bohemian tankard, which was once
used at the family boerd on state oc
casions.
Then there Is the little blue flelft,
email like Its home, dainty and or
namented with scenes of the seaâ far
more expensive than any other stein
In the collection.
Next th?re is one from Nuremberg.
It plays a merry waltz when lifted to
the lips. "One never forgets the trip
to the brewery in that town," Miss
Crim reminisces. '"There are no at
tendantsâthe visitor takes his stein
down off the wall and placing a small
piece of money In a niche In the wall,
like, our nickel- Jn-the-slot, out flows tha
beer, cool, sharp â nectar. But one must
sit with skirts well off the floor, for if
one walks about it is to wads through
a sea of beer foam, at the peril of
one's shoes â such is Nuremberg.
Though this may sound strange It 13
quite the proper thing to make such a
pilgrimage."
In Berlin tbe stein heralds the coat of
arms of Pru?si?.. while from Dresden
there is another, in the beautiful Sax
onian colors, llctlock is the pottery
used in all the better steins, -which
corresponds to Ldmoge in china.
Another young lady who is the for
tunate possessor of a rare and beau
tiful collection Is Mrs. Glenn C. Barn-
Her eyes were looking forty miles
away again, and my eyes were looking
at Sylvia. The faintest line of color
showed in her rounded cheek, it
touched her dimpled curl above her
little ear. Sylvia turned to me with
the shyest of lights in her pansy eyes.
"There's another," she faltered.
Ah! I heard a rustling, under the
manzanita bush. I went down, and
threw a stone at it. When I went
back, I stood facing her.
"He is the seventh man. The an
cients thought there was luck in the
number seven: but you know the
stipulationâ I must approve."
'."He is good, and he has honest
hazel eyes," she began slowly, "and a
splendid chin. He isn't poor, but I'd
rather take manzanita blossoms from
him.. If he could give me nothing else,
than to accept orchids from a prince.
I should rather live in that little two
roomed hou?e with him than with a
king In hi3 palace."
There was a rift in Sylvia's voice as
she finished.
"But he has never asked me to
marry him, and I guess he never will."
"He must be a darned fool then!"
I remarked savagely.
Sylvia laughed softly.
"That's one thing I didn't mention.
He is. But if he doesn't ask me to-
day. I am going to ask him. It's leap
year, you know. Why shouldn't I?
I wish, thousrh, he would ask me. I
should so much rather he would, dear
est.
The last word was whispered, but I
heard it.
"You can't mean me?" .1 croaked,
bewildered.
For answer. Sylvia left her throne
and came down to me. She pointed
the manzanita blossom toward the
Sacramento River, forty miles away.
" S'.-e, dear. The sun strikes the
river, and It looks like a band of gold.

my stupid shoulder, and my arms

RARE COLLECTIONS
OF HISTORICAL
STEINS.Fans From Mrs. W. S. |
Peters of East Oakland. |
THE Jones family was troubled
with two eons; one of them was
labeled Henry Clay and the
other was plain William, usually
marked down to Bill. Now, nature had
clearly designed Henry for great
things. He had the overhanging brow
and automatic cerebral action that
give promise of something new and
unique in the way of intellectual stunts.
While Henry had his eye on the Pres
idency as a comfortable berth in which
to pass his declining years, wearing
on his jutting brows a large laurel
â¢wrrath woven by his grateful country
men, WJUlam aspired to no lower a sta
tJon ".an that of the best baseball
pitcher in the United States. Later on
be modified his views somewhat and
concluded that he woul-" be satisfied
if he could be the engineer of the fast
mail and run up a new record for cows
intercepted on a single trip.
It is also 'innecessary to state that
Henry was one of the most regular at
tendants at Sunday school, while Wil
liam's patronage was usu: Ily limited
to the month !Â»-Â¦ "-tely previous to
the happy Christmastidc. At other
times he appeared only by * and
Lincoln had never gone to college. So
he girded up his intellect and set out
on the road to the White House. When
it was put up to William to go out and
secure his daily portion of the world's
visible supply of bread, he didn't hesi
tate more than sixteen or seventeen
minutes In deciding that Minktown was
too leisurely a place for him. xfe want
ed a place where men were doing things
â and being done. No two by four.hole
in the wall for William. He needed
room to expand, and Chicago seemed
to be hungering for. Just such . an in
dividual as he was. Therefore he hied
himself away to that city of high build
ingsâwith rent and wind in proportion
â and opened negotiations with a gro
cery for an opportunity to become
possessed of his dally loaf, with the
prospect of adding, a little cake and
preserves In the course of time.
While William' was 'thus paving the
way to becoming â¢ a merchant prince,
with all the emoluments and dividends
thereunto appertaining, Henry Clay
was sitting In the lee of a large copy of
Kent's Commentaries and Informing
himself as to the way In which justice
might be made lame as well as blind.
In the course of time he was admitted
to the charmed circle that is allowed to
woods have very queer Ideas of Con
gress sometimes. As for William, it
was universally admitted that his intel
lect would never keep 'him awake
nights, and it was the general opinion
that he would be very fortunate if he
could find a place where he could work
for his board and clothes.
When they were sent to college It was
the same way, only more so. While
Henry was foregathering with the mid
night oil and putting a mansard . roof
and a two-story piazza on his Intellect,
William was usually waging fierce and
unremitting warfare on strong drink or
collecting choice specimens of ivory in
the room of the wicked sophomore from
gay Noo Yawk. Henry graduated with
high honor and a black cutaway, while
William just managed to get. by before
the switch was opened, but he had the
finest collections of signs that had ever
been seen in the Institution.
Henry Clay still had his eye on the
Presidency as his ultimate goal, but
he decided to begin t. collecting bills
' and starting flres for a disciple of
BlackBtone, meanwhile absorbing a lit
tle o* the perfection of reason *on the
side. It was a humble , beginning, ' but
he reasoned that even Abraham Lin
coln started at the bottom, and besides
not then if he could manage to connect
with a previous engagement While
Henry could get up before the whole
school and announce without turning
a hair that his name was Norval on
the Grampian Hills â although they all
knew that It was Jones when he was
In MInktownâ and could even do the
giant swing dji the speech of Sparta
cus, William could never get the dying
soldier of the legion more than half
dead before his voice sneaked out the
back door and left him standing on the
platform with his mouth open and his
mind In the same condition. -The only
advantage that he ever secured from
thes~ Friday afternoon bursts of elo
quence was in the fact that-he had
steady employment for the next week
doing various and sundry acts of vio
lence to the boys who snickered when
his voice deserted him in the midst of
the action. >
Of course. It was universally admit
ted that Henry Clay was the hope of
his family and that William was some
thing else. It was even prophesied by
some of the more daring ones that Hen
ry might some day butt into Congress
if he was real good and read the Bible
and the Encyclopedia Brltannica reg
ularly. People who live in the back-

and while Henry was spreading the
light and heat of his eloquence over
the country William was counting up
his proflt3 for the year and carefully
prying off the mortgage which rested
on his aged parents' dwelling. Inci
dentally he was paying Henry Clay's
debts and selling him goods at whole
sale rates.
Here we must leave the brothers. We
realize that the tale Is incomplete, but
tales will grow and he *vho has a mind

Perhaps the fact that William Is com
pelled to rub along on a few hundred
thousand dollars a year while his
brother flourishes like a green bay tree
on the princely income of three thou

minds to the conclusion that while a
labile ofllce may be a public trust, a
private trust Is more to the point If
a man's tastes run to automobiles and

fact that statesmen are born and not
made should relieve Henry of all re

looked as rosy as a Government con
tract. . He was making as much as
twelve hundred dollars a yearâ when
he could collect it, and his name was a
power In all the Justice of the Peace
courts In the county. He was also cul
tivating the constituency with a view
to the time when the - Incum
bent of the seat in Congress should
conclude that he had rested long
enough." In the meantime he conde
scended to accept a seat in the State
Legislature^â after he had spent all his
prospective j Income for the next two
years in inducing the members of the
nominating convention that he was the
gentleman to safeguard their Interests
and give the gaff to the sinful corpora
tions,' at so much per gaff.
* It was easy sailing from this time
on; the prophecies of his early youth
were fulfilled In a manner that was
calculated to make the people believe
that the prophet business was looking
up. . The doors of Congress opened wide
to him "arid he was to be seen on th*Â»
floor of the House pleading in impas
sioned tones for- an appropriation of
four hundred and seventy-five dollars
for the dredging of Skunk Creek and a
new postofflce for the city of Mink
town. These statements leave no'room
for doubt that he had at last become a
full-fledged statesman. To be sure, thw
Presidency was still beyond him, but
what Congressman would desire to be
President in these degenerate days,
when the fierce light of Senate commit
tees and postoflic investigations beats
hard upon the thrown. Besides, while
he still realized that every "boy has a
chance to be President he had ceased
to have so much faith In chance.
In the midst of- these stirring events
in the career of Henry Clay, what of
William? When we last had the pleas

was occupying the proud position of

leading man in a corner grocery. By
the exercise of frugality and a . keen
eye to business' he had gathered to

on the strength of that he was able to
buy out the other man and add a shoe

Â¦ In the land of the peach blossoms
fans are exchanged as love tokens, and
as China and Japan are really its home
proper, It is more than likely that such
was its original purpose. These coun
tries claim the proud distinction as
well to be the first to do any pictorial
painting. China, in fact, has done the
finest work In existence In filagree gold

supply. Â¦- 'Â¦*'. : I
The fan was Introduced Into Italy,
Spain and Sweden about the same time
that it became so popular in France,
and a little later it made its first ap
pearance In England.
During the reign of Henry VIII two
styles were in vogue. One was for
full-dress occasions, the other for out
door use, and they were used by men
and women alike, to protect them from
the hot rays of the summer's sun. It
is said that during the reign of James
I gentlemen corrected their children
with a large fan, so it Is very evident
that they must have been used com
monly and in the majority of house
holds.
During the time of Charles II fan
making was carried on extensively, and
was a very lucrative business, but soon
Bcme enterprising individual began im
porting them from India, which re
sulted in a petition being: presented to
the Government against importation.
The petition, however, was not wholly
successful, for -fan Importing was not
stopped, although a duty was imposed
which succeeded In protecting home in
dustry and in satisfying the manufac
turers.
About the time of Louis XIV a car

dreamy south â a child of nature. How
much romance she might have connect
ed with her fan is difficult to ascertain.
yet In all probability this dusky maiden
of the South Seas wielded her fan with
as much grace as did the colonial
dames In their stately minuet.
One thing Is to be deeply regretted,
and that is the fact that fan making

as religious ceremony, while in. China
they are found about the royal throne
and are used to desginate degree and

In the romantic field the fan has al
ways been quite as fatal as Cupid's
darts. The beautiful, black-eyed
senorita could talk with her fan while
her not overly watchful companion was
taking her siesta. Probably If the por
traits of the grand and stately dames
of French royalty could but speak,
they would tell of many an animated
flirtation, innocent enough at the .time,
but too frequently ending otherwise.

attention or change the trend of their

one of the most curious, for it is made
straight on one side and has a handle
some three feet in length. It is held
in an easy position and the voice is
thrown toward the part that appears
to have been cut off, and in this way
the congregation is enabled to hear
more or less distinctly what he has'to
say to them. In fact, there is not a
temple in the Orient where fans are
not to be found. Some are for ordi

The pretty, frilly bit of lace and Jew
els that is flaunted so gayly in the
ballroom, on the veranda and at the
reception has an origin that is en
tirely unknown. For surprising as the
fact may be, this dangerous weapon of
feminine warfare dates back to remote
ages.
Â¦ In a tomb of the seventeenth century.
B. C. there was found the handle of
a small fan. Here and there the tiny
holes designated exactly where the
feathers had been fastened and the
preserved remnant was so complete
that not the slightest shadow of a
doubt could remain that the pretty toy
.had been a fan, in all probability
'owned by a fair and gracious daughter
of -that period.
: On the walls of an Egyptian grotto
there is a picture of a man fanning a
water vase for the purpose of keeping
â¢cool Its contents, and as far remote as
the time of Pharoah he is represented
as surrounded with fan bearers, whose
chief duty in life was to await his
pleasure.
This 'custom of fanning royalty and
"others in high position is as much in
vogue to-day as It ever was, though
perhaps the majority of people are not
Aware of the fact. For Instance, In the
Orient fans standing from four to six
feet high are kept constantly in motion
to keep the air cool and to displace the
Insects which are so plentiful in all
tropical countries.
. In religious ceremonies the fan has
always played Its part. As far back
as one can penetrate traces of It may
be discovered and the same custom has
followed down through the ages until
it is used at certain great functions at
the present day. Perhaps the first rec
ords that seems at all near to the
people of this day are the ones of very
early English history, which plainly tell
that fans were used in all churches
to keep the flies off the sacred ele
inents. No particular kind or shape
was choa*r-, although they were not

From this he argued that either her
plans had been disorganized by De
:a\'ai's death, and that no "business"
was intended, or else that all her ef
forts were to be concentrated on a last
' .desperate outrage in which, succeed or
fail, she expected certain capture. It
might even be that the Princess meant
to use her well-known personality as a
figure in Petersburg society to get near

It was a great source of satisfaction
to Voiborth that, so far as he could as
certain, Fortescue had abstained from
going to Versailles. The gay butter

represented on the terrace, but he was
not with them nor was he to be seen
elsewhere in the nearer precincts of the
chateau. Far as the eye could reach

made his way by the Â£rand staircase to
the ground floor; and his uniform gain
ing him unquestioned egress, he passed
out on to the now nearly deserted ter
races. The scene was in striking con
trast to that of two hours before. Save
for a few lingerers to be counted on the
hand, the. crowd had all departed. The
lowing of cattle in the distant pastures,
and the cawing of the rooks away down
in the memory-haunted park, alone
broke the silence of. the. old-world de
mesne. .It was an hour and a season,
with an- all-powerful monarch housed
once more in the chateau, when a phil
osophic mind would have mused on .the
change that two centuries can wreak
on the affairs of men.
But the young Russian was no phil
osopher, a'nd he had other fish to fry
than meditations on the Grand Mon
arque and , the bygone glory of Ver
sailles.' -That he had a purpose quite
distinct from mere loitering was evi
denced by the brisk pace at which he
traversed the gardens, and, always
with his eyes about him, walked on by
way cf the avenue of the Grand Tria
non Into the park.
"This must be. the turning Indicated
by .Monsieur Fortescue." he -muttered,
as he came at length to a cross-road
hand. And quitting the broad drive, he
followed the left-hand rocd for a little
way till on one side he saw a" footpath
winding off Into still "deeper solitudes.
Feeling now sure of his ground, he
struck into the path, which presently
brought, him to an open glade sur
rounded Jon all sides by thick under
growth. In the center a marble fawn
gleamed white In the twilight, and sev
eral other paths converging on the cir
cular space gave It the character of the
heart of a mare. .
Convinced now that he had found the
place he sought, he drew >back a pace
or two. Into the path* by which' he had
approached and waited. His nerves
were all a-tlngle, six-foot.body guards
man though he was, and fiÂ« started at
the slightest sound. A squirrel-run
ning across the glade caused him to
mop his damp brow, with a hardly re
strained Imprecation on his own fears.
But the momenta sped by, and peer as
he might- down. the dark aisles of the
opposite pathways, nothing; came to
break the monotony of his suspense.
"If I had not seen their Majesties en
ter their apartments, and wljhmy own
ears heard them say that they should
remain there, I could bear this no lon
ger," he told . himself at the end 'of ' a
quarter of "an hour. 'â¢--_" _
And then. In the obscurity, of one of
the converging paths â not in front, but
running Into the glade at right" angles
The notes placed at the disposal of

later Olga Palitzln sauntered slowly in

ure in maize-color looking toward the
path" exactly opposite Boris. She was
quite alone as she stood under the
statue, but*-ominous sound â again a
twig cracked in the leafy alley whence
she had come.
Suddenly, while the aide-de-camp
watched with expectant eyes the wo
man who had fooled him. his gaze was
caught by a shimmer of white in the
path opposite, and a moment later his
heart stood stllL Advancing carelessly
into the glade from the gloom of the
pathway, two figures whose familiar
garb turned him sick with horrorâ the
ldng'gray overcoat and astrakan cap of
the Tsar, and the white dress covered
with a fawn-colored dust coat which
the Empress had worn that day. left
no doubt in his mind that Fortescue
had made a terrible mistake in trusting
to the permanence of Imperial inten

them. I think I have learned tne tricK
of thorn at last. And I don't suppose,
all told, it has cost me more than fifty
pounds. And now I am trying to teach
the rest of the family. What I com
plain about the family is that they do
not seerri anxious to learn. "You do
it," they say, pressing the coal-scoop
ir.to raj' hands; "it makes us nervous."
It is a pretty, patriarchal idea; I stand
between them, the trusting, admiring
family, and these explosive stoves that
ar*Â» tiie terror of their lives. They
gather round me in u srroup and watch
me. the capable, all-knowing head who
fears no foreign stove. But there are
days v.hen I get tired of going round
making up flres.
Nor is it sufficient to understand only
one particular stove. The practical
foreigner prides himself upon having
various stoves adapted to various
work. Hitherto I have been speaking
only oÂ£ the stove supposed to be best
suited to reception rooms and bed
rooms. The hall is provided with an
other sort of stove altogether; an iron
stove this, that turns up Its nose at
coke and potato peelings. If you give
it anythins else but the" best coal it
explodes. It is 'like living surrounded
by peppery o'd colonels, trying to pass
a peaceful ivinter among these pas
sionate stoves. There is a stove in
the kitchen to, be used only for roast
inp: this one will hot look at anything
room. It lives, generally speaking, in
side an iron cupboard with two doors.
When you want it you open these doors
and pull it out into the room. It works
on a swiveL And when you don't want
it you try to push It back again, and
then the whole thing tumbles over, and
the girl throws her hands up to heaven
and gays: "lion Dieu!" and screams
for the cook and the femme a Journee,
and they all three say "Mon Dieu!" and
fall upon it with buckets of water. By
round the celling, would enable us to
sit ranged round the walls, like pa
tients In a hospital waiting-room; and
list up coke and potato peelings. Since
then I have had practical experience
of the scientific stove. I want the old
fashioned, unsanitary, wasteful, illog
ical, open fireplace. I want the heat
to go up the chimney, instead of stop
ping in the room and giving me a head
ache, and making everything go round.
When I come 'In out of the snow I
Â¦want to see a fire â something that says
to me with a cheerful crackle." "Hello,
old man, cold outside, isn't it? Come
and Eit down. Come, quite close and
warm your hands. That's right, put
your foot under him and persuade him
to move a yard or two. That's all he's
been doing for the last hour, lying
there roasting himself, lazy little deviL
He'll get softening of the spine, that's
what vill happen to him. Put your
toes on "the fender. The tea will be
here in a minute." I want something
that I can toast my back against,
whll- standing with my coat tails
tucked up and my hands in my pock
ets, explaining things to people. I
don't want a comfortless, staring, white
thing, in a corner of the room, behind
the sofaâ a thing that looks and smells
like a family tomb. It may be hy
gienic, and it may be hot, but it does
not seem to do me any good. It has
its advantages; it contains a cupboard
Into which you can put things to dry.
You can also forget them and leave
them there. Then people complain of a
smell of burning, and hope the house
Is not en fixe, and you ease their mind
by explaining to them tl-at it is prob
ably only your boots. Complicated in
ternal arrangements are worked by a
key. If you put on too much fuel and
do net work things properly the thirg
explodes. And if you â¬'â¢ net put on
any coal at all and the fire goes out
suddenly then, likewise, it expicdes.
That Is the enly way it knows of call
ing attention to itself. On the Con
tinent, you know when the fire wants
seeing to merely by listening. "Sounded
like the dining-room, that last explo
sion," somebody remarks. "I think
not." observes another; "I distinctly felt
the shock behind me â my bedroom I
expect." Bits of the ceiling begin to
fall, and you notice that the cheval
glass over tne sideboard is slowly corn Â¦
ing toward you. "W*;y. it must be this
stove," you say; "curious, how difficult
it is to locate sound." You snatch up
the children and hu"rry out of the
room. After a while, when things have
settled down, you venture to look in
again. Maybe it was only a mild ex
plosion. A ten pound note and a cou
ple of plumbers in the house for a week
Â¦will put things right again. They tell
me they are economical, these German
stoves, but you have got to understand

carriage was crowded. chiefiy with
Germans. Every window was closed.
every ventilator shut. The hot air
quivered round our .feet. Seventeen
men and four women were smoking;
two children were sucking peppermints
and an old married couple eating their
lunch, consisting, apparently, of gar-
Ile.
At the junction the door was thrown
open. The foreigner generally opens
the door a little -way. glides in. and
closes It behind him. Thi3 was not a
foreigner but an American lady, en
voyage, accompanied by five other
American ladies. They inarched In.
carrying packages. They could not find
eix seats together, so they scattered
up and down the carriage. The first
thing that each woman did. the moment
she could get her hand3 free, was to
dash for the nearest window and haul
It down. "Astonishes me." said the
first woman, "that somebody Is not
dead in this carriage." Their idea. I
think, was that through asphyxiation
we had become comatose and, but for
their entrance, world have died uncon
scious. "It Is a current of air that -Is
wanted," said another of the ladies.
So they opened the door at the front
end of the carriage, and four of them
stood outside en the platform, chat
ting pleasantly and admiring the scen
ery, while two of them opened the door
at the other end and took photographs
of the Lake of Geneva. The carriage
rose and cursed them in six languages.
Bells were rung; conductors came fly
ing it. It was all of no use. Those
American ladies were cheerful but
firm. They argued with volubility; they
arjrued standing in the open doorway.
The conductors, familiar, no doubt,
with the American lady and her ways.
shrugged their shoulders and retired.
The other passengers undid their bags
and bundles, and wrapped themselves
up In shawls and Jaeger nightshirts.

condemned to a fine of forty franca
apiece. They also explained to xne that

foreign stove. The rest of the street
thinks you mad. but then the English
man is considered by all foreigners to
be always mad. It is his privilege to bÂ«

you than it did before, and you can
breathe in comfort. But in the railway
. carriage they don't allow you to bÂ«

there are generally half a dozen of

This veteran photographer considers .
that he owes his fortune, which must
be sizable, to King Edward. Many
years ago there was a terrible colliery
accident at Hartley, in Yorkshire. King
Edward, who was then quite a young
man, ordered Downey to take a set of.,

"The Country Girl." The accompanying
picture of Miss Millar is the likeness
of her most In demand at present and
shows her as she appears In "The Or

Is the big hit.
It seems to be n question whether
Gertie Millar or her American rival,
Billie Burke, is most popular with
the photograph buyers at presentâ a
state of things at which no one who
compares their likenesses will wonder.
Miss Burke is even more of a new
comer in London than the Gaiety fa
vorite. She came over here first about
a year ago and sang "coon" songs at
the music halls. She "scored" at once,

"School Girl," the first night notices

her ditty, "My Little Canoe," scored
the success of- the evening, and. at last
accounts, she had repeated the per

.and talented enough to command a
fat salary indefinitely, but no doubt
the handsome sum which the sale of
her photographs brings to her will not
come amiss.

the best she ever had seen, and soon
afterward Queen Victoria commanded
the photographer to take her portrait
at Balmoral. Downey arranged his
camera in a sitting-room and waited.
When the Queen came in she said: "I
can give you only five minutes, Mr.
Downey. Lord Palmerston has an ap
pointment with me, and I must not
keep him waiting." However, the pic
ture was a success; and from that mcÂ»
ment commissions to photograph roy

siders, however, that he practically
made his fortune through one photo
graphâthat of the present Queen, then
Princess of Wales, carrying the Duch
ess of Fife, who was at the time a lit

prints of this photograph and made
close on $40,000 out of It. At the time
of the diamond jubilee 1,000,000 prints
were sold of a photograph of Queen
Victoria also taken by Downey.

Frewen, is one of the debutantes to be
presented to their Majesties, Queen
Alexandra and King Edward VII. at
Buckingham Palace . this season. Mrs.
Moreton Frewen is a lister of Mrs.

Leslie, who with 'her husband was se
lected to accompany the Duke and

These three sisters, who are such fa

a great deal of entertaining this sea

Mrs. George Cornwallis-West also has

But Miss Claire Frewen is not look

her and she consequently hates balls
and dancing parties. Every endeavor
has been made that she might learn
this almost indispensable social art, but
without any encouraging results what

willingly give up, if she were able, all
this part of her "season" to her bright

The exemption which the King en
joys from the operation of the law
which compels number plates to be dis
played on automobiles enables him to
add something to the fun which he con
trives to get out of life despite all the
fuss and ceremony which hedges him
about. When "moting" he nearly al
ways exceeds the speed limit and the
indignation which this spectacle nat
urally arouses in the breast of the
rural constable is increased ten fold
when he beholds a car dash by him
that shows no number. In language
more emphatic than polite he com
mands the offending motorist to halt
that he may take his name and ad
dress. The King dutifully obeys. When
the situation IS explained the limb of
the law retires behind a hedge to kick
himself and his Majesty realizes what
a bracing tonic Is a hearty laugh.
Mrs. Stockton, the wife of Captain
Stockton, the naval attache at the

the fact that she Is seriously ill with

be the result of change of climate and
of the absence of sun which is depress
ing so many people to the verge of seri

lunching out, Mrs. Stockton only nom

with the bright society she meets at
the luncheon and dinner parties and
not with the dainty edibles prepared

LONDON. May 23.â Although Kins
Edward failed to capture the Grand
National with Ambush II, his Majesty
was much more fortunate than many
of his subjects, who backed the horse
to win. The King had only one small
bet on the horse himself, and that same
night he recouped himself for his loss
many times over by his success at
bridge, being favored with a phenom
enal run of luck. The Queen, who is a
pattern of womanly virtue in all things,
never plays hrldze. Jmt..llxe_ King is
passionately fond of the game and
takes a hand at It whenever he gets a
chance. It is a singular fact that the
King owes not a little of his popularity
to his lack of puritanical virtues and
his devotion to some things which the
nonconformist conscience classified as
among the national vices. Her Majesty,
on the other hand, Is adored because
she sticks rigidly to the straight and
narrow path of feminine propriety, even
to the point of prudery. Just on what
terms they agree to disagree as regards
their tastes and feelings i3 a royal se

For some time past Lady Malcolm
has been trying to persuade one of the
smart ladles* clubs to let her have a
room in one of the clubhouses always
reserved for her. But as such an ar
rangement as this clashes with the
most stringent of general club rules,
this little pied-a-terre in London is not,
yet an â¢ accomplished fact and Lady
Malcolm is.' perftn-ce. obliged to con
tinue her patronage of nÂ«r favorite
Jtiotei,
It is a son of Lady Malcolm's broth
er-in-law, the present owner of Poltal
lock, whe is the Ian Malcolm, M. P.,
who married Jeanne Langtry, the
daughter of airs. Langtry. This has
greatly shocked the rigid Scotch fam
ily of the Malcolms, to whom a "play
actress" is still far beyond the pale.
Among Lady Malcolm's other eccen
tricities, she, when in London, always
carried her Jewel bag in her hand. This
receptacle contains some most valuable
pieces of Jewelry, among others sev
eral Immense ropes of wonderful
pearls.
A London house and all thÂ» bother
of servants that such an establishment
entails would not be at all to the liking
of Lady Malcolm, who prefers, when
she comes up to town, and this, by the
way, is pretty frequently, to go to a
hotel.
Many are the stories of her pleadings
on behalf of tired animals. She is, of
course, a Ms subscriber to all the socle
tics for dumb creatures. On one occa
sion when offering a cabman his legal
fare he began to demur, as cabmen
will, and asked for more than the 5
shillings. "Well." replied Lady Mal
colm, "if I give you 10 will you take
your horse home and give him a rest?"
Equines, old and worn out, that are
not likely to be well cared for in their
old age, Lady Malcolm takes under her
winp: and spends her life In devotion to
them. So it Is likely that her estate in
Kentucky will in all probability mean
another "home for horses."
Though not what- is termed a smart
American woman. Lady Malcolm Is a
very well-known figure in London and
Is dubbed a "perfect character" on ac
count of her love for old horses. At
Barnardiston Hall, in Suffolk, the es
tate she bought on the death of her
husband, she has no less than thirty of
them under her especial care. The Hal!,
an old and historic one. has under her
guidance been entirely changed and re
modeled, so that the stable, always
her first thought, now faces the draw
ing-room, so that Lady Malcolm. can
see all that Is done to her old pension
ers. And every morning: when In Suf
folk her Ladyship herself Inspects the
exercising of these old creatures, going
out to view the work clad in a short
skirt, ton boots and bowler hat. and
with whii> In hand. When in London
Lady Malcolm wears always two veil
ings of chiffon over her face, through
can be seen her fringe of fair
hair. For the street her hair Is con
fined with pins, but as soon as she gets
indoors it Is released from these con
fining prongs and allowed to flow down
about her shoulders.
Lady Malcolm of Poltallock is an
American by birth, her father having
been a planter in the South. Her first
husband, H. Gardner Lister, was also
an American and she became the sec
ond wife of Malcolm of Poltallock in
1897. a year after he had been made
a Baron of the United Kinsdom. The
Malcolms of Poltallock are a very old
Scottish family, and it was with very
great regret that on the death of her
husband, who died about two years
ago when traveling in the Riviera.
Lady Malcolm had to give up Poltal
lock, a place of great historic interest
in Argyllshire, Scotland. The gran
deur of the views from Poltallock
have often been spoken of in history
and. there being no direct issue. lord
ly Poltallock had to pass on to the
brother of Baron Malcolm.
LONDON. May 23.â Within the
next few months Lady Malcolm of
Poltallock will be leaving England for
the United States on a sort of house
hunting expedition, for her Ladyship
feels that she can no longer stand the
English winters and the whole of her
time in America is to be devoted to
scouring Kentucky to find some little
estate suitable for a winter home.
Sets of houses and lands there may be
plenty in the State of Kentucky, but
it may not be easy for Lady Malcolm
to discover exactly what she desires,
for her tastes are peculiar and to her
of more importance than her own
comfortable housing i3 the housing of
all the poor old horses which, wher
ever she goes, she collects and takes
care of.

ill, was asked for more ofter than that
of any other beauty, m - ith the exception
of the Queen. This seemed rather sur
prising, considering how lonp; the pres
ent Mrs. Cornwallis-West has been in
this country, but my informant con-
Fidered it due to the titled American
woman's constant social activity and
prominence. The young Duchess of
Westminster, whose husband is sup
posed to be the richest in this country,
was named as the English society
woman who#e popularity with the
buyers cf photographs is second only
to that of Lady Randolph ChurchilL
Oddly enough, the two are sisters-in
law, the Duchess, before her marriagre,
having been Miss Fhelagh West. Other
society women who undoubtedly gain a
tidy amount of pin money through the
tale of their photographs are the
Countess of Warwick, tAdy de Grey,
Lady Helen Vincent and Lady Pole
<arew, who perhaps can be described
as the most classically beautiful
women in English society. By the
wa y, I was told that among the keenest
buyers of photographs of British
women of title are American tourists
of the rentier sex.
EDNA MAY A "SELLER."
Edna May still "sells" well, but ac
ceding to the dealers the actresses
who now are in all probability making
most money out of the sale of their
likenesses are Gertie Millar, of the
"Oaiety." and Billle Burke, the Ameri
can girl who has made a hit at the
Trince of Wales'. Miss Millar is com
paratively a new-comer, but her good,
looks and talent have carried her along
50 fast that the is now the bright
particular female star at the Gaiety.
Sh<" made her debut at the Old Gaiety,
in "The Toreador," where she sang
"Keep Off the Grass" and "Captivating
Ora." and promptly became the rage.
Perhaps she might have followed the
example of Regie Boote, now Marchion
ess of Headfort. Belle Bllton, now
Lady Clancarty, and Connie Gilchrist,
now Countess of Orkney, and married
Into the peerage, but instead she be
stowed her hand upon the young com
poser of the songs with which she made
her hit, Lionel Monckton, who also
wrote "Oh! Listen to the Band." and
There is no doubt what woman it is
photograph now enjoy6 the
largest sale in this country. Queen
Alexandra enjoys this distinction, but,
of course, etiquette forbids her Maj
esty to make any profit out of the sale
of her pictures. The most popular pic
ture of the Queen is one taken in the
robes end cap of a doctor of music.
This has sold by scores of thousands.
and it is estimated that the total num
ber of the Queen's pictures disposed of
must run well into seven figures and
that her Majesty could easily make
S75M1 a year through their sale if she
<ared to do so.
There is, of course, nothing to pre
vent a beautiful society woman from
"realizing" on the sale of her pictures.
At a fashionable photograph shop in
the "West End" I was told yesterday
that the picture of an American worr
an, the former Lady Randolph Church-

that at the present moment there are
et least six women in England whose
pood looks bring them in from 5250
to 55000 a year in this way, and there
are at leaÂ«=t 100 who are in receipt of
incomes rar.ging from $250 to $1250 a
yejn- from royalties on the sale of
their photographs.
Mrs. Langtry. however, is supposed
to hold the record for this sort of
money making. When the craze over
her was at its height 800.000 photo
graphs of the "Jersey Lily" were sold
in Great Britain, their fair subject re
ceiving 6 cents per copy royalty and
clearing 550.000. Mary Anderson's pho
tographs also had a huge sale, going
at the rate of something like 100,000
a year for a decade. Maud Jeffries, the
American girl who played Mercia in
"U'ilscn B^rr.ett> t '.'Sign of the Cross,"
made 510.000 in less than two years out
of photograph royalties, while Edna
May is supposed to have done even
better. During the run of "The Belle

in this country at the rate of 5000 a

It is not perhaps yet time to say that
Dr. Elgar possesses that which shall
raise him permanently above his fel
lows and shall bring about the real
"renaissance" of English music "The
Dream of Gerontius" does indeed show
a vital power, a soaring imagination,
a fervor of religious exaltation, a
dramatic impulse, a command of the
resources of choral and orchestral
writing, that put it far above any other
piece of music brought forth in Eng
land, for generations, and that have
conquered acceptance for it wherever
it has become known, in Germany as
well as in England, and now here. But
nothing else that he has done has
equaled thl3 cantata in the hold it hag
taken upon the musical public. Not the
overture "Cockaigne," nor the songs
entitled "Sea Pictures." and "The
Pipes of Pan," nor the orchestral piece
"Contrasts." which completes the list
of his compositions that had hereto
fore been heard in this city, are enough
to confirm the impression that "The
Dream of Gerontius" has made. His
earlier works are not widely known,
and attracted little attention when they
were first brought out. The next forth
coming products of his Imagination
will be watched with much eagerness,
to see if they carry out the promise
contained in his most famous work.

Elgar Is neither a young man. nor a
beginner.

Then the singer returned to sing

The singer's "Shadow Song" evoked
the usual complimentary encore-r
more than usually well deservedâ of
the debut recital. Here was the trou
ble. Unwise counsel doubtless pre
vailed with the singer to "take" not
only one but two encores, with almost
the musical comedian's readiness. It
Is to protest here. One no more wants
to swallow a double programme than a

the first. But when it comes to three â !
In fact. I was encored out of the
place. Still, of one of the songs I
was glad, the ballad, "Daddy." sung 1
with quite charming feeling by the
singer. It showed her possessed both
of sympathy and poise.

I found Lyric Hall pretty well filled
when I got down there. Other3 be
sides myself were interested in the de
function of Mrs. Cora Hail, acd thÂ»
rise^ â phenix-like â of Mme. Adrienne
St. Clair. I may as well say now that
we probably assisted at the launching
of a prima donna â comic operatic
should be fully understood. Mme. St-
Clairâ oh lud, that it must be! â looked
every spangle of the part as she came
on. She is as handsome as. and not
unlike, Marguerite Sylva, with the
dark, piquant face, large shapeliness
and attractive personality of that Bel
gian beauty. And she can sing. It re
quired only a few notes of her "Shadow
Song" (Meyerbeer) to convince of that.
Many excellent features, indeed, has
this young woman's singing. She has a
lyric soprano of wide range, probably
three octaves, sweet, flexible and full,
and under fairly good control. Her at
tack Is noticeably secure, her intona
tion delightfully true and her colora
tura work â bar the trllls-^decidedly
good. She exhibits, however,' some
badly scarred notes In her upper
fortes, probably the result of forcing
the voice beyond its dynamic limits.
Her style yet has something of the
naivete and provincialism of her sta^s
name.
It is to be confessed that the name
it was that fetched me â "lime.
Adrtenne St. Clair." Not that the
statement of Mme. Abbie Carrington.
who has had the honor of teaching: the
lady to sin? â namely, "this California
girl will be one of the world's great sing

the name, chosen for programme pur
poses by Mrs. Cora Hall, that lured me
to her recital of last week. I had
thought the Vere de Vere extinct. With
Sweet Fifteen chewing "Ghosts" with
its gum, and "hupper" cookdom taking
to Browning societies. I had thought
the Idyllic day of the "Duchess" done.
Yet here was an "Adrienne St. Clair."
full-blown and unashamed. Did never
better Becky Sharp herself, with all
her ancestral *'Montmorenc:es." What
visions the name evoked! What pretty.
foolish echoes set a-quiver! Could the
St. Clair be as naive aa her name, her
song as artless as its Arcadian accent?
Or was she â but with further question
ings in the air I betook myself to hear
the lady warble, wishing that the god3
would throw in a hammock, an ances
tral oak or two and unlimited cara
mels.
Timely and charming among many
timely and charming things done by
the ilusic Section of tfce California
Club was the sc-ng recital of Mme.
Emilia Tojetti of last week, given
over to a programme of son?3 by the
great German lyrist. Huso Wc-if. A
few songs caly of th!3 God-gifted singer
have so far frifted this way. Denis
O'SuIlivan gave us the "Anakreon's
Grab" and the "Fussreise.** To these
Schumann-Helnk added the glorious
"Heimweh." Miss Caroline Little In
troduced the "Verborgenheit" at her
recital and the Sercbrich contribution
was the â¢ delightful "Storchenbot
schaft." To these Mme. Tojetti has
added another nine of the 500 Wolf
songs, each a gem of its kind.
The field cf Wclf's sympathy seems
practically without limit. The massive,
druidlc simplicity of "Weyla's Chant"
Is as little like the gypsy gayety of thÂ«
"Fussreise" a3 it is like* the palpitant
mysticism â tlte composer has plucked
out the very heart of the mood of
him who stands at the grave of the
great^ dead â of "Anacreon's Grave."
Again he turns Spanish troubador in
"Auf dem Grunen Balkon." and in the
love song, worthy to stand with thÂ»
"Liebestod" of "Tristan and Isolde,"
"Gehâ geliebter geh* Jetzt." he be
comes as passionately dramatic as
Wagner himself. He has humor, too,
wit, every necessary distinction of the
song maker, and seems equally con
vincing in every rnood.
Mme. Tojetti brought aa unpreten
tious sympathy and genuine reverence
to the interpretation of the songs, and
in Fred Maurer found an accompanist
who permitted no point of the diScutt
axfd delightful accompaniments to es
cape. The programme was prefaced
by a short sketch of Wolf's life and ap
preciation cf his genius by the sin;er.
and an unusual and admirable cour
tesy of the programme was the print
ing of the names of the pcet3 in whoae
lyrics Wolf has found inspiration.

"I believe you," I stammered.
'â¢That's not it," she shrieked, rapid

wistfully: "Our mother Is dead, you

"Now tell me," I asked, "what you

"What do you thlak?" Miss Aug ex
claimed. "Rosalind, Rosalind:" and she
sprang to her feet, thrust her chin in

reciting " "Dear Celia, I show more

splendid!
"I never did run to Juliet, but I'm
dying simply to do Rosalind. Such dif
ferent ideas people have had of what
I should do. Mr. Springer engaged
me for, above all things, a Kremer
melodrama. I had. of course, the lib
erty of refusing the play when I saw
it â and did. Imagine me in this sort
of thin^: 'Ha! what is the hour?
Alas, vre have no clock! but there is
Mrs. O'Flannigan downstairs â kyind,
good scul â ehe-she-e will not refuse to
tell me the time' â wow!
"The Fatal Wedding," I laughed.
"Exactly," M5ss Aug chuckled.
"Then, when I refused the play, Mr.
Springer asked me what in something
('thunder' probably) I wanted. "Oh,
Clyde Fitch, Gus Thomas or Martha
Mortpn.' I said. Well, we went right
off to Martha Morton then, and she
cair.2 to see me that night In my
specialty and promised me a play. She
wrote itâ 'A Four-leaf Clover,' with a
kind of P.osina Yokes part for me, as
sweet a thing as you ever saw. After
all sorts of ups and downs â oh, I've
had lots cf themâ Flo Ziegfeld made a
contract to star me in the piece. But
there were delays and I became im
patient and at last bought my release
âfrom a man like Ziegf eld. Did ' you
ever hear of such folly?"
"It wasn't wise," I said mi!dly.
"Then I got another manager, Lean
der Sire, who was to produce the play
at the Bijou," Â¦ Miss Aug went on,
eyes aflame. "I had my company all
chosen, Arnold Daly as lead and
Teddy Vokes â a good company. There
were two acts built, and then Mr. Sire
went broke and disappeared. It
seems that fate is against me so far
as the legitimate goes. Still, I
mightn't do well, and I'd rather be a
first-class chambermaid than a sec
ond-class actress!"
Approving, I asked her then If she
sang.
She threw me a laughing "Yes,
though my doctor says I'd have more
friends if I didn't! Sing! You don't
know how much I like to sins. I
spent every penny I had on lessons â
not one a day, but five â from Dr.
Dossil-tin New York: I studied with
Mr. Plumpton, too, in Parts. I adore
voices. Ada Rehan's! Brown â no,

for speaking purposes, though."
"And next year you do 'Humpty

"Um," she nodded.
"And this season â "
"Buckle down to good hard work In
these burlesques â hope I'll get good,

And then Miss Aug's pickles ar

and tea, as she would touch nothing

over it.
"I'm horrid," sh-> decided, crisply
demolishing a pickle. "I don't like

At the recent commencement exer
cises at Berkeley a clever paper was
read treating Â¦with the social side of the
college girl. Now, time was when to
admit of a social side In a college girl's
personality was to admit of weakness â
of lack of serious purpose. College was
primarily a place for work, and, logic
ally enough, no place for play. But a
revolution has come to the minds of
men, a clearing away of the cobwebs,
and It has come to be recognized in
college, as elsewhere in the world, that
God the Father has created us social
creatures, largely dependent upon each
other for pleasure and entertainment,
an4 that the cultivation of this thor
oughly human side of our natures 1b
wholly compatible with the laws of
God. and even a fulfillment of a divine
intention. Therefore are the serious
minded faculty men who preside over
the academic shades of Berkeley and
Stanford awake to this normal inclina
tion of the men and maids who come
to them to drink from the Pierian
spring, and with a wholesome interest
In the pleasures of the frat and the sd
rorlty the social education goes on with
the academic, and the coalition makes
for the developed college man or maid.
And from the social phase of develop
ment much benefit accrues to the outer
world, which looks more and more to
the leadership of the learned in all
things that concern the higher plane of
life. That being the case, it. is not too
much to expect that as the college maid
âand It is she rather more than the
man that sets the standard â will bring
into the "smart set" a higher regard to
general culture, a more serious note but
none the less pleasurable, and per
haps â who knows? â a higher moral
plane, since morals follow so closely
the amusements and pastimes of peo
ple. Albeit, we can see, even In the
morning of feminine college life, a de
velopment of companionable, sensible,
understandable women, neither prudes
"nor boydens, v neither sylphs nor neme
ses, but healthy, normal women, with
an Intelligent understanding of the

people it. Here's to them, and may

every officer and man of the Japanese attacking columns' was shot down. Finally, after many of these futile charges, a handful of Japanese succeeded in piercing the Russian line. They
were quickly reinforced, and in a last brilliant dash the Russian positions were carried. .

on the enemy's trenches, the Japanese
infantry advancing meanwhile to with

worked forward to within 400 meters of
the Russian lines, where they encoun
tered and other entanglements.
They succeeded in discovering an open
ing in these obstacles, and getting fin
ally to within 200 meters of the Russian
trenches they rushed for the line. Sev
eral successive charged were made, but
every officer and man in' the attacking
parties was shot down twenty or thirty
meters from the line. The charges were
then stopped and the Japanese artillery
renewed. its preparatory fire on the enr

Toward', evening.:. a detachment of
Japanese carried a section "of the, Rus

success, sprang forward, and then the
entire line swept up the hill, driving
the Russians from their positions.
â¢ It was In '! the desperate infantry
charges* that the : Japanese sustained
the majority of their losses.
The Japanese began the fighting by
bringing all their field guns into action
und concentrating their fire on the em
placements on the hill. By 11 o'clock

TOK1O, May 2&â The Japanese as
sault on Nanshan Hill was one of the
fiercest and bloodiest affairs in modern
warfare. In the earlier rushes of the
engagement eveVy man participating
was shot down before he reached the
first line of Russian trenches. It was
found necessary to cease these infantry
charges and renew the artillery fire
from the rear before the final and suc
cessful assault on the Russian position
could be made. The success of this
assault was brought about by one de
tachment of Japanese troops, more in
trepid than their comrades, who suc
ceeded in piercing the Russian line.
A splendid stroke of fortune was the
discovery and the destruction by the
Japanese of the electric wires leading
to' the mines at the eastern foot of Nan
shan Hilk This prevented the Russians
exploding these mines when the Japa
nese'infantry crossed the ground where
they, had been placed. It is possible
that' the fortunes of the day hinged
upon these mines. If the Russians had
been able to <vcplode them at the right
time the losses among the Japanese
troops wouldphave been tremendous,
and it is possible also that the Rus
sians would have been able to hold the
hill.
Nanshan was splendidly defended.
Nearly fifty guns of various sizes
were mounted on the various em
placements, and there were also. two
batteries of quick-firing Held pieces. :
The artillery was sheltered behind loop-'
holed trenches on the terraces of the
hill. The infantry manning the field
pieces ran with them around the. hill,
thus using the guns for the protection
of the most important points.

regarding the payment of Interest on
the awards, there was no precedent.
The two remaining questions were
about citizenship, where the laws of.

mixed commission â¢ in 1869, the con
vention constituting this commission
having provided that -the Venezuelan
Government should by its Congress
make provision without delay for the
payment of these awards.-. There was
a delay in the payment covering six
teen years. Venezuela denied the right
to collect interest, since there was no
specific provision for it by the two
governments.
Mr. Plumley held that interest at
the rate 3 per cent, the Venezuelan
statutory rate when no rate is named
in the contract, should be allowed
from the time when the Venezuelan
Congress ratified the terms of the con
vention, accepted the findings of the
commission and made the first pay
ment on account.
Regarding the dispute as to citizen
ship, England set up the claim that a
man born in Venezuela of British
parents resident in Venezuela, and al
ways residing himself in Venezuela,
was a British subject under the consti
tution of Venezuela existing at the time
of his birth. This construction of the
constitution Venezuela opposed, and in
sisted that he was a Venezuelan by
birth and domicile. The latter conten
tion was sustained by the umpire.
CONFLICT OF LAWS.
In the last decision Great Britain
urged that In case of a British subject
domiciled in Venezuela who died there
and who was married to a. Venezuelan
woman, such widow became a British
subject by such marriage and retained
it after his decease, and could appear
as a claimant for a cause accruing to
her husband in his lifetime. Venezuela
held that under the Venezuelan laws
at the decease of her husband, she be
ing then a resident of Venezuela, " she
reverted to her status prior to the mar
riage. It appeared that the claim in
Question accrued and the husband died
before the holding of the convention
constituting the commission. Mr.
Plumley held that the claim of Great
Britain was in accord with its law on
the subject, that the position of Vene
zuela was in accordance with Its law,
and there being thus a conflict of laws
the law of domicile must prevail, and
therefore the claim â¢ of Great Britain
was denied.

day.
The Palace Damascus, an edifice so
old that its builder, its occupants and
Its history are lost in the obscurity of

cured for the fair. The structure is
not to be a replica, but the actual
building will be brought piece by piece

and most beautiful collection of Greek

CALL, BUREAU, WORLD'S FAIR,
ST. LOUIS, May 28.-rThe Dunkard Na
tional Convention, which is usually at
tended by 10,000 or 15,000 delegates from
all parts of the country, will, most like
ly convene in California in 1906. Tennes
see has been chosen for next ' year's
gathering, and a little effort by Califor
nians will secure the one following for
the Golden State. The- Bishops of the
sect practically gave a promise of the
convention 1 of, 1906 to the California
representatives, who went from here to
Carthage. Mo., with hopes of securing
that of 1905. " .
California's sister State, Nevada, Is
malting herself known at the fair. She
has already, won fame for her hospital
ity and exDects to win fame and more
medals with her mineral and agricul
tural displays. â¢ At Chicago Nevada
took first prizes for flour and wheat
and also for honey and potatoes. She
took twenty-nine first prizes there, and,
as one of her commissioners modestly
puts it, she exDects to take them all
at St. Louis.
â¢ Nevada has a cozy little building
under the maples just across from the
pretentious Pennsylvania structure,
and from far up the somber counten
ance of William Penn looks down upon
the World's Fair home of this younger
member of the family of States, full of
the throb of Western energy and am
bition. In the Nevada building are some
relics that are drawing many visitors.
One is the. lash of the whip used by
Hank Monk on the evening he landed
Horace Greeley in Placerville after the
memorable ride taken by the famous
editor in a California stage coach. It is
owned by Thomas Heidenricht of Car
son City. ' ,
"Borax Bill!" who as a baby was
William Parkinson, is probably the
chef d'ouvre of Nevada's display. He
is becoming known to all the fair vis
itors. Bill, abaft of twenty mules and
with every ribbon fully at his com
mand, Is goingto set all the West back
half a century in its efforts to appear
civilized to the effete East.
Of gold ore in her display in the
Mines building Nevada shows a won
derful varietyâ the greatest variety she
claims. Even sylvanite, supposed to
exist only in Colorado, Is exhibited.
Pieces of ore are shown, a ton of which
would make one rich. The "Yerring
ton nugget," a chunk of rock luminous
with ruby silver, weighs 271 pounds
and is worth JSOOO. Tonopah is well
represented and displays are on the
way from Goldfields and the Search
light mine.
But it is in agriculture, that Nevada
sees her permanent future and her
cereals, figs, apricots,' potatoes, apples,
honey and melons are to be shown
in abundance. She .has rich valleys
and they produce unstintedly. Visitors
will be told of the 1,500,000 acres of
arid land, rich as any on earth, that
Is to be watered by Government canals
next year and thrown open to settle
ment.
Charles Pierce of 14 Turk street, San

WASHINGTON. May 28.â Rear Ad
miral Jewell reported by cable to. the
Navy Department to-day the arrival of
thÂ«~r European squadron - under âhis
command, embracing the Olympic, the
Baltimore. and the Cleveland, at Hor
ta, -Azores,. V Orders were sent to the
admiral to. proceed to Tangier.
The kidnapers of Perdicaris'and his
stepson, Varley, in Morocco, have
submitted, their terms for fansom and
the State Department has decided that
they are absolutely impossible of ac
ceptance.
Bandit Raissouli demanded that the
Moorish forces should be withdrawn
from the district in which his band
operated, leaving him in" control. He
asked for a large money ran
som to be collected from the Gover
nors of Tangier and Fez, who happen
to be bitter enemies. He further de
manded absolute immunity for himself
and his followers from pursuit or pun
ishment for the kidnaping and other
crimes which they had committed in
the past. To cap the climax ,of hia
demands, Raissouli insisted that the
United States and Great Britain
should solemnly guarantee the observ
ance by the Moorish Government of
the foregoing stipulations.
Secretary Hay had a conference
with the President and it was agreed
that Raissouli's terms could not be
met. To grant them would be equiv
alent to forcing the Sultan of Morocco
to abdicate in favor of a brigand, so
far as a considerable part of the
Moorish trial was concerned.
The next step is in doubt. Admiral
Chadwick will be at Tangier by to
morrow morning on the Brooklyn, to
be followed in the course of a day or
two by the remainder of his fleet. As
the utmost confidence is imposed in
the discretion and judgment of the
admiral, the present disposition is to
leave him a free hand to deal with
this case in co-operation with Consul
General Gummere.

PARIS, May 28.â Thc Government's
advices concerning the details of the
Armenian massacres are not yet defi
nite, but the official view is that the
depredations are very grave. -Deputy
de Pressenz (Socialist), who has con
fidential relations with the Foreign Of
fice, has received a telegram from Baku
saying the Turkish forces operating
against the Armenians consisted of 12,
000 regulars and 16,000 Kurds, with fif
teen guns. The dispatch further as
serts that forty-three .villages were
burned and that the inhabitants .were
killed. The male Armenians are said
to have made a desperate resistance
on the summit of Mount Antok.
De Pressenz has forwarded the dis
patch to Foreign Minister Delcasse,
with a letter announcing that he will
question the Minister in the Chamber
of Deputies concerning "what steps
French diplomacy intends to take to
put a stop to this lamentable crime."
Some time ago. when Vial and Miss
Straka, eloped, an attempt was made
to procure Indictments 'against them
on serious charges, because at that time
Straka and his wife believed Vial to be
their son. The Grand Jury refused to !
indict them because of lack of evidencfa.
Six months ago Straka arrived in
New york from Bohemia, He sent for
his wife and daughter, and while they
were crossing the ocean they met Vial,
who was working as a deck hand ' on
the ocean 'liner. When the mother saw
the young man* she embraced him and
declared he was her son, who left his
home in Bohemia when 14 years old.
The assertions of the mother were
denied by the young man, but he said
he was willing to pose as her son if she
insisted. They came to Chicago and, as
Detrick Straka, Vial went to work and
helped to support the family. .
His love for Anna Straka grew, and
a short time ago they disappeared from
Straka's home. They furnished a flat
and were making; preparations to be
married when arrested. 'â¢.
. They were taken to the station and
one'week ago were arraigned in court.
The case was continued, and last
Thursday it v was again called. VfSI said
he was born - in Germany, while . the
"long lost" son was born in Bohemia.
He said he had posÂ»d a3 a son,* but
his story convinced Justice .Sabath that
the. young man was not "the son of
Straka and his wife.
The mother still insisted Â¦ that, she
knew. Vial was her son. while thc father
agreed with; the Justice. It was then
decided that Vial and Miss Straka

Hall had been employed as a clerk

PARIS, Mav 26.â Premier Combes'
announcement that the question of sep
aration of state and church would
come in January has drawn attention
to the law already formulated by the
committee on the separation . of the
church and state. It is a sweeping
measure, the opening clauses reading
as follows: "The republic assures free
dom of conscience and it guarantees
the free exercise of religion without re
striction except for the preservation of
public order, f
"The republic will neither protect nor
pay salaries nor subventions under any
form whatever, to anv denominations!.
It will not recognize any minister of
religion and will not furnish any build
ing for the services of any denomina
tion or for the lodging of any of its
ministers."
The measure further abolishes the
concordat, suppresses the French Em
bassy at the Vatican and makes de
tailed provision for the disposal of the
Government's extensive possession of
church property.
In comparison with the present re
gime, under/which the clergy are sal
aried officials, and, the Minister of Pub
lic Worship is one of the members of
the Cabinet, the foregoing makes a
striking change in long and broad sec
ular conditions.- Â¦ â¢

LOS ANGELES, May 28.â Eventful
were the proceedings at both sessions
of the locomotive engineers' conven
tion to-day. The chair so tragically va
cated Friday by First Grand Chief T. B.
Ingraham was filled by William B.
Prenter. Grand Engineer W. S. Stone
was returned to office by almost unan
imous vote, and the insurance branch
was deprived of an officer who, with
President Futch, has since 1896 so ad
ministered the association in this as to
place it foremost among fraternal in
surance organizations.
The event of this afternoon's execu
tive session was the election of Grand
Chief Stone to succeed himself by a
vote that was a surprise even to his
most sanguine friends. But one ballot
was necessary for a choice. Chief Stone
received 430 votes, Matt Shay 107 and
C. W. Gardner 41.
The concluding hours of the conven
tion were occupied in the casting of an
informal ballot for first assistant chief.
There were nearly forty aspirants. The
informal ballot resulted in placing in
the fore C. P. Curtis, F. A. Burgess, E.
W. Hurly, M. W. Cadle. H. E. Willis
and Peter Kilduff. These names will be
voted on Monday.

"One of the fortunate incidents in
the attack was the discovery of a mine
wire at the eastern foot of Nanshan
Hill, the cutting of which prevented
heavy losses."
"There the wire entanglements and
mines lay before us, and the enemy's
infat:try and the machine guns, which
yet remained unabated, kept up their
fire. Finally our infantry forces ap
proachod within 200 meters of the ene
my's position and tried several
charges, but they still proved unsuc
cessful, officers and men all falling
within twenty or thirty meters of the
enemy's position. Thereupon our ar
tillery besan a heavy firing, and in
ihe evening, during the severest can
nonading, the last charge was made
and a breach was opened with srreat
diitlculty. through which we gained the
whole height, expelled the enemy and
captured all the gunÂ» on the forts.
WASHINGTON, May 28.â The Jap

the following dispatch:
"TOKIO, May 28.â Following are
further details of the attack on Kin
chou: The attack on the enemy at
Nanshan Hill commenced at 2:35 a. m.
on the 25th. The enemy's defensive
works were all of a most permanent
nature and their artillery consisted of
fifty guns of various 'calibers and two
quick-firing field artillery companies.
Their infantry ranged in two or thre*
lines In covered trenches, with loop
hoJes and placed machine guns on im
portant points, and offered a stubborn
resistance. We ranged all our field
guns upon the forts and the enemy's
principal artillery and silenced eleven
of them, and while the quick firers,
which previously retired to Nanshan,
continued firing until night, our artil
lery concentrated fire on the enemy's
trenchce and our infantry advanced
within 400 or 500 meters of the enemy's
position.

SEOUL. Korea, May 28. â The kind

sending to the homes of two wounded
Cossacks photographs of the men,
showing them to be alive and safe.
Edwin V. Morgan, the United States

to the stories which are constantly

found the country people to be quiet,

Japanese Give Their Prisoners No
Cnuso for Complaint,
KINDLY TOWARD CAPTIVES.
Captain Jakovleff, former commander
of the Russian battleship Petropav
lovsk. who was wounded when the ship
was destroyed at Port Arthur April
IS, in an interview regarding the pos
sibility of the Japanese capturing Port
Arthur, declared that it would take
150,000 men with magnificent artillery
*"If the Japanese lost 3000 men in tak
ing Kinchou," the officer said, "they
â¢*ill lose 20,000 men at least if they
try to take Port Arthur. Even with
euch sacrifice I consider the capture
$f the fortress to be. impossible. Port
Arthur, in my opinion, is impregnable
as long as its food and ammunition
hold out."
The same officer said the works at
Kinchou had been hastily constructed
and were no criterion of the works at
Port Arthur, which could not be
flanked where the forts were scientific
ally erected and connected to support
each other.

and in its vicinity with composure, as
beins the fortune of war, but he was
Considerably agitated by the later ra
pf.rts that General Fock had not suc
ceeded in savins the Russian guns.
An officer of the general staff said
that thÂ».!oss of suns was unavoidable,
V confined to those mounted on the
works on the hills below Kinchou, as
they could not be carried away when
the P.v:ssians retired, but the breech
blocks, he addc-<l, had been removed.

EXTENT OF JAPANESE VICTORY.
There is no attempt here to disguise
th*r fact that the gucceesful forcing of
the neck of Kwantung Peninsula prop
er put? a practical end to resistance to
the enemy until he reaches the actual
fortifications around Port Arthur. Al
, though there are many strong positions
in th*Â» more than twenty-five miles be
fore the perimeter of the fortress is
reached, the authorities admit that the
â¢ Russians can offer JHtle resistance, and
must now retire within the fortress
and undertake to defend themselves
againpt a siege.
There is no intention of purchasing
any South American warships offered
by private firms. Neither has Russia
any intention of buying foreign mer
channn^n for transport purposes. Four
Harr-burp-American liner? were bought
by tlie merchant marine department
jlvA turned over to the navy to become
part of the volunteer fleet.
It has been found necessary to put
the battleship Orel, which recently
sank at her moorings at Krons"tadt
owing to her sea valves being left open,
and was subsequently refloated, into
the drydock. and possibly she may not
accompany the Baltic fleet to the Far
East.
AKhough work ip being hurried night
and day to prepare the Baltic fleet for
â¢ service, it is fpared now that it cannot
be ready to sail for the Far East be
fore* Oct'iber. The delay is considered
especially unfortunate in view of the
situation at Port Arthur, where the ar
riv'n! of the fleet before the fall of the
fortress would compel the raising of
the siege.
"On May 25 a Japanese force, con
sisting of a battalion of infantry and

A great deal, of course, would de

Russian guns could not be Judged by
the results on the Yalu, where the
Russians had only light advance guard

which the Japanese were bringing up
for UFe in Manchuria. Port Arthur,

God save the Xevka on a cruise."
to accomplish the task.
Asked as to the- number of men in
the Port Arthur garrison. Captain
Jakovleff said it was much larger than
was stated In the telegraphic reports â
much more than 25.000 â but he declined
to state what would be the exact num
ber when the defenders of the Kinchou
positions retired within the fortress.
He discussed with some detail the
Â¦lifflculties of the approach. After the
Â¦)Uter line of the fortifications was
Â¦eached, said he, a number of de
.ached positions must be captured be
fore the enemy could even reach the
inner ring of defenses. The taking of
each position would necessitate a
bloody battle and their capture would
leave the citadel untouched, and, to his
mind, impregnable.

a quart bottle at the girl, which cut a

Receipts of Domestic Gold Partly Off
set Average Loss Resulting From
Sub-Treasury Operations.
NEW YORK, May 2.S.â The Finan
cier this week says: The striking fea
ture of the oflioial statement of the
New York Associated Banks was the
unexpected gain of $16,2S4,900 in casn
holdings. This was largely due to the
fact that the average of about J7.500.000
of the disbursement by the treasury
in the previous week of the S9.000.00O
to the republic of Panama was in
cluded in the cash receipts of last
week, and also to the fact that the
net receipts of money, resulting from
the interbank movement, were almost
unprecedentedly large for the season,
amounting to nearly $10,500,000. The
average loss to the banks resulting
from s'lb-treasury operations and gold
pxjKins was partly offset by receipts
of domestic gold. It is noteworthy that
the gain in specie was more than $10,
000,000 greater than that in legal ten
ders. The latter, however, are at the
maximum of the year. Loans were de
creased ?16,070,100, following a liquida
tion in this item in the previous week
of $22,27r.,lU0, making $3S.445,00(Â» in the
fortnight. The decrease last week was
largely due, as was the case in the
previous week, to the cancellation on
public debts.

Sends Message to Mrs. Quay on Learn
- ins of Senator's Death.
PRESIDENT S Y3I PATH IZES.
HAHRISBURG, Pa., May 28. â A
strong belief prevails among prom
inent politicians that as a tribute to
the memory of the dead leader the
Governor will bestow the Senatorial
mantle of the deceased Senator on the
shoulders of Richard R. Quay, the
Senator's favorite son. The theory ad
vanced for this prediction is that the
selection of the son would not furnish
an advantage to any of the many ap
plicants who will endeavor to be
elected for the full term at the meet
ing of the General Assembly next
January.
Politicians Believe That Senatorial
Mantle Will Fall to K. K. Quay.
SOX MAY SUCCEED HIM.
took his seat two days later, and his
term would have expired March 3, 1905.
Socially "Matt" Quay, as he was
generally known, was an agreeable, un
pretentious gentleman. As a politician
he was said to be a sort of Talleyrand
â strong in a certain finesse of strategy
and skilled in the best art of party
management. He was always a direct
and silent worker, following the short
est course to attain the desired end and
despising all claptrap and noise. It has
been said that during his half-century
of office-holding Quay, except in two
cases, resigned each office only to take
one higher in the scale.
They strenuously deny' any knowl
edge of Miss Wiggins' whereabouts,
but admit that she was in their com
pany just before she disappeared.
Mrs. Wiggins daily besieges the po
lice station in quest of her daughter,
who, she declares, was abducted and
made a victim of foul play.
BUTTE. Mont., May 25. â Late last
night the Sheriff's officers captured
Frank Bell, W. E. Evans and Joseph
Lynch, wanted in connection with the
disappearance of Edna Wiggins, the
lÂ»j-year-old girl Vho strangely dis
appeared in this cit>\ eight days ago.
The three young men were appre
hended at Logan, Mont., while they
were beating their way East on a
freight train.

Through it all his mental energies
never fagged. He joked grimly, at
times and was cheerful in his com
ments.
Ten day3 ago he began the arrange
ment of his personal affairs looking
toward the end. The lasf papers were
not signed until yesterday morning,
but the arrangements were all made.
Quay showed all the stoicism of an
Indian in his last illness. He held out
no hope of recovery and refused to be
lieve it was possible. Coolly and firm
ly he took leave of his dearest friends.
Thursday last he asked to be taken to
his famous library, remarking to his
attendants:
"I want to see my books once more
before I die."
Senator Quay expected death, and
told his friends so. The last call he
made at the White House he told Pres
ident Roopovelt that he expected never
to recover and would hardly see him
again. To Attorney General Knox he
gave thfÂ» same information.
QUAY EXPECTED DEATH.
On his return from the woods, how
ever. Quay was bronzed as a veteran
and looked sturdy enough to live years.
He celebrated his seventieth birthday
at Beaver last fall and at the time;
seemed in excellent health. The loss of
weight, however, distressed him day in
and day out. going constantly to a
scale to see what his weight was. He
dropped off so persistently that the
alarm which pervaded his own mind
spread to friends and family. The re
sult was that he forsook hfs duties in
the United States Senate and betook
himself to Florida, hoping that thÂ«
mild weather there would bring relief,
but Florida failed tr- restore vitality.
Tl.e Senator then went back to Wash
ington, and soon after was taken to
Philadelphia, where he was placed
under the treatment of two eminent
specialists of that city. They ordered
him to Atlantic City, hoping the sea air
would sid in hi^ recovery, but the loss
cf flesh continued gradually. Finding
that Atlantic City didMiot bring about
recovery, the physicians advised" him
to return to Washington. There his
condition continued unchanged.
He began to lose fleshâ at first grad
ually, but later pound by pound. His
stomach refused to assimilate the food
It got, and, nutrition failing, weakness
followed.'
Senator Quay in health was a great
eater, and his trouble of later years
dated from an overdraught on his vital
system due to heavy eating, smoking
and the great nervous strain which he
underwent. Last summer, after the po
litical situation had cleared up in the
State, Quay decided upon a long out
ing. Accompanied by two friends he
went into the heart of the Great Maine'
wilderness, traveling miles' and living
in the open. At that time he complained
of weakness and continued loss of
strength.
PRIELVDS BECOME ALARMED.
BEAVER, Pa., May 2S.â Colonel
Matthew Stanley Quay, senior Senator
from Pennsylvania, died peacefully at
2:48 o'clock this afternoon, after an ill
ness which had been more or less per
sistent for the last year, which took a
turn for the worse ten days ago and
which the doctors diagnosed as chronic
gastritis. The funeral will be held next
Tuesday afternoon and the remains
will be interred in the family burial
plat in Beaver Cemetery.
? Senator Quay's illness was a recur
rence of the trouble that beset him dur
ing the latter part of 11)00 and the
early days of January, 1901, when he
was undergoing the strain of a des
perate flght for re-election to the Sen
ate.

middle of the stream the horse step
ped into a deep hole, fell and threw
the rider into the water. The swift
current carried Herbert down stream
and he went under water twice. When
he came up the second time he struck
the wire fence that caught his- cloth
ing. When he recovered conscious
ness he drew himself on shore.

Resolved, second â That if this report
is adopted thereafter the above pro

be submitted to the General Conference
in order to ascertain whether the legal
constitutional vote of two-thirds of
the members present and voting shall
be given; and
Resolved, thirdâ If such should be
the result the Bishops shall be re
quested to submit the proposition to
the members of the annual conferences
and of the lav electoral conferences,
which shall meet In the years 1907 and
1908, for their adoption of the said
amendment to the constitution.
LOS ANGELES. May 28. â The
Methodist General Conference to-night
decided by a practically unanimous
vote to amend the church constitution
so as to provide for the election of
Bishops of other than the white race.
This question was one of the most
significant programmed for considera
tion by the conference. The matter
came from the committee on episco
pacy as the result of memorials from
several annual conferences favoring
the election of colored Bishops to pre
side as general superintendents.
Chairman J. M. Buckley, in present
ing the report of the committee, char
acterized the recommendation as one
of the most far-reaching importance.
It was an action, he said, as weighty
as any that had been taken by' any
General Conference of recent years.
The report of the committee read in
part:
Concerning memo-rials from the Ten
nessee; East Tennessee, North Caro
lina, South Carolina, Florida, Missis
sippi, Texas and Lexington conferences
requesting the General Conference to
provide for the election of Bishops of
African descent, who shall be assigned
to the presidency of conferences, con
sisting wholly or chiefly of ministers
of African descent, respectfully re
port:
That in the present state of our fun
damental law a constitutional objec
tion is raised to .the ' granting of the
request of said memorialists; but there
having been referred to tins committee
by the General Conference a memorial
from the Rock River conference to
change the fundamental law so as to
make possible the realization of the
desire of the memorialists and to ac
complish other important objects,
therefore,
Resolved, firstâ That this General
Conference propose the following
amendment to the constitution: To
strike out from the third restrictive
rule paragraph 67, section G, of the
discipline of 1900. all after the disjunc
tive "but" and Insert tne words, "may
elect a Bishcp or Bishops for work
among particular races and languages,
or for any of our foreign missions,
limiting their episcopal jurisdiction to
the same respectively," so that the
whole paragraph shall read:
"The General Conference shall not
change or alter any part or rule
of our government so as to do
away with the episcopacy or de
stroy the plan of our itinerant gen
eral superintendency, but may elect a
Bishop or Bishops for work among
particular races and languages or for
any of our- foreign missions, limiting
their episcopal jurisdiction to the same,
respectively."
SAXTA ROSA, May 28.â This was the
third and closing 'day of the Healds
burg floral carnival. It was a splendid
event and entirely successful. The
closing day was devoted to merriment,
under the rule of King Rex. The pre
vious monarch, Queen Isabel, had abdi
cated after placing a crown on the
head of the jovial new sovereign.
The coronation of the king took place
on the same stand on which Queen
Isabel received her floral crown Thurs
day morning. ' Immediately preceding
the crowning Rex came into town with
his cavalcade of horsemen and chariots.
Following the ceremony there was a
fantastic parade. The masquerade ball
of King Rex took place to-night.
The carnival has been a delightful
event and praise has been accorded the
committee In charge for the floral fea
tures in the parade and the decora
tions. Hundreds of visitors remained
to witness the closing features of the
three days' exhibit.

AUBURN. May 28. â The Placer
County bank robber is still at large
and as yet the officers have no clew.
A detective arrived from San Francisco
last night and Sheriff Keena, who was
In Los Angeles at. the time of the rob
bery, came home to-day.
There is now no doubt that the man
whom Constable Leak relieved of his
hat Thursday evening was the robber.
It was dusk and the fellow was several
hundred yards away, but one of Leak's
bullets took the man's hat off. With
the hat were found some strips of an
undershirt and a World's Fair cata
logue. Leak's theory is that the rob
ber was tearing his shirt into strips
in order to make a belt with which to
carry the $5000 ho stole.

the Mexican cotton boll weevil can be
realized from the fact that the in
jury thus far done in the infected por
tion of Texas alone Is estimated by
the Department of Agriculture at
$15,000,000.
If Cook's discovery Is followed by
the introduction of the Guatemalan
ant Into Texas and if the insect does
the same work there that it does In
the uplands of Central America, it Is
no exaggeration to call this find worth
to the American cotton raisers a quar

Hearst Men Win In Hawaii.

The question of the sale of impure
milk in San Francisco came up for a
hearing In an address by Miss Kath
arine Adams before the Association of
Collegiate Alumnae, California branch,
in the gymnasium of the South Park
Settlement, S6 South Park, at 2:15
o'clock yesterday afternoon. After
reading the report to the Board of
Health of the committee especially ap
pointed to inspect the existing condi
tions in the dairies in and around San
Francisco, Miss Adams went on to say
that she had made her own personal
investigations in the interest of the as
sociation, and that the conditions were
horrible. Animals and men were housed
in dirty, unsanitary, ill ventilated and
unlighted barns, the arrangements for
washing bottles and cans being Insuf
ficient and the operation perfunctory.
She had selected three of the best
dairies" in which to make investigations
and reported the following as the result
of her inspection:
"Imagine a long, low shed, the roof
scarcely six feet high, In which are im
prisoned nine rows of cows, thirty to a
row, with hardly room for them to
move in, in a barn filled with the ac
cumulation of years of filth, and, in ad
dition, another shed containing 300 more
cows. In one corner of the shed the
calves were kept, -and probably never
saw the light of day from their birth
until they were sent to the butcher.
FILTH ABOUNDS.
"The provisions for washing the' bot
tles were Inadequate, and the men,
chiefly of the ignorant class, scarcely
submerged the bottles, and never rinsed
them. The bottling was done in the
same place where some of the men
slept, and the room contained swarms
of Hies. The cooling room was directly
off the stable, separated from it by a
rail, over which the milk was passed.
There is one model dairy in Berkeley,
the school of dairying connected with
the University of California, but the
work is limited owing to lack of funds.
The dairymen claim that It is impossi
ble to make changes except at immense
cost, and that competition does not al
low of such expenditure. Hence two
things stand in the way of reform â
the unwillingness of the people to pay
more for milk and the impossibility of
getting better men owing to the union.
Dairymen have said that they have
had to fill the places of discharged men
with union men who have been dis
charged from other places for the same
offense."
When Miss Adams had finished the
following resolution was put before the
meeting and carried:
"Whereas, Milk is recognized as one
of the most important of foods; and
whereas, it is of the utmost importance
to any community to have a sufficient
pure milk supply; therefore be it
"Resolved, That the Association of
Collegiate Alumnae heartily approves
of the work of the Board of Health of
this city In investigating the sources
of the supply of market milk in San
Francisco; and be it further
"Resolved, That we unanimously sec
ond the recommendation made to the
Board of Health by its special com
mittee on . May 26 last to investigate
the oxisting conditions of the milk
supply. "KATHARINE ADAMS,
"EDITH S. HAMMOND,
"MRS. G. R. CH1LDS."
PRACTICAL PATRIOTISM.
Fairfax H. Wheelan was introduced,
and spoke on the work of the Mer
chants' Association. After paying : a
high compliment to the ladies, he im
dlately took up the milk question and
showed that beneficial reforms could
be accomplished, as was shown by the
work of a former milk inspector, Mr.
Dockery, who reduced the mortality
among children in this city Just 50 per
cent In eight months. Then he went
on to illustrate the work of the Mer
chants' Club in securing better light
ed and paved streets, salt water in
street sprinkling, removing of unused
tracks of streetcar companies and the
substitution of electric for horse cars,
the securing ojf various conventions to
San Francisco and many improve
ments which other cities have copied
and enlarged on. He closed with a
strong appeal to the women to urge
upon all their male friends the duties
of citizenship and the necessity of ap
pearing at the polls.
Other business before the meeting
was the election of officers for next
year. They are as follows: President,
Mrs. A. A. Graupner; vice president,
Dr. Edith Hammond; recording secre
tary, Mrs. Moody; corresponding sec
retary. Miss Mary McDougald; treas
urer. Miss Estelle Young. The board
of directors comprises Mrs. C. . "W.
Slack, Miss Cornelia Campbell, Miss
Alice Hays and Miss Edith Bridges.
Announcement was made that the
alumnae would probably send thirty
five delegates to the national conven
tion at St. Louis. Also a request by
Mrs. Drew asking the members to co
operate in listing household aidsâ that
is, people who would work by the hour
as companions "or servants.
Lloyd Eaton Dies In Nome.
Lloyd Eaton, son of Frederick W.
Eaton, auditor of the Pacific States
Telephone Company, died recently of
lung trouble in Nome, where he resided
for. the last four years. The deceased
was one of the promising young men
of this city, where he was born thirty
six years ago. During the gold excite
ment In Alaska the young man started
north with the object of securing his
share of the wealth that offered to
men that cared to. brave the dangers
of the frozen land. He succeeded In
bo far as acquiring wealth, but un-
fortunately the climaffe was more than
he could stand. Hia brother, Ward
Eaton, will leave here by the steamer
St. Paul with the object of -bringing
the body and the widow and child of
the deceased home.

Dr. Ragan had this to say: "I doubt
if dairy interests should be carried on
at all in San Francisco County. This
is a new conclusion I arrived at after
rny visit to Marin County. Every con
dition favorable to the purity of milk
can be found there and when the law
requires the dairymen to adopt a san
itary system and abide by It the public
may be assured of the best results.
The climate is Just the thing. There is
no fog and if man thrives in such an
atmosphere why should not cattle?
"Upon hygienic conditions depends
the mortality of great cities and this
cannot be better emphasized than in
matter of milk supply. There are
sloping hills and the finest of grazing
lands. Even if the dairymen of San
Francisco should construct new barns,
my opinion In this respect would not
be altered, for there would be no
meadows, permitting cows to be
milked in the open air, and'no proper
sunlight or ventilation or running
water, as in creeks, to purify their
premises.
"We intend to press this matter of
pure milk to an issue. It is of vital
importance to good health, and every
possible action will be taken that Will
tend to the betterment of the dairies.
When the final report is made, the
condition of each Institution will be
published. We will establish a sani
tary rate, also a rate for the quality
of milk. All dairies not maintaining
these will be condemned. The practice
of blending poor milk with good will
also be stopped. We find that agencies
resort to this at times and we consider
it most harmful."
Early yesterday morning Drs. Ragan
and Hassler and Inspectors E. C.
Smith, J. Silvera, E. B. O'Conner and
William T. Robertson started on their
trip across the bay. The party divided
into three sections, each taking a dif
ferent course and continuing their in
spections until sundown. \
Ragan and Hassler left San Rafael
by way of the Petaluma road and
crossed to Fairfax, visiting seven
dairies. Smith and Silvera went from
Tiburon to Larkspur, to Strawberry
Point and thence to California City.
They also Inspected seven milk institu
tions. O'Connor and Robertson spent
the dav in the interior of the county
and collected data concerning eight
dairies. Dr. Ragan and his deputies
were provided with authorization from
the State Board of Health, as it was
rumored that there would be some op
position to their visiting a county other
than the one in which they are offi
cials. Reports on this score proved
to be unfounded, as no obstacles were
cast In their way. The health officers
are not done with Marin County. They
have nearly forty more places to look
over and report upon and will make a
second trip on Tuesday.
When the party returned to this city
last night a complete report was made
to Dr. Ragan. Prevailing conditions
were summed up and a general average
struck. This average is not encourag
ing. It hangs between poor and fair.
The Sleeping Hollow Dairy, however,
was found to be first class in every
particular and the inspectors say that
it compares with the others as a first
class racing stable rates with a country
bam. At other ranches whitewash is
applied only about once In every three
years in many of the sheds and in
some places no drainage facilities have
been provided. Ventilation and the
system of dry milking won favor for
some owners, but there is plenty of
room for improvement, as the report
to be submitted when all the dairies
are inspected will show.
DR. RAGAX'S STATEMENT.
While the health officer points to
Marin County as a headquarters for
the supply of milk, he does not com
mend the manner in which the dairies
now located there are conducted. With
one exception, fault is found with all
of the twenty-two visited yesterday,
though some of the unsanitary condi
tions found to exist in San Francisco
County dairies are absent. The ex
panse of fertile land affords facilities
for open air milking, which is one ad
vantage and the drainage of the sheds
is much better than was expected. But
the buildings generally are dilapidated
and cleanliness does not seem to be the
universal order.
INSPECTORS 3IAKE TOUR.
Dr. Ragan, chief health officer of San
Francisco, thinks Marin County an
ideal location for dairies. He is in
favor of abolishing all such institu
tions on the San Francisco peninsula
and obliging their owners to herd their
cattle to meadow lands and sheltering
slopes. The doctor arrived at this con
clusion last evening when he had flnÂ»
ished the llrst c/f a series of dairy in
spections in the northern county. He
made many arguments in support of
his belief and pointed out the benefits
the public at large would reap from
such a move.

ETHE BIRTHDAY"!
FOUR YEARS OLD TO-DAY.
Cora Fredericka Freer's painting, "The Birthday," was the most important figure composition
exhibited by a Chicago artist at the recent exhibition of American oil painting and sculpture at the
Art Institute. It is the work which combines the telling of a pleasing story with the successful ren-
dering of a most interesting effect of artificial lighting. The four flickering tapers on the birthday
cake illuminate the scene, which is' one of tenderness and intensity as well as of festivity.
\ The, costumes of the little girl in whose honor the celebration is made, her young mother
and her comrade and guest furnish notes of colors and the play of the warm glow from the tapers
on these offers a problem which the artist has solved most agreeably.
The expression on the faces of the participants in the pretty fete shows that she is also a
; close student of character. A smile of love and contentment. plays over the features of the mother
as she cuts the cake; the little one looks on with something of curiosity and wonderment in her
joy, while a look of patient expectancy plays over the features of her guest.

with his friend, George Yenowine, when
the latter halted In front of a book

THE CALL, under date of the 13th day of March,
1903, published a special dispatch from Washington
dated March 12. This dispatch stated that some of
the money placed in the hands of' United States Consul
Victor E. Nelson, Bergen, Norway, for payment to fam
ilies of Norwegian blue-jackets killed in the destruction
of the Maine in Havana harbor had not reached the
relatives of those soldiers, although it was said the money
was given to Nelson for distribution; that after an in
vestigation by the State Department 'upon this charge
Consul Nelson was. cabled forhis resignation.
The Call; published this dispatch in the course of its
business without any personal knowledge of the facts as
alleged, but finds upon examination that it was misled,
and that the statements contained in the dispatch were
not true. Mr. Nelson did not receive any money for dis
tribution and it is not the custom of the department to
make such distributions through the hands of the Consul,
consequently it was impossible that there should have
been any investigation of that charge, and it is equally im
possible that the State Department should have asked
him for his resignation for any such cause.
The Call takes pleasure in making this correction and
placing before the public the proper statement of these
facts. : >*V' -' $-V$Â»"S

The law books of Georgia bearing date
of the current year do not contain
anything to the effect that "It docs not

summons cannot be made on the party
from whom the divorce la sought, a
copy of the summons must be pub

circulation in the place where the
party Is known to reside and a copy
of the summons must be mailed to the

WE notice that the press of the State is circulat
ing a statement derogatory to the Associated
Charities of this city, which seems to be based on
a misunderstanding of the object and purpose of that or
ganization. This misunderstanding is to the effect that
the charities is expected to furnish funds for the relief
of those in need. As its ordinary income is less than
$4000 and its expenditure is a little more the comment is
made that its income is used up in office expenses and the
compensation of its office force, which is sneeringly re
ferred to as "of the female persuasion."
As we understand the purposes of the Associated
Charities it is not an almoner at all. The many benefi
cial organizations and charity committees of the differ
ent churches are appealed to for relief by
strangers and by* beggars of all descriptions. Among
these there is a large percentage of impostors. The un
organized public is appealed to every day, on the streets,
for relief and charity by promiscuous beggars. It was
found upon investigation that indiscriminate giving by
individuals and organizations was an evil in itself.. It
encouraged imposture, and diverted from the worthy
poor a vast charity fund which, directed in' proper chan
nels, would help the deserving poor to a better .condition.
To do this required some means for investigating each
case. Church and beneficial organizations could, not do
this and individuals were less qualified for such work.
It was known that often the worthiest indigents, become
dependent through sickness, accident or other misfor
tune, were restrained by pride from asking help and kept
their, distress concealed until they became martyrs to
their self-respect. Some organization was needed /that
would find them' out and assign the task of relieving
them to the proper church or society on which they had
claims of fellowship. â¢
To' do this work the Associated Charities was devised.
It is the business of those who administer it to examine
the cases of all applicants for charity and to see that they.

So Nathan Hale, being chosen, went
By night through the foeman's drowsy
ranks;
He thought of his home, where the
dc^ep-grasaed banks
Of Connecticut lean to her spajmins
flow. â Â¦
He thought of the gin he longed to
wed;
He thought of his mother, worn and
bent
With j'oars; of his youth's ambitious
glow; â¢
He thought of these, and with shudder-
Ing dread
For a weak brief moment bowed his
head.
But he did not falter; he pressed
right on;
His pluck had the old stern martyr
rfhg;
He would do this covert and vulpine
thing
For'hls bleeding land, as her loyal son.
A fox far cunning, a snake for stealth.
Rich were the knowledge he gained
and stored.
Had fate but willed him to bear its
wealth
Bark to the Washington he adored.
Yet, 110; with his triumph nearly

With the sands of Long Island almost

Off his venturous feet, with tha hope

IT is believed to be useful for partisan purposes to
teach the people that the transaction of much of the
business of this country by large corporations, given
the bad name of trusts, is an evil that has originated in
our protective tariff. This course is taken in order to
effectively ambush another attack on protection.
But as large a part of the business of Great Britain is
transacted by corporations between which and our trusts
there is no appreciable difference in economics if there
is in law. There have been organized in Great Britain
77.579 of such corporations, with a stock issue of $29,
982,110,245. A majority of these floated their stock and
went under to the loss of the shareholders, just as the
wild-cat trusts in this country did to the loss of the in
vesting public.
The Manchester Chronicle says that last year 1629 of
these corporations became insolvent, inflicting a loss of
$145,995,000 upon the public which had taken their stocks.
The same authority says that Â«in the last ten years the
losses from the same cause have amounted to $2,725,
240,000. It. is declared that this lost capital was never
represented by valid assets. That is to say it was watered
and fictitious capital.
The Chronicle declares that there must be legislation
to protect the public against the lute of such investments
and that "It does not meet the case to say that we can
not legislate for fools; we must so legislate as to protect
the nation from unscrupulqusness, dishonesty and fraud.
The Board of Trade has been urged by the stock ex
change to deal with this abuse and a serious effort must
be made to safeguard our commercial interests by making
the law very stringent in dealing with abuses of flotation
under the limited liability system."
All the features familiar to us in the United States ap
pear in Great Britain. Under free trade stock watering
and luring of investors go on just as here under pro
tection. The revenue system makes no difference. If
our Democratic politicians were in Great Britain we sup
pose they would be pointing to free trade as the mother
of trusts and the wicked inventor of stock watering.

thing in sight with the artillery of their lungs, make noise
enough to suit us and fortunately commit no more harm
than the assault of exploded wind upon our eardrums.

"Orange groves. In full bearing, fre

Some orchards yield as much as J1S0O

that no one but the author of "Iolan

Gilbert inventions that the new Gar
i;ck play most recalls â could have con
structed, as probably no one else could
Itave conceived, this brilliant piece of
trifling, "its chitf characters. Rosebud,

whose like the stage has not known
e'.nce the palmy days of the Savoy. And
this tijne the famous librettist has out
dared nimself. Dignified judicial lumi
naries, bumptious military men and
fulsome ecclesiastics always have been
marks for Gilbert's wit, but never be
fore lias he K'jrw so far as to picture a
learned and crusty Judge transformed
into a pantaloon, a Baronet of the Life
Guards turned into a pantomime clown
or a sanctimonious vicar bewitched
into, a dancing harlequin in the skinni
est of spangled tights. To a first-night
audience the ;satire gave glee but no
-offense; whether the piece will be a
popular success no one has ventured to
prophesy.
The whole thing is a burlesque on the
time-iionored English pantomime.
When Mr. Gilbert raises his curtain we
find that Rosebud, the good fairy, is in
disgrace with the Fairy Queen. Her
mission is to help along lagging love
affairs. Those in the neighborhood,
however, have gone but indifferently
for some time, and the Queen of the
fays has- decreed that unless Rosebud
brings oft a coup of some sort she will
be thrust into the back row of the
fairy ballet, "along with the stout
ones," as Mr. Gilbert puts it. Anxious
to avoid this. Rosebud has been watch
ing a sort of double-barreled love affair
that has been going on in her vicinity,
the suitors in the case being a some
v.hat timid country vicar and a Baro
net in the Life Guards. The vicar is In
love with a learned Judge's daughter,
who, for courtship purposes, has dis
guised herself as a hospital nurse, but
Rosebud notices that the Baronet also
frequently offers attentions to this lady
and the fairy believes that the military
man's intentions toward her are not
honorable. Here is an opportunity to
intervene. She eeeks the aid of the
Demon Alcohol, an evil spirit, with,
however, conscientious scruples that
handicap him considerably, and after
.come trouble induces him to carry off
the lady to the Baronet's flat in White
hall Court, whence she, the good fairy,
will rescue her just in time and restore
her to her ecclesiastical lover.
But when the scene changes to the
vicar's drawing-room we find an un
expected state of affairs. It seems
that the churchman's sweetheart's
father, the pompous Justice Wortle,
does not approve of the vicar as a
eultor. and in order to deceive him the
reverend and the Baronet are In the

to each other's lady loves.
would present no "great difficulties. It
was merely a matter of a great deal of
digging. Henry M. Flagler took up
the project and it is being carried out
by his lieutenants. We. are not only
making artificial outlets through the
rock, but are also, by ditching 1 and
dredging, turning large bodies of wa
ter into rivers and creeks which flow
to the ocean. The work has progressed
far enough to enable me to predict
confidently the opening- in Florida,
within a very few years, of a great
tract of land of almost unprecedented
fertility. â Success.
There are great agricultural possi
bilities in the Florida Everglades.
Though they are yet merely an ex
pansive waste of swamp and lake and
jungle, I venture to predict that they
will be the location of hundreds of
fertile farms within ten years and will
by degrees develop Into one of the
most productive tracts of land Inâthe
world. The barrier to the utilization
of the Everglades has been, of course,
the water which covers the greater
part of them to a depth of from one
to six feet. But is has been found en
tirely practicable to drain off the wa
ter. "Work to this end has already
been begun and is being pushed rap
idly. When it is completed a tract of
land 160 miles long and sixty wide
will have been opened to cultivation.
The size of this region is not aa im
portant as the remarkable productiv
ity of the soil. The latter is not only
absolutely virgin, but has been fer
tilized by animals and vegetable life
through many centuries. I am confi
dent that its crops will lift Florida to
a place among the leading agricultural
States.
The project of draining the Ever
glades attracted the attention of Henry
B. Plant in" the early '90*s, but he was
by no means sure that the scheme was
feasible, so I, acting under his direc
tion, undertook an expedition through
the region. Despite its proximity to
centers of population, It was then for
the first time thoroughly explored by
white men._ Ours was virtually a voy
age of discovery. We paddled our light
boats on lakes and camped on islands
that, I have good reason to believe,
had never before been visited by any
human being but Semlnole Indians,
and by these but rarely. We under
went so many hardships that some of
our party were compelled to turn
back, but our efforts were not in vain,
for we ascertained the important fact
that the Everglades, along the whole
160 miles of the eastern side, are
rimmed by a rock ledge. We further
more learned that all of the lakes are
several feet above sea level, and we
decided that there was nothing what
ever to prevent the water of the lakes
from flowing into the ocean and leav
ing the land drained if vents could be
made In this long ledge of rock. The
chief question before us pertained to
the practicability of cutting through
the ledge In various places and dredg
ing out outlets Into the Atlantic, which
is not more than two or three miles
away at numerous points.
Experiments proved that this work
Draining the Everglades.
THE supply of a great city of those things that are
among the absolute necessaries of life is a matter
of the highest importance, because it concerns the
health and life" of the people. Of all food supplies milk
is the most important. It is a prime necessity in every
family and ik the sole food of infants. It is also the me
dium through which disease is most easily and most
commonly communicated to man.
The typhoid epidemic at Stanford University two years
ago was caused by the vile conditions in one small dairy.
The owner of that dairy caused the deaths of young men
and women in their prime of life and hope. If he had
met them on the street and shot them dead he would
have been hanged. But he killed them by slow poison
and escaped punishment. A few years ago a typhoid
epidemic broke out in Oakland, causing about forty
deaths. Its origin was traced to a/ small dairy where
everything was reeking with filth. The owner of that
dairy had been guilty of a great crime, but he went un
punished.
Now the dairies in the outskirts of San Francisco are
found to be in such condition that the milk they furnish
should not be fed to pigs it is so filthy,' Many years ago
dairies of this kind in and around New York City were
examined as a result of abnormal infant mortality. The
conditions found were appalling. At that time science
had not revealed bacteriology, and men could only infer
that milk from animals in the physical condition preva
lent in those dairies must carry death with it to the users.
Immediately there arose a crusade against "swill milk,"
which gave to the sanitary inspection of dairies an im
pulse that is still felt. X
As far as investigation has gone it is apparent that the
dairies lodged around the edges of San Francisco are in
a condition as deplorable and as dangerous as the swill
milk establishments of New York. The buildings, barns
and milking sheds are dirty. The cows have no range on
pasture, nor access to natural conditions, nor proper
food. They stand and lie in their own dejections and are
milked without washing and with their flanks in a dirty
condition. In many cases the water they drink is con
taminated, and the same foul water is used for washing
the milk cans and perhaps for thinning the. milk. The
cows are, as a rule, in a condition to excite pity and the
calves are treated so cruelly as to warrant official inter
ference to protect them.
The moral of it all is that those pestiferous and death
dealing dairies around a city should not be permitted at
all. The sale of their product should be prohibited. It
is impossible that they should produce wholesome milk.
That can only be done by cows that have free range on
pasture, with naturf 1 food in abundance, eating only what
is wholesome and living in pure air and the sunshine.
Not a pint of milk should be permitted to come into San
Francisco from any other conditions.
Within easy reach of this city, by water and land
transportation, are districts adapted to dairying, where
the best forage for producing milk is to be had in abun
dance and where the water is pure and every condition
i* kindly to the cow and favors the production of pure
milk. If our sanitary authorities will continue .their in
vestigation and abandon the idea that these filthy little
dairies can ever be put in a proper condition to produce
Avholcsome milk, but forbid the sale of their products, we
may reasonably expect a milk supply from pure sources.
It is a fearful thing that here where nature produces so
lavishly the finest forage and outdoor conditions the
most favorable the people should take their milk supply
from emaciated and diseased cows, standing belly deep in
mud and filth. In the pleasant country around us are
ideal conditions for dairying decently and wholesomely.
If the business were permitted only under such condi
tions we would have cows fed on pure pasture, milked in
clean and wholesome sheds and the milk preserved for
market, not by drugs but by devices for immediately
cooling it to a point that will enable its transportation to
the customer in proper condition for use.
Under such a system for supplying milk it could be
prepared for keeping any proper length of time in proper
vessels, by the Pasteur process for sterilizing. The peo
ple should appreciate the importance of rigid rules to
control this most necessary and at the same time most
dangerous of all food supplies.
But the two captains pointed out to
them that revolutions were a flourish
ing Institution in, the country; that
there was no reason to suppose that
this was the last. ' and^that to shoot
the leaders might be a precedent
dangerous to the leaders of the oppo
sition at some future time. After a
great deal of consideration and a
council of war the strength of these
arguments became apparent to the
opposition and the late government
and their generals were sent out of
the country unmolested.
The only thing that then remained
Â¦was for the two captains to see that
the soldiers in the fortress laid down
their arms. That was seen to. and the
army of the late government then left
the fortress. The moment they left
the fortress they were met by the gen
eral of the -victorious opposition, who
offered them double pay to Join his
array. Without a moment's hesitation
and without a single dissentient voice
the offer was accepted, the vanquished
soldiers resumed their armsand then
formed part of the escort of the army
of the opposition which conducted tifcj
two captains back to their cruisers.
This amusing story by Lord Sel
borne of a comic opera war evoked
much laughter from the distinguished
company present â Boston Transcript
The terms were accepted without de
mur, the Government occupied the po
sition, the opposition withdrew, and in
the course of two or three' days ad
vanced to the attack. There was a
terrific amount of fighting, an immense
amount of ammunition was expended
and a great many lives were lost'
Eventually the Government went on
thÂ« run and retreated pell-mell through
the town into the fortress. But the
moment the opposition arrived at the
position which the Government for
merly held, they ceased flring-not one
single shot was fired after the Govern
ment had abandoned the position
When the opposition had occupied
the position and the Government had
retired into the fortress, both armies
hoisted a flag, "Referees required"
and the two captains, with the Union
Jack and the Stars and Stripes flying
then solemnly went up to the fort The
army of the victors (the opposition)
In f u th( \ Etreets an <* Presented arms.
All the shutters of all the stops were
taken down, and the population turned
out and heartily cheered the referees
Then came the delicate and diplo
matic question of arranging the terms
of peace. The two captains decided
that in respect of the men of the army
of the Government they must lay down
their arms and should then be allowed
to go free. The opposition accepted
those terms without question. They
then said that the generals of the
Government, and they thought" the
Prime Minister, too, should be allowed
to leave the country unmolested, but
to that the opposition at first strongly
demurred, thinking that they ought at
once to be shot.
They then carefully drew up the
order of proceedings. They intimated
that this position was to be held by the
Government, that the opposition was to
retire a certain number of miles and
might then proceed to take the position,
butâ and these were the rulesâ if the
Government once abandoned the po
sition they were to be held to have been
beaten, while if the opposition were un
able to take the position they must
withdraw.
The Government and the opposition
both wrote back to say that their ex
cellencies should be obeyed; but, as
their excellencies had forbidden fight
ing in the town, would they kindly say
where the fighting might take place.
The two captains were quite equal to
the occasion. They surveyed the coun
try, and selected a position which
would do for military operations, with
rivers, hills and everything in its proper
place.
At : he recent Itoyal Academy ban
quet in London, a little piece of history
that bounded. like a fairy tale formed
ihe substance of the speech of Lord
Selborne in responding to the toast of
the navy. Recently, he said, they had
had on!y too pood reason to realize
how inseparable were the greatest risks
from the seaman's life. They were be
ginning to learn also what a modern
naval war meant. Still, those days of
thÂ« navy immortalized by Captain
Marryat were Tiot altogether past.
A few weeks ago two small cruisers,
British and American, found them
selves in a port, which should be name
less, and discovered that the annual
revolution was going on. The Govern
ment was in possession of the town,
and the opposition were rapidly ad
vancing to attack It. The two captains
put their heads together â for there
were many British and American citi
zens in the town, and much British and
American property â and they sent a
joint note to the combatants warning
them that, however much fighting they
chose to do, they (the two captains)
forbade them to fight in the town.
A War Farce.
cf Dr. Hans Kicbter in the conductor's
chairâ a fact which 6eerr.ed to glorify
the performance of Mozart's "Don

stems to be the general opinion that
the opera has not been Â£=o we!l done

are relieved by whatever organization they have the most
claims upon. If a church committee is applied to for re
lief it refers the case to the Associated Charities as a
rule, first furnishing enough means for immediate relief
during the time an examination is- being made. If the
case is reported worthy the relief is continued. If not it
is withdrawn. Even such highly organized bodies as the
Masons and Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias and Ellcs
find it necessary to use the mockery of the Associated
Charities to protect themselves against imposition. If
such be necessary in their, case how much more necessary
is it for church communities and private individuals.
The Associated Charities have command of the liber
ality of many wealthy people who make it a rule to give a
stated sum to charity every year. They want to give this
wisely and where i^ is needed and not indiscriminately
and for the use of frauds and impostors. The only way
they can do this is- by co-operation with the Associated
Charities. That organization also receives and distri
butes clothing and fuel properly when furnished by the
charitable. It is in communication and co-operation with
the Salvation Army, the Volunteers of America and alp
associated persons who do charity work, and is the gen
eral clearing-house for all charitable effort.
The article referred to says that eight ladies are em
ployed in the Associated Charities of San Francisco, and
complains that their salaries and car fare amount to
$2948 15 per year. That is only $36851 apiece for a year's
work and car fare! Instead of complaining that it is too
much, as the article does, we should all be ashamed that
it is sqjjjtle.
For rent, telephone, printing and postage the sum of
$1109 30 was spent, and that is out of proportion to the
amount of good done by the devoted women who ad
minister associated affairs. We have no doubt that they
save the waste upon impostors and frauds of many times
the cost of their work and confine it to cases in which it
is really needed and where it does good. We make no
apology for this indorsement of their work and com
mendation of them, hoping that it may not only overtake
and correct the misrepresentation of their purpose but
that it will stir the community to a sense of its duty to
them. Their equipment should be better, their income
larger and their pay increased.

The Grand Jury met Friday and
filed a report regarding its inspection
of the City and County Hospital. The
report state's that many necessary Im
provements have been made and the
Institution is In first-class order. The
report continues:
The bulldlngi for the help are In a dilapi
dated condition, and th? electric wiring is im
perfect. There Is a nÂ«ed of lire escapes on the
buildings, and the' building occupied by the fe
male nurse* 1Â« unfit for the purpose (or which
It I* uÂ«ed. While nearly new, the foundation
and flooring are rotted away. We see the ne
copslty for a new hospital at once, and we
would recommend that If another location
â¢hould be secured that the present site should
always be retained by the city aa an* auxiliary
hospital, the mild climate and pure air in this
location being unsurpassed In this city.
The Grand Jury recommended that
the Board of Supervisors and the >
Board of Health compel the Sanitary'
Reduction Works to install a smoke
consumer on its chimney in ( order to
prevent the dissemination of fumes
that are said to be injurious to health.
The Grand Jury finds that the neces
sary apparatus can be installed at an
increased expense of 20 per cent in
the fuel bill. Â¦>

Bernard N. Baker, former president

that this should be made subject to a
contract being entered into by public
proposals so that no citizen or corpor
ation would have any undue advan

laws and a builders or owners bonus
of 50 per cent in cash upon the com
missioning of ships completed within
two years after the passage of the act,

headquarters. He is here to take back
Everett Abbott, defaulting vice pres
ident and cashier of the American
Marine Transportation Company, who
was arrested at Market and Powell
streets about two weeks ago by De
tective Ed Gibson.
After taking his sudden departure
from Boston Abbott went to Mextco
and came to this city a few days prior
to his arrest. He claimed at the time
that he was not responsible for the
deficiency in his accounts and blamed
others. The deficiency amounts to
$105,000. It was- all taken within two
months and the belief Is that Abbott
could not have exDended such a large
amount in that time and that most of
it must be hidden somewhere. . Â¦ â¢
The inspector will leave with his
prisoner on Tuesday.

The Grand Jury yesterday forward
ed to the Board of Supervisors Its re
port on the Fire Department. The in
quisitorial body found that with very
few exceptions most urgent repairs
and alterations are needed in the dif
ferent flre engine houses. The Instal
lation of an auxiliary salt water sys
tem is favored and the following ex
cerpt relates to the imperative need
of better fire protection throughout
the city:
"Larger mains and hydrants are
needed in many portions of the city.
A great number of five and six story
buildings have been erected in the
most exposed portions and known as
the "boarding-house district," notably
on Pine street, from Stockton to Jones.
The water main on Pine street is but
six inches in diameter and the pres
sure only thirty-five pounds to the
square inch, not enough to supply the
companies responding to first alarms
of fire. In the factory district on Bry
nnt street, from Fourth to Ninth, a
similar condition exists. Rlncon Hill
is practically unprotected. At Sutter
and Gough streets there are two large
hotels and the Lowell High School,
with a main but pIx inches in diam
eter. There is a lack of hydrants in
the thickly populated portions of the
city and the recommendation of the
Chief Engineer for 300 additional hy
drants is highly commended."

drants Aro Xecdcd in Many Por

GRAND JURY ADVOCATES
BETTER FIRE PROTECTION
A short time after the admittance of
the will Charles P. Brundage, nephew
of the deceased, who had cared for
Sweeney during the last few months
of his fife, claimed the entire estate.
He based his claim on a deed made by
: Sweeney a few weeks befo-re his death.
This doed conveyed to Brundase all
tbe realty left by the deceased. Brun
dage alÂ£o produced a bill of pale of the
personal property of the deceased made
cut in favor of the claimant and signed
by Eweeiwy. Brundage's claims were
opposed, by the trust company and by
Sweeney's rplatives. Brundage. there
fore, filed salts to- quiet title to the
realty and to settle the dispute over
the personal property. These suits
"*ievc-r came to a final determination in
the courts, for they were compromised,
Brundage agreeing to dismiss them all
prrAMding the defendants would waive
all claim to the realty and content
themsf-lves with the personal property,
which was valued at about $31,00*. The
rornpromipe was effected and the
Sweeney estate peemed in a fair way
to be settled when tho Park Commis
sioners commenced their action to set
aside the compromise. This action was
fallowed by the filing of similar actions
by thp Lanes and Mrs. Clark. The ac
tions were all combined and were pros
ecuted in Judge BeawelTfl court, the
trSal lasting several weeks.
Thomas U. Sweeney, a wealthy ec
rentrlc, one of whose hobbies was the
Improvement of Golden Gate Park,
dl^d in January. 1900. Shortly after
his dtath his will, which doviFod his
to trrc Brurdage family and
''ther relatives, Â«'harles C Lane, his
brother-in-law, William Lane, the lat
nr's son, and Lucy Clark, the de
redenfs sister, and many charitable
Institutions, and also devised to the
I'arjt Commissioners two blocks f>{ land
to be used for the completion of the
Panorama building, was admitted to
pmbatfs. Th^ California Title Insur
r.nco and Trust Company was named
:;?_rxerutor of the will.
.' NFI'UFW CLAIMS ESTATE.
This lack of proof was also held to
be .evident in the cases of Charles C.
L>ane. William E. Lane and Lucy
Clark, relatives of Sweeney, who. In
suits commenced a few days after the
action brought by the Park Commis
sioners, prayed, as did the commis
sioners, thnt the compromise be set
aside and that they be declared to have
a larger interest in the estate than
they obtained through the compromise,
namely, an interest in personal prop
erty worth $31,000. Judge Seawell de
cided all the cases from the bench. In
dcJng so he said:
"This court finds that Thomas U.
Sweeney was able to manage his af
fairs, was capable of understanding
the nature of his deed to Brundage
and was not unduly influenced to exe
cute the samÂ°. It is ordered that judg
ment be entered for the defendants."
LtANES DEFEATi:i>.
The Panorama building on Straw
berry Hill in Golden Gate Park will
remain uncompleted if the Park Ccnn
mlsslonf-rs are dependent upon the es
tÂ»je cf Thomas U. Sweeney for funds
to do the work. Judge Seawell de
cided yesterday that the Park Com
.xnissicners have no claim upon two
blocks cf land on K Btreet. between
Seventh an<5 Ninth avenues, devised to
â¢them in Sweeney's will, to be used for
â¢the -completion of the Panorama build
ing, the erection of which was begun
during thÂ« testator's lifetime. The
court holds that the Park Commis
sioners failed to prove that the gift
deed made by Sweeney during the last
few weeks of his life, which trans
ferred to Charles S. Brundage. his
nephew, all the property devised in the
will, .had been obtained by fraud and
trndu* influence on the part of Brun
fiage. They also failed to prove that
the compromise effected by Brundage
vrjth the California Title Insurance and
TYust Company of his suit for his
uncle's estato was a compromise due
to lack of proper care and diligence
on -the part of the trust company as
executor of Sweeney's v.-ill. Again
they failed to pi^ove that Sweeney was
in his dotaje at the Hire the deed was
made ar,d that he was Incapable of
knowing the true import of the deed.
Judge de Haven, with a freezing
glance at the unfortunate representa
tive of the District Attorney, remarked
that he wished it to be understood dis
tinctly that when a defendant pleaded
guilty in his court he, the Judge, felt
surer that he was not doing an injus
tice in Imposing sentence than he
would In a case where a conviction had
been had by a Jury. When a man
pleaded guilty the court was sure of
his guilt and that he was deserving of
punishment. The fact that the prison
er had pleaded guilty would not have
any weight with the Judge or Induce
him to make the punishment one whit
lighter.
These remarks of the court discon
certed the prisoner and he was allowed
to change his plea to that of net guil
ty. June 1 was eet as the day for the
triaL
A brother of Minter had informed
the District Attorney that Robert was
not mentally or morally responsible
for his actions and that the defendant
had been a patient in an insane asy
lum for Borne time.
Persons who may plead guilty here
after In the United States District
Court need expect no leniency on that
account. They will be sentenced to as
severe punishment as though they had
been convicted by the verdict of a
Jury.
Such was the purport of an an
nouncement made yesterday by Judge
de Haven when Robert Minter, alias
Robert John, came up for sentence an
his plea of guilty to a charge that he
had made use of the postoffice with in
tent to swindle the credulous by prom
ises of employment at ten dollars per
week to his correspondents. On being
asked whether he had anything to say
why sentence should not be pronounced
ag-ainst him, Minter said that he waa
only technically guilty, but had pleaded
guilty after consultation with the Dis
trict Attorney and the Postofflce In
spector, with the expectation that be
cause of such plea his sentence would
not be made severe.

The right cf the Citizens' Alliance
to use the label it has adopted has
been made the subject of a law
suit by the Typographical Union on
the gTound that the alliance label bears
a close resemblance to that of the
union. Yesterday Will J. French,
president of the San Francisco Typo
graphical Union Xo. 21, filed a suit
for en Injunction restraining the alli
ance from using a label that somewhat
resembles that used by the union
chops, and the presence of which on
prtnled matter Is an announcement
that the shop turning out the printed
matter Is a member of the alliance and
net subjected to union rules. The
similarity In the appearance of the
labels is rrhnt the union complains of.
the complaint alleging: that the new
device is so .r.ear the *orm of the old
that it is likely to deceive. In fact it
is alJ<\e:ed that it was adopted for the
sole purpose of deceiving the public.
The union also asks lor $5000 dam-
EfeF. claiming that by the use of the
label adopted by the alliance the union
has already suffered a pecuniary loss.
The case will be heard by Judge Sloss,
â¢who. when the complaint for the in
junction was presented to him. Issued
en order directing Herbert A. George,
manager of the alliance, and W. E.
Alexander, another official of the or
panization. tiho are the defendants In
the suit, to appear before him June 3
to show cause why the injunction
should not issue- as prayed for.
The charge is also made in the com
plaint that the alliance is a body hos
tile to the plaintiff and other union or
ffanlzatlor.s and Is organized to harass,
Â«nnoy end injure plaintiff and kindred
bodies.

cording to the complaint for divorce
filed yesterday by Mrs. Hannan, these

until finally her husband, tiring of
their wordy wars, took to using his flsts.
She says he used them with such ef
fect that on many occasions he left
her black and blue, and then, to make
matters worse,- called her all sorts of
vile names. This sort of treatment con
tinued, she adds, until April 28 of this
year, when he deserted her, leaving
her penniless.

The concert by the pupils of the Den
man School for the benefit of the
teachers' annuity fund "was given at
the Alhambra Theater yesterday after
noon. The audience was largeand re
sponded to the efforts of the young
people with much applause. The pro
gramme, which was rendered by girls
of eight grades, was excellent, consist
ing of only high-class music and re
flecting much credit on Miss Estelle
Carpenter, superlntendenLof music in
the public schools, and A. L. Mann,
principal of the Denman School, who
trained the pupils.
Little tots from the first grade sang
a lullaby and danced a mtnuet. Those
of tho second grade made their en
trance in a serpentine drill and were
perfect in "An April Child" and "Slum
ber Song." The third grade won favor
in "May Dance," a Polish song, and an
"Evening Prayer," prettily sung. The
fourth grade rendered a jolly school
song and a sea ballad. The, fifth grade
pupils sang "My Own. United States,'
and their tableaux and drill work was
worthy of more than special mention.
Miss Edna Shores and Miss Carrie San
ford of the same grade proved them
selves promising artists at the piano.
The girls of the sixth grade ac
quitted themselves well with a class
song. "Lilies Sweet," and two trios,
"The Silent Voice" and "Lead, Kindly
Light." The seventh grade contributed
three numbers to the programme,
opening with â¢ Sousa's "Stars and
Stripes." Miss Dorothy Passmore, ac
companied by Miss Susan Pasmore on
the piano, played a cello solo, "Ber
ceuse," by Popper. The last number
was "Santa Lucia, Neapolitan." The
pupils of the eighth grade were on the
programme for five numbers and dis
played remarkable vocal training in
solo, part and chorus work. Their
voices seem to be cultivated naturally
and the shriek and exertion that some
times characterizes children's singing
was not noticed. The numbers were
Schubert's "Serenade," Mendelssohn's
"I Would That My Love," Vogrich's
"Love and Mirth," Pinsuti's "Wel
come, Pretty Primrose," and Wagner's
"Pilgrim Chorus," the last named ren
dered by one hundred voices.

Matt Larsen, convicted of drunlc
kenness and unprovoked assault upon
various pedestrians who crossed his
path on Market street, cheerfully in
formed Judge Fritz that he was pre
pared to pay any reasonable fine, hut
his Honor surprised him by pronounc
ing a sentence of two months' impris
onment without alternative.
George Thomas, who stole a ten
pound box of chewing tobacco from a
wagon at Fourth and Howard streets,
got thi'eo months from Judge Mogan.
The value of the plunder was $6 50,
but George was trying to sell it for 50
cents when a policeman nabbed him
on the Barbary Coast.
Mrs. Margaret Galvin, who is weal
thy enough to keep a maid and dwell
in an expensive flat, was convicted of
drunkenness in a public place and is
held in custody to appear before Judge
Fritz next Tuesday. The woman; who
is a confirmed inebriate, has been ar
rested numerous times before, but un
til yesterday sTie escaped imprison
ment by forfeiting her bail. She was
helplessly Intoxicated when Officer J.
B. .O'Connor picked her up on Van
Ness avenue Friday afternoon.
* * ? â¢
Nineteen-year-old Mary Wilson,
who recentlS' came from a respectable
home at Marysville and fell into evil
ways, will be sentenced for vagrancy
next Saturday by Judge Mogan. She
refused to return to a soldier a cheap
watch which he had allowed her to
wear and he it was who had her ar
rested. Then she gave up the watch,
but was held for vagrancy. '
Walter E. Reed pleaded' guilty to
two charges of petty larceny In order
to escape conviction on the more se
rious accusation, of forgery and was
sentenced to a year in jail by Judge
Fritz. Reed forged the name of his
employer on a check for $40 and wad
brought back from Indiana to stand
trial.
Petty larceny Is the charge on
which Walter Murdoch will be tried
next Tuesday by Judge Mogan. He is
accused of stealing a valise from 320
Minna street and pawning it under
the Illustrious name of "Jack-Mun
roe."
C. S. Rproat. accused of concealing
property to defraud his creditors, will
have a jury trial June 9 In Judge
Fritz's court. He recently: pwttH a
well-known market on Market street.
Complaint of Kxeeutrj
Thomas W. Kase, to whom Jose
phine Winter, widow of W. G. Winter,
asigned her interest in her husband's
estate, applied yesterday to the Su
perior Court for an order directing
Elizabeth Bloom, executrix of the will
of Winter, to appear and show cause
why she has not filed an accounting
since October, 1898. Judge Kerrigan
Issued the citation directing Mrs.
Bloom to appear before him next Fri
day.
Grego Sparovich said that while
strolling past No. 30 East street, a
'longshore slopshop kept -by Julius
Goldstein, he was grabbed and drag
ged inside by Thomas Beatty, "side
walk booster" for the establishment.
Ere he was allowed to leave the place,
Mr. Sparovich added, a brass watch
was put in and $12 50 taken out of one
of his pockets by Beatty.
After listening to Mr. Sparovich's
narrative Judge Mogan set next Fri
day for the trial of Beatty, who is the
ex-champion uncolored cakewalker of
the Pacific Coast and has been in po-
Bavo Casier, who fired two shots at
Mrs. Lizzie Vinkie a few days ago in
her Sunshine court< residence, has been
held to the Superior Court on the,
charge of attempt to murder. His bail
was fixed at $2000 by Judge Cabaniss.
"A low-down thing" and "a mean
old thing" were the most offensive
epithets addressed by 'Mrs. Clara
Carney to Joseph Enos, from whom she
rented the three rooms she occupies at
2S27 Sixteenth street, but Mr. Enos con
sidered them sufficiently opprobrious to
justify him in having her arrested for
disturbing the peace.
Her refusal to pay for one dollar's
worth of extra gas which was con
sumed in her apartments primarily
brought the landlord's Ire upon Mrs.
Carney, although he testified that she
had also appropriated to her own use
a dilapidated meat safe belonging to
him and ousted therefrom a quantity
of pigeon feed, and had painted some
of his flower pots and presented them
with their floral treasures to her
friends. In comparison with her en
deavor to shirk the gas Indebtedness
he considers the pieat safe and flower
pot incidents of minor import.
Mrs. Carney's case was exhaustively
defended by Warren Temple Esq.. bar
rister-at-law, who did not succeed in
disproving Mr. Enos' allegation as to
her offensive language. When the lady
announced her intention of vacating
the Enos property next Friday the case
was continued till next Saturday by
Judge Mogan.
Judge Fritz was ready to proceed
with the preliminary examination of
E. W. Gunther, charged with bribing
a juror in a Chinese murder case L.
Judge Lawlor's court, but Attorney
Hoff Cook, for the defense, obtained
a continuance till next Friday.
John Parsons, who is traveling for
an Eastern men's furnishing goods
firm, is held in $500 cash bail to an
swer the charge of having insulted a
twelve-year-old girl Friday afternoon
at Oak and Stanyan streets, while she
was going -from school to her home in
the Sunset district. There were no
eyewitnesses of the alleged offense, but
the girl notified Patrolman McKebbitt
and described Parsons so accurately
that the officer at once recognized tho
description as that of a man whom ho
found seated in the Park panhandle,
and whom the girl subsequently iden
tified as the man who had terrlflecl her.
Judge Mogan resolutely declined an
appeal for reduction of the ball, and
took occasion to say that no mercy
will be shown by him to any one con
victed of annoying women or children
In the public parks.
Mrs. Van Curen is a cripple and
walks with the aid of a cane. She
struck her persecutor with the cane be
fore he allowed her to rise. Then he
waxed angry and told her that she
didn't own the park.
Judge Mogan pronounced Master
Hester guilty of disturbing the peace
and ordered him to appear for sentence
next Tuesday.
As the boy was a stranger to her the
lady did not reply to his query. Then
he did a very foolish thing by ignoring
the snub and seating himself baside
her. Still more foolishly, he main
tained his familiar manner and con
tinued talking. Most foolish thing of
all, he placed his hand upon her knee
and endeavored to restrain her when
ehe attempted to rise and leave him.
"Let me go," she commanded.
"Aw, don't be in a hurry," he said.
"Hello, kid; didn't you used to go to
the Crocker School when I was there?"
Mrs. Edith Van Curen of 810 Stanyan
street was sitting upon a bench in
Golden Gate Park last Friday after
noon awaiting her husband when 19
year-r.ld Sidney Hester, who lives In
the 700 block of the same street, ap
proached her and said:
Then began a debate that continued
without a second's intermission on
either side until the Judge reminded
the faithful Hickey of his duty. During
its progress Mr. and Mrs. Thommel
shouted simultaneously, each apparent
ly determined to shout the other to
subjection. The lady had the last word
and was in superior argumentative fet
tle when the halt was en-forced.
The cape is under judicial advisement
till next Tuesday.
In defense of the charge Mr. Thommel
said he had been "nagged" by the com
plainant, but did not chase her out of
the hou.se. She, however, before depart
ing had struck his eye with her
clenched fist, and he submitted a deep
ly discolored optic in evidence.
"How can you?" yelled Mrs. Thom
mel.
"How can't I?" shouted Mr, Thom
mel. "Didn't you blacken my eye, and
didn't you pull out my ha.ir until I must
wear a wig?" To substantiate that in
terrogatory assertion Mr. Thommel
doffed a toupee and disclosed a cranium
bald as a billiard ball.
Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Thommel were
the stellar performers yesterday in
Judge Mog-an's court. They berated
each other across the bench until his
Honor inserted an index finger In each
of his ears and sternly commanded
Bailiff Hickey" to silence them. With
the man at his right and the woman at
his left, the Judge received the full
force of their rapidly delivered cross
fire of crimination and recrimination.
Mrs. Thommel had concluded her
complaint ere the oral duel began. It
was Mr. Thommel's f defensive state

The Pacific Mail steamship City of
Sydney, which arrived from Panama
and Central American ports Friday,
brought the news from Salvador that
Isaac Lewin, one of the leading coffee
brokers of that republic, who formerly
lived in this city, where his brothers
are now prominently Identified with
the grocery business, is waited there
on a serious charge by the Government
authorities.
According: to the information received
here Lewin, who had been engaged in
business In Salvador for a number
of year3, recently disappeared after
failing to account for $30,000 due on de
liveries of coffee assigned to "him. His
disappearance raised a great furor
among the growers, who appealed to
the Government to cause his arrest.
Le\yin was traced to Honduras, where
he was arrested, but while j being
(brought back to Salvador by officers
who had been sent" after him the ac
cused escaped and is supposed to have
made his way Into Guatemala.
The Government of Salvador has an
nounced its intention to apprehend
Lewin at any cost, and to that end the
steamers touching at the ports in that
country are being searched and a care
ful lookout is being maintained by
agents of Salvador in Guatemala and
neighboring republics. When the City
of Sydney touched at Salvador the of
ficials stated that the opinion was en
tertained by the Government that Lew
in was somewhere in the eastern part
of Guatemala making for Port Barrios
with the view of reaching this country
by way of New Orleans.
Le win's method of alleged Irregular
dealings with the coffee growers Is said
to have been to give receipts to plant
ers for their coffee, which was shipped
to this city^ and when the money on
these consignments became due he
went to Honduras, leaving a clerk.
Jorge Castro, to face the trouble that
ensued. The authorities, however, con
cluded that Castro was in no way Im
plicated and he was released from cus
tody. ,
One of the alleged victims of Lewin
was a sister of Macarlo Urias, one of
the wealthiest coffee flnca owners in
Salvador. , L.ewin is well known In this
city, where he formerly lived. He vis
ited San Francisco only a few months
ago in connection with his business af
fairs here. When the City of Sydney
arrived Friday afternoon several In
quiries were made of the officers of the
vessel regarding Lewin by persons sup
posed to be acting for Consul General
Mejta. The latter, however, while ad
mitting that he had learned that Lew
in was a fugitive from Salvador and
was badly wanted by the -authorities
there, denied that he had received any
official instructions regarding the case.

stock iti the Curtis, Collins & Hol
brook Company, a corporation doing
business in the southern part of the
rftatc. The stock, according to the
plaintiff, is worth S26S.550. He says
that for business reasons the stock,
though ;t portion of the assets of Tu
man & Holbrook. was allowed to stand
in the name of Holbrook. and that the
Jatter took advantage of this fact to
claim the shares as part of his indi
vidual assets. He says Holbrook mad*
ihis claim in January of this year, af
ter he hnd repudiated the partnership
and that he- has ever since refused to
acknowledge plaintiff's interest in th>j
stock and has also, says the plaintiff,
refused to account to him for money
he received during the last two years
for the sale of 100 shares of the stock.

concerning the charges preferred
against, him of failing to report for
duty and neglecting to account for
fundg intrusted to his . care, he as
sumed an air of surprise and queried
in a quiet manner:" "What charges?
where did you read of them?" When
informed that they had been published
in The Call a week ago and had also
been referred to in the press dispatches
from Washington later, he replied that
he had not read them.
*'As to -the story about my failure
to report for duty," he continued, "all
that there was to tha^ was the fact
that the Washington authorities tried
to find me at a certain time and were
unable to do so. I reported afterward.
There was no trouble."
He admitted that he is on his way
to- the Philippines under orders, but
would not admit that he had been dis
patched to Manila to answer any
charges, and endeavored to convey the
idea that these charges were all news

I The closing of the past week was
1 marked by a sale of considerable sig
nificance as showing the westward

ket street. The deal was put through
by Thomas Magee & Sons. A syndi
cate, of San Francisco men has pur
chased from the Wertheimers, who

: of two-story frame buildings. The

I pletely formulated, but it is probable

"Yes. I think I do," replied General
MacArthur, and scanning the faces qf
a number of the Filipinos which were
smiling into his. he added rather
sternly: "I guess I have met a number
of these gentlemen before."
General MacArthur spent half an
hour with the party and then took
formal leave, but not until he had ex
tended an Invitation to those present
to visit the Presidio before their de
parture for the East.
â¢ Tuesday the party will board the
Government . tag Slocum at 9:30
o'clock and enjoy a trip around the
bay and a visit to Mare Island. The
excursion of the visiting Filipinos to
Asti was necessarily postponed. A.
Sbarboro was unable to secure a car
for to-day or for either to-morrow
or Tuesday, the reason for the failure
being the great demand for cars for
the regular, holiday business of the
railway." ,Mr. Sbarboro has requested
the guests toe remain over until after
Wednesday, which is the earliest timÂ«
that transportation facilities can be
secured. If a favorable answer is re
turned the excursion to Asti will take
place on -Wednesday. . Â¦.':"â¢

"They worked with a conscientious
ness that impressed us. The sword may
make slaves, but never friends* and we
w.ere conquered not, by the sword, but
by reason. The relations existing will
become closer, and what, the United
States gives in love and friendship will
not be lacking in the Filipinos in re
turn. I am convinced you will soon
bring into realization the grandest ideas
conceived by President McKinley, who
said it was his greatest desire 'to bring
happiness and prosperity to eight mil
lions of people.' .'
- SPEAKS. IN ENGLISH.
"."I refer to General Smith, who later
was appointed Collector of Customs of
the Philippines and subsequently As
sociate Judge of the Supreme Court at
the- same time I was appointed. . The
civil, commercial and penal code of the
Filipinos had to be changed at the time
the United States assumed charge and,
ajlhough" this involved tho . greatest
labor and work, the Commissioners
worked diligently and kindly and re
tained all the good points of the old
code. You can hardly imagine the
labor of digesting the Spanish juris
prudence and formulating the new
legislation of the Philippines. The great
power of the United States, which is
not only great enough to conquer the
Philippines, but a nation three or four
times as large, was not needed after
our people had met the kindness of the
civil authorities as represented in your
best. men. . Â¦ \ ' â¢ Â¦ ~
Californians, and among the latter I
have observed a feeling of good will
and fellowship for the Filipinos. Among
many, I shall limit myself to men
tioning one illustrious Californian
absent .in the Philippines who, after
finishing his term as military Governor
of Xegros. after having prevented the
insurrection rife in Panay from spread
ing to Xegros, had to exercise his au
thority to. prevent the people of Xegros
from, gratefully retaining him there by
force. .
"The people have been granted privi
leges that take them to a higher plane
than that on which they formerly
stood by expounding the superiority
of the American system of govern
ment. I take pleasure in expounding
this to the Filipinos now iji arms
against the authority of the United
States, as it shows them how far it Is
above what they had in Spanish-times,
to attract them to tlio United States'

to point a moral between American

that the American system was nearly,

wrought such tin -effect that unless it

tobacco and sugar to have free entry
into the ports of the United States.
The suppression of duties could not in

present sugar production In the United
States does not represent one-half of
the consumption. The FUlplno meth
od of cultivating sugar is primitive
and has its drawbacks and could not
compete with the industry in the
States. Another. need is the estab

the new mortgage law renders the
question of titles beyond question, so

spoke as follows:
"Toastmaster and distinguished citi
zens of California: I desire to express
gratification and thanks for this mag
nificent exnresslon of good will, feeH
ing doubly thankful for more than one
reason. First as a member of- -.the
Honorary Commission of Filipinos -to
the St. Louis Exposition; also as a
member of the great agricultural as
sociation of Panay and Negros and also
as from the city of Hollo. The code of
your municipal organization introduced
by the Americans is one of your fore
most works; it reveals the purposes
and noble ideas entertained by the
United States for the uplifting of the
Filipinos.
"We do not have to make a trip to
San Francisco to learn of the tiospl-,
tallty of Americans, and particularly
United States Senator George C. Per
kins spoke at' length upon- the early
conditions of California, and of the
great transition that had taken place
in the State. Originally a Spanish do
main and filled more or less with peo
ple of untutored habits and nature it
had now grown to be one of the grand
est States in the whole Union. It. was.
regarded as such throughout. the world.
It is the nearest State and the open
seaboard to the Philippine Islands. The
whole Philippine Islands will certainly
within a few years see the greatness
and grandeur of the Government that
is ruled by the stars and stripes. This
commission, formed of the highest gen
tlemen of the Philippines, has come
here that the members could see for
themselves the grreataess of our ' form
of government. Every : man â¢ had a
chance to take an interest in the gov
ernment of the country. As a'Caiifor
nian he welcomed them-to the State,~as
.did every . other American citizen. '.
Following Senator Perkins, the Hon. j
Victorino Mapa, Associate Judge of the
Supreme Court of the Philippine Isl- :
ands, aaid: ......
"Toastmaster and Illustrious Califor
nians: Upon reaching the shores of
your bay two feelings strove. for mas
tery, the feeling of admiration for the
greatness "of "the 'work .you have
wrought on the shores of this bay. when
I think that fifty years ago there-was
nothing .here but a puebla of a : f ew
houses, and the feeling of. gratitude -for .
the hospitable welcome extended to the
commission. The feeling of admiration
has caused me* to, think of the grea^
smallness of J the Philippine Islands
when compared"' with the grandeur of
the United States,' as referring to the
material side of the question: the sec
ond,- the- sentimental -gratitude of the
Filipinos. < ... .
mostly needed is railroads in order
that American civilization, Â¦ progress
and ideas may be spread throughout
the. archipelago, and that railroad ma

redemption to the United States they
also desire to owe their material and
progressive redemption . to them."

Following Mayor Schmitz came Sr.
Don Juan de Leon, representing the
municipal Government of Hollo and ex-
At the conclusion of this speech there
was great applause and enthusiasm
on all sides and the flistinpuiv.hed visit
or was obliged to rise and express his
thanks by a profusion of graceful Fili
pino bows.
Mayor Eugene Sr-hmitz v.as next on
the programme. . He was in his hap
piest vein. Representi.13 the citizens
of San Francisco, he extended the free
dom of the city to the prentJemen of the
Philippines. He assured them that our
welcome was warm, sincere and hearty,
and that we were delighted to have
them in our midst. He told- them that
the welcome we extended here was only
a forerunner of what they would re
ceive during their entire trip in the
United States, and he was sure that
when their visit was finished they
would be glad to know what kind of
people and what kind of friends they
had In the United States.
"Senor Toastmaster and Citizens of
California: I will begin by asking your
pardon for not being able to address
you in our new tongue. I can hardly
express my gratitude and that of the
members of the commission for the
kindly and cordial reception we have
received from the citizens of Califor
nia. Although appointed by * the
United States, our. commission was
ratified by a meeting of Filipino citi
zens before our departure, therefore
we represent the entire body politic
and social of the Philippine Islands
and tender to you cordially all the
good will -that abides in the hearts
of the Filipino people to our brethren
on this side of the water. Be assured,
gentlemen, that all the manifestations
of good feeling and good will of which
we are the recipients will be resounded
throughout the islands, for all eyes
are fixed upon the commission as well
as upon the people of the United States.
The persons who carried the former
civilization to the Philippines carried
the rattan and 'Showed us the way to
heaven,' but tha new civilization,
which also comes from this side,
'shows us not how to die, but how to
live.* It was due to the commission
presided over by Governor William II.
Taft and four colleagues that th.e Fili
pinos began to feel a real attachment
for Americans; I may also include the
work of the Hon. Arthur W. Ferguson.
I therefore propose a toast to the citi
zens of California :uid our neighbors
on the other side of the Pacific.'.'
GREAT APPLAUSE.
The first Filipino speaker was the
Hon. Trinidad H. P. de Tavera, who
responded to the toast, "Our Guests."
He spoke as follows, the Hon. Arthur
W. Ferguson interpreting:
STRIKING ADDRESS.
He was sure that the intelligent Fili
pino knew this to be the state of af
fairs, and he was glad to see that so
many representative Filipino gentlemen
had come across the Pacific to see what
America was like. He knew they would
be proud when they looked upon the
manner in* which ' the United States
was governed, and when they could
see that every man under the Stars
and Stripes had a voice, and could con
tribute to the ruling of the affairs of
the nation. The more they saw of
America the more they would be im
pressed with what the American Gov
ernment means.
Professor Moses next spoke at length
about the existing relations of the two
countries, or, rather, of the connection
between the United States and the
Philippine Islands. Great good could
only be the result of the alliance, he
said.
The speeches of all the Filipinos
except that of Don Ramon Genato
were delivered In Spanish and were in
terpreted in a successful manner by
Commissioner A. W. Ferguson. Mr.
Symmes welcomed the visitors in
a speech filled with warmth and good
feeling, which was received with ex
pressions of delight by the guests.
The honorary members of the Phil
ippines Commission to the St. Louis
Exposition were banqueted at the Pal
ace Hotel last night. The entertain
ment was tendered by the commercial
organizations of San Francisco, head
ed by the Chamber of Commerce, as
sisted by distinguished officials, in
cluding the Governor of tbe^ State, the
Mayor and representative's of the
army and navy. The affair was^a
handsome one In every way and the
Maple Room never presented a more
beautiful appearance. The tables were
arranged in horseshoe shape and
loaded down with a wealth of magnifi
cent American Beauty roses inter
spersed with tall silver candelabra with
golden shades. F. J. Symmes was
toastmaster of the evening.

would diminish as the Spanish sov
ereignty has diminished in the Philip
pine Islands. False impressions on
both sides of the water have been
spread. The visit of this commission
here will unquestionably do a great
deal to correct tne erroneous ideas that
may be now existing. They will learn
and thÂ«y will fully understand after
their visit to this country what they
have sworn to obey.
'"They will be as loyal sons to
America as all of us are. Since our
friends of the commission have been
â¢here they' have professed the most
extreme thanks for the charming
courtesy that ttfey have received from
your hands, and I doubt if during their
entire visit throughout our country
that there will bey-any memories that
will linger as pleasantly In their minds
as tho reception, the cordiality and the
wholesome good feeling: that has been
extended to them by the eitlzens of
San Francisco.". At the conclusion of
Commissioner Ferguson's' speech,
which was delivered in English, a re
quest was made by one of the Filipinos
that he repeat the final sentences in
their own language. He did so, and
his remarks were received with an
ovation of applause from the foreigft
visitors. Hosts at the banquet were:
Supervisor Eggers objected to any
change being made in the budget, al
t hough he .would have liked to see
enough money given all the depart
ments to meet their respective plans.
Supervisor Bent Indorsed the motion
.of Boxton and said be hoped the
' hange would be made, for the School
Department certainly needed every
cent possible.
Speaking for the Finance Committee,'
Supervisor d'Ancona said the commit
tee would rather strike out the entire
item than, have it cut in half, as pro
posed by Boxton. The roll was caHed
and the motion lost by a vote of 11 to 5.
The vote expressed the strength of the
linance Committee, and every other
effort to make a change was turned
down by practically the same figures. "
In raiiid succession motions were
made to strike out the apportionments
for the public convenience station at
Fifth and Market streets. $7500: the
construction of a new elevator in the
west end of the City Hall.- $7500. and
:he erection of poles for decorative pur
poses on Market street, between the
ferry and Second street, Â£3500. but each
motion was as rapidly voted dov.-n.
Supervisor Lunstedt would not give
up even then, and moved to insert in the
tiiidfret an apportionment of $5000 for
the construction of a fire engine house
rn Ashbury Heights. The chair ruled the
motion out of order, as it v.as not ac
Â«nmpanied by any motion to strike out
*om<? other equivalent item.
Supervisor Alpcr? moved to strike
out the public convenience at Fifth and
Market streets and a^ld instead the
ronFtruetSon of an engine-house at
.\tihbury Heights. As the first portion
Of hi? motion had been previously de
feated the chair ruled him out of or
der, 'out at the reouest of D'Ancona the
question v/as put to a vote and met the
cam* fatfi as Sts predecessors.
Prior to the vote lwing taken Lun
stedt afked that the representatives
of th? police .ird Hre departments be
Â¦ allowed to address the board relative
to tbe m-eds of their res&ective depart
ments, but Supervisor Oomte objected,
end when the question was put to a
vote it vas lost.
The final voV? on the "adoption of the
budget resulted in 12 ayps and 4 noes,
ATpers?, BÂ«--nt. Boxton and Lunstedt
votlmc in the negative.
.. Just prior to adjournment Supervisor
P.raunhart asked for a suspension of
the rules ar.d the passage of the fol
lowing rc-soiut ion : â¢-- - , - s y 7 ;
BRALMIAirrS .RESOLUTION-.
"Whereas. The voters of the.cjty and
county of Sab PivuuJsco have on two
different occasions by Â» majority vote
emphatically declared Sn favor of the
municipal ownership and operation of.
the property known as the Geary
street Railroad; and
"Whereas. A two-thirds vote is nec
rssary to authorize the issuance of the
bonds of the city and county for the
purpose of constructing or recon
structing said road prior to its opera
tion bv the municipality, and such au
thorization lms not yet been obtained;
and
"Whereas, A petition has been filed
with this board asking for a franchise
to be granted to a private corporation
to operate a railway over and upon
said "Geary street, which petition has
not been f?rant<Â»d; and. #
"Whereas, The city and county of
ft*n Francisco has now the free and
unobstructed right to said street for
any public purpose. Including that of
tli*Â» construction and operation of a
street railway: now therefore be it
"Resolved. By the Board of Super
visor!?, that the Committee on Charter
Amendments be and it is hereby in
structed to report to this board an
amendment to the charter to be sub
mitted rit the next general election,
such amendment to provide for a spe
cial tax in excess of the 'dollar limit'
of taxation sufficient to raise a sum
for the conversion, construction arid
equipment of the Geary-street railway,
in accordance with the plans and esti
mates of the City Engineer now on file
in the office of the clerk of this board."
The resolution was referred to a
Joint committee on Public Utilities and
OBJECT TO CHANGES.
The budget recommended by the Fin
ance Committee of the Board of Super
visors has been passed to print. carry-
Ing with it apportionment* amounting
to J7.SS4.S3C for the year 1904-05. The
passage of the document was not ac
complished without a struggle, for
there was sufficient opposition to cause
some doubt in the minds of the com
mittee before a vote was taken on a
motion to strike cut one-half of the
first Item. As soon as that vote had
been taken the fate of the entire budget
vas Kettled.
Mayor Schmitz was unable to attend
the meeting of the board yesterday
niorning. hence Supervisor Branden
etein. chairman of the Finance Com
mittee, presided, and In calling the
meeting to order reported that all re-
Quests and protest* had been consid
ered by the committee, but that it had
been decided to recommend the passage
to print without any changes in the
original amounts. Supervisor d'Ancona
added that the request of the School
Department for a larger appropriation
than the budget allowed had been con
sidered, but that It had been concluded
to make no change, as the amount that
the committee had figured as a surplus
of the school fund could be considered
as pert of the apportionment, despite
the contention of the School Board to
the contrary. If any increase in any
amount was made it would cripple
some of the permanent improvements
specified, in the budget, and the com
mittee did not wish to do that.
In order to bring the question to an
issue Supervisor Boxton moved to re
duce the apportionment of $150,000 for
the Twin Peaks auxiliary water supply
s-ystem to $75,000. His contention was
that the $150,000 could not be properly
spent in one year and that by reducing
the amount one-half it would leave suf
ficient money to apportion for other
matters which were being slighted,
particularly the Police Department, the
F;re Department and the school sys
tem.
"I have not expressed any opinion
about the re-election of Senator Bard
and it would be improper for me to.
do so at this time. I have said that
I found him able and considerate and
a colleague whom I admired, but as to
saying anything about his re-election
I certainly did not nor would I at this
time. It Is entirely too soon to talk of
such matters, even if I wanted to. and
I can positively state that I have not
expressed an opinion regarding -the
matter. I do not know who my col
league will be and it would be very
unbecoming for me. at this time, to
give any expression of preference."
The First Congressional District,
which is overwhelmingly Republican,
has practically declared for Duncan K.
McKinlay as the Congressional candi
date from that district. That district
is Mr. McKlnlay's old home. There he
delivered his first speeches for the Re
publican ticket and won recognition;
by. national leaders as a man whose
services on the stumn were valuable
to the party. According to his for
mer neighbors Sonoma County will
send a solid delegation to the convene
tion pledged to secure his nomination
as the Republican candidate . for Con
gress. .
Current rumor has had it for several
days that Senator Perkins was pro
claiming for the re-election of Senator
Bard. The senior Senator, however,
says it would be unbecoming for him
to express any preference at this time.
When asked regarding the rumor he
said: T 4 l" .^
There is more or less discussion in
the Republican ranks as to the place
of meeting for the August convention.
Sacramento 13 anxious for the gather
ing, but the claims of Santa Cruz as
a convention city are deemed prefer
able by those who have attended con
ventions in both places. Among the
leaders of the rank and file the senti
ment is in favor of Santa Cruz" and
that city is likely to get the Republi
can State Convention in August
McKIXLAY FOR CONGRESS.
! The men who will this year act ai
the executive committee of the Re
publican party of California were
named by Judge Albert G. Burnett
yesterday afternoon and they will see
that the Republican party rolls up an
unprecedented majority In November.
In selecting: the committee of twen
ty-one, which Judge Burnett was au
thorised to do by the Republican Stats
conventiqn held in Sacramento May
18 and 18, great care was taken not
to have any one named who could bo
pointed out as factional or as any
thing, but a stanch Republican. Con
sequently the list contains no names
over which there could be raised any
doubt as to their loyalty to the party.
The committee will be called together
some time this week and will respond
in the following order:
T. H. Selvage of Humboldt County,
E. F. Woodward of Sonoma County.
R. T. Devlin of Sacramento County.
Â¦Charles H. Spear of Alameda County,
John A. Britton of Alameda County,
P. S. Teller of Alameda County, Al

San Luis Obiapo County and L. A.
Wright of San Diego County.
APPROVE COMMITTEE.
The personnel of the committee
meets with the hearty approval of the_
Republicans of San Francisco as ex
pressed by the members of the Union
League and kindred organizations.
The question of chairman will be tak
nn up when the committee meets dur
ing the week and as there is consider
able honor to be accredited to the
man who is at the head of the Repub
lican campaign in California when
this State casts the party vote for
Presidential electors, there will be a
friendly contest for the honor.
At the present time General George
Stone of San Francisco and Thomas
Flint Jr. of .San Benito are the prin
cipal aspirants for the position. Mem
bers of tile committee decline, at this
time, to state any preference, preiter
ring to leave the matter to the con
sideration of the committee when it
assembles.
Inasmuch as the committee has no
authorized head at present, Jacob
Steppacher, secretary of the organiza
tion, will call the meeting to oi-der and
ask for nominations for permanent
chairman. That meeting will deter
mine who will have the honor of di
recting the campaign of Theodore
Roosevelt in the State of California in

Latonia Race Results.
Jack Munroe settled down to work
In e;irmÂ»st at Shechan's lteach Tavern
yesterday. His principal work was
done in the afternoon, when he and
Andy Gallagher, the well-known ama
teur heavy-weight, went four fast two
minute rounds. The big fellow did not
want the general public admitted, so
only a small collection of friends had
the pleasure of seeing him go through
his initial day's work.
Munroe showed up extremely well
in his bout with Gallagher. The lat
ter is an unusually clever boxer, yet
he found it difficult to hit the miner.
He was shifty from the start and
showed much speed In every round.
Gallagher succeeded in hitting him
several good wallops in the stomach,
but the bl6\vs did not seem to affect
the big fellow In the least. He proved
cool and collected and those who saw
him box several years ago were pleas
antly surprised at the marked im
provement
Before boxing with Gallagher Mun
roe punched the bag, hit the sand
bag for a while and tugged at the
wrist machines. He will settle down
to hard work gradually and expects
to gain muscle and strength doing his
stunts by the sea. He will box again
with Gallagher thl3 afternoon.

ROME. May 23.â Cardinal Satolli.
accompanied by his cousin. Father
Ercole; his private secretary, Father
Marucchi. and a second secretary,
Father Lulgi, left for New York Fri
day. There were gathered at the rail
way station to bid him good-by many
high prelates and dignitaries. Car
dinal Satolli repeated that he was not
charged with any mission, adding:
"I am going, attracted to the United
States by pleasant remembrances ot
my sojourn there. I have many good
friends In America, so I anticipate
great pleasure in revisiting: the noblq
country."
Owing to the disagreeable wind
blowing and the fact that two hard
days of tournament play are before
the players, the attendance on the
tennis courts was lighter yesterday
than usual on Saturday afternoons.
The cracks who will figure in the
tournament to-day rested in to
be fresh.
One of the most interesting doubles
matches seen on the courts for eome
time was that between Harry Weihe
and Grant Smith and Drummond Mac-
Gavin and Herbert Schmidt. Weihe
haa played but little of late and was
a trifle unsteady at the start, but
played his usual clever game in the
last three sets. Schmidt supported
MacGavin well, and, although they
won but one of the four sets played,
their opponents had no easy time beat-
Ing them. Smith and Weihe did some
fast and clever work at the net, while
their opponents were best in the
back court. MacGavin and Schmidt
won the first set, 6-1. Their oppo
nents won the second set by a Similar
score. The third set was the closest
and finally went to Smith and Weihe.
The fourth set was a repetition of the
third. The score was 1-6, 6-1. 8-6, 6-4.
Weihe and MacGavin then Joined
forces and played Schmidt and Dr.
Hill. The college cracks were too
strong for their opponents and beat
them two straight sets.
Will Allen seems to have lost his
skill and rarely wins a practice match.
He was beaten yesterday by both Ray
Cornell and Carl Gardner. Cornell
beat him 9-7 and Gardner beat him
10-8, 8-6.
Car! Gardner and Herbert Long
played a fast practice match in the
morning. After losing the first set,
6-8, Gardner pulled out the next two
handily. Gardner had a lead of 5-2
and 40-15 in the first 6et, but Long's
clever strokes pulled him through.
The loser was rather careless In the
la.Bt two sets.
Chet Smith and Ray Cornell played
three sets, two of which were won by
the former. Smith lost the first set,
but had no difficulty winning the last
two, the third being a love set.
Herbert Gray beat Ben Wood, win
ning two sets out of three.
Dr. Lovegrove beat H. Spring In
straight sets. The doctor Is improving
rapidly and seldom loses a match.

San Francisco can win almost any
old kind of a game from Portland pro
vided the little hit comes in occasion
ally. They won yesterday and at that
they did not have to hit the ball any
too hard. The tramps from the north
did more of their posing stunts on the
bags and absolutely refused to come
in when they should, so the game end
ed 7 to 2.
Mr. Houston had his troubles in big
chunks during the sixth inning, when
the Portlanders executed the marvel
ous feat of getting one run on four
hits. Nadeau, Beck and Francis sin
gled. On Francis' hit Nadeau started
to come in after a bad throw had been
made to the plate. It seems that
Leahy had placed a mask on the line
and Shea went over to remove it.
When the ball came in Leahy let It
go through him.
Nadeau made the plate and then the
howl was raised. The San Francisco
players contended that Shea ha % d
balked Leahy and the umpire ruled
that way. Then the Portland players
gathered around in bunches on the
field and for ten minutes the diamond
looked like the scene of an old-time
riot.
Finally the players gave in and got
back into the game. The first ball
that Jones tried to pitch fell out of
his hand and resulted in as palpable
a balk as ever happened on a ball
field. This the umpire could not see
fejid he refused to allow the batter to
take his base. Another rough house
followed and this time the fans Joined
ia the roast.
Anyhow, the Portlanders got the
worst of it this time, and they had to
get in and play the best they could.
Murphy came* through with a single
to left and brought Xadeau in. It
looked like a victory for the Browns
right there, but the next two men
were dead ones, so the last chance had
flown.
Young Druhot had his control with
him, but he got bumped rather reg
ularly when the locals needed runs.
The game was slow and dragged along
for two hours and ten minutes. Jones
pitched good ball and struck out eight
men. On Decoration day there will
be two games between the same teams.
The first will be called at 10:10 a. m.
on the Oakland diamond and the sec
ond at Recreation Park at 2:30. The

The record equaled was that for the
half-mile, 1.56 4-5, and was done by Â£;.
B. Parsons of Yale. He could have un
doubtedly passed these figures had he
been pressed.
On the Jump-off for the medals Mc-

because they were made after tha

NEW YORK, May 28. â It was only
natural that Bryn Mawr, which-was
second to Delhi in the Withers, should
win the Preakness stakes at Gravesend
track to-day, but it was the manner
In which he won it. that aroused the
admiration of the spectators. It i'J
true he was in receipt of ten pqunds
from Dolly Spanker, whose form at
Morris Park had been excellent,, but
the Goughacres colt fell far out of
the race in the first half mile because
of the sizzling pace and also because
he suffered considerable .interference
that few expected to see him overcome
the long lead held by Dolly Spanker.
When the field strung out around
the far turn, however, and 'it was seen
that the purple jacket of Bryn Mawr's
rider was steadily overhauling those
in front, a wave of enthusiasm swept
along the densely packed quarter
stretch and through the two enormous
stands, and the final gallant victory
achieved by the Pennsylvania colt was
cheered to the echo. The triumph was
partly due to the alertness of Hilde
brand, his Jockey, who lost not one
foot of ground, but who made his
mount cling to the rail. Dolly Spanker
ran rather wide, much as Irish Lad
had done in the Brooklyn handicap.
Bryn Mawr came on next the rail and
half a furlong from "home it was
clearly seen he â¢ would win. Dolly
Spanker was reeling from the effects
of the fast pace set.
Flammula, the great tip, ran un
placed. Summary:

Nothing is known of the woman's
antecedents and it .has not yet been
decided what to do with her.
The woman was isolated in the
liner's hospital and there detained un
til she was turned over to the quaran
tine officials, who vesterday took her
baggage from the liner and disinfected
the hospital where she had been con
fined.
A leper, with fingers and toes eaten
away by the dire disease, was discov
ered among the 900 passengers on the
liner Siberia three days after she left
Honolulu. When the Siberia arrived
here Friday morning the unfortunate
victim was pent to the quarantine sta
tion at Angel Island, where she is now
detained.
The leper passenger was Antonio
Jffsu. a Portuguese woman. 60 years of
age. who took passage on the Siberia at
Honolulu. So well did she hide her af
fliction that she evaded the vigilance
of the authorities at the island port
and was on the liner mingling with her
fellow passengers for three days before
It was discovered.'
Jt was Purser Jerome who made the
discovery. It was noticed " that the
woman kept her hands hidden beneath
her shawl. She also wore gloves con
tinuously. Jerome noticed something
about the shape of her hands, and the
woman's apparent confusion when
questioned impelled the purser to re
fer the case to Surgeon Lutz.
An investigation revealed that it was
to hide the ravages of the disease that
the woman wore glcyves; the flnjjers of
which were found to be stuffed with
cotton to dissemble the flesh and bone
digits which had been eaten away by
the leprosy.
Her toes had suffered in like manner.
There was a large audience in the
Alhambra last night to witness the
burlesque circus arranged by W. t*.
Haskell for Islam Temple; Mystic

the performers were members of thu
Temple, who made the show a bur
lesque in the fullest sen?e of the word.
Jt was intended as a night of relaxa
tion for the members and their families
and friends. Almost every lady on en
tering the theater was given a toy bal
loon ornamented with the mystic sym
bols of Islam Temple.
Outside the entrance to the show tent
George "Habernicht acted as spieler,
Charles H.' Van Orden held down the
ticket wagon, and C. F. Eckton, J. D.

lary, had sentence suspended by. Judge
Dunne for a month, and was told by
the Judge to go to work and behave
himself. He was found in the room of
"William J. Pilcher at 145*i Fifth street

was sentenced to serve three years in
San Quentln.

two charges of burglary against him
and was sentenced to serve ten years

Judge .suspended sentence on his con
viction and allowed him to go on pro
bation, but he could. not refrain from

to what was expected, most of them
became '"rooters" for the Lakeside

grateful to you. Already I f*-l the vtcor of new life !n my body; no ache* and no rains. I wiah you evÂ«ry auecers In reor work." ,
Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. They are a beacon light to the man who has become discouraged from
useless doctoring. I get such letters every day. ,
My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates them, and stirs up a great forcj of energy. ;
l/Du'ie King, Commercial Vlotel, San Francisco, says: "I take pleasure in dropping you a few lines to let you knoT how creat!y Improved I w since I sot y?ur Belt. M7
headaches have left me and I am iraJning In welxht. I feel like Â¦ a different woman, and wi very grateful to vou for all the god your B*!t has <!ere me."
I make llie best electrical body appliance in the world, having devoted twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. My cures after
everything else has failed are my best arguments. â¢
Mr. Roy Burlc. McKittrick, Cal., writes: "From tbe first night I wore the belt I felt nsw lifÂ«' tn every part of my bÂ«dy. The weakness "*Â» choked Â»rr.med:atÂ«i;\ and t am
now able to do heavy -Â»Â»ork without tiring. I nm et"d 1^ thought of the belt, for In no other way could the m*nÂ«y briny m* so much p>aÂ«ure." >
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or joints, "come-and-go" pains in his shoulders, cftrst nr Â«idc. Sciatica in
his hip, Lumbago, Rheumatism, or any ache or pain, and my Belt will pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive oat evrry sign of pain, i
No pain can exist where ray Belt is worn. /
Mr. J. L. Baird of Orland. Cal.. writes: "Sty back Is antlrcly- well, and I would not take $10Â© for my *elt tf I couH not icrt anotbÂ»T. It '.a tiÂ« best thing rm earth flBf a

And these "old" men, these men who have burned the candle at both ends â or even if they haven't â these men who tor one rrason or another
feel that life has loit its spice, that they are getting old too fast, I can make them feel the sparkle and fire of jv.uth r.^ain.
v I'll never forget when Mr. A. Crawford of Pokegama, Oregoriv an old man of seventy, wrote, to me and said: "When I wrote to you laÂ« I
told you to send me a Belt to make an old man young, and you did. I am seventy years old, and since I have worn the Belt I f??l as strong a* I
i did at thirty-five, and can do as good a day's work as I could at. that age." It was two j-ears ago that Mr. Crawford wrote me that letter. Here 13
one I just got from him: " |
"In rÂ«ply to your letter I am glad to say thit I to just as much In favor of your Belt as I ever was. for it has b^ea a remarkable help to irÂ«. I am seventy-two years old, but

In the quest of a "washable" Bible,
for use in the London police courts,
attention has been called to a water
proof cloth, an admirable imitation of
leather. Mr. Labouchere. in Truth,
makes the sensible suggestion that if
a proper "washable" cloth can be
found, its use be not confined to Bibles,
but to historical romances and books
that are read. Mr. Labouchere thinks
especially washable bindings J could be
advantageously used in free circulat
ing libraries, j But why stop here? Why
not such also in private libraries and
why not, furthermore, a washable pa
per, so that the books could be washed
inside and out? Then, perhaps/ read
ing might be made sanitary, and. sani
tary we must be. Also, if washable
bindings are used, in public .libraries,
laundries will need to be attached and
Mr. Carnegie will thus have opened
up to him another, way for getting rid
of his money. Housekeepers, however,
would probably be found < lined up
against washable bindings, sanitary or
unsanitary, which would mean an ex
tra laundress and new terrors to house
cleaning.â New' York Globe.

One evidence of gentle breeding is a
well-modulated voice. Thomas Went
worth Hlgginson said "Shut me up
In a dark room with a mixed multitude
and ] can pick out the gentlefolks by
thelr voices." In the compass of every
voice there are three registersâ the
middle or throat, the lower or chest
and the upper or head register. The
use of the middle pitch for talking is
very desirable, but the voice should be
trained to slide up and down, varying
with tho emotions; low when the mood
Inclines toward seriousness and higher
when it becomes tinged witrf excite
ment. An interesting speaker constant
ly changes his pitch â not abruptly, but
with ease and skill; and the greater
range one has the more certain he is
to get and retain the pleased attention
of listeners. Our high-pitched, strident
voices are sharply criticized, and it is
quite within our power to change them.
I confess to liking a bit of slang now
end then from a young man's mouth.
It sounds racy, adds snap and spice if
used judiciously, and a few of Its terms
are pithy and expressive; but when a
girl uses slang it only sounds common.
What Is becoming to one sex is not
necessarily so to the other. When we
see . a woman who laughs and talks
loudly in public places we put a severe
strain upon our charity and judgment
not to think her vulgar. When to the
conventional "How do you do?" she
replies "Fine!" we know on just what
rung of the social ladder to put her. â

The heroic action of the engineer of a.
little compressed air locomotive, as
sisted by a number of the employes,
was all that prevented a terrible explo
sion of dynamite this evening at the
works of the California Powder Works
at Pinole. During the fire, which de
stroyed the gun cotton department,
half a dozen freight cars loaded with
dynamite were standing on a side track
close to the gun cotton building, and
when the structure caught fire the
flames spread so rapidly that there was
little time to move the cars.
The little compressed air engine was
coupled on, and Just in time the train
load of dynamite was whisked away to
a safe distance. Many empty cars
were standing on the same siding and
an attempt was made to save them,
but the heat was so great that It was
impossible and they were burned with
the building.
The gun cotton department was
burned to the ground and a lot of
valuable machinery was destroyed. The
total loss will amount to about $25,000.

mestic Industries School. It seems
that ihe school had never, in its four
years <-f existence, been conducted on
a practical basis. Mrs. Hearst believ
ed at Cist that it would eventually be
come f;e!f-tupporting. but it always
continued to be a heavy drain upon her
purse. The non-success cf the institu
tion from a financial standpoint was
due altogether to the fact -that only
the finet-t kind of needlework was
Uiugrht. and for this there is almost
no rr.erket.

TN piib'.ii-utiun of the story of Mrs.
Bearst'fi withdrawal from the support
of the Domestic Industries School for
girls attending the University of Cali
fornia, and from two ether of her bene
faction* has brought out a denial from
Mrs. Hearst^ friends that she contem
plates complete withdrawal of assist
ance t<> university activities. These
friejids eay that the university's bene
factress is merely lopping oft! a few of
the nrn-re expensive experiments that
have failed to justify her further aid.
It is true that she Is retrenching in
certain directions, but this is merely
incidental.
As an issue growing out of the suit
an accounting was called for from the
trustees. According to the present set
tlement the estate of John Taylor turns
back 1000 shares of the Kennedy Min
ing and Milling Company's stock Into
the estate and ten shares of the Llver
more Bank stock. Thomas H. B. Var
ney turns back seventy shares of the
bank stock, and Judge Seawell has de
cided that 450 shares of the Kennedy
Mining and Milling Company and ten
shares of the bank stock claimed by
Pitcher's estate but held by the bank
belong to the Varney estate.
The annuitants are Frances Raleigh,
who receives $100 a month; Harriet A.
Loomis, who gets $50 . a month, and
Mrs. Emily Brownell, who receives $75
a month. Fifteen heirs of the estate
have been represented by Attorneys
Bishop & Wheeler and A. J. Treat. The
estate of John Taylor has been repre
sented by Attorney W. S. Goodfellow.
i The* decision was rendered in accord
ance with an agreement entered into
with the representatives of the original
trustees in regard to the amounts to
be turned back by them into the estate.
According to Attorney Treat this set
tlement Is on the same basis as was of
fered them . seven years ago, but was
declined.
Charges of fraud and the extraor
dinary actions taken in order to keep
the case from coming, to trial made it a
matter of wide general interest. Var
ney was the founder of the Llvermore
Bank and Pitcher was cashlen The as
sets of the estate now consist' of all of
the stock of the -bank, the Garcia ranch
property, valued at $100,000, and 1450
shares of the Kennedy Mining and
Milling Company, in all valued at $325,
000.
The litigation that, has lasted for a
decade over the estate of Thomas Var
ney of Llvermore is , ended. Superior
Judge Seawell of San Francisco, who
heard the case because of the disquali
fications of the Alameda Judges for
one cause or another, rendered a decis
ion to-day in which he decided that
the eighteen heirs of the estate were
entitled to a distribution of about $300,
000 of property. This leaves about $25,
000 still tied up to pay annuities aggre
gating $225 a month. In this decision
the heirs have won as against the trus
tees, who have maintained that the
trust intended that the entire estate
should be held together until the last
of the three annuitants died.
The. case has been a notable one.
Thomas Varney died at Livermore and
left as the trustees of his will John
Taylor, H. H. Pitcher and Thomas II.
B. Varney, his nephew. Taylor and
Pitcher are both dead, the latter shoot
ing himself at the crisis of the litiga
tion. Thomas H. B. Varney has re
signed as a trustee, and the California
Title Insurance and Trust Company is
the sole trustee now of the estate.

The parents of the victim of the sad
accident reside at 2215 Andover street.
Within plain sigh of four school
mates, who were unable to render any
aid, ten-year-old George Rutherford,
son of William H. Rutherford, a well
known blacksmith of this city, sank
to his death this afternoon In the
waters of a pool in the old Blair
quarry near Piedmont. By the time
his companions, horrified by the fat%
of their playmate, had secured help no
trace of the boy was to be seeh, and
it was only after a long search that
the body was finally recovered.
Young Rutherford, accompanied by
Ned Elchler, Theodore Moore and two
other boys, all about the same age,
went out to the quarry this afternoon
to go in swimming. After they had
paddled about In the water for soma
time they climbed upon an old raft and
pushed it out into the deeper water.
The raft, overweighted, began to sink,
and the boys made a scramble for the
bank. All got safely ashore but Ruther
ford, who was thrown from the raft
Into a deep pool from which he could
not escape. His playmates were un
able to reach him and saw him strug
gle in vain to reach the bank. After
he had disappeared they ran for help.
G. . W. Burr and A. R. Scrimgeour,
both of whom are employed by the
Oakland Paving Company, which con
trols the quarry, dragged the pond for
several hours, finally recovering the
body at 8 o'clock .this evening. They
at once brought it to the morgue in
Oakland.

The dead body of Pietro Virindo, an
Italian bartender, who resided in San
Francisco, was found this morning in
a vacant lot near St. Mary's Cemetery.
A pistol beside the body and a bullet
wound in the head explained. the man
ner of death, and there is no doubt
that Virando committed suicide. Last
Wednesday morning 1 he wrote a letter
Jto his. cousin, Antonio Gaffodlo, who re<
fsldes at Twenty-seventh and Grove
streets, announcing his, intention to
commit suicide. This letter was dated
: at Berkeley and yesterday Gaffodlo
took the missive to Deputy Coroner
Streightlf at Berkeley, but as the body
of Virando had not been discovered at
that time the Deputy Coroner could
give Gaffodio no information.
In his letter Virando stated that he
intended to make away with himself,
as ho was tired of living and did not
care to keep up the struggle any
longer. He asked the pardon of his
mother and his friends for his act.
Virando worked for some time as a
cook and bartender In San Francisco.
He was 43 years of age and unmarried.

MacMuIlan alleges that he has per
formed his part of the contract, thai
this money was brought into the coun
ty treasury through his efforts and
that he is entitled to his share of it.
His claim has been repudiated by the
Supervisors, who claim that they were
duped when they made the agreement.
The suit is brought by M. C. Chapman,
as attorney for MacMuIlan.
At the first of \his year MacMuIlan
addressed a communication to the
Board of Supervisors, saying he
thought that much property in the
county was not upon the assessment
roll. He offered to expert the assess
ment rolls for half of the taxes upon
such property as he could find. His of
fer was accepted by the Supervisors.
MacMuIlan has since claimed half of
the taxes on the assessment levied on
the franchises cf the Oakland Gas,
Light and Heat Company in Oakland,
Alameda and Berkeley; the block sys
tem of switching of the Southern Pa
cific Railway and the water in the res
ervoirs of ihe Contra Costa Watet
Company. The assessment on the
water alone has been placed at
11.000,000.
To enforce his claim against the
Hoard of Supervisors, C S. MacMuI
lan brought suit this afternoon against
Alameda County for the sum of
Â«21,70u 80. This he claims is due him
by reason of a contract entered into
by thu Board of Supervisors whereb>
he was to receive 50 per cent of the
taxes collected on all property he could
ilnd was not regularly upon the as- 1
sessincnt rolls. He claim:* that he dis
covered several million dollars' worth,
and that $Â«3,681 60 has been collected
through his efforts which would have
otherwise been lost to the county. Ac
cording; to his contract, he claims half
of it.

New Potatoes continued to arrive freely,
particularly from the river districts, and the
market had an easy tone, with trade of a' light
lobbing character. Most dealers were anxious
to clean up, as Monday will be a holiday, and
some were making liberal concessions to buy
ers In order to force sales. The top quotation
for whites was obtained only for small lots of
exceptionally fine stock, $1 75 being the top
for the general market. . Old Potatoes con

reasonable offer was refused. Onions, too,
were easier under liberal supplies and a light

It is true that the young habitue of
showy places of amusement may pro
nounce the habit of feminine smoking
to be "ripping," or whatever Is .the
latest term of approval in his vernacu
lar, and it is equally indisputable that
there are many long-haired decadents,
showing by their dress and manners
a degeneracy from the essentially mas
culine, "who encourage women to ap
proximate as much as possible to them
selves. But without fear of contra
diction it can be emphatically stated,
that the English gentleman, well bred,
brought up in an ordered home, edu
cated amid the cleanly, wholesome In
fluences of a public school, and filling
his useful part In the sea or land ser
vice of the King, ip a profession or
business, hates to see a woman
smoking under any circumstances, and
as far as his own sisters and his
fiancee or wife were concerned, would
do his utmost to prevent it. Perhaps
his attitude is not strictly logical, and
If he enjoys a cigar, cigarette or pipe
himself, why should not his women
folk? â¢ In his mind, however, smoking
by, women is invariably associated
with other attributes that he does not
admire, and though on occasion he may
make excuses for the cigarette that has
accompanied a flirtation the prejudice
Is there and is ineradicable. â London

CHICAGO. May 28.â Lower cables and con
tinued favorable weather depressed wheat
prices to-day, final figures on the July de
livery being down '-jc. Corn is ofT *;c. Oats
show a lots of *Â»t'Sc. Provisions are 2Â«ic
higher to Oc lower.
The weather and cables caused moderate
re'ling of wheat at the etart, resulting In a
elight decline, July being off He to \c. at 86c
to Sti'ic There was rome buylne that looked
like covering of the same character that has
been in progress for several days. This de
mand had a tendency to hold prices fairly
steady at the initial dealings. Later, how
ever, holders of May commenced to liquidate.
Ensuirs weakness started considerable gelling
In other months, causing lueses all around.
The September delivery showed a fair decree
of firmness, due to purchases of nearly 1,000,000
bushels by a house with Northwest connec
tions. Extreme fluctuations marked the
trading in May. and much difficulty was ex
perienced in making sales.
After selling off to SS^eSoTic. July closed
at SST-ic. May ranged between 95>4c and Â»7'ic,
doting at SKÂ»%c
Corn was decidedly bearish, due to un
usually heavy receipts and almost perfect
weather conditions for the growing crop. July
opened &c to Me lower, at ..^c to 47*ic, sold
down to 4ti T^c and closed at 47c.
Oats were under similar bearish Influence
in the matter of * weather. After opening a
ehade lower at :JS*;c. July declined to 3SÂ»4c
anrt closed at 38Vic.
Provisions are practically deserted, and
biismert almcst at a standstill. The easier
tone in grains offset a firm hog market and
caused slight losses. July pork closed 5c
lower, at $11 274. July lard was off 2^c, at
$6 47*i. Ribs were up 2^0,

Receipts of Cherries were the largest for the
season, being somewhere in the neighborhood
of 4000 packages, and as there were large lines
carried over from the preceding day the mar
ket was. very weak. Occasional sales of the
beet btack in. small boxes were reported at a
slight advance over the quotations, but for the
general market GOc was an extreme figure,
offerings of common white in small boxes were
practically unsalable. Royal Annes were of
fering freely, but they were poorly packed and
sold slowly. Bulk lots were steady and the
canners paid 2@3Vic for white and 2$3c per
pound for black. Apricots appeared from AVtn
tcrs and from the river and sold within the
quoted range. Green Apples brought 50c per
box. Cantaloupes from Thermal sold at twe
each, and come small oneg from Coachella were
offering at SSc each. Citrus fruits were in free
supply and^%nchanged.
STRAWBERRIESâ $4Â®S per chest for Long
worths and *2<i."{ 50 for the larger varieties.
LOGANBERRIESâ JtffS per -cheat and

The aggregate receipts of Strawberries were
heavy, but the market showed considerable
improvement, as retailers were, purchasing
freely in order to meet the extra Sunday re
quirements. Fresh arrivals of Longworths
were comparatively light for reasons already
mentioned, and choice offerings cleaned up
readily at firmer rates, the ruling prices being
95QS per. chest. Some poor and sunburnt lots
sold down to $3 per cb^st. but there were not
enough sales at that figure to warrant such a
quotation. The large varieties cleaned up well
and the canners were still buying at the mini
mum quotation, but were unable to secure any
great quantity, as the regular trade cleaned
the market up pretty well. Small lots of
Blackberries and Loganberries were received
and cleaned up readily at good figures. Rasp
berries from the south brought 20c per small
basket, and Eorne from Hay wards sold at $1 25
per drawer. Gooseberries and Currants con
tinued plentiful and dull.

â¢ The rate of reinsurance on the Ital
ian ship Laura jumped yesterday from
35 to CO per cent and the underwriting
world is beginning to consider as hope
less the overdue vessel's prospect of
reaching her destination. She is 'now
out 119 days from Newcastle, Australia,
for Tocopillp. As she is loaded with
coal, her cargo becomes more < sus
ceptible to spontaneous combustion
with every day it remains in her hold.
The average length of the voyage she
is making is fifty daye. so that she is
now more than two months overdue.
The Laura is well known at this port.
No change, was reported in the rates of

The Millen Griffith lent her usual and
purely fictitious assistance on Friday
when the liner Siberia went to her
berth. Such assistance as was needed
was rendered by the army tug Slocum,
which happened to, be in the vicinity.
The Millen Griffith, however, put her
nose to the liner's steel side forward
and did what she could. Long after
the liner had been \ made ' fast and
when most of the passengers had dis
embarked, Captain Smith heard a noise
over the bow as of a coffee mill grind
ing, and, looking. over the side, discov
ered the Millen Griffith still churning
away. In the bustle of landing she had
been forgotten. :
The Arabs, however, will be another
kind of towboat and according to the
builders will be one of the most pow
erful on the bay. In size, strength and
appearance the Arabs will resemble
the Santa Fe tug A. H. Payson. She is
115 feet long. 24 feet in beam and 12
feet deep. She will be an oil-burner,
equipped with 750-horsepower engines
and capable of making It or 13 knots.
She has a wooden hull, and is provided
with a cabin for passengers.
The Pacific Mail Company's new
tugboat, Arabs, was successfully
launched yesterday, morning from the
Fulton Iron "Works yard at Harbor
View. The Arabs will replace the Mil
len Griffith, which lost the power of
towing many moons ago and has long
been a standing Joke In the local ma
rine world.
Arabs Successfully" Launched.
'The Pacific ,. Mail Company's steam
ship San Juan, Captain Urry, sailed
yesterday for Panama and way ports
with 2450 tons of cargo, which included
1500 barrels . of California wine, 60,000
feet of lumber and 250 tons of lead.
Most of this freight is for New York.
Her passengers included forty-five
Chinese, a larg-e number in the steer
age and in the cabin she carried the
following named: A. E. Hornstein, E.
L. Baker. Mrs. F. Mowlong, S. C. Mil
ler and J. L. Elder.

"Le Fils de 1'Etolle" ("The Son of
the Star"), the new musical drama in
five acts, libretto by Catulle Mendes
and music by Camilla Erlanger, i3 the
most lavishly staged production ever
presented In Paris, according to tho
critics. It goes back to the taking of
Jerusalem by the Romans during the
reisrn of the Emperor Hadrian. There
seems to be not much more for the
critics to say of it. ': â¢ /
PARIS, May 21. â "Varennes." Mme.
Bernhardt's new play, has not scored
quite the success in Its first few pre
sentations that had been predicted.
Although ever ready to accept her # as
the greatest of all modern artists In
whatever play ihe may appear, the
public is manifestly passive, to say the
least, in accepting: her latest effort.
The play was written for her by Lave
dan and Lenotre. It recounts the
flight of Louis XVI and Marie Antoi
nette to Varennes.
For some reason the authors have
distorted the truth not a little, and In
some places, the critics agree, it has
been needlessly sacrificed. This, they
argue, was done for romantic reasons.
The consensus of opinion Is that there
should have been more romance in the
play or more history. Catulle Mende3,
a noted author and playwright, speak
ing of Bemhardt in the play, says:
"As yesterday, as to-morrow, as al
ways, ilme. Bernhardt â smiling, im
passioned, sorrowful, proud, humili
ated, maternal, loving, coaxing and
majestic, charming and epic â takes
possession of the soul victoriously and
all other successes, those of the au
thors, painters, actors, actresses, scat
ter before her continued triumph."
Marcel Prevost's new play, "La Plus
Falble" ("The Feeblest") has Jumped
into favor at the Comedle Ftancaise.
The end of the play la moral, and for
that reason something of a novelty in
a French drama. Perhaps It is this
very novelty that has caught the pop
ular fancy.
The hero is a man who has linked
his life to a divorced womanl He has
no faith In marriage vows, and, there
fore, takes her wlthouX a wedding
ceremony. His family lives according
to the strictest conventions and his
attachment for the divorced woman
engenders bitterness. At last the hero
meets with a serious accident, and
while his life is hanging in the balance
his relatives carry him off and. try to
terminate his unconventional alliance.
But, as it must in all successful
plays and books, love triumphs In the
end. The husband of the divorced
woman conveniently dies, and then a
mutual friend crops up to reunite the
twain. The hero's antemarriage views
are suppressed. He and the heroim;
are properly married and "live happy
ever after." 'Â¦'â¢',

These acts, says Barber, and many
other alleged peculiar transactions in
dulged in by the directors, aroused his
suspicions and he Investigated further,
to learn that the assessments on the
ftock recently levied were made solely
for the purpose of enriching the di
rectors and were of such a nature that
they should be declared void by the
court.

Uien he learned that the dividends paid

had been given $27,300 commission on
the sale of stock and that the money
had bÂ«en taken from the funds of the
corporation, given to Waterhouse and
then divided among the other directors.
He says that he also learned that the
two dividends declared on the stock of
the corporation had been paid out of
money borrowed on the assets of the
rorpcration, and that a sale of $10,000
worth of stock had resulted only In
profits for the directors.

frauded out of ?i')00 by the defendants-
He asks that the affairs of the com
pany be taken out of the hands of the
orfendants, that a receiver be appoint
ed to prolect his interests and those
i>f a number of other people who suc
cumbed to the blandishments of the

that certain assessments levied be de-
PnMlc . prints and private advices
' from Honolulu b&Y that misfortune haa
! already overtaken the American Tra
1 vesty Companyâ the bunch of merry
I burleaquers that was organized here to
I tour the Orient and sailed away about
i a month ago after, playing a roost suc
! cessful two weeks' enp^-gement at the
i Grand Opera-house.
They mado an Immense professional
and social hit in the Hawaiian metropo
â¢ lis, but illness and internal dissension
i threaten their future. Clarence W.
: Kolb, the elongated German comedian,
I has been ordered by medical men to
; return to tbe United States if he de
' sires to prolong his life, for they .found
that in view of his present physical
! condition a visit to Australia at this
1 time â it is midwinter there â would
' certainly shorten his earthly tenure.
; He has adopted their counsel, say the
Â¦ newspapers, and will come back to
', California at the expiration of the
'. Honolulu engagement.
The seriousness of this deprivation
i can be appreciated by any one who has
i weighed the comparative values of the
i American travesty principals in the
i Weber and Fields productions. That it
[was the team work of Kolb and Dill
: that made the pieces "go" is conceded
: by every one who saw the same play
| ers in the same plays at Fischer's
; Theater. The other prominent people â
' Barney Bernard, Maud Amber and
: Winfield Blake â had admirers in plen
i ty, but everybody admired Kolb, . the
' lanky and aggressive, and Dill, the
Â¦ paunchy and, passive. It is understood
j that Kolb's successor as Dill's foil will
be Harry . Cashman. a- comedian who
has played various roles at several the
| aters In this city without winning dis
i Unction in any of them. 5
; Report has it also that Barney Ber
1 nard is dissatisfied with certain condi-.
: tions and may soon return to the scene
; of his former triumphs. A letter from
; a member of the company says that
> although Maude Amber and Winfleld
I Blake were comparatively obscured in
: the advance advertising, they made a
â¢ hit of the opening show. "Fiddle-Dee
: Dee," and that their unlooked-for suc
Â¦ cess did not 6erve to elevate the spirits
] of their brother and sister, mummers
i who had been extensively "featured"
! by the man ahead. "While the islanders
I laughed at Kolb and Dill and pro
nounced Bernard a clever Hebrew im
j personator, they threw -up their hats
and stamped their feet- in admiration
1 of -the statuesque leading wo.man and
. handsome leading man. One facetious
: para,Tapher dubbed him "Winthegirls"
; Blake..
The company, minus Kolb and per
| haps others of the original member
| fhip. will resume its Journey to Aus
Â¦ tralia on the steamer that left' this port
: last Thursday.
