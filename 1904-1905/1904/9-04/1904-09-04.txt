/^VONCERNING the degrees in
{ / Masonry, the first three degrees
\Jl are: First, entered apprentice
X, degree; second, fellowcraft de
gree, and third, master Mason degree.
These three degrees are conferred in
the Blue Lodge and, when one has
received them, he Is as much of a
Mason, for all practical purposes, as
he can ever be. From the master
Mason's degree there are two rites,
known as the York rite and the Scot
tish rite. Pursuing the York rite, a
master Mason takes the mark mas
ter's degree, then the past master's
degree, then the most excellent mas
ter's degree and then the Royal Arch
degree. Those four degrees are taken
in the Royal Arch Chapter. The
royal master's degree, select master's
degree and super-excellent master's
degree are taken In the council. In
the commandery is conferred the Or
der of the Red Cross, the Order of the
Temple and the Order of Malta. On
receiving; these degrees and orders in
the sequence na"med, one becomes a
Knight Templar.- The various subor
dinate lodges, conferring the master
Mason's degree, have a State organiza
tion known as the Grand Lodge, and
so the chapters have a State organiza
tion known as the Grand Royal Arch
Chapter. In the same manner there
is a Grand v Councll and there is a
Grand Commandery of Knights Temp
lar, representative of all the subor
dinate commanderies of the State. The
national Templar organization, repre-,
sentatlve of all the Grand Comman
deries. is known as the Grand En
campment. It is the Grand Encamp
ment that meets in San Francisco In
triennial conclave the first week of
September.
The three blue, degreesâ apprentice,
fellowcraft and master â belong to and
form a part of all the principal rites.
The Ancient and" Accepted ..Scottish
rite consists of a body of the thirty
third degree, called Supreme Council.
Of theEe, the oldest existing one in
the world is that for the southern
Jurisdiction of the United States,
whose see is at Charleston. It was es
tablished on May 31. 1801, and from
it all other Supreme Councils now In
existence have mediately or immedi
ately originated. The Supreme Coun
cil for the northern jurisdiction of the
United States was established at. New
York by the Supreme Council of the
United States at Charleston, in' 1813
and was afterward removed . to Bos
ton.
The laws by which the Supreme
Councils are governed are: First, the
constitutions and regulations of the
year 1762; second, the statutes, regu
lations and institutes adopted at dif
ferent times under these; third, the
true. secret Institutes, or. grand -con
stitutions of the' year 1786,- which pur
port to have been enacted in that
The Mystic Shrine is not, properly
speaking, an order of Masonry, al
though none but Knights Templar and
those who attained the thirty-second
degree in the Scottish rite are eligible
to become members of the Shrine.
A rite of Freemasonry is a scale of
degrees, more or less in number, fol
lowing t each other In regular order
and worked as a system under one
governing body.
Many rites have been worked, the
principal of which, at the present day,
are commonly known as the English
or York rite, the. Ancient and Accept
ed Scottish rite and the Rita Moderne,
or French rite. / Â¦'
year jby^the Supreme Council of the
thlrty^thifd degree at Berlin and ap
prove'd and sanctioned by Frederick
the Great, "grand patron, grand* com
mander, universal grand master and
true defender of the order"; fourth,
the constitution' and statutes . of the
respective Supreme Councils.
The degrees from- the -first to the
thirty-second are divided In six tem-
pies or classes, each administered by
a body of !the last degree of the class:
1. Entered Apprentice.
These degrees are conferred by, sym
bolic lodges, under the authority of
a Grand Lodge within whose Jurisdic
tion they are located. : ' ' Â¦
'Â¦Â¦ 4. Secret Master.
The Supreme Council for the South
ern Jurisdiction has also two other
honorary membership's: â¢
1. Knight Commander of the Court
of Honor: and
2. Grand Cross of the Court of Honor.
These degrees are never applied for
and are srlven In the same manner as
the thirty-third. The former, while not
necessarily a stepping-stone to tha
thirty-third degree,. Is. a prerequisite,
and no one can receive the thirty- third
degree until after he has passed a' pro
bationary period of- at least two years
as a Knight Commander of the Court
of Honor. The honorarium . of Grand
Cross Is a great distinction, and la con
ferred upon deserving: thirty-seconds
and thirty- thirds, its possession being
a valued trophy of which only a few
can boast.
31. Inspector Inquisitor; and
32. Master of the Royal Secret.
These are conferred In a Consistory.
Originally they were conferred by the
Supreme Council only or by Its special
authority, but in the United States the
power has been delegated to the Con
sistories.
33. Sovereign Grand Inspector Gen
eral. - .?
Conferred by the Supreme Council
only. It is never applied for, but is
given, upqn unanimous .election, to a
limited number of persons in each
State as an Honorary Degree, the re
cipients becoming honorary members of
the Supreme Council.
The thirty-third degree Is divided
into two classes â active and honorary.
Of the first class there are in the
Southern Jurisdiction 33 and in the
Northern Jurisdiction 6G and in most
Councils 9; they are the real gover
nors of the rite; and each. In his own
individual Jurisdiction, possesses all
the rights and prerogatives anciently
supposed to have belonged to the orig
inal grand masters, their jurisdiction
extending: .from the fourth degree to
the thirty-third, and disclaiming . any
authority to govern the symbolic de
grees.

of the continent, was too , far away.
in 1SS3. Grand Master Stoddard at
tended that conclave as grand sword
bearer. Four other officers of the
Grand Encampment who attended the
conclave of 1883 have since been hon
ored with the highest station within the
gift of theMasonic order: Robert E.
Withers, then deputy grand master;
John P. S. Gobln. then grand captain
general; Warren LaRue Thomas, at
that time grand Junior warden, and
Hugh McCurdy, at that time grand
senior warden. Â¦ Â»
So I state that one of the greatest
benefits that has accrued to San Fran
cisco, California and the entire coast
through the^ Knights - Templar Con
clave of 1883 was the stamp it placed
upon this city aa.the ideal convention
city. That one thing was the Initial
impulse resulting subsequently in
bringing thousands upon thousands of
men of various professions, pursuits
and callings, men prominent in civic,
commercial, fraternal and theological
activity, out here on visits of busi
ness mingled with pleasure and curi
osity in various national conventions
in the past twenty years; and to the
Knights Templar of this State for the
schedule of entertainment afforded
their guests, .no less than to the resi
dents of this State for their
hearty co-operation, is the
credit- due for the lasting
good impressions our
guests bore away and
. \ie lasting bene
fits that have

Fast Grand Master of the
The reputation of San Francisco as
the Ideal convention city of the United
States Is established beyond question.
Other cities have claims that cannot
be entirely Ignored, or otherwise there
would be evert more conventions held
out here than there are. By these con
ventions we have been advertised
to greater advantage, perhaps, than
any other State in the Union. And
this Is largely the result, as I
have stated, of the conclave of
1SS3 and of the fact that the residents
of this State were quick to realize that
an opportunity had been presented to
them through the efforts of 'Knights
Templar here of bringing their State
before the eyes of the whole country
through the medium of one of the most
Influential and representative bodies
in the United States and they grasped
the opportunity ably and decisively.
The conclave spirit has been growing
tremendously until It- has become a stu
pendous task to entertain the body of
Templars and visitors that attend the
triennial conclaves. In 1883 there were
7000 Templars In line in the grand pa
rade; this year there will be approxi
mately 12.000. It is impossible to state
how many visitors will be present dur
ing the corning week; from the reports
given out by those in a . position to
know, 75,000 would be a conservative
estimate. However, preliminary esti
mates on visitors to a conclave are
pretty difficult to give satisfactorily.
We will not have as many as cities such
as Boston and Plttsburg and Washing
ton had, because they had such large
centers to draw from, but we will see
the greatest gathering within the his
tory of San Francisco.
Inose who attended the conclave of
18S." and who are returning to at
tend the coming conclave will see
many notable and impressive changes
alonar the line of the parade. Every
seven-story steel structure building
has been erected since then. The Call
building, the Examiner building, the
Chronicle building and the Mutual
Bank building, on the four corners
from which the grand parade will
start, have all been erected since then.
Those who come in by way of the
Santa Fe and Southern Pacific will
enter the city through one of the most
imposing ferry depots in the United
States. At the ferry building they
will find the terminals of streetcar
lines, especially the electric systems
radiating to the south, whose districts
c,cver practically all of the territory
from the Cliff House to San Mateo.
The city has put on the dress of
modern architecture within the twen
ty-one years that have intervened be
tween 1883 and 1904. Our popula
tion has doubled. Hundreds of acres
of land then vacant are covered now
with homes and business blocks. Some
of the old cranks still thought there
was doubt as to the stability of San
Francisco. I believe they are all dead,
and from their ashes have risen men
whose faith In the future of San Fran
eisco cannot b r e shaken. Everything
points to us as the entry point of the
United States for the Orient. When
we look back fifty years and see what
San Francisco was then -we 'cannot be
said to be dreamers if we say in fifty
years hence San Francisco -will be the
second city in the union.

throughout the East of that spirit

{ Conclave of 1SS3 was the slart
{ ing I't'int for this Htate as a con
i. vcotion State and San Francisco
as a convention city. It wes
the first national gathering of any
magnitude that had ever assembled
hciv. There were in 1SS3 more than
60.000 strangers in the city, the greatest
body o* representative men that had
iver been gathered within the hospit
able embrace of San Francisco. Too
much stress cannot be laid upon the
good to us that resulted from that en
campment and that will result from
the coming one. Within the body of
the Knights Templar are contained
many of the leading figures of the day
in public lifeâcaptains of finance and
industry, men prominent in commerce,
rrade and manufacture and men identi
fied with professional and theological
activity. One of the proudest memories
cherished by local Knights Templar
is the memory of the magnificent re
ception tendered by California Com
mandery to President William McKin
ley. himself a Sir Knicht. upon the oc
casion of his visit here in 1P01. Mr. Mc-
Kinley was pleased to say that the re
cepticn 'tendered him by the Knights
Templar here was the finest testimonial
he had received on his entire tour.
Ko stone was left unturned in 18S3 to
give our guests the very finest of recep
tions, and to the credit cf all be it said
that hardly a man approached for as
sistance, financial or otherwise, failed
to respond. Excursions were held that
icok in the points of interest through
out the State. Every phase of Cali
fornia industries was brought to the
attention of these representative visi
tors from abroad. San Franciscans
and Californians seemed animated with
hut .one desire; they were one .in a
unanimous spirit to extend to our vis
'tinrr brethren and to their families and
friends a right royal welcome and a
hearty invitation to tarry with us.
Many of thern did. The Knights Temp
lar Conclave of 1833 was incidentally
the greatest California exploitation
scheme that has ever been consum
mated. The result 41 the generous
treatment and open-hearted hospitality
was that these strangers went back
home carrying golden tales of the won
ders of this far western shore, of her
fruit and flowers, her wheat and vines,
her equable climate, and the glories of
river, valley and grove.

It is not difficult to understand why
cities strive eo zealously for the, honor
of entertaining the Grand Encampment
at each successive triennial conclave.
The Grand Encampment is iriade up of
all past grand commanders of State
Grand Commanderies, in addition to
the grand commander, grand gener
cllssimo and crand captain general of
State Grand Commanderies holding of

public prominence. This can be readily
seen by glancing over the list of officers
of the Grand Comrnindery of Califor
nia. In a similar way tha membership
of Grand Commanderies is made up of
all past commanders of all State Com
manderies and of the three highest of
ticere of a commandery, namely the
commander; the generalissimo and the
captain jreneral. So it is easy to be
seen that the constant sifting; tends to
produce strength in the higher bodies,
and tends to make them bodies of men

THE'. SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
MOST EMINENT SIR IlEUBEN -HEDLEY IJjOYD.
2The first steps taken In California
by the Supreme Council to occupy this
territory was on Thursday, April 4.
1S61. by the election of Brother Milton
S.' Latham as a sovereign grand in
spector general, an active brother for
California. This session was held at
New Orleans. Brother Latham at tha:
time was United States Senator repre-
The work of the Ancient and Ac
cepted Scottish Rite in the State of
California, as in all other jurisdictions,
commenced with a few zealous breth
ren, hampered at times by envy and
jealousy on the part of some, until at
this writing it numbers among its vo
taries the most influential men of the
community.
Greece, Athens
Switzerland. Lausanne.
Canada, Hamilton.
Egypt. Cairo.
Tunis, Tunis. .
Venezuela. Caracas.
Hungary, Budapest.
Dominican republic, San Domingo.
Sweden, Stockholm.
Norway, Christlania.
Denmark, Copenhagen-
And these Supreme Councils, wher
ever they exist, are the sole power of
the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite
in the countries where they are located,
and all of them recognize as the su
preme law for their government the
grand constitutions of 17S6.
The bodies organized at Charleston,
S. C, met with varying success for a
number of years, but the fires of Scot
tish Rite Free Masonry, though at
times dormant, were kept alive by the
intellects and minds of the old . guard
until there sprung into existence at last
â¢
commander, James D. Richardson of
Tennessee, has for more than twenty
yrars-been- the leader of the minority
in the 'House of* Congress, a position
which he held until his accession to the
throne of Scottish Rite Masonry, when
he resigned from his public ; ' office - in
order that he might give his time and
intellect to the grand cause which he
has selected for his future life.

3^ HERE are two great rites or
orders of Freemasonry in ex
istence, one commonly known as
the York and the other as the
Scottish Rite. The former is
the more numerous of the ttfo in the
United States, while the reverse of this
is true as to Europe, and, indeed, as to
a!! foreign lands. -
The York is the older rite in so far
cs we have authentic history. As to
the Scottish rite of Freemasonry, this
was in existence In France and other
countries of Europe some years prior to
1762. and tvas known as the Rite of
or Heredoni. It was com
posed of three degrees of the York rite
and twenty-two others, the eighteenth
btirg the "Rose Croix" and the twenty
fifth degree the "Prince of the Royal
Secret."
In presenting a history of the Ancient
and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freema
sonry, it is but proper that I should re
fer to the labors of James D. Richard
son, tiiirty-third sovereign grand com
mander for the southern jurisdiction in
the United States, and Edward A.
Sherman, thirty-third o* California, to
both of whom we are indebted for their
is.bors in the compilation of digests in
tlieir respective departments â the for
mer for the rite in general and the lat
ter as to the rite in California.
Scottish Rite Masonry was intro
duced into America by Etienn* Â«/
Stephen Morin, who held a patent frcei
the Rite of Perfection or Heredom,
Orient of Paris, bearing date August
27. 176L He was then about to sail to
America and as a reward for service*
done the order and for his zeal in Ma
sonry he was given authority by thig
patent to establish perfect and sub
lime Masonry in the new world. He
was also given authority to create in
spectors general in all places where the
sublime degrees were not established.
On September 21, 1762, nine Masonic
commissioners or delegates from the
Council of Emperors of the east and
v.est of Paris and from the Council of
Princes of the Royal Secret at Bor
deaux met at the latter place and set
tled the regulations of the Masonry of
Perfection in thirty-five articles.
In 1769 he founded lodges of Per
fection and other bodies of the rite in
Kingslort. Jamaica, and in the ex
ercise of the powers of substitution
given him. he transferred his powers
and successive deputy inspectors were
created by him. As the inspector gen
eral of the lodges, chapters, councils,
otc. in all parts of the new world, he
pave the degree of inspector general to
Her.ry Andrew Francken in Jamaica
some time prior to 1767 and in his
turn the degrees were handed to Hy
man I. Long in 1795.
On the 12th day of November, 1796.
Brother Long, deputy grand inspector
general in Freemasonry, granted let
ters patent of that date to Alexander
Francois Aug-uste de Grasse-Tilly. late
an engineer in the services of the
United States, and to others," creating
them deputies for grand inspector
general and on the same date giving
as the places of Masonry at Kingston,
Jamaica, he granted a patent to Jean
Baptiste and others, authorizing the
establishment of a body in Charles
ton. South Carolina.
Under this patent the brethren
named established a grand sublime
c-ouncil of the Prince of the Royal Se
cret at Charleston. January 13. 1797.
which was * duly confirmed by the
Grand Council at Kingston. Later
there was granted to John Mitchell a
patent raising him to the highest de
gree in Masonry and .creating hirn,
deputy grand inspector general. He
â¢a as then a Justice of the Quorum
Court, and a notary public in South
Carolina and was late colonel and
â¢Â¦juartprmaster general in the United
â¢Stales army.
In 1783 the Sublime Grand Lodge of
Perfection was established at Charles
ton, and 17S8 and subsequent years,
other bodies of the rite were organized
there On May 31. 1801. there was
organized in Charleston. South Caro
lina, a supreme council of the Thirty
third Degree for the United States of
America. It became the mother Su
preme Council of the world, being the
first body organized comprising de
grees from the fourth to the thirty

with the high honors of Masonry by
Brothers Mitchell >and Dalcho. sover

th? c-o-urse cf the year 1S02, the whole

was completed, agreeably to the grand
constitutions. *.
The grand constitution as th<Â» law

The war of the rebellion breaking out
eleven days afterward, his public du
ties as United States Senator prevented
Brother Latham . from entering upon
the work of propagating the Scottish
Rite In California, and his election as
active inspector general of this State
was made to lapse by reason of the
war.
The first Master Mason to receive the
degree of the Ancient and Accepted
Rite in California was Brother Fred
erick Edward Faxon of Sonora, who
received the same from Brother Perez
Snell, Thirty-third, in 1S03, a deputy of
the Supreme Council, which appoint
ment he had held from the year 1S27.
At the close of the Civil War the
Supreme Council for the Southern
Jurisdiction met at Charleston. S.
C, Thursday, November 16. 1S65. In
his address at that time Brother
Albert Pike, sovereign grand com
mander, proposed the election of an
inspector general for California, and
Brother Ebenezer Hamilton Shaw re
ceived that honor. Subsequently,
Brother Shaw proposed for honorary
membership Brother Alexander G.
Abell of California, Thus the first
steps were taken by the Supreme
Council for establishing the Ancient
and Accepted Scottish Rite on the Pa
cific Coast.
On August 4. 1866, California Lodge
of Perfection No. 1, the first regular
body of Scottish Rite Masonry on the
Pacific Coast, with William M. Run
den as master, was organized.
The bodies of the Ancient and Ac
cepted Scottish Rite in California
owed allegiance to the Supreme Coun
cil, under the government of a grand
consistory. DP to January 1, 1S37, when
Brother Thomas H. Caswell, then sov
ereign grand commander, issued a
"proclamation dissolving the same, and
the bodies then became directly subor
dinate to W. Frank Pierce, who, since
and up to and including the present
writing, has been in direct command
of the bodies of the Ancient and Ac
cepted Rite in the State of California,
as active Inspector general for this
jurisdiction.
Brother Pierce, as the active inspect
or general for the State of California,
has been fit in his wisdom to pursue a
different course from that adopted In
other States of the southern Jurisdic
tion. In other sections of the southern
jurisdiction, as a general proposition,
one, or possibly two, bodies control the
entire State, it being necessary for
candidates to travel the entire length
of the jurisdiction to receive the de
grees, and in these places they are
conferred In what, is termed . team
work, that is, the degrees from the
fourth to the thirty-second are con
ferred within four or five days, the
bodies meeting thus two or three times
a year. Brother Pierce, however, has
in this State permitted the organiza
tion of the bodies of the rite where
ever they have been called for and In
his opinion could be* maintained.
The wisdom of this course is appar
ent in the widely disseminated knowl
edge of Scottish Rite within this State,
and as the Scottish Rite bodies work
weekly, the same as the blue lodges or
commanderies, it creates a far greater
Interest and at the same time permits
of closer inspection of Scottish Rite
work bv the candidates who have al
ready received the degrees.
The bodies of the Ancient and Ac
cepted Scottish Rite granted dispensa
tions by the inspector general. Brother
Pierce, number tblrty-three in all.
Yerba Buena Lodge of Perfection No.

October 15, 1S6S. This body is now one
ot the strongest in the entire southern
jurisdiction.

A more complete departure from
established custom was the one per
mitting the organization of two sets
of Scottish Rite bodies in one city, that
Is San Francisco. On October 1. 1902.

Rickon, thirty-third degree, from
Little Rock, Ark., under a dis
pensation from the inspector general,
organized what are known as the Cal
ifornia bodies, meeting at present at
Golden Gate Hall. 623 Sutler street.
They have a' membership of 300 ac
quired in less than two years, one of
the most rapid growths In the history
of Masonry in .this city. The term
California bodies is taken on account
of the name given to the different sec
tions. California Lodge of Perfection.
California Chapter of Rose Croix, Cal
ifornia Council of "Kadosh and Cali
fornia Consistory.
The wisdom Â¦ of permitting two
bodies In this city is evidenced by the
work accomplished and they are now
working in perfect amity and confi
dence with each other and as there
are more than 6000 Masons in the city
of San Francisco from which to draw
material for- the Scottish Rite there
is no doubt not only of the continued
success of this body but of the older
body. Terba Buena. which deserv*rs
much for the work it has done In the
propagation of thÂ» Scottish Rite.
The first register of the Supreme
Council for the southern jurisdiction of
the United States, mother Supreme
Council of the world, has the following
officers and titles:
Colonel John Mitchell, sovereign
grand commander.
Dr. Frederick Dalcho, lieutenant
grand commander.
Emanuel de la Motta, treasurer gen
eral of the Holy Empire.,
Abraham Alexander, secretary gen
eral of the Holy Empire.
Major T. B. Bowen, grand master of
ceremonies.
On February 21, 1S02, the Supreme
Council granted its first patent, that
to Alexander Francois de Grasse-Tilly
as sovereign commander inspector gen
eral. They made him a member of the
Supreme Council, declaring thus that
he was grand commander for life of
the Supreme Council in the French
West India Elands, and the Supreme
Council made him its representative
therein, giving him power to constitute,
establish, direct and inspect all bodies
cf the rite. He subsequently went to
Santo Dumingo, establishing bodies
there, but in 1S03 the insurrectionists
in that island being successful, the
French rule therein terminated, and
the Count, with the bth#r members of
the rite, returned to France, where by
virtue of the paumt issued to him by
the Supreme Council at Charleston,
S. C, he organized and established in
Paris, France, October 20, 1SO4 7 a Su
preme Council uf the thirty-third de
gree for France. The Supreme Council
established at Paris was the. third or
ganized in point of time, the second
beirrg for the Windward and I^eeward
islands at Port au Prince. Since that
date ther<? have been established- and
are now in existence thirty regular Su

Since the organization of the com

there have been admitted by initiation
and affiliation 1200 members. Deduct
ing the number who have died and
those who for other causes have ceased
to be members, there remains in active
membership 665. There nave been no
suspensions and but two expulsions for
unknlghtly conduct in all the years of
the commandery â a most remarkable
showing and one that speaks well for
the general character of the member;

Of those who have been members 00

C. Perkins, have honored the State as
members of the Senate of the United
States; and one, John C. Burch, as a
member of the House of Represent
atives. Many have held positions of
prominence in California, Altogether
California Commandery has had a
goodly share of honors, both Masonic
and civic, and her influence in Masonic
and civil matters has always been po
tential and uplifting.
During the years 1876, 1877 and I87S
Sir Knight Hiram T. Graves was grand
commander of California. In 1877 he
was present at the Triennial Conclave,
held in the city of Cleveland, Ohio. Be
ing greatly impressed with the gather
ing of thobsands on that occasion, on
his return he undertook the task of
enthusing the Sir Knights of California
in relation to the matter of attending
and participating in the conclaves of
the order. By his strenuous exertions
a California Battalion was formed from
the commanderies of the State for the
purpose of attending the conclave to be
held at Chicago . Â¦ Â«- Â¦ 1880. California
Commandery participated and a dele
gation of some two hundred and fifty
were present at that conclave with the
intention to have San Francisco chosen
as the place for the conclave of 1883.
Success crowned their efforts and in
1883 the Grand Encampment assembled
In this city. California Com
mandery acted . a leading
part in the entertainment of
the visitors on that occasion
and acquitted herself with
credit George C. Perkins
was at that time grand com
mander of the State, as
In 18SD Sir. Knight Peter Dean, being
commander of California Commandery,
"escorted the Grand Commandery of
California to the twenty-fourth Trien
nial Conclave, which assembled in the
city of Washington, D. C. California
is a mounted commandery, and on thia
occasion appeared with full ranks
among- -20,000; Knights in, on
Pennsylvania avenue in- that. city. It
was , aV proud occasion when, as the
pride of the parade, with black horses
handsomely caparisoned, the Sir
Knights 'passed the reviewing stand of
President Harrison, in front of .the
White House.
A similar display was made at Den
ver by the commandery at the twenty
fifth Triennial Conclave in 1892, when it
acted as escort to the Grand Com
mandery of California.
The twenty-sixth Triennial Conclave
assembled in Boston in 1895. This was
one of the largest conclaves ever held,
it being estimated that 25,000 Knights
appeared in the line of parade. Califor
nia Commandery again bore away the
palm. She gave a magnificent banquet
to the members of the Grand Encamp
ment, at which were present the Gov
ernor of Massachusetts and his staff,
the Governors of several other States
and many State and city officials. By
her action at Boston she established a
reputation for open-hearted munificence
that has made her name and the name
of the State all over this great land a
synonym for hospitality.
The twenty-seventh Triennial Con
clave was held at the city of Pittsburg
in October, 1898. California Command
ery escorted the Grand Commandery
of the State, the escort of Sir Knight
Reuben H. Lloyd, the - deputy grand
master of the Grand Encampment At
this conclave Sir Knight Lloyd attained
the goal of honorable ambition, being
unanimously elected grand master of
the Grand Encampment of the United
States. He had won the spurs of hon
orable distinction by : faithful and ef
ficient and knightly service in the cause
of Masonry and Templarism. He had
served his Masonic lodge as master; hia
commandery for four years as captain
general, for two years as grand gener
alissimo, for one year as deputy grand
commander and for two years as grand
commander. In 1886 he was chosen se
nior warden of the Grand Encampment,
in* 1889 grand captain general, in jj 1892
grand generalissimo", In 1895 deputy
grand master and In 1898 grand master.
His elevation to the highest office . In
the gift of this great order was deemed
a' most distinguished com
pliment to the State and a
great honor alike to him
( and to California Com
;mandery.

THE planting and organization of
the Order of Knights Templar in
California and on the Pacific
Coast was commenced in the
month of September, A. D. 1S52.
At that time the subordinate bodies of
Templars in the United States were
entitled ''encampments." Sundry
Knights residing in San Francisco as
sembled and framed a petition to the
General Grand Encampment of the
United States of America praying for
authority to establish an encampment
of the order in the city of San P"ran
cisco. The petition was presented to
Sir Knight Benjamin Brown French,
the general grand recorder, at Wash
ington, D. C, and in due time a. dis
pensation, dated at Boston, Mass., No
vember 10, 1852, and signed by Sir
Knight Charles W. Moore, general
grand generalissimo, was issued. This
instrument authorized the formation
of an encampment of Knights Templar
in tSan Francisco under the name of
San Francisco Encampment No. 1.
The dispensation named Sir Knights
Gregory Yale, eminent commander;
Sir Knight William B. Wakeman, gen
eralissimo, and Sir Knight Abrain
Bartol, captain general. The other
parties named therein were: Sir
Knights Richard F. Knott, Garrett W.
Ryckman, Joseph Waterman, John H.
Brown, Luther T. Wilson, Jame3 A.
McDougall, William H. Folger and
Henry A. Cobb.
On December 22, 1S52, a partial or
ganization under the dispensation was
effected and the following additional
Knights were admitted as original
members of the encampment: Sir
Knights Peter A. Brinsmade, Alex
ander G. Abell. Charles C. Tracy,
Leander Ransom and Silas C. Field.
On January 2, 1853, the organization
was completed by the appointment of
the following officers: Sir Knights
Peter A. Brinsmade, 'prelate; Luther
T. Wilson, S. W.; Henry A. Cobb, J.
W.; John H. Brown, treasurer; Alex
ander G. Abell, recorder; Joseph Wa
terman, St. B.; Charles C. Tracy, Sd.
B.; James A. McDougall, warder, and
Silas C. Field, sentinel.
' Little was done during the time the
encampment remained under dispen
sation. On November 1. 1853, a qhar
tor was issued by the General Grand
Encampment. Officers under the char
ter were elected and San Francisco
Encampment No. 1 was thus fully in
vested and started upon the career of
usefulness and prosperity, which has
continued until it has now become one
of the largest, most noted and most
influential of the bodies unde'r the
control of the General Grand Encamp
ment of the United States and the first
in formation, rank and character on
the Pacific Coast.
In September, 1856, the General Grand
Encampment at its Triennial Conclave
made sundry changes in the names of
the. several bodies under its jurisdic
tion and the name of San Francisco
Encampment No. 1 was changed to San 1
Francisco Commandery No. 1 and its
chief officer was thereafter entitled
commander. Sir Knight Leander Ran
son was on March 5, 1857, re-elected
commander; Sir Knight James C. L.
Wadsworth, generalissimo, and Sir
Knight Alexander G. Abell captain
general. In 1858. at the annual election,
Sir Knight Alexander G. Abell was
chosen commander. Sir Knight James
C. L. Wadsworth was re-elected gen
eralissimo and Sir Knight Eli Cook
captain general. This was the last
election prior to the formation of the
Grand Commandery of California. On
July 5, 1S53, Sacramento Encampment
No. 2 was organized and received a
charter from the General Grand En
campment on February 6, 1854. On
February 20, 1856, the General Grand
Encampment issued a dispensation for
the formation of an encampment at the
City of Columbia, in Tuolumne County,
under the name of Pacific Encampment
!No. 3. It received a charter on Sep
tember 10, 1856. The titles of these two
bodies, under the change adopted by
the General Grand Encampment, were
subsequently changed to the term
commandery.
The Grand Commandery of the State
jheld its first conclave in the city of
San Francisco on August 11, 1858. We
may here remark incidentally that all
jthe grand officers at this conclave have
jsince passed over the Dark River.
' At this conclave Sir Knight Eli Cook i
presented a petition from San Fran
cisco Commandery praying that its
name be changed and that it be here
after named and known as California
Commandery No. 1. The prayer was
'granted and since that time the com
mandery has been so known and des
ignated upon the registry of the Grand
Commandery.

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
California Commandery accompa
nied. Grand Master Lloyd as escort,
and again fully maintained her here
tofore well established reputation. Her
generous membership provided the
needed funds, and she returned bear
ing back laurels of distinction.
And now â with zoal and generosity
greater than ever before â California
Commandery Is striving to do her
part in welcoming and entertain
ing the thousands of fraters and
friends who. will visit San Francisco
and the State on the ides of Septem
ber. She is heartily joining her sister
commanderies of the State in earnest
effort to make the twenty-ninth Tri
ennial Conclave outrival all heretofore
held in all the pomp and circumstance
of excellence.
Except the care exercised in the se
lection of her membership and the
character of that membership, noth
ing has conduced more to her present
enviable status than the beneficent and
encouraging efforts of her excellent
drill corps. This sketch of her history
would be incomplete without refer
ence to the potent influence of this
chosen body of her members.
Immediately after the Triennial Con*
clave held In the city of Washington
in 1S89, Past Commander Captain R.
P. Hurlbut, no doubt induced by his
natural aptitude and his knowledge of
the tactics, as well as by what he had
observed of the good effects of proper
drill exercises upon the character of
the work in a commandery, conceived
the idea of selecting a suitable num
ber of the younger and more active
members. With him thought is the
mother of action. He is characterized
by unbounded enthusiasm, strong de
termination and a thorough under
standing of what is needed for suc
cess in this species of exercises. He
understands the men under his charge,
and how to treat, direct and Instruct
them. With persistency he drilled his
corps and the good results of the drill
were aoon made manifest in the char
acter of the work in conferring the
orders in the commandery. We haz-,
ard nothing in saying, without boast,
that it will be difficult to find any
commandery excelling California
Commandery in this important par
ticular. This excellence of work Is
very greatly attributed to the perfec
tion of discipline in the drill corps.
By the time of the conclave held in
Denver, in 1892, the California Drill
Corps was prepared to enter the lists
In competitive drill. This It did, and
with plaudits won the first prize as a
mounted corps. The mounted corps en
tered the list again in 1901 at the Louis
ville conclave and again won first prize.
The commandery very generously, in
addition to the amount given for en
tertainment at Louisville, appropriated
the sum of $3000 to aid the drill corps
and a trophy is placed to its credit,
i With the present able corps of offi
cers, an excellent membership and the
stimulus of past successes, there is no
reason to doubt that this great com
mandery will maintain the enviable
rank among the commanderies of the
State and the nation hitherto held. All
those on her register are, as they should
be, fully Imbued with the great import
ance of harmony, and appreciating the
lofty character of the principles and
teachings of Templarism they will con
serve, preserve and add to the proud
record they have so fitly earned in the
past and so gloriously maintained.
Of all the brilliant events that have
been held under the auspices of Cali
fornia Commandery none brings a
greater thrill of pride to the com
mandery members than the recollec- 1
tion of the magnificent reception ac
corded to the late President William,
McKinley, a member of Canton Com
mandery, Canton, Ohio, upon the oc
casion of his memorable visit here in
May, 1901. The following, descriptions
of that function are taken from the
report made to the commandery by
General W. H. L. Barnes, chairman of
the executive committee. " â¢ â¢ â¢
Not less than 14,000 people crowded
the Pavilion. The lofty but dingy and
dusty rafters were swathed In the na
tional colors; banners and flags
streamed and hung from every timber
to which one could be fastened, and as
the sunlight streamed through tha
windows and fell In broad belts of
light upon the assemblage of brilliant- i
ly gowned women and quaintly habit-,
ed men there was presented a scene/
which would not have dishonored tho J
coronation of an emperor.
"Sir Knight McKinley, as he walkv
ed through the avenue of swords ex<
tended from the eastern end , of thÂ«
Pavilion to the great stage at'the west,
exclaimed over and over again, 'Hot*
beautiful!' * â¢ â¢ The drill corps,}
commanded by Sir Knight Hurlbut,!
formed upon the floor the Templar \
emblem of eternity â the ring â and,
kneeling in unison, without comment, Â¦
chanted the prayer of the Lord. 1 No
one who witnessed that scene and
heard the almost divine melody of.
those voices will ever forget elthers
Sir. Knight McKinley was deepH
moved. His eyes were suffused wit*Â»
tears and his lips devoutly followed
the words * addressed to 'Our Father
who* art in heaven." California Com
mandery No. 1 has acquired a national
reputation and will be distinguished in
Masonic annals as the only Masonic
body : which, solely as such, has ever
entertained the President of the TJnit-T
ed States in his Masonlu capacity >
alone."
4Starting with forty-three members in
1881, the total enrollment is now 705,
or an average annual increase of about
thirty. This is a most flattering show-
Ing and speaks well for the general
character of the cc-mmandery. Deduct
ing, the names of those who, by death
or other causes, have ceased to be
members, there remain, about 500
names upon the roll of the com
mandery.
Expansion in membership with Gold
en Gate seems to have been "the
mother of necessity." Its quarters at
131 Post street becoming no longer such
as afforded the needed accommodation
and conveniences, in 1S91. but ten years
subsequent to her organization, her en
ergetic and Intelligent business men
and fraters undertook and carried to
completion the erection of a temple
more spacious and better fitted to ac
commodate its growing needs. This
magnificent structure, known as Gold
en Gate Hall, was erected at a cost
of approximately 5140.000 â a monument
to the energy and zeal of the member
ship and a testimonial to the lov* of
the fraters for the Institution of which
they now formed an integral and im
portant part. Spacious as this build
ing is, the* commandery, at the lapse
of a little over another decade, found
it too small to afford the .necessary
conveniences. It, tnerefore, dis
posed of the property and is now
contemplating the erection, either by
Iteelf or conjointly with ether
Masonic bodies, of a still more spacious
edifice. The commandery continues,
however, to occupy Golden Gate Hall,
and with continuous zeal, day by
day, it is lengthening and strength
ening the cords of an influence already
potential. Good judgment in business
alTi-irc, and excellent taste in artistic
ideas appear to be characteristics of
Golden Gate; no better proof of the
former is needed than that manifested
In the system adopted for the keeping
of its records and books of account
by the recorder, and Its excellent plan
of life-membership; its coat-of-arms.
its commandery Jewel, its button of
1S02; Robert B. More. 1903; Robert
W.*Campbell, 1904. and the present
commander. Philip D. Code, whose
term expires In 1905. Much of the
remarkable success of the command
cry is attributable to the zealous and
efficient services of these able and ex
perienced officers; much also resulted
from the care and fidelity exercised by
Sir Knights Samuel Swift. Charles L.
Thomas, William T. Fcnda and the
incumbent, Theo Frolich, in the po
sition of recorder. In a commandery
there is no position of greater Tespon
sibility or fraught with more import
ant duties than that of recorder, nor
is there anymore influential 'for good.
Golden Gate seems to have fully r"ec
cgnized this fact in the selection ' of
these officers.
Golden Gate Cc-mmandery actively
participated In the conclave of , the
Grand Encampment held in this city in
18S3 and added greatly to the interest
and success of that occasion. The
work of providing the needed finances
and of receiving and entertaining the
many visitors to this city at that time
was an; arduous one and devolved
chlfcfly upon the two cc-mmanderies of
Ihe'city, . Like those of her sister com
mandery the members of Golden Gate
entered with zeal upc-n the herculean
task, striving to be among the first
in extending hospitality to the pil
grims. Many will recall the scenes at
Uashaivay Hall and the friendships
formed. Golden Gate, in all matters
of preparation, escort duty, entertain
ment and money did its part nobly
and well and left pleasant recollections
upon the minds of its own and visit
ing Sir Knights. i Â¦ '
In 1886 the commandery. enthused
by the recollections of 18S3, determined
upon a pilgrimage to the conclave of
1SS6, at St. Louis. On this pilgrimage
the commandery met with most gener
ous receptions at various places and
won great popularity for generous hos
pitality at St. Louis. In 1SS9 the com
mandery participated in the conclave
at Washington, D. C. and there elicited
the commendation of the assembled
thousands, winning by its hospitality
and its excellent parades a- national
reputation. The commandery has been
well represented at all the triennial
conclaves of the order since its or
ganization, except that held at the
city of Pittsburg in 1SS9. and at all
it has fully maintained its status
as one of the foremost commanderies
of the land. It is justly proud of its
standing; it has had honor for itself;
it has honored the order in the State.
Much of the good repute of Golden
Gate, next to that arising from the
character of its membership, springs
from the excellence of its drill corps.
To those unacquainted with^the im
portant influences of a drill corps upon
the condition of a commandery, such
a body might appear to be an appen
dage more ornamental than useful.
Such, however, is not the case. In all
branches of the Masonic order much of
the excellence and interest depend
upon the impressions of the work in
performing the several ceremonies.
Nothing in a commandery adds more
to this impressiveness than the assist
ance rendered by a well-drilled corps,
specially selected for the purpose.
Golden Gate early realized this; hence
in 1883, it granted a petition presented
by its captain general. Sir Knight
Frank W. Sumner, signed by twenty-
nate commanderies. It rightly
claims the credit of having virtually
introduced on the Pacific Coast the
custom of fraternal visits among the
bodies of the order, and its pilgrim
ages to sister commanderies have been
a pleasant feature in its history.

ON the 14th day of February, 1S81,
R. E. Commander Bruce B. Lee
granted a dispensation to estab
lish another commandery in the
city of San Francisco. A very appro
priate and expressive name Â£ad been
selected, and the unusual number of
forty-three f raters joined in petition to
the grand commander of the State to
grant the dispensation. As Minerva
sprang fully developed from the fore
head of Jove, so Golden Gate came
forth fully equipped to enter upon a
career of active and successful endeav
or. The first meeting for the purpose
of organizing the commandery was held
on the 13th day of January, 1SS1, and
the granting of the petition for a dis
pensation was recommended by Cali
fornia Commandery No. 1. The dis
pensation named Sir Knights William
O. Gould as commander, Henry H.
Blake as generalissimo and Tristani
Burgess as captain general. The com
mandery at once proceeded to work
under the dispensation and conferred
the orders upon a number of candi
dates prior to the annual conclave of
the Grand Commandery in 18S1. At
this conclave the commandery exempli
fied the Order of the Red Cross, and
?.he work under the dispensation being
approved that document was surren
dered and a charter of perpetuation
was granted on the 15th day of April.
1SS1. No time was .lost, and on the 21st
day of April the commandery was duly
constituted by the past grand com
mander, the late Hiram T. Graves, act
ing by appointment for the grand com
mander, Bruce B. Lee. Thus in the
brief space of a little more than two
months Golden Gate Commandery was
enrolled upon the register of the Grand
Commanderj', being the sixteenth com
' mandery in the State. The assemblies
of the commandery were at first held
In the Masonic Temple, on Post street,
and until the completion and dedication
of an asylum of its own, at 131 Post
street, on the 29th day of September,
1S8L At the dedication of this asy
lum California Commandery No. 1 and
Oakland No. 11. with a brilliant com
pany of ladies and Sir Knights, were
present, and with elaborate, dignified
and impressive services Golden Gate
"set up housekeeping" in its own home.
It is not surprising that the success
of Golden Gate Commandery .has
been so phenomenal; it had started
out under the most favorable auspices,
having for its guidance both intelli
gence and experience. Its first com
mander. Sir Knight Gould, had been
grand commander of Kansas; its pre
late, the late Hezekiah L. Hosmer, af
terward grand prelate of the Grand
Commandery of California, had been
one of the most distinguished Mason*
of Ohio; Dr. Isaac S. Titus was a past
grand master of the Grand Lodge of
California; Theodore F. Tracy was a
past grand generalissimo of the Grand
Lodge of California, and Tristanr
Burges, afterward grand : commander
of the Grand Commandery of Califor
nia. The other charter members were

end John Skae. Many of these were
men of high business and social stand
ing, who have had marked Influence
upon the social, business and civic ln
'terests of the city and of the State.
' The first candidate permitted to
pass the threshold of the commandery
was Frank William Sumner, after
ward grand commander of the State
and the author of the excellent work
on Templar tactics, a work that has
had a most potent influence not only
on the condition of his own com
mandery, but also upon that of every
commandery in the State and even of
many beyond the confines of . the
State.
Golden Gate has been honored by
the Grand Commandery of the State
by the election of Sir Knights F.;W.

Zerubbabel I, it is rumored, died of a;
broken heart, for he never smiled
again after his California friends left!
him in the effete East. He moped andÂ»
pined and touched not food, neither
would he drink, and died even so. His
beautiful black skin, stuffed, all that
is left of him save memory, now graces
the banquet hall of the asylum. Ze-.
rubbabel II was the lion of the Wash-;
ington conclave. An unfailing appe-'
tite for champagne and chocolate bon-j
bons nearly ended his reign, but hej
lived to become the especial pet of Mrs. ;
John A. Logan, who expressed a wish,
for him when, the conclave was over.']
Her wish had but to be intimated to
the. gallant California knights and his
bearship straightway became domi-'
ciled within the Logan demesne, where
he passed his davs in plenteousness
and cheer until, essaying one day to
embrace a colored servant in the'
wholesouled, hearty manner of the!
West, he absentmindedly cracked him
a. rib or two in the servitor and was
sorrowfully dispatched to the happy
hunting ground of well meaning but
absent minded little bears. He hugged
not wisely, but too welL Fittingly
stuffed, in an upright position, he now*
hands a silver qard salver to visitors
at the Logan home. Zerubbabel IV.
after the Boston conclave, became the*
pet of the Bay State Commandery of
Brockton. With him as the nucleus, a,
zoo was formed there which is now the
pride of the Brockton people, so that!
Zerubbabel IV may in truth be said!
to have budded a second temple. i
And now cometh Zerubbabel VIIJ
who, a tiny cub, fell prey in the wild*
of Slskiyou to Sir Knight A. W. Mc-I
Kenzie, and who, a five -months old
cub, will occupy the place of honor be-!
fore the plumed ranks of Golden Gate.
In the grand parade of September 6. '
It Is possible Zerubbabel may havq
company, for J. E. Doollttle of Coop-J
erstown, who has supplied the six prew
vious Zenibbabels, has Informed Gold-J
en Gate that he baa a grizzly on hand j
and It is probable that two bears will
appear In the parade.
Not one-half the honor' ever was
accorded to Zerubbabel of old
that is accorded by the belted
and booted Knights of Golden
Gate to their Zerubbabel, the seventh
in an honored line. And, like Zerub
babel of old, It seems his predestined
fate to be a sharer, too, of exile, even
as his six predecessors of glorious
memory, for never has Zerubbabel
brought home yet 'to his asylum tht
chaplets of laurel bestowed upon him
by worshipers at conclaves far afield. â¢
For it is a custom so old that the
memory of man runneth not to the
contrary that Zerubbabel must be left
behind when the returning cavalcades
throw forth their beauseants to the".
"Western breeze.
Thus it was that the reign of Zerub
babel I over Golden Gate Commandery
terminated in St. Louis after the con
clave of 1S86; Zerubbabel II in Wash
ington In 18S9; Zerubbabel III, Den-,
ver; Zerubbabel IV, Boston; Ze
rubbabel V, Pittsburg, and Zerub
babel VI, in Louisville, and now it.
is ur> to Zerubbabel VII to maintain;
the dignity and pomp of his exalted ;
station when in the grand parade he*
heads the knightlv host. Â«
four others, asking permission to form
a drill corps, to serve in connection
with the commandery in importing
Templar and military knowledge. The
knowledge sained through this instru
mentality soon made itself felt, not
alone in the commandery work, but
also in the outside influence upon the
order. Under the able instruction of
Sir Knight Sumn er the drill corps of
Golden Gate in a short time won tro
phies for excellence. The corps is still
one of the features of thia command
ery. It Is now under the captaincy of
Sir Knight Colonel William Edwards,
a very competent drillmaster, and it
is always Teady to give good account
of Its work.
The financial condition of Golden
Gate is just what it might be expected
to be under the guidance of so many
able business men. After disposing of
Golden Gate Hall the commandery
purchased a valuable lot in the "West
ern Addition in contemplation of erect
ing thereon a temple. This project,
however, is for the present in abey
ance until it may be finally determined
whether or not the several Masonic
bodies will unite in erecting a Masonic
Temple comporting with the character
and greatness of the city. The present
Masonic Temple is no longer suitable
to accommodate the growing needs cf
Masonry. It is hoped that by a union
of the Masonic bodies, San Francisco
may, in the near future, have a temple
superior to any in the land. It is cer
tain that Golden Gate will do its part
in this as she has in all things tend
ing to the interest of the order and of
humanity.
The commandery is taking a very
active part in the preparations for the
entertainment of visitors to the ap
proaching conclave and fully intends
to add greatly to laurels heretofore
won. : ".y.~

*y* T no time in the history of this,
f \ perhaps of any other State, were
1~~~| the benign influences and bene-
X factions of Masonry more need-
ed or more effective for good
than during the days of the early pio
neers of California. At that time, as
now, California numbered among its
inhabitants people of every nation and
clime, the kind offices of women were
wanting, distress and sickness pre
vailed, the blessings of home life were
comparatively unknown.
Among the early pioneers there were
good men and true, thoroughly imbued
with the teachings and principles of
Masonry; men who had seen and ap
preciated the great benefactions of the
order; men who realized that in health
us well as in times of distress, sick
iH'ZS and death.brutherly love and affec
tion, the administering of relief in dis
tress, the performing of the last sad
offices that the Jiving one to the dead,
the companionship and association so
desirable ajid necessary In human Hie,
the mutual aid and protection required
by the environment of the time, were
ml needed. Realizing and anticipating
those needs, a. few earnest Masons un
dertook the beneficent task of establish
ing Masonic lodges upon these Western
bbores. The first great Masonic mis
sionary v. ho came to California was the
brave, heroic, hardy and determined
Brother Peter Lassen. a native of Den
mark but an adopted son of America.
He, in company with David D. Dutton.
a. devout Mason, late of Vacaville, So
lano Oountv. with whom the writer of
this sketch was Intimately acquainted,
and a few others, landed at Bodega in
1840. They remained at Bodega for a
few days and then came to Yerba
Buena, now San Francisco. ,,'-*- > ; ;"Â¦-Â¦'
Brother Lassen went thence to Sa.n
Jose and spent the winter of 1840
working at his trade, that of bluck-
Mnith. Later he obtained a grant o?
land, which lie selected in .what Is
now Tehama County. He came- to Te
hama County in 1845, laid out a town
which he named Benton City, and de
termined to establish a Masonic iodge
at his home. Brother Lasseu gave his
name to that grand mountain which
r*ars its crest far up beyond the
clouds toward heaven known as Las
pen's Peak. It stands with Its snow
tapped summit as an enduring monu
ment to the virtues and the purity -of
ihls honored Mason. Las3en*s ranch
boon became a well known landmark
nud the habitat of true Masonic hos
pitality. In 1S47 Brother Lassen re
turned to. Missouri for the avowed
purpose of bringing' back to Califor
nia a train of emigrants and if .pos
sible a charter for a Masonic lodge.
Tn Missouri Saschel Woods and others
joined with him in an application to
the Grand Lodge of Missouri for a

the committee: reportea. Their report
was unanimously udupted. Thus was
instituted the Grand Lodge ot Califor
nia, a Grand Lodge destined to take
high rank in the yalaxy ot Grand
Lodges upon the American continent.
A ii- election lor officers under this
constitution having beeu held resulted
in the choice of Brothers Jonathan D.

Tutt as deputy grand master. Caleb
Fenner as senior grand %varden, Sas
chel Woods as junior grand warden,
Berryman Jennings as grand treasurer
and John H. Gihon as grantl secretary,
.and these officers, were duly installed.
On the same day Connecticut Lodge
was recognized as a legally constituted
lodge unoe-r the jurisdiction of Califor

Western Star Lodge was recognized as
a legally constituted lodge, . retaining
its Original name;, and California
Ludge was recognized us a legally con
stituted lodge with privilege to retain
the name which it had at the time If it
eo desired. On this day also a charter
was granted to New .Jersey Lodge, by
tho name of Berrvman Lodge, which
name was, "at the first annual commu

lodges.
The Grand Lodge of California con- 1
vened . in annual session for the first
time on the 7th day of May, 1S50. Grand
Master Stevenson, beirtfc unable to at
tend, presented a brief but comprehen
sive communication, from which we
excerpt the introductory paragraph :
Brethren: The formation of a Grand
I^odge for the State of California should
be a subject of sincere congratulation to
every Mason here and elsewhere; for prob- Â¦ Â¦
ably ln.no part of the habitable globe has
Its usefulness I been made so - manifest as ;

unfrequently happens that --within . the
distance of a Â¦ few hundred Â¦ yards .. of a
mining district there will be found many
penaim laborinK together , who are stran

if they be members of our. ancient order,
each Is the master of. a language that all
can understand, and there at once springs,
up that deep feeling of â¢ fraternal affection
which has ever 'Bo distinctly, marked and
distinguished the -'members -of '.the Ma

"a member of this order, no one can be a

of. this country, as well in health as in

In the absence of Grand Master
California, although not the first on
the Pacific- Coast, a lodge having been
instituted at Oregon City in Oregon
on the 11th day of September, 184 8.
The good Brother Peter Lassen lost
his life In 1859. shot to death by Piute
Indians. His body was recovered near
Pyramid Lake and was burled at Hon
ey Lake, on his own ranch. The place
where rest the mortal remains of this
good man is marked by a monument
erected by the citizens and testifying
to their affection and respect for the
noble pioneer, whose kind heart and
noble integrity as a' man and Mason
had won the hearts of all. The grand
old Lassen's Peak, with Us beautiful

and worth.
A charter, bearing date of November
9. 1848, under the name of California
Lodge No. 13, was Issued by the Grand
Lodge of the District of Columbia.
This charter authorized Brothers Levi
Stowell as worshipful master; William
Van Voorhies, as senior warden, and
B. F. McDougall, as junior warden." to
open and hold a lodge in the city of
San Francisco. In conformity, with
this authority. Brother Stowell opened
the lodge in San Francisco in October,

On January 31. 1S49, the Grand Lodge
of Connecticut issued a charter grant
ing full power to Brothers Caleb Fen
ner, as worshipful master; James W.
Gc-odrich, as senior warden, and Elizur
HubbeU. as junior warden, to open and
hold<i lodge In the Territory of Cali

thority granted, a lodge wa3 opened
by Brother Fenner in the city of Sac
ramento, under the name of Connecti

Besides these three regularly char
tered lodges, there were two others-
New Jersey Lodge, located at. Sacra
ntento under a dispensation granted by
the deputy grand master of the. State
of New Jersey: and Benlcia Lodge, un
tJer a dispensation from the Independ
ent Grcnd Lod^e of Louisiana.
On the 17th day of April, l$50, pur
suant to notice duly given, delegates
from the aforenamed lodges assembled
in the city of Sacramento for the pur
pose-of forming a Grand Lodge. The
delegates from Western Star Lodge,
No. 98 of Benton City, were Brothers
J. Wilcoxon, Thomas E. Groz and ,C.

of San Francisco, Brothers Charles
Gilman, J. D. Stevenson and John H.

Brother, Charles L. Gilman of San

as the "American Doctrine" it was nec
essary that there should be present. the
representatives of at least three.reg

I began early in California and, like
] the bay leaf, it has flourished and
' JL waxed exceedingly strong. It
niWt be admitted in the early days
there v.as plenty of room for improve
ment among the settlers, and when
Knights who had come into a strange
land proposed a grand commandery
here the idea was hailed with delight
and quickly acted upon.
Pursuant to previous agreement, the
representatives of the three commartd
c-ries and the appendant orders exist
ing in the State, which, by the way.
were under charters from the Grand
Encampment of the United States, as
sembled in the asylum of San Fran
cisco Commandery No. 1. at the city of
San Francisco, on Tuesday, the 10th
day of August, 1S58. for the purpose of
organizing a grand commandery. of
Knights Templar in the State of Cali
fornia.
At this time there were three char
tered commanderies â California No. 1,
which had a membership of fifty-three;
Sacramento No. 2, with sixty members
enrolled, and Pacific No. 3, with but
seventeen members all told. The total
number was 130, while In January, 1904,
there were forty-two chartered com
manderies and some 4599 members. So
you see the growth of the Knights in
this State has not been slow nor has
it been forced.
Sir Alexander G. Abell. commander of
San Francisco Commandery No. 1,
stated the object of the convocation,
and it was upon his motion that Sir
Isaac Davis, commander of Sacra
mento Commandery No. 2, was invited
to preside during its deliberations.
On motion of Sir John S.. Graham,
commander of Pacific Commandery. No.

recorder of the convocation, and at the
same time it was ordered that a com
mittee, of .three be appointed to ex

scats in this convocation. - These
Knights were Sir .Leander Ransom,
Sir John S. Graham and Sir George

presented the following report, which

The real history of any large con
cern must of necessity be dry, but
where facts are wanted there is not
very much space for flowery speeches,
and, of a truth they? are; not .even/
apropos. .Perhaps the original petition"
that was submitted to the GrandfEn-.
Jcampment might be of more" than ordi- Â¦
When Bernard said "Ye cover your
horses with silken trappings and I
know not how much fine cloth hangs
pendent from your coat of mail," he
did not mean that the Templars were
not brave and good, but that all this
pomp and display would be of 1.0 :d
vantage to them spiritually, and he
was somewhat afraid that the "painted
spears, the bridles and spurs adorned
with gold, silver and precious gems,"
would have a demoralizing effect upon
them. "Three things," he said, "are
indispensably necessary to the success
of a soldier; he must be bold, active
and circumspect: quick in running,
prompt In striking." And in this he
gave excellent advice. Certainly no
man could go far wrong in accepting
it as his code. In fact, were I asked to
advise a young man I could give him
no better rule to follow, unless, per
hops. it be Martin Luther's beautiful
prayer which seems to sum up all
thingsâ
'Our God, our Father! with us stay.
And make us keep thy narrow way:
Free us from sin. and all its power:
Give us a joyful dylnghour:
Deliver us from Satan's arts.
And let us build our hopes on thee;
Down Jn our very heart of heatts.
Oh God. may we true servants be;
And serve thee ever perfectly!
Help us with all thy children here.
, To fight and flee with holy fear:
Flee from temptation, and to fight
With thy own weapons for the right.
Amen! Amen! Â£0 let it be;
'- So shall we ever sing to thee. .
Hallelujah!

Of course, there 13 mucli about the
order that is ornamental and flowery,
but there Is infinitely more that is good
and solid and true. In the olden days
pilgrims were welcomed everywhere
and In return for the hospital
ity they received they were
only asked their prayers. Unfor
tunately this does not hold good to
day. While the pilgrims are undoubt
edly welcomed, they are not treated as
courteously by strangers unless they
chance to wear the mystic token, and
then it becomes a duty to help a fel
low brother. It is true hospitals are
built upon the banks of rivers, upon
the heights of mountains and in thÂ«
midst of cities, but they are not for
the pilgrims themselves, but for their
wives and daughters, for it is one of
the first duties of a Knight to expose
himself to a thousand dangers to aid
the helpless and the poor.

to-day. At any rate, it will serve as
an example of how things were carried

'I'o the Most Eminent William C.
Hubbard, Grand Master of Knights
Templar in the United States: The
petition of the undersigned, officers of
three (encampments) commanderies cf
Knights .Templar now existing ln-the
State of California, under charter from
the Grand Encampment of Knights
Templar of the United States of Amer
ica, respectfully showeth:
"That on the first day of November,
A. D. 1S53, San Francisco (encamp
ment) Commandery No. 1, held In the
city of San Francisco, was chartered
by the above named grand body; that
on the sixth day of February. A. D.
1854, Sacramento (encampment) Com
mandery No. 2, held in the city of Sac
ramento, was chartered by the same
grand body; that on the tenth day of
September, A. D. 1856, Pacific (encamp
ment) Commandery No. 0. held in the
city of Columbia, was chartered by the
same supreme body; and that since the
reception of those several charters th*
three (encampments) commanderies
above named, having had their officer*
duly installed, have been regularly anil
constantly at work under the said au
thority, and -have- endeavored in all
things to comply with the constitution
and regulations of the Grand Encamp*
ment of the United States, and to pro
mote the Interests and further the
proper extension of Christian chivalry
within their respective jurisdictions.
"This petition of the undersigned
showeth: That it is believed. that thÂ«Â»
good of the order in this State and
the , convenience of its members will
be greatly consulted and promoted by
the establishment of a Grand Com
mandery; and, as each of the comman
deries fiefore named have, at different
times since the reception of their sev
eral charters, adopted resolutions ex
pressive of their ardent desire for the
formation of such a grand body, the
undersigned, the regularly elected and
installed officers of these bodies, prom
ising obedience to the grand master
and the Grand Encamnment in all
things appertaining to the order, re
spectfully request that you will "1ssuÂ«
your' warrant, authorizing the estab
lishment and continuance of a Grand
Commandery -of Knights Templar for
.the State of California." r
. This petition was signed by the offi
cers â¢ of the three commanderies and
was sent from- San Francisco the 20th
of April, 1858. Of course, while the
warrant was - expected, it was by, no
manner of means a foregone conclu
sion and all members of the comman
deries were considerably relieved when
it really came.
And this was the way the Grand
Conimandefy of Knights Templar com
menced its first conclave in San Fran
cisco the 11th of August, 1858. For some
reason or other people seem to have
got the idea that the commanderies had
some early difficulties to contend with,
but so far as I know there was nothing
of the kind. All was smooth sailing.
Many of the most prominent men of the
State, were Knights, and as all were
vastly interested and did all they could
to promote the order it stands to reason
that ; it prospered and grew strong and
influential. Â¦ The commanders have been
men of strength and ability, as will be
seen .from glancing at the. list from the
first commander to the one of the pres
ent day. for. they have been as follows:

\ Masonry that every lodge. is under,obli

composing the boards of relief, Ma
sons and the widows and orphans of
Masons belonging to other jurisdictions,
and also the sum expended by the 291
'lodges of the State for the â¢ relief of
their own members. It is needless to
say that Masonry in California is doing
a great work.
In 1S90 the Grand Lodge adopted a
series of .resolutions looking to the
founding, of a Masonic Home for the
nurture and the intellectual, moral and
physical -culture of the children of de
ceased Master Masons of the State, and
as >a -temporary- asylum for poor and
distressed Masons and the widows of
deceased Masons. In 1891 the Grand
Lodge adopted a resolution providing
for the appointment of a board of trus
tees whose duty it should be to prgan
ize such home. This board organized
in 1892 and at once began the arduous
undertaking. Suffice it to say that in
due time the home was established, a
palatial structure was erected at De
coto, in Alameda. County, and Califor
nia now has ! a Masonic Widows' and
Orphans' ; Home, well equipped, and
serving a most beneflcient purpose. The
Masons of the State have great pride
in the home and seem disposed, with
one accord, to "Ive to- it the support
which it requires. .Already some of the
noble-hearted brethren have made lib
eral donations;. the ladles of the State
contribute liberally; through the liber
ality 'of \ particular brethren- additional
structures Â¦ have < been 7 erected; and It
now ranks among the best, of this class
of charitable institutions in the land.

having more than one lodge, each of
the "lodges Is under the same obligation.
In ordsr properly to distribute the bur
dens imposed upon j the lodges in San
Francisco, and to. enable them to dis
pense more equitably their charities, as
well as to guard against imposition on
the part' of Improper applicants, the
masters of five of the seven lodges lo
cated in San Francisco, in 1855 formed
a compact and organized a Masonic
Board of Relief. ' :. .
This board has regularly held itsmeet-

inceptlc-n to tHe present time. If is not

The expenditures of the board have
yearly increased, until in 1903 they had
reached the munificent sum , of $13,

board during the fifty years' of its. ex

they took the usual vows of poverty,
chastity a:id obedience, and were
given as a residence a part of the pal
ace of the Latin kings of Jerusalem,
which, fcefors -the conquest of the city
during the first crusade, had been the
Mosque of Mount Moriah. The palace
was a!?o known as Solomon's Temple,
and this circumstance gave them the
name of Templars. The knishts.desis
nat-td themselves as "Poor Fellow Sol-,
diers of Christ," "Brethren -of the Or
der of the Temple." "Brethren of the
Soldiery of the Temple," and "Pau
peres Comrnilitones Christi Tcmpli Sa
lcnionici." and in after years these des-.
ignations were abbreviated into
Knights Templar.'
The first grand master was Hugo de
Paganis. and in answer 'to his petition
tbat this little band of knights be per-'
mitted to form a military and religious
order. Pope Honorius the Second ap
proved that request and referred him
to the ecclesiastical council, then in
cession at Troves, which entertained
the petition and directed St. Bernard
to prepare the necessary rules for the
government of the new order.
This code of laws is still in existence,
and enjoins severe religious exercises,
fasting and prayer. The daily life and
even the thousht of the Sir Knight is
prescribed. The order increased rap^
idly in numbers and Influence, many of
the members coming from the noblest
families In Europe. Kings and nobles
praised their zeal and granted liberal
gifts of money, goods and ( land, so that
Â¦within a generation their preceptories
and homes were established within
every Christian country. At first the
organization of the " order was very
simple, but In less than a century num
bers and "wealth caused the manner of
government to become' more compli
cated and a gradual change in the or
ganization of the'orde'r created classes
of membership, which were known as
knights, chaplains and serving breth
ren. : ,
Those who desired admission as
Knights were obliged to prove that
they sprang from a knightly family,
that they were born In lawful wedlock,
that they were not connected with any,;
other order of knighthood and were free
from previous obligations, unmarried,
end had sound and .healthy constitu- v
tions. In the Templar army were often
bodies of men enlisted for a campaign"
or for a term of . service, and in such
forces the Knights acted as officers or
leaders. "?Â». Â¦
In A. D. 1162 Pope Alexander III
granted the Templars permission to re
ceive Into their houses spiritual per
sons, the "chaplains," wbo were not
bound by any previous obligations.
Their vows on their ." reception were
somewhat similar to those of the
Knights, and j they performed all reli
gious offices and officiated as priests at
the ceremonies of the order.
The serving brethren were sup
posed to be free born, and at times in
cluded men of wealth and high posi-;
tion. They were divided into brethren
at-arms and handicraft brethren. The
former composed the. bulk of the Tem
plar army, and were often promoted to
the honors a of knighthood. The latter
class remained in the preceptories and
exercised their various trades, such as
farriers and armorers. â¢ y .,*
These three classes constituted the*
recognized order of the Temple. There
was., however, a class known as - the
"Affiliati" or Affiliated. These were
persons of both, sexes who had an in
terest in the order and werei '.eja-,
titled to- Its protection... There , l wae
also another class called the "Do
. hates" or " "Donats," comppsed ;'-\ of.
young men destined for service in the
order, or_ influential citizens who had'
contributed to the Templar treasury.

With the destruction of the Templars
in France other nations made attacks
on the order, confiscating its .estates,
imprisoning or driving away the Temp
lars and virtually blotting out the ex
istence of the order. . The Knights, flee
ing, from their priories, sought refuge
wherever a friendly, harbor could be
found. Quite a number made their
way to Scotland, as.Jn that land the
Templars had suffered no persecution,
and while there joined or united with
the Order of St. John of Jerusalem,
upon which the confiscated lands of the
Templars had been bestowed. Some
followed the fortunes and placed them
selves under the protection of Charles
Edward the Pretender, who became, or
was styled, grand master, and to thi3
circumstance some of the degrees in
the Scottish Rite probablr owe their
existence. Some members of the order
took, refuge in religious houses and
others retired to private life, but in
all cases the Templars retained the old
religious training, with continued
fidelity to the principles of the order,
and won esteem and good will in what
ever station they were placed.
It has been suggested that no* direct
authority or title can be traced from
the old order to the present one. which
is so potential in the United States,
but there sejems to , be authentic evi
dence that the existence of the order
never disappeared. So great and so
powerful an organization as Templar
ism could never have died without
leaving Its traces and its influence on
the existing conditions of society at
that time and in the subsequent ages.
The Knights of the Temple became
affiliated with the Knights of St. John,
and, without doubt, members of these
orders at times received the degrees of
Freemasonry. In such cases they
proved valuable members and at all
times aided the cause with their coun
.sel, purse and sword. Part of the
present authority for the existence of
the order cpmes from the English
priories in Bristol, Bath, York, Salis
bury and London. The persecution of
the Templars in England was never
severe, although these priories, except
the two first named, were broken- up
and their members dispersed.
The Encampment or Baldwyn at
Bristol continued Its organization, ac
cepted the doctrines of the established
church, and from time to time created
Knights of the Temple and of St. John.
The claims of this encampment appear
to be well founded, and its continua
tion from the time when the property
of the order was sequestered to the
present day can hardly be questioned.
Without doubt the English and Ameri
can Templars can trace their authority
and origin to the Ealdwyn ..Encamp
ment and to the Independent action of
the Knights of the Temple and of St.
John while in Scotland.
The knightly life was a religious life
and true knighthood was never known
until the church and the faith of
Christ were established upon the earth.
The term of probation of the knight
was emblematical of the life of the Re
deemer, triumphing over the faults of
sinful nature and finding new strength
for faith, purity and devotion-
Half soldier and. half monk was his
characteristic, and the fulfillment of
every Christian duty and the practice
of Christian virtue was the rule and
motive of -his actions. Life was con
secrated by prayer and sacrifice, ; and
death was ever welcome for the cause
of Christ. "Non ; nobis, Domlne; non
nobis! sed nomine tuo da Gloriam!" :
were willing to listen to any charges
against the Order of the Temple. For
a generation or more there had been
strange stories about these Knights,
rumors affecting their orthodoxy and
the loyalty of the order, and the secret
rites and black art practiced at their
secret meetings. Credence was given
to the charges that, the neophyte spat
upon the crucifix, disovowed his belief
in Christ, and worshiped idols. The
Templar's pride, arrogance and luxury
soon rendered him an object of dislike
to those who were willing or 'possessed
the power to accomplish his fall. The
members of the order being scattered
in their various preceptories and not
being able to read aright the signs of
the times were in a condition to be
come an easy prey to an avaricious
and unscrupulous prince.
Such was Philip the Fair of France,
who planned to add to his treasury the
Immense wealth of the preceptories
which were located within his king
dom. . To his wishes Pope Clement V
gave ready 'consent, and in June. 1306,
the grand master was summoned by
the Pope, at. the instigation of Philip.
t0 meet him in Paris on matters of
importance to the order. De Molay.
the grand master, obeyed, and with
a large 'amount of .treasure and a re
tinue "of Knights, hastened to Paris,
By promises, and excuses the gfand
[master was delayed in the French
capital for nearly a year, and then,
on October 13, 1307, the .grand master
and every- Templar in France was ar
rested and thrust into prison.
Cruelty, injustice and the tortures
of the Inquisition marked all the pro
ceedings of the examination. The
charges which were preferred could
not, even in that age, be substantiated,
but th.e judgment had been rendered
before the trial, and during the follow
ing seven years the Templars "â¢ were
driven from their homes, imprisoned
for life or burned at the stake. The
Pope, who Â«had " received the honors
and vows of these valiant Knights, exe
cuted the orders of his master, Philip
of France, and saw with fear and
trembling an order which was created
and which existed for the glory of his
church disappear in the smoke which
arose from the funeral pyre or vanish
in the noisome dungeon where life and
liberty were lost.

FranE William, SSumner
The supreme power of th> order was
vested in a grand master, elected for
life, and whose authority was- well
nJgh absolute. His residence was at
first at Jerusalem, and nftcrwird at
the city or place- where the headquar
ters of the order were located.
Th?. next officer in rank- .to the
grand master was th$ seneschal, who.
exarcised authority in case of the dis-,
ability of the .master. THe marshal,
third in rank, was the military of
ficer or general of the order. The
treasurer," having duties rs implied by
his name, also exercised authority as
admiral. The draper performed those'
duties which 'in the present day are
Incumbent upon. the commissary gen-.
ervil. . 'The turcopolier was the com
mander of, the cavalry.
As tho order grew in strength it
Vas divided into provinces, and these
territorial districts were governed by
grand preceptors or grand priors
The., highest executive body of
1" 7 order was composed of the
officers of the order as men
tioned, the grand preceptors of
provinces and a' certain num
ber of distinguished Sir
Knights. These formed - the
Chapter General of the
order, and in this body all
'the laws and regulations
were, made and the grand
officers elected. The au
thority and lands of the
order .were divided up
into fifteen provinces,
extending' from Pales
tine to the western
bounds of Europe, and
from Sicily to Ger
many, forming an em
pire by itself and hav
ing one interest and
controlled by one pol-
and if he .re- .
plied, that he still Â¦
desired to be re- "â¢
celved; he' was
questioned fur
ther as to â¢ his
mind : and con-,
science; ". ; ;'
â¢ The candidate
was then seated
before the mas
ter,'" who deliv
ered to . him a
discourse on his
obligations. to the
order. Among his
duties may be men
Â¦ tiontd: He was
never to assault
a n'y Christianas,
nor swear,
- nor re
cpive
The reception of a
Knight into the order
was a solemn ceremo
nial and was secret, as
none but members
were entitled to be
present. The full de
tails of the ceremonies
of initiation are not
known in the present
day, as a portion of
esoteric work has been
lost. We know, how
ever, the general detail
of the rite of reception
of a candidate for the
candidate for the honors
of . the order in those days,
and a sketch of such
reception is given.
On tire day -of the re
ception' the master and
Knights were sent tc
warn the candidate ol
the dangers and hard
ships which he would
be obliged to encoun
ter if he became a
knight cf- the order.
If his replies were sat
isfactory the commit
tee returned to the
chapter - room and
made a report, .which,
on being received, and
there ' being no objec
tion, the committee re
turned and gave the candidate the nec
essary instructions as to the manner in
which he should act, and then led him
to the door of the chapter-room.
On entering, he cast himself on. his
knees before the master, -and said:
"Sir, i am come before God/ before. you
and the' brethren, and :'pray. and be
seech you, for God and our dear Lady's
sake, 1 to admit rrie into your fellowship
and the good deeds of tiie order, as one,
who will for all his life be the; servant!
and slave of the order." The master
then addressed the. candidate and 'ex
plained to him what he. must renounce,
what ; he must undergo, and jwhat ; he
must expect if. he was â¢ to become, a.
member of this order of knighthood;
any attention from a woman without
the consent of his superiors; not to kiss
Â§i woman; not to abuse any one and to..
â¢ibe ever "courteous to all; to attend.
divine service; to begin and end his
meals with prayer; to be submissive"
and, obedient to the grand master and "
â¢all those In authority; to cross the.
seas; to go to battle, and never turn
i;his back on three foes, and, if alone,
to fight them if they were infidels.
The life of the soldier was' part sol
dier and part monk. Daily religious
services were required and none could
.absent themselves without the con-
passing away when its work was ac
complished.
. The peculiar dress of the order was a
long white tunic, with a red passion
cross on the front and back. Over this
" was worn the white Templar cloak or
mantle, displaying a red Templar cross
over the left breast; and the head was
covered .with a can or hood attached
to the mantle. The white garments
were worn only \ by the knights who
had been bound to the order for, a fixed
period ' or for life. The chaplains
clothed themselves in dark robes'suit
able to their profession, but ornament-
history of Palestine aunng
twelfth and thirteenth cen
tuWes Is virtually a story of
the Knights Templar and
the Knights Hospitaler
and a record of their
struggles against the
Saracens for dominion
in the Holy Land.
-The zeal of these
Knights was never
questioned. They
were the first to ad
vance and the last to
retreat, for in accord
ance with the rules of
. their order they never
turned their . backs upon
an Infidel foe.
During the. latter years of
the order power and pros
perity sapped the warlike
spirit of the Templars, and
although wealth and au
thority had been ob
tained, such acquisi
tion had been ob
tained by loss of
piety and virtue.
There was a
growing senti
ment against the
order, for the
Templars seemed
to have forgotten
their vows to
protect the holy
sepulcher, and. after the disastrous
defeat in r Acre in 1291, had, ex
cepting a short stay in Cyprus, hur
ried to the various manors which were
held by the order in the different coun
tries of Europe. * These priories or pre
ceptories have been estimated to have
numbered 9000,. and the divisions of the
orders yielded the revenue of kings.
The Knights Hospitaler, on the other
hand, after evacuating Palestine, re
mained at Cyprus and Rhodes, creat
ing a naval force and engaging in suc
cessful maritime warfare against the
Turks and Saracens throughout the
Mediterranean.
The different lines of policy pursued
by the two orders created a distrust of
the Templars arid therefore the people
sent -, of the mas
ter or â¢ preceptor.
.Two plain meals
an d sometimes
three were allowed
each day, but the
fare was at tlme3

served,; .but strict
silence enjoined that
all might listen to
the words from Holy
Writ, which were
read by a -chaplain or
one of the Knights.

edkwith the cross of the order. .The
brethren-at-arms. the serving brethren
and others connected with the order
were bidden to wear dark or dusky
brown garments, but ho bright or
parti-colored clothing was allowed to
be worn on any occasion.
The armor was : that of the age.
either plate or chain, the latter coming
into favor with the Knights after their
experience , in battles with the Sara
cens. Over the mail was worn the
mantle and cross of the order, but no
further distinguishing mark or insig
nia was allowed. The arms were the
sword, lance, mace and shield, and,
afterward, from knowledge gained in
Palestine, the bow and arrow were at
times- used. Â¦ / ' â¢
As the Knights we're a mounted force
the fighting was done on horseback.
There is a legend that during the
earlier* years of the order, because of
poverty, two Knighta were mounted on
souue aevouon to tne
order were ever enjoin
ed. It was a wonderful
brotherh o o d and
flourished accord
ing to the
i
necessi
ties of
the
one horse, but such tradition is doubt
ful. Wealth came to the organization
from the first, and all duly â¢ created
Knights were provided with -two and
sometimes three horses. . ' ... _.
-The 'banners of the order were ..two.
The beauseant, the upp^r half of
which was black and the lower half
white, was sometimes known as the
vexillium belli, or battle flag or war
banner of the order and was borne. in
all conflicts. At times the Knights car
ried the beauseant in the form of a
8mail pennant at the end of their lances.
The red cross banner was a white
flag on which was displayed the
broad red passion cross, and this
standard might be . called the
headquarters llag of the organ
ization as it was always placed
in front of' the v grand master's
station. â¢

tion existed two centuries ar.d its

some office. After he has been in a
month or two he usually has Just as
much reason for keeping quiet as the
other fellows have. It was expected
that this is what would happen to Mr.
Joke, but he was wl3er than they
thought. No sooner had his office be

the trail of the gentlemen who had
been shaking dice for the city revenues

off from the next streetcar franchise.
No one really believed that he meant
it, but while the grafters were sitting
around waiting for the right time to

"Let's cut and run," said Bert. 1
In another instant they had whisked
out among the stray flakes of the piaz

that is making itself felt more and
rr.ore as lime goes on.
In the good old days when a woman
via regarded as so much personal
property, a mere personal chattel, in
fact, thin^r. were upon quite a differ
ent basis. Then the brave knight rode
gayly forth tied in all his gorgeous
armor and left his wife at home to
watch and wait and sich for his re
turn. Did she ever think of accom
panying han? No, not she. Home was
just wherr* r^ic* belonged: so. forsooth,
she stayed there, and what is more,
without a murmur, too.
But the knights* of to-day are not
quite as i!;iepenient â not quite as
high and. mighty. To be sure they
ride forth, kut they di> not always go
alone. Whether it is because woman
kind has ;-pv.dua!ly csnie into a high

lived up to these workings there would
be no need of a church, for every one
would be doing the very best they
knew how.jv Â«:'-,-
The influence of all secret bodies is
goodâ whether It be for men or women
or both. Twe.nty-one years ago I was
the chairman of the reception commit
tee, as I am to-day, and in that span
of years I can see where women have
made great strides and where they
have made themselves too Indispensa
ble to ever be put aside. . In fact. I
think they will keep golnj on and on
until all the privileges that are now
denied them will be theirs and by pop
ular accord. This probably will not
be in my time, but. -believe me. it Is to
be in time to come.'
ins the front -gate, I am sure I do
not know; but a casual glance is all
that is needed to assure one that
where man is wbman is sure to be
found, and every lodge, every, secret
organization and every social power
has gradually corns to recognize the
fcict and has opened its door to women
!n general.
It took centuries to convince the
Knight Templars that the order 6t
the Eastern Star would be a good in
stitution and that their wives and
daughters tould, in a. measure, feel
that they were not entirely secluded
from all thing3 Masonic. The Odd
Fellown found a-place for their ladle's
fair in the Rebecca lodgeroom and
the Red Men sought their Pocahontas
that they might have ;v war . dance
every now and then. Even tho Native
Sons looked about and sighed discon
solately until the Daughters shared
some of their secrets and then caused
them to think twice before speaking
ence.
And so one will find it all the way
through whichever way fliw glances.
For every J^ck there i3 a Jill and no
sooner do men form an organization
than the women begin casting their
eye3 about and formulating plans
That spirit prevails to-day. Men had
secret organizations and business meet
ings. Women endured it for a time
and then because they couldn't usurp
these rights determined to have these
s'elfsame things for themselves and on
just as exclusive a plan. They insti
tuted lodges, formed clubs and had all
sorts of meetings of their own and
what is the result? A broader mind, a
more contented spirit and a better
sense of fellowship. People who are
interested In outside doings have Uttle
or no time to fret and worry over petty
trials that come to every home. . And
for that matter, coming in direct con
tact with thinking men and women
broadens and makes them bigger and
they are better able to cope with their
di.iicultics. What once seemed like a
tremendous trial is later regarded as
something too small and too trifling
to give a Bccond thought, and so much
good is accomplished. .
Both lodges and clubs \ should add
their miteâ the one because of its so
ciability and the other because of its
workings. Women are by nature very
sociable and they are likewise very im
pressionistic. They blossom out and
are at their best when they have one

Here is a sample of how things
.we're done years ago. In 1880 when
our Knights went to Chicago to see
about California having. the next con
clave, nea rly every woman on the
train was a perfect stranger to her
next door neighbor, hut of course all
the men- were brothers and if they
v/ere.r.ot already acquainted they did
not stand upon ceremony.. , One by
one tho ladies presented their cards
and gradually became friendly, s6 that
when they- reached Chicago they were
having a' jolly time. But again they
were immediately plunged Into a myr
iad of strangers. . â¢ '
The result of this trip was the for
mation of an organization termed the
Knights Templar Triennial Union and
it was composed of the wives, daugh^_
ters and mothers of
the Knights. They
were to take charge
of the entertain-
Ynent entirely and
see that all visiting
ladies were prop
erly cared for.
Now, my point is

the beauty of the Sound addressed the members with no eloquence, as a
game of poker began as we started and was never deserted for the twenty
four hours we sailed. Not to seem churlish I played at times â "sat in," as
Mr. Backstay quaintly put itâ and at' the end of the voyage it was dis
closed that the amount of my losses to my host just offset the bill I had
paid for sundry cases of wine, patties and other more substantial provisions.
I left the yacht in company with a quiet, smiling gentleman, who re-,
marked to me, "You paid the shot this time. I believe." He explained that
Mr. Backstay had evolved a plan of high living and plain sailing which
much amused and interested his friends. He had inherited nothing but
the yacht, "not enough else to buy a new duck suit for him," my acquaint
ance said, and lived on her permanently. When his larder ran low he asked
some guest to order a new supply and worked out the financial end as in my
case. The wages of the crew and other necessary expenses he won at poker.
"Jack's a deuce of a nice fellow," remarked my informant, "and we are
all awfully proud of him that he has evolved so successful a plan for living
nicely and honestly. Had he not such a pretty wit, or none at all, he might
have become a cotillon tender, and then we would have been obliged to cut
him, but as it is we are proud of him."
I relate this incident as evidence of the popularity I am enjoying, my
informant assuring me that Mr. Backstay only honored with invitations to
his yacht men whose qualities made their popularity a matter of course. I
chanced to speak to Mrs. Lacquerre of this and she laughed heartily, say
ing, "Poor, dear 'Jack* Backstay! We all know him, and I do assure you
that you have been correctly informed. He entertains no one*on that
amazing yacht of his whose qualities he is not certain are sufficient to
provide entertainment." She placed such a peculiar accent on the word
"entertainment" that had I been of a suspicious -nature it might have oc
curred to me that the kind of entertainment my qualities provided went
into the several hampers of wine and food I sent to the yachtâ and paid
for. But, of course, it would be a kind of mock modesty I greatly con
demn for me to pretend that I am not in myself, and aside from my fot'-
DEAR UNCLE SILAS:â It is a penalty of popularity that one
may not have his time at his own disposal. I find myself so
much in demand that many serious studies of social problems are,
for the present at least, abandoned. I speak of this at once, as
it lead? me to reply to your well meant, advice concerning such
companions as Mr. "Bob"' Faykerr and Miss "Babe" Franklin. I readily
understand what you, at a distance and with what you will pardon mv call
ing old-fashioned ideas, may believe to be my personal dancer. But. dear
uncle, do not b alarmed on my account. I have had my lesson and shall
profit by it. I candidly admit that Miss Franklin may have deceived
me as to her necessities and worthiness and that Mr. Faykerr may have re
ceived a share of the money I lost in the gambling house as his commis
sion for introducing me there. This, I say, I admit; yet I cannot but feel
surprised that you have such knowledge of New York as to discover the
truth even from my letters. I had always supposed your visits here to be
strictly business in their nature, yet I hear from Mrs. Lacquerre that you
are well-known in her social sets, and I gather from her smiling remarks
that you do not disdain to indulge in the frivolities of society to an ex
tent. How little we really know of even those with whom our companion
ship has been the closest! You, whom I have always supposed to be a
model of somewhat prim, if not austere, conduct, to have so conducted
yourself here in New Yoric as to earn a reputation for gayety of demeanor
surpassed by few!
But these are mere reflections, and I recall your requests that my let
ters be confined rather more to narrative of events than observations on
ethics. I comply.
Mrs. Lacquerre having gone to her summer cottage. Boulder Crest. I
received from her a note inviting me for a week end. the time of mv ar
rival and departure being definitely stated in her note, even to the par
ticular train I was to take each way. This struck me as lacking in hos
pitality â as if one's hostess were fortifying herself against having a
stupid guest on her hands a minute longer than she had braced herself to
endure the ordeal. I can imagine instances where such precaution would
be advisable, but why should it be used in sending out invitations to guests
who are desirable? I have, I hope, no more than a properly high regard
for my own merits, yet I cannot but speculate upon the fact that for the
very week end Mrs. Lacquerre" named I had several other invitations
which did not limit my visit to minutes or hours â not even days. I was,
for example, invite 1 for a vachtine cruise by Mr. Jack Backstay, on whose
sloop, the Hyghboll, I had already made one vovage up the sound. I met
Mr. Backstay through Mr. Faykerr one evening and he cordially invited me
to take a run on his yacht the next day. He was going aboard that night
and asked me to call at a certain store in the morning and order a number
of articles, of which he gave me a list. I did so. noting that the goods con
sisted chiefly of refreshments of a solid nature and otherwise. When I
mentioned the yacht to which they were to be sent the salesman politely
but with marked firmness insisted upon cash in advance. Of course I paid
for the goods, thinking it would be entirely proper to remind my host of
tune, a young gentleman of high qualities as an entertainer. Only the
young and frivolous could deny that, I fancy.
This thought brings to ray mind Miss Frances Lacquerre. Not that
she is frivolous; she might be more acceptable in my esteem if she were.
She seems to be a youne woman with a high opinion, of her own merits,
and that is a phase of character I find it difficult to encounter with be
coming equanimity. Miss Frances has a lofty maner of looking at things
â at me. for example â which her mental attributes do not in any degree
justify. At the time of the conversation with Mrs. Lacquerre to which I
have just referred. I turned to Frances and. asked her opinion of Mr. Back
stay. She hesitated a moment and then replied: "I suppose, as society is
organized, there is a proper place in it for sharks to prevent an oversupply
of gudgeons."
"I fail to appreciate the application of your simile. Miss Frances." I re
sponded.
"Were there no gudzeons on Mr. Backstay's yacht?" she asked scorn
"Frances, dear," interrupted Mrs. Lacquerre, "you do not know what
a gudgeon is, and neither do I. Order us some tea."
The young lady raised her cvebrows at her mother, smiled in a wav
which exasperated me quite unaccountably, and responded coollv: "How
delightfully of one mind we all are â no one of us seems to know what a
gudgeon is. But, mamma, in vulgar parlance, isn't it described as a sucker?"
"Don't be slangy, Frances," was all her mother said, and the young
lady prepared tea. For a young woman of such little worth in intellectual
qualities she is much in my mind. Why I cannot tell. To be sure. I find
that her famed beauty, which I did not at first see. had grown upon me. I
seek in woman, as the poet wrote â
"Benignity and home bred sense.
Ripening into perfect innocence."
rather than
"A lovely apparition sent
To be a moment's ornament.'*
I find that Frances is â but why should I waste time in telling what I
think of her. Surely, she is nothing to me, nor would I wish her to be. I
learn that she "goes in for." as the quaint expression is. all out of door
sports and is very popular with voting gentlemen of my age, who, as I
learn, devote but little of their time to mastering the intricacies of political
problems; engaging themselves, rather, in futile pastimes of an athletic
nature. But I shall be able to tell you more of this phase of life uoon my
return from my promised week-end visit to Mrs. Lacquerre's country place,
and for that purpose suspend this letter for the present.
Well, Uncle. Silas, if you know what seaside cottage life is. and Mrs.
.Lacquerre assures me that you do, why have you never told me of it? I
am becoming convinced that in order to prepare myself to '"see life steadily
and see it it whole" it may be advisable for me to interrupt my studies of
national fiscal policies and for a time, at least, devote my energies to ac
quiring some knowledge of how mv fellow man of my own social condition
conducts his life. I was verv thorough in my course in sociology in col
lege, but now, to my surprise. I mijjht as well be a "pagan suckled in a
creed outworn" as a modern American for all that I know of many aspects
of life surrounding me.
Mrs. Lacquerre's cottage is a twenty-room mansion on a rocky point
of land reaching out into a bav filled with islands. It is several miles from
the railway station, and, with the exception of perhaps half a dozen other
equally expensive cottages, there is no other habitation within sight. But
all the cottages had week-end parties, so that for an event in which all were
interested, a company of nearly a hundred ladies and gentlemen assem
bled. In a later letter, perhaps, when my mind is more in order, I shall
give you a filled-in picture of our life at Bowlder Crest, but at present
must attempt but a scanty sketch. I shall not now describe the various
recreations on land â golf, tennis and squashâ in which the company in
dulged, for it is with the water my experiences chiefly relate. In a little
cove, on the sheltered side of the point, as many as a dozen yachts were
anchored, some belonging to the hosts, some to the guests, and in addition
there were .numberless small craft of many odd shapes and designs, some
for sailing, some for rowing. In, on, around, and I may say under and
over, these yachts and various other craft, the life of the several house
parties chiefly centered, and there was continual intercourse between the
yachts and the landing; sometimes by means of rowboats manned by uni
formed sailors and sometimes by little sailing craft or by pretty motor
boats, and again even by swimming. A party of us were down at the bath
house, built on the deck of an old wreck, when Miss Frances said to me:
"Can you really swim? You do not play golf, polo, tennis, squash, nor do
yacht. If you swim let me show you off."
The remark rather confused me. as it had not occurred to me" that I
lacked in any of the accomplishments of the society my wealth and educa
tion places me in. Therefore I was pleased to think of what a powerful
swimmer I am.
"Surely," I replied, "I swim. Let us swim out to the yacht." Miss
Frances looked at me as if doubtful of my sincerity, so to prove it I
dived off and struck out. and she promptly followed. We boarded one
yacht by its landing steps and a maid enveloped Frances in a warm bath
robe. I felt some little pride in having our feat highly praised. Nothing
but yachting was talked off by the party assembled on the afterdeck, and I
determined to secure a boat of some sort at once in order not at all times
to feel so wholly out of the running, as the saying is.
That afternoon I quietly hurried over to a fishing village not far up
the coast and promptly made known my wish to an ancient mariner I found
on the wharf looking out to sea with one eye and narrowly regarding me
with the other. When I made known to him my desire to purchase a sail
boat he brought both eyes to bear on me, adjusted his trousers band with
both hands, spat to the right, then to the left, and at last slowly remarked:
"Well, sir, some men be lucky. Ef you be looking for a tried and true,
rcg'lar old-style Yankee sloop as hez proved herself at everything from
lobsters to lime, come with me."
The craft he showed me looked much in need of a bath, in spite of the
fact that she was quite as wet inside as out, but my seafaring friend as
sured me that with new sails and a coat of paint she would be as handsome
as a cup defender, and probably as last. I was impatient to become a pri
vate yacht owner, so I closed a bargain, and the ancient mariner offered
to sail me bacl: to Bowlder Crest Cove. As to the boat's sailing qualities
I have no knowledge, for I was so frantically busy pumping all the way I
heeded nothing except my rapidly blistering hands v But as we entered the
cove I heard much comment shouted through megaphones by gentlemen
on the anchored yachts, such as "Two to one she sinks before she beaches 1"
"Hi there, Noah, where are you going, overland?" This last remark was
suggested by the fact that at that instant we grounded heavily on the
beach. There was a shiver, a shake, a gentle sighing of old timbers, and mv
craft seemed to shrink and collapse. The mariner jumped overboard and
waded ashore, saying, "Never thought she'd get here, but the price was
worth the risk." â¢
All the guests from the cottages gathered to inspect my purchase
which, having been beached at high tide, we could soon walk around dry
shod, and there were many expressions of wonder that the skipper had
managed to fetch her so far from her ancient resting place. I felt some
chagrin as I learned that my purchase had long been an object of curious
interest as the oldest and craziest craft afloat, but before I revealed the
object of its purchase I heard Frances say to me with a meaning accent
"It was so kind of you to risk your life to supply our beach with a wreck"
It is so very picturesque, and we have always wanted one, but no one bÂ£
fore ever thought of this plan. .
â¢-K I saw that she had said this to protect me from ridicule and to make a
hero of me. -and I attempted, perhaps with some feeling, to thank her but
she interrupted me by exclaiming: "Oh, greater freshness than yours' has
been salted by a clever woman!" Then she ran away. Now. what could
she have meant. Uncle Silas? What could she have meant? Affectionately

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
REVBEN FROM BEETVILLE.
12It is a fascinating subject, Russia. But for a wholesome fear
of my editor, I feel I could ramble on for columns. Nature has
made life hard there for rich and poor alike. To the banks of the
Neva, with its ague and influenza bestowing fogs and mist?! one
imagines that the devil himself must have guided Peter the Great.
"Show me in all thy dominions the most hopelessly unattractive
site on which to build a city," Peter must have prayed; and the
devil, having discovered the site on which St. Petersburg now
stands, must have returned to his master in high good feather. "I
think, my dear Peter, I have found you something really unique.
It is a pestilent swamp to which a mighty river brings bitter
blasts and marrow-chilling fogs. In the brief summer time the wind
will bring you sand. In this way you will combine the disadvan
tages of the North Pole with those of the desert of Sahara." In
the winter time the Russians light their great stoves and doubly
barricade their doors and windows ; and in this atmosphere, like
that of a greenhouse, many of their women will pass six months,
never venturing out of doors. Even the men only go out at inter
vals. Every office, every shop, is an oven. Men of forty have white
hair and parchment faces, and the women are old at thirty. The,
farm laborers during the few summer months work almost entircly
without sleep. They leave that for the winter, when they shut
themselves up like dormice in their hovels, their store of food and
vodka buried underneath the floor. For days together they sleep,
then wake and dig, then sleep again. So it is even with their bet
ters. The Russian party lasts all night. In an adjoining room
are beds and couches ; half a dozen guests are always sleeping. An
hour contents them, then they rejoin the company and other
guests take their places. The Russian eats when he feels so dis
posed; the table is always spread, the guests come and go. Once
a year there is a great feast in Moscow. The Russian merchant
and his friends sit down early in the day and a sort of thick
sweet pancake is served up hot. The feast continues for many
hours, and the ambition of the Russian merchant is to eat more
than his neighbor. Fifty or sixty of these hot cakes a man will
consume at a sitting, and a dozen funerals in Moscow is often the
result. An uncivilized 'people, we call them in our lordly way, but
they are young. They will see us out, I am ; inclined "to think.
Their energy, their intelligence â when these show above, the
groundwork and their animalism â are monstrous. I have known
a Russian to learn Chinese within six months. English! they learn
it while you are. talking to them. The children play at chess and
study the violin for their own amusement. The world will be glad
of Russia â when she has put her house in order.

telligent animals. Yet every educated Russian you talk to on the
subject knows that revolution 1 is coming. But he talks to you
about it with the door shut,ior no man in Russia can be'sure that
his own servants are not police spies. I was discussing the question
with a Russian official one evening in his study when his old
housekeeper entered the roomâ a soft-eyed, gray-haired, woman
who had been in his service more than eight years and whose po
sition in the household was almost that of a friend. He stopped
abruptly and changed the conversation. So soon as the door was
closed behind her again he explained himself: "It is better to chat
upon such matters when one is quite alone," he laughed. "But
surely you can trust her," I said. "It is safer to trust no one," he
answered.- And then he continued from the point where we had
been interrupted. "It is gathering," he said ; "there are times when
I almost smell blood in the air. I am an old man and may escape
it, but my children will have to suffer â suffer as children must do
for the sins of their fathers. We have made brute beasts of the
people, and as brute beasts they will come upon us, cruel and un
discriminating; right and wrong indifferently going clown before
them. But it has to be. It is needed. The future history of
Russia will be the history of the French Revolution over 'again,
but with this difference: that the educated classes, the thinkers,
who are pushing forward the dumb masses are doing so with their
eyes open. There will be no Mirabeau, no Danton, to be ap
palled at the people's ingratitude. The men who to-day are work
ing for revolution in Russia number among their ranks" statesmen,
soldiers, delicately-nurtured women, rich landowners, prosperous
tradesmen, students familiar with the lessons of history.* They
have no misconceptions concerning the blind Frankenstein into
which they are breathing life. He will crush them ; they know it ; but
with them he will crush the injustice and stupidity they have
grown to hate better than they love themselves. The Russian
peasant, when he rises, will prove more terrible, more pitiless, than
were the men of 1790. He is less intelligent, more brutal. They
sing a wild, sad song, these Russian cattle, the while they work.
They sing it in chorus on the quays while hauling the cargo, thev
sing it in the factory, they chant it on the weary, endless stepped,
reaping the corn they may not eat. It is about "the good time their
masters are havingâ of the feasting and the merry-making. Bui
the last line of every verse is the same. When you ask a Rus
sian to translate it for you he shrugs his shoulders. 'Oh, it means,'
he says, 'that their time will come, some day !' It is a sad, pathetic,
haunting refrain. They sing it in the drawing-rooms of Moscow
arid St. Petersburg, and somehow the light talk and laughter die
away, and a'hush, like a chill breath, enters by the closed door and
passes through: It is a curious song, like the wailing of a tired,
wind, and one day it will sweep over the land heralding terror."*
A Scotchman I met in Russia told me that when he first came
out to act as manager of a large factory just outside St. Peters-
burg, belonging to his Scottish employers, he unwittingly made a
mistake the first week when paying his workpeople. By a miscal
culation of the Russian money he paid some three hundred men
each one nearly a ruble short. He discovered his error before the
following Saturday and then put the matter right. The men ac
cepted his explanation with perfect composure and without any
comment whatever. The thing astonished him. "But you musL
have known I was paying you short." he said to one of them.
"Why didn't you tell me of it?" "Oh," answered the man, "we
thought you were putting it in your own pocket, and that if we
had complained it would only have meant dismissal for us. No
one would have taken our word against yours." Corruption ap
pears to be so general throughout the whole of Russia that all
classes have come to accept it as part of the established order of
things. A friend gave me a little dog to bring away with me. It
was a valuable animal and I wished to keep it with me. It is
strictly forbidden to take dogs into railway carriages. The list of
the pains and penalties for doing so frightened me considerably.
"Oh, that will be all right," my friend assured me, "have a few ru
bles loose in your pocket." I. tipped the 'station-master and I
tipped the guard and started, pleased with myself. But I had not
anticipated what was in store for me. The news that an English
man with a dog in a basket and rubles in his pocket was coming
must have been telegraphed all down the line. At almost every
stopping place some enormous official, generally wearing a sword
and a helmet, boarded the train. At first these fellows terrified
me. I took them for field marshals, at least. When they saw the
dog their astonishment was boundless. Visions of Siberia crossed
my mind. Anxious and trembling I gave the first one a gold piece.
He shook nic warmly by the hand. I thought he was going to kiss
me. If I had offered him my cheek I am sure he would have done
so. With the next one I felt less apprehensive. For a couple of
rubles he blessed me, so I gathered, and, commending me to the
care of the Almighty, departed. Before* I had reached the Ger
man frontier I was giving away the equivalent of English six
pences to men with the bearing and carriage of major generals, and
to see their faces brighten up and to receive their heartfelt bene
dictions was well worth the money.

I OUGHT to like Russia better than I do, if only for the sake of
the many good friends lam proud to possess among the

mantelpiece. It helps me to maintain my head at that de
gree of distension necessary for the performance of all liter
ary work. It presents in the center a neatly written address in
excellent English, that I frankly confess I am never tired of, read
ing, around which are ranged"- some hundreds of names I am quite
unable to read ; but which, in spite of their strange lettering, I
know to be the names of good Russian men and women, to whom,
a year or two ago, the kindly idea occurred to send me a Christ
mas card, this message of encouragement. The individual Russian
is one of the most charming creatures living. If he likes you he
does not hesitate to let you know it, not only by every kindly
action possible, but, by what perhaps is just as useful in this gray
old world, by .kindly speech. We Anglo-Saxons are apt to pride
ourselves upon bei;;g undemonstrative. Max Adler tells a tale of
a boy who was sent out by his father to fetch in some wood. The
boy took the opportunity of disappearing and did not show his
face again beneath the paternal roof for over twenty years. Then,
one evening, a smiling, well-dressed stranger entered to the old
couple and announced himself as their long lost child. "Well, you
haven't hurried yourself," grumbled the old man, "and blarm me,
if now you haven't forgotten the wood !" I was lunching with an
Englishman in a London restaurant one day. A man entered and
took his seat at a table nearby, and glancing around and meeting
my friend's eyes smiled and nodded. "Excuse me a minute," said â¢
my friend, "I must just speak to my brother â haven't seen him for
more than five years." He finished his soup and leisurely wiped
his mustache before strolling across and shaking hands. They
talked for a while, then my friend returned to me. "Never
thought to see him again," observed my friend; "he was one of the
garrison at that place in Africa â what's the name of it? * * *
that the Mahdi attacked. Only three of them escaped. Ahvavs
was' a lucky beggar, Jim !" "But wouldn't you like to talk to him
some more?" I suggested. "I can see you at any time about this
little business of ours." "Oh, that's all right," he answered ; "we
have just fixed it up â shall be dining with him to-morrow."
* * *
I thought of this scene one evening while dining with some
Russian friends in a St. Petersburg hotel. One of the party had
not seen his second cousin, a mining engineer, for nearly eighteen
months. They sat opposite to one another, and a dozen times at
least during the course of the dinner one of them would jump up
from his chair and run around to embrace the other. They would
throw their arms about one another, kissing one another on both
cheeks, and then sit down again with moist eyes. Their behavior
among their fellow countrymen excited no astonishment whatever.
The Russian's anger is just as quick and vehement as his love. I
was supping one evening with friends in one of the chief restaur
ants on the Ncvsky. Two gentlemen at an adjoining table, who
up till the previous moment had been engaged in amicable con
versation, suddenly sprang to their feet and "went for" one an
other. One man secured the water bottle which he promptly
broke over the other's head. His opponent chose for his weapon
a heavy mahogany chair, and, leaping back for the purpose of se
curing a good swing, lurched against my hostess. "Do please be
careful," said the lady. "A thousand pardons, madame," returned
the stranger, from whom blood and water were streaming in equal
copiousness, and, taking the utmost care to avoid interfering with
our comfort, he succeeded adroitly in flooring his antagonist by a
well directed blow. A policeman appeared upon the scene with
marvelous promptitude. He did not attempt to interfere, but, run
ning out into the street, communicated the glad tidings to another
policeman. "That's going to cost them a pretty penny," observed
my host, who was calmly continuing his supper; "why couldn't
they wait?" It did cost them a pretty penny. Some half a dozen
policemen were round' about before as many minutes had elapsed
and each one claimed his bribe. Then they wished both comba
tants good-night and trooped out, evidently in great good humor ;
and the two gentlemen, with wet napkins round their heads, sat
down again, and laughter and amicable conversation flowed freely
as before.

any acknowledgment for superior in
tellectual ability. Notably one may
quote the case of Madame. Curie, the
discoverer of radium. Coward Adam
says she discovered it by "a fluke" â
that is to say, by chanbe. Most great
discoveries occur, even to men, in the
same way. In the present instance the
''chance" came to a woman. Why
should she not therefore have all the
honor due to her? â the same honor
precisely as would fall to the lot of a
man in her place? Columns upon col
i urnns of praise would be bestowed
. upon her were she of Adam's sex. and
: all "the, academies of science would con
tend with each other as =to- which

s 'creature,* who owns and admits the

- now speaking" of the coward "specimen.
'.. .The brave Adam. does not turn. tall or
Â» climb trees, . and he appears to. have
had nothing to do with the Garden of
Eden. Very likely he was born some
where else. For he says â "The woman
whom thou, gavest to be with me is
the joy of my lifeâ the companion of
my thoughts. To her ray soul turns;
for her my heart beats; in her I.re
joice- her triumphs are my pride: her
success â¢ is my delight. If danger
threatens her, I will be her defender,
not her accuser; should she be blamed'
for aught, I' will take her fault udoii
myself, and will serve as a. strong
shield between her and calumny. This
is the least I can do to prove my love
toward her â for without her I should
be the worst of creatures â a lonely soul
in an empty world!"
So says, or may say brave Adam!
But his coward brother does not under
stand such high-flown ssntiments.
Coward Adam's main object in life is to
"avoid a scene" with either the Lord
Almighty. Mister- Sarpint or Missis
Eve. He likes' to wriggle out of diffi
culties, both public- and private. In a
oulet way. He does not understand the
"methods'" of plain,' ' blunt people who
tell him frank'y. what a sneak, he is.. Ha
is very ubiquitous and much more fre
quently to be met with than his braver
twin. And if he should chance to read
what I have set down here concerning
him he will . nrobably say as usual:
"The -woman whom thou gavest" in
j various forms of anonymous vituper
ation. But his active policy will re
,main the same as it ever was â "Mis
ter. Adam,, he. clum up a tree!"
looks on, waiting for the inevitable
tirale cf his various hesitations and in
*niciencier> â the "Mister Adam, he
clum um a tree." For in most matters
ot social, political and moral progress
the great difficulty is to obtain an up
right, downright, honest and impartial
opinion from any leading public man.
The nation may be drifting devil-ward,
but statesmen are judged to be more
statesmanlike if they hold their
tongues and watch i^, go. They must
not speak the truth. It would offend
so many people. It would upset so
many interests. It would create a
panic on the Stock Exchange. It
would throw Wall street' into hysterics.
The woild's vast public, composed of
thinking, working and more or less
educated and intelligent people, may
and do crave for a bold utterdnee, a
truth openly enunciated and bravely
maintained, but to the weavers of po
litical intrigue and the self-seeking
schemers in governmental depart
ments, the public is considered merely
as a big child, to be soothed with lol
lipop phrases and tickled by rattle
promises. If the big child cries and
screams because it is hungry, they
chirp, to it about fair trade â if it com
plains that its ministers of l'eligion are
trying to make it say its prayers back
ward, they promise a full "inquiry into
recent abuses in the church." But tine
words butter no parsnips. Coward
Adam always climbs up a tree ' as
quickly as he can when instead of fine
words fine deeds are demanded. . Phy
sical feats of skill, physical gymnastics
of all kinds he excels in, but a mortal
difficulty always places him as it did
in the Garden of Eden, in what, he
would conventionally term "an awk
ward position."
Not so very long ago I saw Coward
Adam at his tree-climbing in a law
court. Three valiant descendants of
Ananias, all bound in a compact to
support their great ancestor's reputa
tion, appeared against me to try and
prove that I wanted to build a free
library in Henley street, Stratford-on-
A von, where there were some old
houses of "Shakespeare's time which I
judged it would be patriotic and nat
ural to save from wreckage. They said
'my motive was not to save the old
houses, but to put up a building com
memorative of my own philanthropy,
a la Carnegie. Never having had tho>
remotest intention of building anything
anywhere. I faced mine accusers. I
confronted Sergeant Buzfuz. I con
templated Messrs. Dodson and Fogg.
1 was one woman against three men.
I had only one witness who could an
swer to the fact that I never had so
much as dreamed of committing a free
library crime, and this witness was also
a woman. She, being in the employ and
under the rule of Messieurs les Ana
niases, Â¦was of course "subpenaed" on
their side, and not on mine. Messieurs
les Ananiases swore themselves black,
â if not in the face, yet in the heart â
but despite the advantage they had of
being three to one, they were proved
libelers, and lost their case, going out
of court somewhat less perkily than
they came in. During the progress of
the whole business 1 was very much
interested as a kind of outside specta
tor, apart altogether from my own
share in the proceedings. Coward
Adam was climbing his tree all the
time, and I watched him climb. "The
woman whom thou gavest â " it was
the same everlasting old cry! One of
the Ananiases concerned had, soma
months before, contributed something
to the press about "the unwritten laws
of chivalry." Oh, those unwritten laws!
V/hy are they not called those un
acted laws? Seeing that Coward Adam
always quotes them when ignoring
them!
"Never kiss and tell," is, I believe,
an "unwritten law of chivalry." This
law, so I understand, Coward Adam
docs sometimes manage to obey, albeit
reluctantly. Because he would like to
tellâ he would very much like to tellâ
ifâ if the story of the kiss did not in
volve himself in the telling! But at
this juncture "the unwritten laws of
chivalry" step in and he is saved. And
chivalry is the tree up which he climbs,
chattering to himself the usual formula
â "The woman whom thou gavest to be
with me" â etc., etc. Alas, poor
woman! She has heard him saying
this ever since she, in an unselfish de
sire to share her food with him, gave
him the forbidden apple. Â¦ No doubt she
offered him its rosiest and ripest side.
She always doesâ at first. Not-after
ward. As soon as he turns traitor and
runs up a tree, she takes to pelting
him. metaphorically speaking, with
cocoanuts. This is quite natural on
her part. She had thought him a man
â and when he suddenly changes into a
monkey, she doesn't understand it. To
this cause may possibly be attributed
some of the ructions which occasion
ally jar the harmonious estate of mat
rimony.
Coward Adam does very well in
America. He sees his position there
quite plainly. He knows that ' If he
climbs his tree too often, hundreds of
feminine hands will pull him down. So
he resigns himself to the inevitable.
He is not slow to repeat the customary
whine â "The woman whom thou gavest'
me"â but he says it quietly to himself
between whiles. Because he knows that
sho knows all his share in the mischief.
So he digs and delves, and finds gold
and silver and limitless oil' wherewith
to turn into millions of dollars for her
pleasure; he packs pork.- lays railway
tracks, starts companies, organizes
"combines"â and strains every -nerve
and sinew to "do" every other "Adam

may we say the women?). whom thou
gavest" may. be clothed In Paris model
gowns and' wear jewels outrivaling in
size and luster those of all the kings
and queens that ever made their sad
and stately progress through history.
Indeed, Coward Adam, in the position
he occupies as a free citizen of that
mighty' republic over which the wild
eagle screams exultingly, looks a little
bit like a beaten animal. . But he bears
his beating well, and is quite pleasant
about it. In regard to "the . woman
whom thou gavest me" he is nearer
the imaginary code of "chivalry" than
his European brother. If the original
Adam had learned the ways of a mod

X -<* count Jtr- friends there is one
very handsome and devotedly attentive
gentleman of four years old, who is
particularly fond of reciting to ma in

Hut Mister Adam, he
Oum up a I ret.
There is something in this graphic
narrative which appears to tickle my
jroung ciiva'i^r's fancy immensely, for
whenever he says ''Mister Adam, he
dam up r. tree," he opens his big blue
eyes very widely, claps his tiny hands
very luudly. and gives vent to ecstatic
s-hrieks of laughter. It is quite evident
ihat he entirely understands and ap
preciates Adam's position. Young as
he is, he has the instinctive knowledge
within him that when the time comes
he will likewise adopt the "Clum up a
tree" policy. For Adam is the same
Adam still, and nothing will ever
change him. And when things are get
ting rather "mixed" in his career, and
the forbidden fruit he has so readily
devoured turns out to be rather more
sour and tasteless than he had antici
pated â when his garden of Eden is be
ing searched through and through for
the- causes of the folly and disobedience
which have devastated its original fair
ness, tho same old story may be said
of him â "Mister Adam, he clum up a
tree." Perhaps if he only climbed a
tree one might excuse him â but unfor
tunately he talked while climbing â
talks as though he were an old bab
bling grandam instead of a lord of
creationâ and" grandam-like, puts the
bin me on somebody else. He says â
"The woman whom thou gavest to be
with inc. :>tie gave me of the tree and
I did eat." Coward Adam! Observe
how he at once transfers the fault of
his own lack of will and purpose to the
weaker, more credulous, more lovtns
and trusting partner â how he ieave.s
her defenseless to brave the wrath
which he himself dreads â and how he
never for one-half second dreams of
admitting himself to be the least in the
wrong. Hut there is always one great
satisfaction to be derived from the
perusal of the strange old Eden story,
and that is that "Mister Sarpint" was
of the mah! gender. Scripture leaves
no room for doubt on this point. It
says: "Now the serpant was more sub
til than any beast of the tield which
the Lord God had made. And he said
unto the woman â " So that a "he"
tempted :\ woman before "she" ever
tempted a "he." Women should be
duly thankful lor the sex of "Mister
Sarpint." und should also bear in mind
that this particular *he" was "more
subtil than any beast of the field
which the Lord God had made." On
many cr. occasion it will be found a
salutory and useful fact to remember.
Once upon a time, so wa are told,
there was an age of chivalry. The word
"chivalry" is stated in the dictionary
to be derived from the French "cheval,"
a horse, and "chivalrous" men were in
the literal meaning of the term merely
men who rode about on horseback. But
chivalry has somehow come to. imply
respect, devotion and reverence for
women. The "chivalrous" knight is
supposed to have gone all over the
world, wearing the glove or the ribbon
of his "ladye faire" in his helmet, and
challenging to single combat every
other knight that dared to question the
supremacy of her beauty and virtue.
1 confers at once that I do not be
lieve in him. If he ever existed he
must have been :i mosi unnatural and
abnormal product of humanity, as un
lil.o his first progenitor. Adam, as he
oould well be. For even in the "Round
Table" romances on 1 ? finds an entire
lack of chivalry in the eb-called chival
rous Lnignia of King Arthur. Their
moral principles left much to be de
sired, and the conduct of Sir Melia
graunce who betrayed the loves of
Lancelot and the Queen"** was merely
that of a common sneak. Coward
Adam spoke in him. as In many of the
Arthurian heroes â and that they were
mere "chivalrous" than the modern
male gossips who Jeer away a woman's
name and honor in thoir smoking and
framing rooms is a legend which like
that of the "Tree of Good and Evil"
itself requires stronger confirmation
than history as yet witnes&eth.
Coward Adam, taking him as he ap
pears in the present day. has lately
shown himself off in various odd phases
and lamentable positions. During the
South African war he came out strong
in some of our generals who put the
blame of- certain military mishaps on
one another like quarelsome children,
thereby losing dignity, and offered a
most humiliating spectacle to the
amazed British public. Coward Adam's
policy, after making a blunder, is to
adopt any He. rather than say frankly
and boldlyâ "I did It." He will eat
dirt by the bushel in preference to the
nobler starvation act of singly facing
his foes. He is just now exhibiting

GOPIOUS is the literature upon
the trusts. Upon this new and
untoward development in mod
em industrialism there has been writ
ten volume upon volume, pamphlet
after pamphlet, each with Its own pe
culiar try at a solution of the prob
lem. Of this growing bibliotheca. no
bttter types of the extremes of ; . value
reached by Its several component
lications could be:* chosen than those
represented by "Trusts of To-Day,"-by
Gilbert Holland Montague. and
"Trusts vs. the Public Welfare." from
the pen of H. C. Richie. The one is a
scientific survey of the economics of
great corporate organizations, calmly
and Judiciously set forth, the other a
fervently partisan screed, wherein as
sertion is made the only prop of argu
ment and reassertion the only substi
tute for logic Both are interesting,
but from widely different standpoints.
Montague sets forth in his book
both the theoretical and the actual.
Viewing the subject from the vantage
ground of a trained economist, he Is
enabled to draw the deductions that
must come of a strictly scientific
analysis; calling to his aid the statis
tics of trust promotion and trust man
agement, he is prepared to demon
strate the present status of the trust
problem on Its strictly practical side.
The theory of the trust as an out
growth of present day trade condi
tions. Its effect upon production and
labor â this occupies the first attention
of the author. The evils arising out of
combination, which are not Inherent
in its nature, but are the result of
improper conduct of biisiness; are
finally reviewed with a summary of
the legislative acts that have been di
rected against that form of organiza
tion. :.
That the tendency to combination
for the restraint of competition is a
natural outgrowth of highly organized
trade the author recognizes at the out
set. This tendency first manifested It
self in this country with the forma
tion cf the pools in the whisky and
oil interests. Then came the original
trust agreement of 1SS2 by which the
Standard OH first attempted to give
legal and binding obligation to the un
enforcible agreements of the pooL
With the declaration of the courts
against the legality of the earliest
form of trust came the combination
through "holding - corporations," at
present the seemingly unassailable
tenure of trust existence.
Now. therefore, we have combination
through this ""holding corporation," a
giant entity whose financial power Is
such that a purchase of the voting ma
jority of the frock of the several con
cerns combined brings complete control
over the respective boards of directors
and permits of a direction over tb"e gen
eral policy of all so rigid as to be prac
tically dictatorial. This is the modern
trust and this is the problem of the
trust as Montague states It:
"If the trust deserves to live the sav
ings of combination must be found. real
and legitimate; the first class of .evils
flowing from the mere fact of monop
oly must be proved either self-correc
tive or able to be corrected by statute;
the second class of evils, resulting from
the particular form assumed in the or
ganization of existing combinations,
must be sho.wn to be self -corrective â¢ or
capable cf correction by statute."
This first class of evils, inherent In
monopolistic organization per se. and
Trhich must be capable of correction If
the trust deserves a true economic
place In modern industrialism, includes
the temptation to raise prices, to obtain
secret discrimination- from railroads, Â¦ to
fix destructive prices for the crushing
of smaller rivals, to corrupt legislation
and to stultify individual initiative. To

on OtSaer- Books
* * â¢T" HE Mother of Pauline," by L.
I Parry Truscott^ is a carefully
* conceived and skillfully exe
cuted novel on a decidedly morbid sub
ject. It Is the story of a wc-man who
is forced to decide between a conven
tional marriage and the recognition of
her child/ born out of wedlock. Through
the unfortunate puritanlsm of her older
sister â cne of that self-sacrificing type
who would gladly climb a martyr's
pyre if enly the world might be there
to applaudâ Pauline i3 made to suffer
the keenest mental anguish and finally
to unite herself to the man of her
early love with the recognition of the
little daughter still held in abeyance.
How the unfortunate mother is forced
to cloak the love 'for her little one
under a semblance of charity until her
mother's Instinct breaks down all bar
riers of convention and she comes-forth
boldly with the truth before all, is the
substance of the greater part of the
noveL.
There is some good character delin
eation in Truscott's story, especially^
that of the pusillanimous doctor, and
the author has succeeded In catching
very aptly the narrow atmosphere of
austerity that surrounds the people of
his story. . The theme, however, seem
ingly so attractive to authors of the,
analyzing school, is not one to attract
the average reader, nor does the action
in the piece rise greatly beyond the
drone of the commonplace.

The trust's savings must be real and
legitimate if that form of combination
is to be justified economically, says
Montague. In the discussion of. what,
the savings, of combination are he
makes this Â«-trong point: Ecop<sr.VlÂ«*. : -:Ti
the marketing of product, resulting
from restricted competition, are sav
ings par c7C^-Â«ll?nce to be distinguished
from savings in the production of out
put resulting from concentrated capi
tal- Thus does Montague defend the
â¢trust.' in that It makes possible this
real increment of gain:
Â¦ "The rrevention of ruinous compsti
ticn and of industrial war, the saving
of enormous sums* which vain compe
tition among middlemen is fcverywbere
losing between producer and consumer,
the economy to the manufacturer - of
larg^ stale hr>rga.inin.T with nis banker,
v.ith his employes and with the pro
ducers of raw materials, and. finally,
the usual economies of production on a.
large scale â all .these ravings show the
new form of. business organization (the
trust) to be more economical and.con
sequently to be more efficient than the
old."
The control of output and of the mar
ket the author admits to be the great
est trust evil- By frightening out small
er competitors with a great show of
capital the trust naturally has the pow
er to fix its own price upon the com
modity controlled. But, says the writer:
"In the" persistence with which com
petition against a trust continues, in
the quickness irith which that competi
tion increases when opportunity, for
profit under unusual prices - appears,
and in the ever-present possibility of
competition which meets a trust at
every turn in its policy, lie the safe
guards against the abuse of this great
power." Â«
In detailing the part played by pro
moters and underwriters in -the forma
tion of the trust and the direction of Its
initial policy Montague follows lines
made. familiar by recent revelations in
the financing of the shipbuilding trust
and United States Steel. Overcapitali
zation and the floating of watered
stock, though It harms no one save the
shareholders in the trust, gives to that
form of combination a rapidly growing
element of actual fraud. The true basis
of capitalization should be the earning
power of the combination. "A proper
capitalization is that which so adjusts
the amount of securities to the earnings
as to make the stock sell for its face
value."
After reviewing to some length *he
history of anti-trust. legisl: lion, the au
thor closes his volur-e with a critical
resume of the practicability of the
many measures advanced for the con
trol of the monopolies. Constitutional
amendment, disturbing the present bal
ance between Federal and State com
mercial regulation in favor of the one
or the other, would. In the opinion of
the writer, but strengthen the organ
izations aimed at through the confusion
arising out of the matter of court ju
risdiction- . The enlargement of the
power of Congress over Interstate com
merce to the extent of putting a
quietus to the interstate traffic of
overcapitalised and dangerous mo
nopolies meets this question, "What la
overcapitalization, when is monopoly
proved, and where is interstate com
merce?"
"By enforcing publicity in Interstate
trading corporations," says Montague,
in his suggestion for remedial meas
ures, "assuming that the trusts are
deraonstrably engaged in * Interstate
commerce, the -whole evil arising from
the form of modern trust organization
might be corrected. By strengthening
the interstate commerce act to prevent
freight discrimination the whole evil
of practical monopoly might be correct
ed. These last two remedies. carry in
themselves the cure of most trust Ills."

BIg'esi of
ifoe Democratic
Platform
TARIFF â The Democratic party has been and
will continue to be the consistent opponent of
Jhat class of tariff legislation by which certain
Inleresu have been permitted, 'through Congres
sional favor, to draw a heavy tribute from the Amer
ican people.
We favor a revision and a gradual reduction of
the tariff by the friends of the masses and for the
commonweal, and not by the friends of its abuses,
its extortions and ita discriminations, keeping in view
the ultimate ends of "equality of burdens and equality
of opportunities" and the constitutional purpose of
raisins a revenue by taxation â to wit, the support of
the Federal Government in all Its Integrity and viril
ity, but in simplicity.
MONET â Parker telegram to W. F. Sheehan:
"I regard the gold standard as firmly and irre
vocably established, and shall act accordingly If the
action of the convention to-day shall be ratified by
the people. As the platform is silent on the subject,
my view should be made known to the convention
and, If It Is proved to be unsatisfactory to the ma
jority, I request you to decline the nomination for me
at once, so that another may be nominated before
adjournment."
Reply of convention: "The platform adopted by
this convention is silent on the question of the mon
etary standard because It Is not regarded by U3 as a
possible issue In this campaign, and only campaign
issues were mentioned in the platform. Therefore
there Is nothing In the views expressed by you in the
telegram just received which would preclude a man
entertaining- them from accepting a nomination on
said platform." ,
TRUSTSâ Any trust or unlawful combination en
gaged in interstate commerce which is monopolizing
any branch of business or production should not be
permitted to transact' business .outside of" the State
of Its origin. Whenever it shall be established in any
court of competent jurisdiction that, such' monopo
lization exists such prohibition should be enforced
through comprehensive laws to be enacted on V* the',
subject Â¦/,.".".- k - Â¦.* ' ".
NEGRO PROBLEMâ The race question has
brought countless woes to this country. The calm
wisdom of the American people should see to it that
It brings no more. . To revive the dead .andj hateful
race and sectional animosities in any part of our
common country means confusion, distraction of busi-.
nesa and the reopening of wounds, now happily healed.
THE PHILIPPINESâ We insist that we ought to
do for , the Filipinos what we have done already for
the Cubans/ and it is our duty to make that prom
ise now, and upon suitable guarantees of protection
to citizens of our own and other countries resident
there at the time of our withdrawal 'set .the' Filipino
people upon their feet, free and Independent to work
out their own destiny.
, "CAPITAL AND LABORâ We favor the enactment
and administration of laws giving labor and capital
impartially their just rights. Capital and labor ought
not to be enemies. Each. Is necessary to the other.'
Each has its. rights, but the. rights of labor are cer
tainly no less "vested," no less "sacred" and no less
"inalienable" than the rights of capital. Constjtu
tlonal guarantees are violated whenever any citizen
is denied the right to labor, acquire and enjoy prop- '
erty or reside where interests or inclination may de
termine. Any denial thereof by individuals, organ
izations or government should be summarily rebuked
and punished.
ISTHMIAN CANAL. â The Democracy, when In
trusted with power, will construct the Panama canal
speedily, honestly and economically, thereby giving to
our people what Democrats have always contended
for, a great interoceanic canal, furnishing shorter and
cheaper lines of transportation and broader and less
trammeled trade relations with the other peoples of
the world.
MERCHANT MARINEâ We denounce the ship
subsidy bill recently passed by the United States Sen
ate as an iniquitous appropriation of public funds for
private purposes and a wasteful, illogical. and useless
attempt to overcome by subsidy the obstructio.ns
raised by Republican legislation to the grow'th and
development of American commerce on the sea.
We favor t,he upbuilding of a merchant marine
without new or additional burdens upon the people
and without bounties from the public treasury.
EXECUTIVE USURPATIONâ We favor the nom
ination and, election of a President imbued with the
principles of the constitution, who will set his face
sternly against executive usurpation of legislative and
Judicial functions, whether that usurpation be veiled
under the guise of executive construction of existing
laws or whether it takes refuge in the tyrant's pleas
of necessity or superior wisdom.

capacity. Then â at that time he was
24 â the Queen made him her honorary
chaplain and sub-almoner. After the
lapse of another year he was appointed
Dean of Windsor and domestic chap
lain to the Queen. For nine years he
held these offices to the great satisfac
tion of the good old Queen, who made
him her confidant In . political and do
mestic as well as religious matters, and
poured all her troubles into his discreet
ears. To Mrs. Davidson, too. she be
came much attached, and often
dropped in to take tea with her at
Windsor. Of Dr. Davidson's gifts as a
preacher ehe had the highest opinion
and declared that a sermon he once
preached before her on "Life and
Death" was the most powerful she had
ever heard.
But the devout and kind-hearted
Queen came to the - conclusion that
such a shining light should not be de
voted bo exclusively to the illumination
of her own spiritual pathway, and in
1S91 Dr. Randall Davidson was made
Bishop of Rochester. At the same time
he was appointed her "clerk of the
closet." an office which corresponds to
that of father confessor in the Catholic
church. It was an Indication that in
his wider sphere the religious ties that
bound him to the sovereign were not to

LONDON, Sept. 1. â The wide pub
licity that has been given to the recent
rather severe accident to the Duchess
of Marlborough, due to a fall from her
horse at Blenheim, has not been at all
to her liking. In contrast to many
titled dames this plucky American girl
has a great aversion to posing as an
object of sympathy. Thrice before,
since her marriage, she has been laid
up by accidents that have happened to
her at Blenheim, but none knew of
these mishaps save her most intimate
friends, so strenuously did she object
to making herself an object of ftshlon
able sympathy. Once she slipped on
the stairs and in trying to save herself
from rolling headlong down the whole
flight she injured her arm so severely
that she was obliged to carry it in a
sling for three or four days. On an
other occasion she missed the carriage
step as she was dismounting and fell
on her hands and knees on the pave
ment In front of the castle door, hurt
ing herself severely. She afterward
had a bicycle "spill," which caused her
to confine herself to the house for a
week. ;â¢ _

BRITISH PUBLIC LOSES
ITS AWE OF ROYALTY
LONDON, Sept. S.â That royalty has
lost some of its sacredness to the Brit
ish since the accession of King Edward '.
to the throne is shown ay the absence
of crowds at 'points where it is known '
in advance the King or Â¦ Queen Is to
pass.'
It must surely be an agreeable
change for the Queen, who is now able
to Journey through the streets in her
royal carriage â¢ without the prospect of
an -~ eternal, bow. It Is not that the
public is less :loyal to the new Queen
than it was to the old, .but the feeling
of -".."sacredness" â¢â¢'-;â¢ wLich '. might 1 well '
hedge about the. late ; venerable " lady
who^ seldom Â¦ left' her castle and then
only; in * greatest state is difficult 'of
maintenance in the case of'a'Queen
Clares "thar Duchess ? to, - be/: one i of
who may fairly be said to gad about
upon errands of most amiable conde
scension.
Visitors to the Continent know well
that a - large measure of freedom from
the persecution of being run after and
stared at as curiositler, or even as "se
cred relics," has been obtained by the
Empress Augusta, Q-.een Elena, Queen
Wilhelmina and even the Czarina, and
the agreeable change that is coming
over the. manners and customs of the
British . public toward royalty can
scarcely fail to be cf interest to the
sociologist, ' ~~
But the most serious part of the
host's duties Is providing for the King's
amusement. Every day's diversions are
carefully planned beforehand so that
he may not have a dull moment on his
hands. He is fond of a ma tear theatri
cal Â¦entertainments. "Whatever may be
the day's programme, however, tha
night Invariably winds up with bridge,
which is often kept up untl Ithe "wee
sma' hours," when luck favors his
Majesty.
The King has gone to Marienbad "In
cog" as the Duke of Lancaster, by
which he avoids the fuss and ceremony
of which he no aoubt grows vÂ«ry
weary at home. His daily routine there
is in striking contrast to the round of
pleasures which are planned with so
much care and elaboration by those
whom he vi3its here. He rises about 7
o'clock, and in accordance with the
diet prescribed, which Is an essential
part of the cure, contents himself with
a light breakfast of rolls. Lunch is
taken early and Is of the simplest
description. The afternoon the Kins
devote3 to light exercise and is cften to
be seen on the golf links. He takes his
dinner early and it is as simple as the
royal luncheon. Only the lightest
-nines are allowed, Beion U o'clock ha
turns l9Â» ' â ' ""â*" """''^
MUST BE AMUSED.
Catering to the royal appetite Is no
light matter, for like all tie members
of hi3 family, he is a hearty eater asd
is particular as to what he eats. Either
the Kins himself or one of his suits
who is familiar with his tastes amends
th#- menu for the day, which includes
breakfast, luncheon, tea. dinner and
supper, besides Incidental refreshments.
The King's arrival at the house -which
he honors .with his presence Is usually
timed to take place about S o'clock in
the evening. Usually he retires imme
diately to the apartments reserved for
him and does not meet the rest of tha
house party until a few minutes be
fore the dinner hour. As a rule that
Is fixed at 9 o'clock, in accordance with
the custom obtaining at Buckingham
Palace and Windsor.
Through the private secretary. Lord
'Knollys. the King sends a list of the
guests whom he desires should be In
vited to help entertain him. Among
them may appear the name of some
one with whom the host, or more likely
the hostess, is at deadly enmity. It
makes no difference. Personal feeling
has to be set aside, pride swallowed
and the Invitation sent. The King's
wishes are interpreted as royal com
mands which must be obeyed at the
risk of incurring his displeasure. It is
only after the list of guests selected
by the King has been received that the
host and hostess venture humbly to
submit a list, of such friends of their
own as they would like to Invite. If
included in it are the names of any
person whom the King does not desire
to meet they are scratched out befora
the list is returned by his faithful sec
retary.
CHOOSES HOST'S GUESTS.
The King does not receive Invitations
to visit hi3 subjects. He in-vites him
self. Through Lord Farquhar. the con
troller of the King's household, the
person selected for this mark of royal
favor receives a notification that his
Majesty will be graciously pleased to
pay a visit at such and such a date and
remain so long. Then the excitement
begins. The house receives an over
hauling, compared with which an an
nual spring cleaning is a trifling mat
ter. Painters, polishers and paper
hangers are summoned. The suite set
apart for the royal guest must be re
furnished and redecorated throughout.
An absolutely new bed must be placed
in the royal bedchamber, for that di
vinity â¢which doth hedge about a King
forbids that he should slumber between
sheets where a less exalted personage
has reposed. If accommodation Is lim
ited, children and nurses are all packed
off. Servants are carefully inspected,
and only the best permitted to be la
evidence during the King's sojourn,
They are carefully trained in the nice
ties of court etiauette.
LONDON, Sept. 3.â High society
breathed a sigh of relief when the
King departed for Marienbad to under
go the cure at that popular Austrian
spa. The general feeling of satisfac
tion among the nabobs of the land is
due to the fact that for a season none
of them will be called to turn their
stately homes upside down to provide
entertainment and accommodation for
his Majesty and suite. Dispensing hos
pitality to the King involves sb much
expense that only the richest can af
ford it. and even they do not hanker
after a too frequent repetition of the
exalted honor.
LONDON.* Sept. 3. â By the time
these lines appear in pnnt the Arch
bishop of Canterbury and his 'Rife
will have arrived In the United State3
â an ever.t "which -will lend additional
interest to the accompanying 1 private

who, as Prince of Wales, made a tour
of America long years ago. ihÂ«Â»
Archbishop of Canterbury occupies
the most exalted rank of any Eng
lishman who has ever visited the
United Stales. The Archbishop of
Canterbury is the head of the Eng
lish church. He dominates the Bish
ops and the Bishops rule the clergy.
H:s BpirfrpaJ domain extends over
seas to the eolonies of the British em
pire. Of course, like all Bishops, he
ha? a seat in thÂ» House of Lords, with
ail the legislative provileges of a peer,
but in addition he is one of the King's
Lords of the Privy Council.
XO TITLE FOR HIS WIFE.
I:. Kr.glnr.<i v.ives usually share in
their hu-sbands' titles, but the wives
of church dignitaries do not. That is
why the better half of the Archbishop
of Canterbury is plain Mrs. Randall
Davidson.
Adde from the fact that he was
born in Scotland whence come so
many men who get to the top in
English public life, there was nothing
In R&ndall Davidson's youth that pre
saged for him an exceptionally bril
liant career. As a lad he was more
devoted to his rod and gun than to his
studies. When he was sixteen the
accidental firing of a gun lodged a
charge of shot in the base of his spine,
and he has never known what good
health is since. He is periodically
threatened with peritonitis and for
months, sometimes for a whole year,
has had to subsist on xnilk foods. So
::;ose who have made elaborate prepa
rations to feast and entertain him in
America are likely to find their culi
nary triumphs wasted on him. As
regards diet his habits are much more
iv accord with John D. Rockefeller's
than with those of J. Plerpont Mor
gran. who, it has been stated here, will
be the Archbishop's host In the United
States.
A man less conscientiously deter
mined to make the best of himself
would have found in the burden of
physical weakness and suffering laid
upon him suScient cause for taking
life easy, for which many snug billets
in jhe Church of England aSord ample
opportunity.
DLL HEALTH AT OXFORD.
At Oxford ill health interfered so
' seriously with the Archbishop's studies
that he obtained only a mere pass de
' pree, whereas his predecessor in the
Prinacy. Dr. Temple, carried off
double first-class honors. However, a
piece cf rare good fortune, as It ap
' reared in the light of subsequent
events, befell Dr. Davidson at Oxford.
He won t&Â» friendship of Crawford
Ta::, nn of Archbishop Tait. But
for this, It is curious to speculate,
Randall Davidson might be only a
country parson, for he makes no pre
tensions to that profound scholarship
and mastery of theology by which
clerics who are dependent on their
cwn exertions usually rise to eminence
in the sen-ice of the church-
Through Tait another pathway to
distinction was opened to him. He
became intimate with the Archbishop
Bad the rest of his family and made
o good an impression that, after he
had served three years as a curate he
was, appointed the Archbishop's do
mestic chaplain and private secretary
and - Installed at Lambeth Palace.
Davidson was twenty-nine then and a
>>ar Jater he married the Archbishop's
m â¢ ond daughter. Edith- As his father
in-law the Archbishop took a still
fct-ener interest in his protege and ln
?duced him to royalty. In that
harmed circle his sua%*ity, polish and
piety, which was characterized by
serenity rather than austerity, again
; Â£e a favorable impression, and

Vest's Telling Point.
Among the reminiscences of the late
Senator Vest is one by Hunter Ben
Jenkins, the steamboat man, concern
ing the trial of a murder case at Lex- (
ington. Mo., which occurred before the
war. A man named Smith, living at
Independence, Mo., had given himself
â¢up to the authorities for killing a man
named Foster at Kansas City. Smith
was a friend of the late Senator and
the latter, being cognizant of the con
ditions under which the murder oc
curred, offered to defend him.
The prosecution was "conducted by
Messrs. Comings and Sawyer, assisted
by Colonel Aaron Connor, who was
afterward in the Confederate Congress.
In the case Mr. Vest discredited the
statements of one of the witnesses. The
witness was an unkempt, poorly
dressed individual, who wore a long,
ill-fitting jacket. Colonel Connor In
his speech tried to make it appear to

to know^r.hat I do at Belle Isle. I rest.
I rest by giving myself extra fatigue.
You know that the life I lead in Paris
is; rather of a paradoxical sort. Still,
one must occasionally breathe. The
same fate which made me the servant
of an art in which only brain and heart,
sensibility and intelligence, are active,
also gave me a taste, a want, a furious
passion for physical motion. How do I
conciliate these contradictions? I am
sure I don't know, but I go to Belle
Isle. I see you smile. How can a
microscopic place like Belle Isle give
scope for my insatiable nature? Well,
Belle Isle certainly is microscopic, but
It is wild and it is Immense, because
Belle Isle is one of the outposts of
the Old World, . a bit of Europe
plunged in ths ocean. Because the
infinite ocean hurls its furious green
waves against the black rocks of Belli*
Isle and beyond, at the other end of
the ocean. I imagine America and fresh

Isle. For Its solitude, its silence, its
wlldness, its fisherfolk, its trans

Good Sense.
In reply to a certain temperance so
ciety of 'Connecticut, which protested
against the breaking of the traditional
bottle of wine over the bows of the
battleship Connecticut, soon to be
launched. Acting Secretary of the Navy
Darling recently sent # the following
eminently sane and/wholesome reply:
"I am in receipt of your communica
tion of August 12. 1904, forwarding sev
eral petitions of the United Society of
Christian Endeavor, requesting that the
use of wine be dispensed with as a
part of the ceremony of launching the
battleship Connecticut, on the ground
that 'the use of wine in the ceremony
la a practice misleading to the young,
questionable to others and offensive to
many.' "
"I have great respect for your cause
and your organization, comprising 46.
000 societies and three million members
in the United States, but in this par
ticular case, as a practical question,
1 am unable to reach your conclusions.
If the youth of the country are mis
led, it is not by the ceremony cf break
ing wine upon the iron prow of a bat
tleship, but because they follow false
prophets, and if such a use of wine is
'questionable to others and offensive to
many,' it Is because of 'evil to him who
evil thinks."
! "It is inconceivable that the breaking
of a bottle of wine upon the Connecti
cut can injure her as a battleship or
work the slightest injury to any man,
and as an example. It seems to me that
the cause of temperance would be bet
ter served if more of the world's prod
uct of wines were spilled overboard to
wash the hulls of battleships.
"Finally, permit me to suggest that
you and the 3,000.000 people you repre
sent ought to find comfort in the
thought that wine thus expended can
neither Imperil the soul nor contribute
to the cup of human sorrow.**

There Is an empire on this planet

Madame Fannie Francisca in her
song recitals of this month include
some notable novelties. Arias from

"Zaza." and the Leoncavallo "Manon"

arias in five tongues. There seems to

PIANIST AND SINGER
MAX HEINRICH ALSO
HAS CREATIVE SKTLLi
On Friday afternoon Max Heinrich
gave an afternoon of music at Lyric
Hall. The afternoon was devoted ex
clusively to the compositions of Mr.
Heinrich, who to his gifts as singer
and pianist adds an important creative
faculty. The programme included the
melodramatic music to "The Raven,"
and to "Magdaiena, or the Spanish
Duel." with Mr. Heinrich reciting the
poem%. The composer was assisted by
Miss Julia Heinrich, both as singer and
pianist, by Miss Dora de Fillippe and
by Hother Wismer. violinist.
And, by the way, besides (her excep
tional gifts as a soubrette, that she is
developing at a remarkable rate. Miss
de Fillippe is an accomplished lieder
singer. Grieg. Franz, Schumann and
other masters of lieder I have heard
delightfully interpreted by this clever
little artist. Mr. Heinrich was fortun
ate in her co-operation.
And, again by the way, what a curi
ous career the little singer's has been.
When I said "soubrette" to her In my
chat for these columns, not so many
months ago, the little lady was deli
cately but evidently shocked. She came
here with all the weight of a Santuzza
upon her small shoulders and with
tragic grand opera written all over her
aspirations. But came one soubrette
part after another for her, cleverly
chosen by that clever stage manager,
Ferris Hartman. Always vivacious, at
first Miss de Fillippe was a little hys
terical, restless, unconcentrated in her
efforts, but always most signally des
tined for comedy. To-day she prom
ises to- be one of the first of her class.
Chic, wit, grace, and the most active
of consciences, as well as her excep
tional vocal qualifications, make Miss
de Fillippe perhaps the most attractive
soubrette the Tivoli has had.
Talking of Tivoll matters, the latest
surprise is the engagement of Andrew
Bogart, who appears next week in
"The Serenade." I know nothing of
Mr. Bogart's dramatic gifts, but know
him as a singer of unusual charm. It is
the highest, most tasteful, most pol
ished sort of art and should serve ex
cellently in "The Serenade." The en
gagement has aroused a wide local in
terest.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The Orpheum â talking of the Tivoli
â is rapidly entering into competition
with that ancient institution as a
musical missionary. Following up
the. Helnrichs' engagement of last
week â that followed the Russo-Deck
er-Abramoff engagement â that fol
lowed any number of others, including
the only Slapoffsky's; comes the Men
delssohn quartet tbis . week. For
vaudeville purposes the combination
is called the "Great Singing Four."
The four hail from Denver, . Colorado.
Their names at home are H. D. Mar
tin, first tenor: Robert Slack, second
tenor; R. V. Brown, first bass, and C.
D. Schmldlap, second bass. As to
their entertainment it is Improbable
that they will give "The Old Oaken
Bucket" or the steamboat whistle:
their programme taking the form of
a sketch. "New Year's Eve In Bohe
mia," composed of songs and dialogue
in equal doses, , If the quartet equals
its reputation it should be very much
worth hearing.
Another October attraction, irapa-
Sousa and his band will be at the
Alhambra .Theater for twelve concerts
during the latter part of October. The
band will be accompanied, as usual,
by soloists of excellence. ;Â«*
After ten years' absence Kyrle Bel

with "Raffles, the Amateur Cracks
man," a cornedj'-melodrama by E. W.
Hornung and Eugene Presbrey, that
was one of the substantial successes
of the last New York season. â¢ The play
Is of exceptionally wide appeal, the
adventures of the brilliant society thief
furnishing as attractive material as
those of the brilliant detective, "Sher
lock Holmes." Mr. Bellew is said to be
most admirably placed as Raffles, and
E. M. Holland's impersonation of the
detective, Captain Bedford, is only sec
ond in interest. The inevitable love
story is present and claimed to be
charming, but the chief interest of the
plot lies in the very exciting adven
tures of Mr. Raffles.
As Raffles is rich, attractive In every
way, yet given to purloining even his
own guests' belongings, the question as
to what class he belongs to â the klepto
maniacs or otherwise^ â furnishes those
given that way with agreeable food for
speculation.
Mr. Bellew's support is the same in
all essentials as that which helped him
play "Raffl^" 200 times at the Princess
and Savoy Ttheaters. New York, last
year. Clara Blandick, Beverley Sit
greaves, Olive Wyndham. Mignon Ber

gence of her Candida, with the addi

CHILDREN'S THEATER
TO BE OPENED THIS
WINTER IN NEW YORK
there are a Keith andâ family modesty
precludes other mention â in our midst.
"Have vou ever exhibited?" I in
quired.
"Only once, in St. Loui3," Mr. Bos
worth replied. "I did it then to help
an Impecunious dealer along. But I
have strong ideas on amateurism of
any sort. It hurts our own art abom
inably."
"But your exhibition helped the
dealer?"
"It did." the artist claimed. "I was
something of a matinee favorite in St.
Louis ar.d the girls came up nobly."
My "Ah!" was long and happy. Here,
at last, was a bit of the Bosworth I
came out for.
"Ah!" said I. Then, too vaguely for
report, I managed to suggest the ques
tion whether or not Mr. Bosworth's
physical charms had anything to do
with the case?
He coolly argued that It had almost
everything In the following refreshing
fashion: "Oh, I know my value as a
physical specimen. I've been getting
money on it for years Tcu â you must
not think because I played Judas that
I think I know it all. Not by a jugful.
Eut a good physique is perhaps more
useful to you on the stage than any
where e'.se. And I've had one."
" "Had' one?"
"I used to be a consumptive." the
actor amazed me with then. "I got
down to 123 pcunds â I'm 210 now â and
there didn't seem to be any chance for
roe: in fact I've read my own obituary
three times and gone twice to the front
door to take flowers intended for my
own funeral. You couldn't get much
nearer than that."
"And how did youâ?" I stammered.
"How did I escape?" gossiped Mr.
Bosworth. "Well. I didn't care about
the thing particularly either way. That
eliminated the wcrry element. Then I
took plenty, but not too much, fresh
air. And I forced myself to eat enough
and good fcod. didn't work too hard
and compelled myself to think only
healthful thoughts."
"Something of a Christian science ar
rangement?"
"Yes â no. though, for I still have
some little logic left," the actor put it.
"But you said you had 'bad' health.
It is Impossible that now â "
"A few weeks ago only." said the
man in front of me. with his clear,
quiet blue eyes, as calm as a summer
lake. "I fell from the roof of my house
in Canada â I've a place there on Rice
Lake. Ontario â fell en my shoulder. A
severe hemorrhage followed. You can
understand what that meant to a for
mer consumptive. Still I believe it is
only some old Jung scars that bled. But
you can understand that I'm not In
quite such good form as usuaL"
And I knew my beauty man for a
brave man then. All this was much
more casuallv told than I have told it.
It was. by the way. "on the side." hints
dropped here and there in the corners
of the interview.
We got somehow after this to chat
of the actor's deliriously incongruous
Mexican history.
'In Salt Lake City," he recounted,
"I got stuck while with Mrs. D. P.
Bowers" company." He laughed a little
then â he is not given to it â as he added,
"that was when I went with Herrmann
to Mexico."
""What Hermann â ?"
"Herrmann the Great." smiled the
actor. "I was his assistant. I did the
tricks and he got the glory, that is. I
usedâ this is funnyâ to go through the
markets in New Orleans with a silk
hat full of ducks and a rubber belt
full of eggs for Herrmann to do tricks
with to advertise the show. Degrading
rot. but it got me to New York and
Augustin Daly."
It is good to hear Mr. Bosworth
speak of Daly. All he knows he as
cribes to Dalyâ and Mrs. Fiske.
"You were long with Daly?" I asked.
"Ten years," the actor answered,
"and in almost everything they did.
AH small parts, you must understand,
such as the sea captain in 'Twelfth
Night.' Charles the Wrestlerâ that was
my first. What do you think Dab
asked me when I went to him?"
"What?' I asked.
"Not what parts I'd played, but what
else I'd done, what I liked to do, who
were my people. When I told him my
father was a gentleman â that is, that
he'd never been in jail or politics â
that I'd been a sailor, a wrestler, a jug
gler, he said 'Come right along; you'll
do.' And I think I was considered
quite reliable for all their smaller
parts. And how Daly knew where to
put one. His judgment was infallible,
I think. It is rather the fashion to
decry him now, but Daly Is the door
through which all the new life of the
theater has had to pass. He Is the
biggest figure so far In the American
dramaâ he and Mrs. Fiske. And Daly
was bigger, inasmuch as his view of
thingsâ from his cot acting himselfâ
was more detached. See page of
my paper on Daly." the actor added
with a laush.
"You write, too?" I queried.
"A little." said the sallor-wrestler-
Juggler-actor-artist-scrtbe! "I'm just
waiting for an article of mine on Daly
to come out in Pearson's."
"Now," I ventured. "I know you
want to talk about Judas "
"Indeed. I do want to talk about
Judas." said Mr. Bosworth, leaning
forward to it. "That was absolutely
Mrs. Fiske's fault."
"The conception?"
"Not at all. but my being in the part."
There was much more feeling In the
actor's cool voice here than at any
time during the interview. "I didn't^
want to play it. I played Flavius in
New York, where the 'brutal brawn of
me did good service. But I had such
absolute faifhâ have still almost as
muchâ in Mrs. Fiske's judgment, that
I undertook it. You saw the resultâ
a great mistake."
The pause here was not wholly pleas
ant.
"Then again with Lovborg," he re
sumed. "Any one less like a Lovborg
that I amâ could you find anywhere?
Ibsen describes him exactly â pale, hec
tic, slim, so on. I Implored Mrs. Fiske
to let me play him with a beard, as
a character part. I am a character ac
tor. But she wanted the Lovborg of
the fieshpots "
"And there's a good deal to be said
for that Lovborg," I inserted.
"But surely Lovborg has more wit
than beef?** Mr. Bosworth protested,
â¢â¢and I have more beef that wit."

. When I came to I found that Mr.
Bosworth was talking about first
right nervousness. I'm sure I don't
know wry. n ne might sensibly waste
t;rrÂ«!Â» rv:th a DÂ«sJy over such things,
f.nd Ehaws, I thought, but heavens,
why squander an Adonis upon them?
But he was at them and I noticed,
touched, that the bis fellow was a
bit breathless â indeed evidently nerv
ous. I remembered then that he
talgbt be recalling the San Francisco
critics on his Judas, their irnperti
r.ence concerning his Lovborg. as if
Bach things really mattered to a Hy
perion.
However, seriously as if it were of
Fen-ir." cor.seiuence, Mr. Bosworth
â¢was explaining that the whole com
pany "was unusually nervous on the
preceding evening â its opening right;
cf how, with some people, first nights
made r.o difference; of how again.
t. ith the Mrs. Fiske type, they were
'three-hour infernos: of how yet an
other " type, the mechanical actors â
'instancies Amelia Bingham and Leo
Dietriehstein â get a certain emotional
excitement on such occasions that
Jr.akes them play incalculably better
tha.n at any other time; and of how
he. himself, not being of the order of
Â£ctor that Treasures its steps, goes to
pieces.
As Mr. Bcswcrth's bookish, conscious
English. sti'.I jtc^th its appealing little
catch in the breath, rolled out. I began
to be afraid. Again I had missed the
beauty man. He wasn't it. I felt In

3rnpcsrib>: And they had.
Concealing my disappointment as
b<?st I might I turned a respectful ear
then to some of the earlier Bosworth
history. The actor used years ago to
be at the o'.d California, when he was
a small bey and Lewis Morrison a star.
He ran away from home at 12 years
r'.i to eo to sea. Three years of that
he had ard then came to San Francisco

"Then when you people here got me
in a part suited to me," the actor re
sumed, still most comically modest,
"why, 5'ou didn't think I was so objec
tionable."
"What would you really like to
play?" I asked.
"In 'Hedda Gabler*â oh. Brack!" said

Snobs? Are such birds indigenous
to this land of the free?
A*' e ' .good friend, and there are
Three 5p?ries of the bird, a few spec
imens of which thrive famously in the
.â¢.'an Francisco smart set â the money
tnob. the "old family" snob and the
"clever" snob, the latter class divid
ed into the artist snob and the liter
ary snob.
Now, of these the money snob is
jerhaps the most common variety.
and unquestionably the most mad
dening. Next comes the "family"
pnob. who tries to market his small
personality at the price of his prede
cessors. And then comes the artist
rnob, together with his literary con
frere, they who have, perhaps, the
be5t excuse for their sin, because of
their own endeavor and their mental
development, and since the only aris
tocracy worthy of recognition is a
Ijrain aristocracy. But may the good
Lord deliver us from all, amen!
The latest phase of snobbery In our
Western burg is manifested in a local
dub, the personnel of which is ,sup
l>osedly clever women, women who
can do things â sing, play, write and
road. .
For a time the club thrived admir
ably. Then up spoke Miss Moneysnob
whenever a new member was proposed
with the condemnatory remark that
" Really, they haven't anything.
They're not in our set." Then along
<omer Miss Oldfamily. "Who are
They? Who was her grandfather.*
While they may be nice people, really,
they don't belong" â and the singers
or the instrumentalists don't get in,
rust because they made a bad choice
"l grand father.
The artist snob is partially under
; tandable, but no less unendurable. He
Vas conceived a fine contempt for con
, eruional things â for money, for ra
Â«ional conduct and for the opinions of
cienâ all of which is as reprehensible
fcÂ£ the sin of his confreres."
And. by the way, this snobbery is
largely propagated in our public high
school?, where frats and sororities
abound; in the universities, where the
associations exist, but to a lesser
degree; and in the so-called finishing
schools for girls, where money, dress
and family form the measure of popu
larity, and. where character, cleverness
and personal charm count for but little.
And at the bottom of it all lies the
maudlin mistakes of mothers, whose
<icar desire for social triumphs for their
daughters has poisoned their young
hearts and tainted their soulsâ and
wearied the world with their snobbery
âwhich distinctly holds no place in
American civilization.

Reports were received that advance
information on the crop's condition as

The veteran Odd Fellows, those who
have been in the order for more than
twenty-five years, will be a special fea
ture in the grand parade. While many
of them are gray-haired and are in the
sere and yellow leaf of life, they pro
pose to walk the entire line of march
in token of" their appreciation of the or
der in which they have so long held
membership.
Sacramento County will send a com
mittee of prominent Odd "Fellows, in
company of Governor Pardee. to the
State line to welcome the grand sire
and his officers upon reaching the State.
John B. Good^win, grand sire of the
Sovereign Grand Lodge, a resident of
Atlanta, Ga., will arrive in this city,
accompanied by the other high officers,
on Saturday, September 17, and they
will be escorted to their respective
hotels by the cantons of San Francisco,
Patriarchs Militant and a band of mu
sic. They will also be met by the of
ficers of the reception committee and
the grand officers of the State.
The committee on entertainment has
secured a chorus of 200 voices to aid in
the musical programme that has been
prepared for the Sovereign Lodge week
in the Mechanics' Pavilion. This, in ad
dition to the literary programme, will
be decided upon this week.
The anniversary of the Rebekah
branch of the order, which falls during
Sovereign Grand Lodge week, will be
entirely in the hands of the Rebekahs,
who on that day will provide entertain
ment for the visitors, as well as for the
members of the order In this city. A
fine programme will be presented.

j matter of the reception by the general
j committee of the 33,000 Odd Fellows of

j Sovereign Grand Lodge and the thou
j sands of visiting Odd Fellows from the
I East and Canada who will be in this
j city during the week commencing Sep
j tc-mber 23.
The decoration committee has com
i pleted all arrangements for the main
] tenance of the street electrical display
i and that in the Mechanics' Pavilion
â¢ that has been established by the
; Knights Templar. In addition it has
\ decided upon the idea of decoration
j that will be used in Native Sons' Hall,
i where the sessions of the sovereign
| body will be held. The idea is purely
; Californian, the features of the make
! up being native trees, vines, ferns and
â¢ fresh flowers every day, added to ar
; tistlc blending of the colors of the or
j der in graceful festoons mingled with
j American flags, escutcheons, bannerets
' bearing symbols of Odd Fellowship,
I the royal purple of the Encampment
i and the nile green and pink of the Re
j bekah branch.
Up to date Grand Marshal General E.
J H. Black has, with the assistance of
j the chairman of the parade committee,
j arranged for sixteen divisions for the
; parade, with a prospect of Increase to
I eighteen. Every county in the State
! will be represented in a large or Emall
; er degree. Santa Clara County wants a
| division, as it will have its own band
I and a float, also a conveyance bearing
j the children of the orphans' home at
j Gilroy. Santa Clara County will have
: a representation of more than 750 peo-
J pie. San Mateo County has asked for a
j division for 300 members of the. order,
i Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Sono
j ma, Sacramento, Yolo. Los- Angeles.
i San Diego and many other counties
; have given assurance of fine repre
\ sentatlons in line and have asked for
j place. The parade committee has taken
every request under consideration and
expects to make arrangements so that
every one will be satisfied with the po
sition assigned in what will be the
grandest parade the Odd Fellows have
ever arranged for in this State and
which will take place on Friday, Sep
tember 23. In order to stimulate gen
erous rivalry the parade committee has
offered prizes to be awarded to the
lodge making the greatest numerical
showing in line and for the most hand
some float.

slaves and destined to iead an immoral
life In this country-
Imrclgratlon Commissioner Hart
North sent the papers to Washington
and in due course of time received
instructions to deport the four women
and to allow the remainder of the
party to proceed to St. Louis. North
has been subjected to considerable ad
verse criticism because he did not
recommend the denial of the eight
women remaining. It is urged that
If four of them are slaves It would
be logical to conclude, in view of th*
Chinese character, that the eight oth
ers are slaves also. To use the words
of a distinguished navigator, 'if they
were all boiled in the same pot they
would all come out alike."
The four slaves are in care of the
women at the Methodist Mission,
awaiting deportation or whatever legal
proceedings may be instituted in their
behalf by their ojvners. The sworn

ARRANGEMENTS COMPLETED.
The details of what the parlors of
Oakland, assisted by those of Alameda
County, are doing in the matter of pro
cession, literary exercises and enter
tainments has from time to time been
described, but what they are doing will
be added to by the Native Son parlors
of San Franjcisco. The twenty-three
subordinates of the organization will
swell the numerical strength of the
procession in Oakland, and together
with the Native Daughters of the Gold
en West, many of those local parlors
having expressed a determination to
take part in the parade, will do much
to make the day one of pleasant memo
ries.
The celebration of Admission day by
the Native Sons of the Golden "West
will be in the city of Oakland jhis year.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
events connected with the conclave of
the Knights Templar will occupy con
siderable attention on the 9th, the Na
tives propose to have as attractive an
observance of the anniversary of the
birth of the Golden State as has ever
been had in any city outside of San
Francisco.

THK Oakland bond campaign should need no further argument
than the admirable statement of John L. Howard, a member of
the City Council and chairman of the committee which has
wrought out the bond proposition by long deliberation. It is con
spicuous io? h> frankness and fairness of spirit, and its true
business ring. It girds at no one. goads no one to opposition, but
states with foj>ce a business proposition and a great opportunity. Too
much cannot be said of the good fortune of Oakland in having in the
Council a business man of talent and integrity like Mr. Howard.
When he leads ihe city can afford to follow.
It is every day apparent that the community in California which
neglects to secure proper and impressive public buildings, good and
clean strcet>. beautiful parks and pleasant drives and boulevards
must drop out of the procession. By contrast with towns having
such adornments, a California city that has them not appears dirtier
and more dismal and repulsive here than anywhere else. Oakland
has every possible natural advantage and some that are peculiar to
her and impossible to any other city on the coast, such as Lake
Merritt for a water park and the proximity of a possible foothill
park x- Â¦ i â¢ ' ,. t ,-- : a5; ';C
Not to improve such advantages is to deliberately stick her head
in the mud and die. smothered -and nasty. Men like Mr. Howard
and Mayor Oluey cannot always be secured in the officiary of a city,
and if the opportunity they have brought within reach is not seized
by carrying the bonds no one can tell whether it will ever come
again under auspices as favorable. Among the purposes of the bond
issue is the needed dredging of Lake Merritt to a uniform depth, the
material taken out being required as the foundation of a small paik,
immediately south of the Twelfth-street dam.
When that is done and the shores of the lake arc paiked. and
boats of greater draught can ply upon the water, the guests of Oak
land on public occasions and the tourists attracted by the beauties
the bonds will provide can enjoy the pleasure of a boat ride on that
beautiful sheet of water. Xo other city can have such an attraction.

SAX FRAN'CISCO is the glad host of the Knights Templar in
their grand conclave. From every State in the Union and
from far countries the members of the order have come to
adjust their relations, transact their business and meet in social
enjoyment, and to renew old friendships and strengthen their
fraternal bonds.
Their traditions go far back to the crusades and to the incidents
of that great movenitnt. which changed the affairs of Europe,
cemented the bonds of Christianity, spread abroad a spirit of brother
hood and engendered the confidence in the arm and power of the
individual, which led forward to freedom for man. One needs to
comprehend the lethargy which preceded the spirit-stirring call of
Peter the Hermit to appreciate thoroughly the awakening that fol
lowed the union of nations in the unselfish sacrifice required in an
attempt to get possession for Christendom of the Holy Sopulcner.
The lethargy which had been upon the Christian world and
had retarded individual and national progress had its cause in
the general and profound and pious belief in the millennium.
Christendom had been taught at its altars that the thousandth year
of the Christian era would see the end of the world. The weight j
of this incubus increased with each generation and the gloom grew
more profound as the fatal date drew near. It was impossible for
man to rise and go forward in the certain prospect that on a fixed
date the solid earth which was his home, and* the sun that gave it
light and heat and life, and the sky arched above it, all would
disappear and only space and darkness remain. Not even the
promise of life to come in a spiritual world transcending the
physical universe could raise the spirit of the pious believer. Human j
nature, clinging to the tangible of which man was a part, was
stronger than spiritual aspiration.
But the day of doom came, and the world stood, the sun rose
in the morning and the distant stars twinkled at night, and the
earth gave its fruits, and the spirit of man put off sackcloth and
put aside its fear. , The human race acquired confidence in the
dignity of man and^ Christianity took on a new aspect, and within
a hundred years came to be studied in the light of its ethics and
its mercies and its leading to Tightness of life here in the midst of
the visible and the tangible. Then the hearts of men were ihrilled by
lo\e. instead of being crushed by fear, and men werejnoved by great
and unselfish zeal to rescue the Holy Sepulcher and put Christendom
in possession of the affluent fountain of its mighty and merciful
purpose. â¢>.
The crusades filled Europe with the Templars and the Palmers
and banded them into fraternities. They caused a higher value to
be put upon character and conduct, and their final effect was to
compel respect for human reason, for the right of private judgment
and to enfranchise man a< a citizen of the spiritual republic, with
the right to spiritually approach his Creator without an inter
mediary if he chose to have it so.
The Knights Templar, to their own satisfaction, represent these
final effects of the crusades. In forms and ritual they preserve the
traditions of that distant and heroic age. adapting them to the
enlightenment that has come since the" incubus of the millennium
was lifted. They come to us the representatives of character and
fraternity. We welcome them in the midst of spectacular and
decorative effects, intended as a fit setting for the pageantry which
is the external expression of the traditions of which they are the
keepers.
Pageantry has always deeply influenced man. It is properly
used to move him in the formation and execution of high purposes,
and may be a factor in personal reform by suggesting a high ideal
which becomes a leading and' a light. Government* have averted
disaster by pageantry and the most venerable religious bodies have
always used it to impress man; by ritual andjprrn* Xo matter what
one's views of splendid display may be there are few who are not
thrilled and moved and for a time taken above themselves by
pageantry. Its use by our guests is to inspire ideals and to dignify
the sentiment of fraternity.:
. They are with ;:s in thousands â they are welcome. The spirit
of hospitality warms every heart and Hushes every face in Cali
fornia. \\ biltr il't-y stay oil we have is theirs. The members of
their order who arc fellow citizens add to the virtues of the
Templar the exalted quality of dwellers in a State where the
grass roots in gold, the vineyards purple in the sun and nature
wears unfading; garlands. They are the particular hosts, but every
one of us is a host of this great throng, whose members are of a
world-belting fraternity, in which brotherly love survives war,
pestilence and ambition. '

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALU
HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON, Aug. 20.âTo
teach Irishmen to farm on Ameri
can lines Is the object of an Inter
esting scheme recently conceived by
Sir Horace Plunkett. Sir Horace
is vice president of the Irish Board
of Agriculture, but he is best
known in the United States as the
owner of large ranches in Dakota,
Wyoming and Montana. An agent of
his named Blair is novr In the United
States for the purpose of inducing
young Irishmen now in American cities
to go on Sir Horace's ranches and
get an insight into the system he em
ploys there, in the hope that they may
be induced later on to return to Ire
land and become practical agricultur
ists in their Â«o\vn country. He will also
send out direct a number of young
men from Ireland next month. He will
pay their passages, and from the mo
ment they commence work on the
ranches they will receive wages equiv
alent to what unskilled labor would
command in any city or town In the
United States. Sir Horace has com
menced to recognize the evils of emi
gration as it affects Ireland, and he is
prepared to make big sacrifices to com
bat them. It is estimated that this
experiment of his will* cost him at least
$30,000. The Irish Board of Agriculture,
of which he is practically the head, has
nothing to do with this scheme. It is
purely an idea of his own. He has re
cently taken much interest In the work
of the Anti-Emigration Society, and h<*
has succeeded in finding employment at
home for quite a number of young men
and women whose passages had been
paid to the United States. Under his
regime at the Board of Agriculture
fruit growing, improvement in forestry
and the peat industry are opening up
fresh avenues of employment.

UNCLE SAM : "THE COUNTRY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU."
22REV. GEO. C. ADAMS.
It is a part of the nature of things:
rot a matter of legislation, but a "hu
man necessity. Just as surely as a
dock is made to run a certain num
ber of days and then stop unless
Â¦wound up, so surely the human sys
tem is constructed to do good v. - ork,
and last its allotted number of years,
provided it is given one seventh of
the time for recuperation, and the per
sistent violation of that law , means
physical, mental and spiritual" deteri
oration. It is unfortunate that a large
part cf the people have got the im
pression that the Sabbath is man's
invention, and that those who had the
power have made laws for its- ob
servants that did not take into ac
count the difference in tastes, in con
-stcience and in training; it is true that
in some places such lav.s are or have
been on the statute books, but they
were there because some had recog
nized an inexorable law, and had per
haps not stopped to see that not all
had learned what they had. We are
learning, sometimes by bitter experi
ence, that men cannot be legislated
into morality. When the French -' --
6embly undertook to rearrange all the
s flairs of government they yielded to
iheir spirit of hatred to the clergy and
the church so far as to include in it
everything religious, and among other
reformatory acts so called they abol
ished the Sabbath. They made a new
arrangement of time, and realizing
that man must have some rest* and
change, they appointed each tenth
day as a day of rest and festivity.
This stood for a time, but not long;
the human need was too great, and
TKIRTY-FIVE years ago Presi
dent Clark of the Massachu
setts Agricultural College was
earnestly importuned to lake
charge of the educational system of
Japan, then just beginning the course
of study and improvement that has
made her the formidable figh'er she
Is to-day. He replied that his duties
to his college were such that hÂ«Â» could
not accept the offered position. The
call was repeated with such earnest
ness that Dr. Clark finally consented
to go over and teach for one year. In
preparation for it he sent the Mikado
a sketch of work for the days of the
rreek, such as he thought would make
the best use of the time. He was
aware that Japan had no such idea
of a day of rest as that to which he
had been trained, and was puzzled for
a little as to how he should indicate
it; he finally made out the schedule
of duties for the different days, and
when he came to Sunday he left it
blank; it was sent for inspection, and
in due time came' back with the Mi
kado's approval, and in the blank
fj.ace after Sunday he had written
the word 'â¢Rest." Whether it was an
act of courtesy to the man whose
services he desired, or a recognition
of the fact that the so-called Chris
tian nations have a principle repre
sented In the Sabbath that is an ele
ment of strength, the Mikado stated
a great fact and cave his sanction to
it? acceptance as a part of the teach
ers' schedule. * Â¦ ,
That the t Sabbath rightly appre
ciated is a help to public order is
shown by the consequences of its
abolition. Those who have a con
science with regard to it are liable
to have one in all other matters. When
the French Assembly had" taken the
step mentioned above Zachary Ma
caulay, the father of the famous es
sayist, had with infinite labor planted
a colony on the coast of Africa; it
was prosperous, orderly and the peo
ple were happy and contented. One
day a French frigate appeared in the
cfiinjy: the officers and men came
ashore and began carousing about the
town and tearing things to pieces;
Mr. Macaulay remonstrated with the
officers and reminded them that it was
a Sabbath; the officers exclaimed:
"Don't you know that the Assembly
has abolished the Sabbath?" and they
tore his town to pieces. Xo matter
how strict or how apparently dog
matic they may be who ( keep the Sab
bath, it is generally conceded that if
they are conscientious about it they
are honest ;ind sincere in other mat
ters. It has a definite influence on
the whole life. When William E.
Dodge was talking in the board of di
rectors of one of the Eastern rail
roads and they were arguing the ques
tion of Sunday trajfic he said: "Gen
tlemen, if you compel your employes
to break the fourth commandant they
shortly they came back to the old ar
rangement and replaced the Sabbath
in the calendar.
There is another side to man's na
ture, a higher faculty, that often gets
neglected in the work of life. A great
ironworker, a successful mart, who
heard Ole Bull play his violin in his
factorj'. admitted that he had lost
something out of his life; he had
been so eager and devoted to his reg
ular business that he had neglected
the finer qualities of his nature, and
the chords of that violin woke him to

prepared him for the other services
of the day. In these times he might
shovel all he pleased on Sunday, and
very few would take any account of
his acts. The craving for a complete
change from the other days Is lead
ing thousands out into the fields and
over the mountain sides each Sabbath.
The great question for each one to
decide is whether what they are doing
really rests them and prepares them
for the next day's work. Because of
this practice and the things that often
are attendant upon it It is true that
many working people are rendered
utterly unfit for their daily toil; while
we have no right to legislate or to be
conscience for them we do have the
right to ask if they are really bene
fiting themselves. The foremen of
factories and those who employ large
numbers of men tell us how they
dread Monday morning, many of
their employes have so used the Sab
bath that they are of no use until
â¢Tuesday or even Wednesday; such a
use of the Sabbath as- cuts off a man's
earnings for one or two days of every
week cannot be called rest to him or
any one else.
of the institutions of civilization, of
great antiquity, associated the
moral fiber of the races that have
made use of it; it certainly seems to
merit our careful thought and to be
worth some sort of observance. We
mred to bear in mind the fact that
"we are a people of diverse training,
different ideals and varying practices.
We are to be most charitable to one
another; no one of us has the right
to decide how another shall observe
the day; in an article like this we can
only attempt to show what the day
stands for and what can be accom
plished by it. The word means a
break in the order of work, it marks
a pause in the business of life; we are
all pretty well agreed that we shall
be the better for leaving off the work
that has taken all our time and
strength for the past six days, and by
doing something different; it is to be
made as unlike as possible to the days\
that have preceded and those that will
follow it. -Rest is not necessarily idle
ntss; to the one who has been exer
cising the muscles violently rest will
be the relaxation to the muscles and
the exercise of the mental faculties;
to the tired brain worker the- most
violent of physical exercise may be
the best rest, j One of the ablest and
best ministers who ever lived had a
load of sand in his cellar, and when
he came home from church on Sun
day, his brain fagged and his nerves
all afire, he went down and shoveled
that load of sand about; it waa a day
when the consciences of the members
of his congregation were sure to be
as active for him as for themselves;
but it was exactly what he needed and
a consciousness of it- Another man,
a great pork packer, was approached
by a friend with regard to a mission
enterprise, and he remarked, "I don't
know anything about missions. I know
all about pork." It is well that a man
should put his whole heart into what
he is doing, but it is rather a humili
ating admission to make that he

humap being that calls for finer food
than 'that, and cannot be satisfied

of U3 at times there comes the fact
that we once had a purity of heart, a

and the good, and that we have lost it.
Right here is a chance for Sabbath
rest that will restore what has been

th<Â» French Assembly declared its be

to stop and think about him. We may
do it in the fields, or when meditating

rendered in the case of Leo Won
Tong, the Chinese against whom a de
portation case has been pending for
several weeks in the United States
court, | holding that he could legally
remain in this country. Judge John H.
Rogers of the United States District
Court gave the first legal opinion on
the status of a Chinese who changes
his occupation while in this country.
The Chinese exclusion act grants
merchants the privilege of coming
into the United States. It excludes
laborers. Leo Won Tong entered the
country as a merchant, holding that
occupation for several years. Four
years ago he became a laborer and the
customs department sought to deport
him, holding that as a laborer he had
no right to enter this country and
therefore'Tiad no right to remain. Tha
Chinese contended that he came into
the country legally and once here the
Government had not the right to send
him back to China.

TRENTON, N. J., Sept. 3.â The North
ern Securities Company to-day filed in
the United States Circuit Court Its for
mal answer in the suit instituted by
Edward H. ' Harriman, Winslow S.
Pierce, the Oregon Short Line Company
and the Equitable Trust Company of
New York to restrain the Northern Se
curities Company from carrying out Its
proposed plan of distribution of its as
sets. This is the first formal answer
filed by the 'Northern Securities Com
pany, either to the original bill of com
pjaint of Harriman and Pierce or to the
first and second amendments thereto.
The preliminary injunction granted by
Judge Bradford restraining the North
ern Securities Company from disposing
of certain shares of the Northern Pa
cific Company was granted upon mo
tion and argument in open court and
without the filing of any formal answer
to the original bill. The filing of the
answer would seem to indicate that the
case is to go before Judge Bradford for
a final hearing, notwithstanding the
fact that an appeal has been taken in
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals from Judge Bradford's opinion in
granting a preliminary injunction.
The answer filed to-day is largely a
formal presentation of points that were
made before Judge Bradford on the ar
gument on motion for a preliminary
Injunction.
The answer admits that on November
18, 1901, Harriman and Pierce owned
preferred stock to the value of $41,085,
000 and common stock to the value of
$37,023,000, but avers that on the same
date Harriman and Pierce transferred
this stock to the Northern Securities
Company, receiving therefor $3,915,625 in
cash and ' $82,491,871, in stock of the
Northern Securities Company. It Is fur
ther averred that this transfer was ab
solute and unconditional and that there
never had been any understanding or
agreement, expressed or implied, as to
how long such preferred or common
stock should be retained or managed
by the Northern Securities Company.
It is also stated that under a resolution
by the board of directors of the North
ern Pacific Company the preferred
stock of that (Company was retired on
November 13, 1901, and that since Janu
ary 1, 1902, such preferred stock of the
Northern Pacific Company has ceased
to exist. It Is denied that the decision
of the Suprema Court of the United
States was to the effect that the stock
of the Northern Pacific Company ac
quired by the Northern Securities Com
pany Is held by the latter as trustee.
It is averred that all stock of the
Northern Securities Company has been
acquired for a valuable consideration
in the belief that it presented a propor
tion of the defendants' assets, and this
is set up as one of the reasons for the
proposed plan of distribution.

All hands decided to stay by the Gar
field. At Captain Norby's lequest the
life-savers notified the Spreckels Tow
boat Company, and ai 7 o'clock the tug
Defiance had a hawser fast to the
stranded three -master. Within fifteen
minutes the Garfield was in deep water.
She is now on the Sixteenth-street dry
dock being repaired. 'Â¦
The GarfielJ, v.ith Captain Xorby and
a crew of â¢even men. left here at 4:30
p. m. on Friday for .Everett, in ballast.
Outside" the heads there was no wind
and a thick fog. The schooner drifted
to the southward. A sounding taken at
4 a. m. showed only eleven fathoms of
water, and both anchors were let gro.
So swiftly -.vac the schooner drifting
that both anchor chains parted, and at
4:30 o'clock the Garfield bumped the
beach in the breakers, stern on. The
rudder was smashed, the keel damaged
and seas swept over the hull.
Captain Xorby signaled for help,
using flare lights, and at 6 a. m. the
life-saving crew from the Golden Gate
station had a boat alongside the
schooner.
The. ilircc-rnasted schooner James A.
Garfteld, Captain Norby, went ashore
tally yesterday morning about five
miles south cf the Cliff House. The
\essel, which was pretty badly dam
aged, was saved from total destruction
by the fc'Dreckels tug Defiance, which
towed her to the Sixteenth-street dry*
dock. No lives wxre lost, but the mis
hap save the Golden Gate life-saving
crew a chance to show that they were
auor.ding strictly to business.

PAXTON. Neb., Sept. 3.â A severe
rain and hail storm passed over this
place Wednesday night. The lightning
struck John Swanson's house, burned
off the metal picture cords, passed to
his bed. struck him on the hip, ran out
of his foot and set the bod clothes on
fire. Swanson will recover.
Hailstones as large as a baseball fell.
Robert Dyke put a half-bushel measure
over his head to protect himself while
he was caring for his team and the
hail split the measure into pieces and
lacerated Dyke's face. About three
inches of rain fell.

The report of G. N. Salisbury, potion di
rector United States Weather Bvreau. for the
Wa.sfcir.gton Crop Bulletin, week endt-d Au
pu=t SO, is as follows:
The week was moderately warm in the
r-astern counties, and cool in the western
counties. It was dry until the liSth, when
hjrht #howerÂ« became ecr.eral throughout the
Ftate. brtakir.g the drought that had prevailed
for more than a month. Although the rain
was light, its effect was beneficial in quench
ing thÂ« forest flres. clearing the atmosphere
of smoke, laying the dust and freshening veg
etation. The showers wert too light and too
late to be of much help to the general crop.
Copious rains would revive pastures and In
sure a good root crop.
The threshing of winter wheat is about
two-thirds to three-fourths completed. ThÂ»
yield apparently varies from a little below
average to a little above, according to local
ity. The quality is good, but the berry is
smaller than usual, owing to hot end dry
weather. Fall seeding has Just begun In early
â¢â¢ections. Tbe soil is too dry for plowing.
The cutting of spring wheat is nearly finished
except in late localities. The yield, although
fair to good in eastern Whitman and the
southeast counties, is far below average In
the central courti*s. The week has been fine
for oat cutting and the work is nearly flnish-d.
Th* crop iÂ» in reneral light. Corn is being
cut in Kllkltat County.
AccortlE!? to reports, the heps are tot ma
turing well. the. bnrra arÂ« Email and soft.
and aphis arÂ» troublesome. Picking will be
gin Jn cbout a week. The potato crop ac
cording to thÂ« general estimate, will be very
light this year; not more than half a crop.

concern. Small amounts have left the coun
try on account of the new Cuban loan, but
Europe has made no demands upon our sup

ant that we could readily epare a considerable
amount even at this reason without detri
neat to ourselves. Wry shortly cotton bills
will be j/lentiful. ar<J t:r,id shipment* then
will be beyond consideration."
Ttw 2? aw Tork drealar of Henry Clews says:
**T2m stock market continues to chow a good
caflerlcBe. Epaculation has been inactive ow
isg to the mcertainty of crops and tbe ab
â¢eoc* of many lemdlng operators. Tbe latter
tre already becicning to return, and ere long
the Stock ExcL&cge should be the scene of
rreater activity. Monetary conditions are en
tirely satisfactory to the stock market. Crop
<3etca&Â£s have bepun and funds are being sent
South aad Weet with increasing freedom. Call
loans la consequence are somewhat firmer,
but tlae money i( plentiful, and there I* noth
ing in fight in the moniey market at this
time to prevent greater activity and strength
In stocks. Back reserves are so heavy and
crfilrary requirements bo moderate that there
1* ro occasion for fearing the usual strtn
pency incidental to the crop movement. Nor
are fold shipments any longer a subject for
Money and Stocks.

The conditions Vaid down knocked
the scheme, as one man couldn't have
caught ten quail in the time left. It
was intended to invite everybody in
the county to trap them at 60 cents
a bird.
The California 'county commissioners
have decided that each one shall give
the lecture on his particular locality at
the stereopticon exhibits at the Califor
nia building Inaugurated through the
enterprise of Captain Harris, the Kings
County commissioner. These lectures
are being given* regularly now at 5
o'clock each evening and are attended
by crowds that fill the little hair at the
California building. San Joaquin Coun
ty pictures were displayed the first
evening, with Calvin Brown as lec
turer. Sacramento followed, with Roy
Brooke as the orator in Its behalf.
Fresno County's pictures were ex
plained by Charles Wyer, and Kings
County's by Captain Harris. The other
county representatives will appear in
turn. The "World's Fair may develop
some spellbinders In Californiaâ some
mute, Inglorious "Websters, who, start
ing humbly with pig prodigies and Irri
gation scenes, will . be , thrOllng % *-Tast
audiences with discourses on the prob
lems of the day.
Much interest is manifested In the
pretty display made by Santa Barbara.
This is one of the world-famous Cali
fornia resorts. There are few tourists
who have ever visited the Golden State
who have not spent some of their time
at this place, where the climate Is of
the sort that makes one wish dreams
could produce bank accounts or that
bank accounts were not a prerequisite
of . dreams. Santa Barbara's fame
brings as many people to her exhibit
as it will bring to Santa Barbara.
Before the "World's Fair opened some
enterprising citizens of Santa Barbara
conceived the idea of exhibiting at the
exposition 500 live California qual!.
There was a game law that prevented
the capture of the birds and so they
went to Merritt, who had been to the
Legislature, where he got some game
laws passed himself, and asked him his
advice. He consulted the Fish and
Game Commission and got permission
to capture the birds. The promoters
were happy until they heard the condi
tions. These werÂ» that one man only
catch the entire 500 quail and that he
make affidavit for what purpose they
were going to be used. Some of them,
it was understood, were to be sent to
public parks in Europe after the fair.
None was to be killed.
CONDITIONS TOO HARD.
Something California lemon growers
should look into is a complaint that
lemons sent East by them do not keep
as well a3 those sent from other lo
calities. "Whether this is due to faulty
"curing" or the variety of the fruit is
not known, but growers could probably
find the cause and remedy it if they in
vestigated.
C. W. Merritt, the commissioner from
Santa Barbara, failed to get his daily
temperature reports by telegraph from
that county for one or two days, and
was wondering what caused the omis
sion. A Los Angeles man told him
there had probably been a hot wave,
and he quit wondering and awaited his
home papers.
Commissioner Merritt Is having
great difficulty with the crayfish he
brought here from Santa Barbara. It
is in a tank of preserving fluid and he
wants to get it in a Jar so as to shove
it better, but It is of such great length,
its whiskers alone being the longest in
Missouri, that no jar in St. Louis will
hold it. The public is overlooking the
fact every day that Santa Barbara has
the biggest grapevine and the biggest
crayfish In the â¢ world. ' and with two
such wonders known to the world prog
ress should be certain.

Tho Butter market ', continues about as be

. S. Truman yesterday began suit
against Harvey H. Dana for 512,835
damages' and the re-formation of a
ten-year lease on the seven-story hotel
at the corner of Hyde and Geary
streets. Truman wants the rental cut
from $1445 a. month to. $900 a month
on account of the failure of Dana to
complete the building according to
agreement at the time the lease was
made in June, 1903. The chief item
is , charged , to be Dana's neglect to
put in a cold storage plant on time,
and finally, when the plant, was in
stalled, it would not work, all of
which, it is alleged, was of great dam
age to the perishable goods kept by
the hotel. For this item Truman de
mands $9000. The lesser sums mak
ing the -total' asked for Include Dana's
alleged failure to pay , $035 for a

the jury. He considered the defendant
committed a cool and deliberate mur
der/ There was not one palliating cir

thought there was. The demeanor of
lhe.defendant during the trial was re

TO FORMULATE* VERDICT
The test in determining. whether ar
ticles .are. contraband of war is their
destination for the military uses of a
belligerent. . Quoting' from Dana in his
notes to Wheaton's International Law,
the department' says: ' .
"The. chief circumstances of inquiry
would naturally be the port of destina
tion." If that'. is ' a ; naval arsenal, or a
port in which vessels of war areusual
ly fitted out, or, in which a fleet is ly
ing,'or a garrison town, 1 or a place from
[which * a- military ' expedition is' fitting
out,' r the presumption of . military use
would - be raised more or less strongly
according to the circumstances."
, c The * department. "concludes that- an
extension of * the ;, principle of
band' by- treating coal and all ' other
fuel and raw cotton as absolutely con
traband '} of ". war, 'simply *Â¦ because . they
are' shipped^by." a: -neutral,", to- a ; non
blockaded port' of -a^belligerent,- would
not appear^ to be "in -accord with the
reasonable and lawful, righte of a neu
tral commerce. ~.f V ' â¢
Under date of August 23 Acting Sec
retary of State Adee replied, inclosing
a copy of the department's circular of
June 10, .1904, showing its general atti
tude as to conditional contraband* and
stating that -special cases as of the
Arabia and' the- Calches ' were being
pressed in detail.' He' also stated that
the Russian,. Government conceded the
right of; appeal'to St. Petersburg and
consequently, it was 'imperative that
American owners whose property had
been 'confiscated by the; prize court at
Vladivostok, should- take an appeal to
the h'lgher court at St. Petersburg as
the foundation of a claim for indem
nity for seizure and. confiscation.
In the. departments circular of June

A meeting of the representatives of
the commercial bodies of this city was
held August 12 in the rooms of the
Chamber of Commerce to consider the
matter of the seizure of shipments from
this port by Russian war vessels. A
communication was forwarded to Sec
retary of State Hay .through United
States Senator Perkins in which they
called the attention of the department
to the refusal of certain -American
steamship companies to receive' for
shipment to Japanese, Korean, Manchu
rlan and Siberian Â» ports freight de
clared by Russia to be contraband of
war. As a result other vessels flying
the British flag, relying on the protec
tion of the Government of Great Bri
tain, were receiving such goods for
shipment and thus trade was. being di
verted from American to foreign bot
toms at.a loss to the American steam
ship companies.
After citing the work of the Russian
raiding fleet in the waters of the Orient

Secretary of State Replies
to the Petition of San
Francisco Commercial Men
The plaintiff is seventy-two years old
and it is alleged that she has trusted
Woods for years. She was unable, it
Is said, to comprehend business matters
and en August 5 Woods called at her
lodgings and represented, to her that
it was unsafe for her to keep the shares
in her possession. On his representa
tions, the complaint states, she turned
the stock over to him, with the.under
standing that he was to collect the
dividends for her. At the same time,
she' says, he submitted a document,
which she signed, ignorant of Its con
tents. On the strength of the docu
ment, it Is claimed. Woods had her
shares transferred to his name and has
collected J18D 78 in dividends. :
It is alleged that he now claims to
be the owner of the shares and has de
clined to surrender them upon the de
mand, made by Emilie Dierks. The
court is asked to decide that the docu
ment by which Woods got the stock is
void and that the shares be retrans
ferred.
Old, partially paralyzed and bedrid
den, Wilhelmina Rosentnal came into
the Superior Court yesterday with a
complaint charging a long time friend,
whom she had trusted, with having
appropriated 306 shares of Spring Val
ley Water stock belonging to her. The
suit was begun through Emille A-
Dierks, who, on August 26, was ap
pointed'guardian of the plaintiff upon
a showing that Mrs. Rosenthal was
unable to care for herself or look after
her business. Robert J. Woods and the
Spring Valley Water Company are the
defendants.

Upon this ground Walker declared
that the roads were only engaged in
the transaction of an* interstate busi
ness and 'that therefore the applica
tion of the law quoted by Shortridge
was unconstitutional in that it inter
fered with interstate commerce..
â¢ The evidence of Deputy County
Clerk Charles Morris was taken, show
ing that he could find no record of
the articles in question having ever
been filed by the two roads named In
this county. On the other side of
the question, Foshay Walker, repre
senting the railroads, examined
Charles A. "Rutherford, district pas
senger agent for the; Rock Island, and
E. A. Mudget, passenger agent for
the Burlington, each of whom testi
fied that the only business they did
in California was tp solicit the pur
chase of tickets that would take the
passenger over some portion of their
respective lines.
Samuel Shortridge, representing the
several dealers in cut rate tickets,
attacked the right of the plaintiffs to
maintain an action in a California
court on the ground that those named
as connecting lines of the Southern
Pacific had not complied with -the
statute of 1901, requiring foreign cor
porations to . tile articles of incorpora
tion in this .Suttees a* condition pre
cedent to gaining â¢ a -right . in court.
This contention was aimed at the
Northern Pacific, Oregon Short Line
and Burlington and Rock Island sys
tems. .
Judge. Murasky yesterday morning
heard the conclusion of the argu
ments on the motion to dissolve the
injunction obtained by the Southern
Pacific arid its connecting lines pre
venting the local ticket brokers from
dealing in the special excursion tick
ets sold for the Templars and Odd
Fellows' conventions. The court took
the matter under advisement and an
early decision is looked for, as the
Templars' Conclave opens to-morrow
and every day is important to the
brokers.

Ah Wan. foreman of a coolie gang
employed in the Tesla coal mines,
came to the city to engage a cook and
dishwasher and was arrested for vio
lating the ordinance which prohibits
the posting of placards , on China
town's dead walls. As translated by
Interpreter Gong, the yellow sheet
which Ah Wan inscribed with black
hiernglyphics and stuck where his com
patriots could see it reads as follows:"
"Ah Wan. "You-sabee? Cook.
Washum. Any man wantee job come
to me." Â¦
Martin * '-essi, restaurant cook, paid
$2 50 for a new pair of pantaloons, and
the first time he wore them he slipped
and they ripped at the place where
such garments always do rip. Hasten
ing to his tailor, whose shop is on Du
pont street, near Green, he" doffed the
damaged trousers, donned substitutes
and instructed the sartorial artist to
b<Â» sure and have the rip repaired not
later than Friday evening, as he was
scheduled to lead .a cotillon.. With as
surance" that the instruction would be
obeyed, he went away with easy mind.
At the appointed time, however, the
trousers were not mended, nor did
there seem to be any possibility of the
mending being finished in time for the
dance. The argument that ensued , was
terminated by Flressi drawing a knife
and threatening to slay the deceitful
tailor, and Patrolman J. W. Davids
arrived just in time to prevent a trag
edy. .
"I'd like to get out for Sunday," re
marked Mr. Flressi to Judge Mogan,
befors whom he stood accused of wield
ing a deadly weapon, "because I have
a very important engagement for that
afternoon."
"With a lady, I presume?"
"Yes. sir."
"Well, it -would be disgraceful to go
a-courting in those trousers," said the
Judge, "and as your other ones remain
unrepaired I don't see any use in let
ting 3'ou go till Monday."
"That not so," contended Chang She
in fairly decent English. "Him ,no
shout. Hoss him come too quickee."
The case was continued till next
Wednesday and orders were given to
have Magee in court on that date.
Chang She, one of Chinatown's falr
pst belles, was daintily tripping across
Dupont street, between Washington
and Clay, when a horse driven
by H. C. Magee, real estate agent,
knocked her down. soiled her
new mauve kimona, disarranged her
coiffure and smashed a jade bracelet to
which she attached great intrinsic and
sentimental value, inasmuch as it was
a betrothal gift from Wok Foy, an opu
lent carver of pork. She was en route
from her barber to her affianced when
the unfortunate accident occurred, and,
of course, she could not think of such
a thing as pursuing her journey while
she was in a disheveled condition, for
Wok Fey is a stickler for feminine
neatness of appearance. So her dis
tress was enhanced by fear that Wok
Foy might be uneasy over her failure
to materialize at the appointed time in
the pork shop. â¢ ,
Magee did not annear in court to de
fend himself, but that he was not ex
clusively responsible for the upsetting
of Chang She's person and plans was
pleaded by his counsel. If the maiden
had paid attention to Mr. Magee's
warning shouts as the buggy ap
proached her, argued the attorney, she
could have averted the collision. But
she walked with bowed head and ap
parently was oblivious to her environ
ment.
Half a dozen milkmenâ E. P. Walsh,
Samuel llarron. Charles Paul, Charles
Evans, J. M. Turner and G. L. Perham
âwere before Judge Cabaniss on the
charge of adulterating cream with
"thickening" and their cases were con
tinued till September 10 by request of
the defense. . . ..
The man of several aliases was ar
rested for tapping the till of Super
visor L. A. Hea's paint shop at 1318
Stockton street and purloining there
from, five silver dollars, while he was
waiting to reauest the Supervisor to
sign 'an application for a free license
to peddle Knights Templar badges. In
court he stated that he came here from
Medora, Iowa, but afterward said his
last place of residence was New York
City. A tattered pocketbook found in
his possession contained documentary
evidence that he traveled under vari
ous names, several tenderly worded
epistles from women being addressed
to his different aliases. He explained
that he changed his name with the ob
ject of changing his luck, but the court
apparently ascribed a more felonious
motive to his frequent nomenclatural
mutations.
J. TV. Stacy, alias J. W. Tracy, alias
J. W. Raineer, accused of petty lar
ceny, hoped that the court would with
hold its judgment until he could pre
sent proofs of good character.
"I'm afraid you would keep me wait
ing too long," said Judge Megan, "and
besides I'm already satisfied you are a
crook who came to town to pursue your
calling while the Knights Templar Con
clace is on. So to save time and trouble
I'll now pronounce you guilty and fix
your punishment next Wednesday."
Mrs. Bernard staggered and would
have fallen if Bailiff Maloney's strong
arm haQ not anticipated such a move
ment.
"Stronger and handsomer than ever,
they said, and I was the well-pleased
woman. 'I hc-pe,* says 1. to Mrs. Gal

Mogan, because â ' "
"Six months," was the sententious
pronouncement from the bench.
j Police Judge Mogan returned to his
bench yesterday morning physically
I and intellectually strengthened by his
! six weeks' vacation and. the first de-
J fendant to greet him was Mrs. Nellie
Bernard, an old acquaintance.
"My!" she exclaimed, "but you are
looking well. Judge. If ever a man
j needed rest and recreation that' man
[was you and many's the time I said
â¢ that before you went awayi" The last
'time I stood here â you gave me thirty

the Judge's ungallant interruption.
! "Yap â drunk on Fourih street. But

i "Short sentences don't seem to have
1 the desired curative effect in your
case," his Honor again interrupted,
; "and I think I'll prolong the dose this
f time."
Joe Fusita, a diminutive Jap, was
bombarding the residence of a Chinese
woman in Eartlett alley when Police
Corporal Frear stopped his operations
and took him to prison. The missiles
employed by Fugita were less damag
ing than those used by his compatriots
in their, attacks- upon Port Aurther's
outposts', as they consisted of cobble
stones and barrel staves, but they
were hurled with sufficient . force to
demolish almost the entire front of the
â¢'crib." He was fined $10.
"Then you'd better go before thft
Board of Supervisors and request that
it be repealed," said the Judge. "Mean
time I will give myself till next Mon
day to think over the! matter of fining

"When a person has bÂ«en told that
they are in the last stages of consump-
tion and that no treatment can help
them. .It is surely a wonderful relief,
both physically and mentally, to find a
treatment that has curative effects. My
condition was a very serious one, and all
the medical treatment that I used, did
me no good. I heard of the success of
Electro-Chemlstry in serious diseases
like my own and I went to the Electro-"
Chemic Institute, No. 118 Grant Ave.. for
a careful examination. This examina-
tion was free and it was so thorough
that I had great hopes when the Electro-
Chemic specialists told me that Electro-
chemistry would cure me. I began the
treatment Immediately, and In a shore
time my condition was greatly Improved
in every way. When I first went to the
Institute my breathinjr was so short that
I could hardly go up the stairs. I had a
very serious cough â¢ and I expectorated
horrible looking matter from my lungs
I had fever in the afternoons and had
night sweats. I had lost a great deal of
flesh and was so weak that I could
scarcely get about. I feel like a new
woman now. I feel' stronger in every
way. The cough has disappeared. The
night sweats and the afternoon fevers
have both disappeared. I do not expecto-
rate bad looking matter from my lungs
and all of this has been accomplished in a
very -short time and at very little ex-
pense. I feel it my duty to tell other
sufferers of the wonderful effects of Elec-
tro-Chemistry in bad cases like my own
My name is Mrs. M. Macdousrall and I
live at Xo. 400 Oak St.. San Francisco"
It is cures like these that is making
the Electro-Chemic treatment famous
and it is because of such cures that. in
less than three years' time the Electro-
Chemic practice in 8an Francisco has
become the largest special practice in
the Y.'est. Electro-Chemistry is curative
in all long-standing and chronic diseases
and it is the most successful treatment
yet discovered for the cure of Consump-

The Electro-Chemic X-Ray Examina-
tion is the most reliable examination
that any sufferer can have and it is ab-
solutely free to all. Patients living at a
distance should try to come to the office
for this examination. In most cases thÂ«
patient can take the course of, Elec

home the same day. An expensive Elec-

was the Democratic platform of ISrz that
wrought the havoc.
everything. 1S32 was the best year this coun
try had ever seen. Locking for an issue tÂ»
win a campaign upon, cir Democratic friends
declared protection both unwarranted by taÂ»
constitution and vicious. Listen to their tariff
plank of that year:
"We denounc* Republican protection as s>

A generation had grows up under Use pro
tective principle and knew nothing cf th*
evils that always have and always will and
always must result from a tariff for rrresuÂ«
only. When every man. woman and child ia
the United States Is eating three full meal*
a day, the price of bread and meat and every

will be reasonably high, and the demand for
cheaper living expenses will be quite popular.

In ranting about for an Issue oa which our

they found It necessary to forsake Us* plat

DEMOCRATS HTTNT ISSUES.
- I never Indulge but one criticism oX .the
Democratic party. I concede that some of the
highest minded, some of Use best educated.
some of the most patriotic and some of the
best men In the world disagree with me poliU
eally. I never allow myself to quarrel with
them. But for some years I think I haTe
sever spoken without Indulging this criticism.
I never Indulge it. however, without explain
ing that If any one. when I am through, will
say to me. frankly.. "I think. Mr. Shaw, your
criticism was' unjust and unsupported by the
facts." then I will never Indulge It again.
My criUclsm Is this:- It seems to rae thiat Use
leaders of the Democratic party are exercising
more anxiety to discover an Issue on which
to win a campaign than in formulating a wise
policy for. the management cf the Govern
ment after they have won their campaign. I
have stated this criticism In a score of States
and I, have never heard Its Justice questioned.
If time would permit I would be glad to
review^ each and every campaign since the
organization of the Republican party, and I
think I Â¦ would be able to show that la each
and every campaign since 1560 our political
opponents have been controlled by expediency
rather :than by principle. I 'will content my
self, however, with beginning with the cam
paign, of isaa.
The year 1S92 was the most , prosperous this
country had ever seen. Measured ..' by the
amount â¢ of business done, measured by â¢ the
money. on deposit In thÂ« banks. â¢ measured . by
wages * paid. Â¦ measured by prices ; of < commodl-
Uea.'Â»Â«Â»Â«ure4 bj. acjtilBX as4 satasursd fcr
of Use world. I submit that this Is worth lock
lag after. But tn proof of my previous state
ment that the Republican party has not ne
glected the export trade, the United States has
the largest export trade of all these sixty
countries, and more than one-eighth of tha
aggregxta.
But I cresum* that my friends. Clark aad
Bailey, would, if pressed, seek shelter behind
an Incorrect definition cf free trade. Mr.
Baile) said In hi* late speech:
"Whatever and Individual Democrat, or. ta
deed. what all the Democrats might think
about free trade as a theory, the dullest maa
la this crowd knows perfecUy well that free
trade Is aa utter Impossibility la this re
public"
I make the assertion without fsar of Â«*en
an attempt at costradlcUoa that free trade
aad tariff for reveaue only are ldeaUcaL This
Is proved, as we lawyers say. In the hornbooks.
All elementary works on political economy use
the terms synonymously. Great Britain Is
notoriously a free trade country. It is the
only free trade country oZ aay Importance.
Tet England raises' more tariff revenu.9 per
capita than the United States. Her tariff
revenues exceed $4 per capita and our tariff
revenues are about S3 50. But Great Britain
levies her tariff for revenue only. She levies
none for protecUon. We levy some for reve
nue, but mostly for protection.
Note the difference between the English
theory and the Republican theory. Great
Britain, for Instance, levies a tariff on tea
and coffee. Of course it is a traiff for reve
nue only. We placed a duty on tea during the
Spanish War. It was for revenue only, and
after the war was over a&d the revesu* was
no longer needed It was repealed. Neither
England nor the United States ever placed a
duty on tea for the purpose of e&couragl&g the>
growth of tea in Great Britain or the United
States. A tariff for revenue only does ad
vance the price of necessaries to the people.
The Republican party places a tariff en sugar,
and I am not prepared to say that It does not
advance the price of sugar. I do know, how
ever, that its purpose Is to encourage the
beet sugar Industry. In the. United States. We
have the capacity to produce our own sugar,
and its growth would furnish employment for
a very large number of people, and Use agri
cultural lands thus employed would not bÂ»
In competition with the wheat lands. Tne
lands that would then grow beets are now
growing wheat or corn. The Republican party
does not legislate for the purpose of advancing
the price of products to the American con
sumer, but it legislates In the Interest of the
American home market. It believes in build
ing diversified Industries. It believes In fur
nlehlng employment for every man who desires
work by protecting the product of his toll from
open compeUUon with those who are content
to live on a lower plane and from, those who.
In periods of foreign depression, are willing tÂ»
dump their surplus upon our market regardless
of price.
"Democrats divide all Imports Into three
classesâ necessaries, comforts and luxuries, and
contend that the tariff duties should be highest
on luxuries. lower en comforts and lowest or
none at all on necessaries. They furthermore
say that taxes should be uniform oa all arti
cle? belonging to one class." '
Senator BaUey.of Texas; another good friend
of mine and a splendid fellow,' opened the cam

"I do aÂ«t hyrttto ft rtT *t*^l lamrtrn* +~ 'I'^sjtj
Here Is a declaration that It is a funda
mental principle of the DemocraUc party that
the Government has no constitutional rirht to
levy a. orotective tariff, for a protective tariff,
though It may produce a revenue, is not "for
the purpose of .revenue only." A tariff, for
revenue only Is not a tariff for the protection of
some. And I also assume that Mr. Clark did
not exoect the convention over which he pre
sided to again J-jsUfy the charge which ha
pronounces mendacious; but it. did; It said:
"We denounce protection as robbery of the
many to enrich the few."_
I think Mr. Clark would be JusUfied In calling
a Republican speaker mendacious who would
choree that the Democratic party is ia favor
of "robbery cf the many to enrich the few."
The Democratic party ought to stand some
place' within the ring during a campaign. I
am willins that they shall chocse their corner,
but I do insist that they shall not crawl under
the rope without throwing up the sponge. They
must cither stand for protecUon or against It.
They Ceclired against it in 1S92. and they
have never retracted cr apolcgited. The
American Deoxle .remember. But If they were
f orjetf uL they sUll read, and they have" read
tb* redÂ»crtion that protecUon is "mbbery of
the" many, to enrich the lAw." Mr. Clark fur
ther eh id: j
I make the charge, and I am neither ig
norant oa that subject nor xnendacioua, aad I
have no uakiad feelings toward my personal
friend. Champ Clark. I assume that Mr.
Clark had himself forgotten, and supposed
the American people had forgotten, the Demo
craUc tariff plank of 1S92, which said:
"We denounce Reoubiican protection as '-a
fraud and a robbery cf.the great majority of
the American ""people fcr the beneflt of the
few. "We declare It to be a fundamental prin
ciple of the "Democratic party that tha Federal
Government has ao consUtuUonai power to Im
pose asd collect tariff duUea except for the
purpose of revenue only." Â¦ ~* _ ;.:
PRODUCERS ARE PROTECTED.
Applying this, the Republican party baa al
ways sought to protect the American pro
ducer, while the DemocraUc party Is a free
trade party. I do not say that DemocraUo
voters are all free traders, but I speak of the
party as a party. And I say this â¢mindful of
the fact that Hoa. Champ Clark In his speech
as permanent chairman of the last Democratic
National Convention, In charging the Repub
lican party with attempUng to get votes under
false pretenses, used this language:
"One of their false pretenses â the one oa
which they harp en the most this yearâ Is
that the DemocraUc party is In favor of free
trade. The charge Is utterly false. There are
individual Democrats who are free traders.
just as there are individual Republicans who
are atheists; but It would be precisely as true
and fair to denounce the Republican party aa
a party of atheists as to denominate the Dem
ccraUc party as a party of free trade. It
never w&Â» a free trade party aad is not now.
The man who charges that it Is does so be
cause of Igncrance or mendacity."
therefore a producer, although he does not
own the object upen which his toll la ex
rÂ«ended. nor the resultant of that tolL And
every citlren. active or Idle, is a consumer of
food products, clothing and other necessaries
of Ufe. He may also be a consumer of large
Quantities of building material and of manu
facturing material and of purchased labor.* .
The Democratic party invariably and always
makes iu appeal to the voter from the stand
point of the consumer. It never tells the
laborer that it Is all-important that he have
good wages, "but it continually tells him that
it is all-Important that he have cheap living
expenses. It never tells the farmer that the
prlcaaf farm products is a matter of Im
portance or worthy of "his consideration, but
It continually tells him that the price cf nails
and of barbed wire and of window ; glass and
of kerosene oil and of carpet "tacas is of great
moment. The Democratic party has always
and does aow inein that the consumer Is Im
posed upon whenever anything can be ob
tained anywhere cheaper than la the market ia
which he buys. On the contrary, the Re
publican party tells the producer that his In
terests are being neglected whenever it Is
possible to Eecure a better market tor the
things he has to sell than the market In which
he sells. The DemocraUc party always insists
that it Is unimportant who produces that
which we consume, providing It is cheap. The
Republican party Insists that It . Is relatively
of no importance what price we pay providing
the price when paid passes Into the hands of
one who will In turn be a consumer of our
products. The Republican party believes in
the principles so aptly stated by Abraham
Lincoln: "If I understand this," said Mr.
Lincoln, "when we buy a toa of steel rails
abroad we get the rails and the foreigner gets
the money; but when we buy a ton of steel
rails produced at home, we get both the ralla

Xn acfilesce representing the best
citizenship cf California crowded the
AJhar-bra Theater last evening: on the
occasion of the formal opening: of the
Presidential campaign by the Republi
cs r.s.
The address of Leslie M. Shaw cf
Iowa. Secretary of the Treasury, was
captivating and convincing:. In every
*cnre of the term the distinguished
Cabinet officer "made good." He wen
the rapt attention of his hearers at
the cutset and maintained It to the
finish, two hours later. He defined the
policies and principles of the Republi
can party in sty3e characteristic of
Fimplicity and sincerity. Parables
rxMcted and pithy added to the effect of
the speech. In many of the remarks
Â£EiÂ£e there were flashes of true humor
ihat edified The audience.
The utterance of patriotic sentiments
ir.$?ir>id enthusiasm and prolonged
cheerinp. Notable demonstrations fol
lowed his references to the splendid
Personality cf Theodore Roosevelt. The
integrity of the President, his ambition
to promote the welfare of all the people
r>f the land and so promote the great
ness and prosperity of the American
ration evoked great demonstrations of
approval.
Along: about the middle of the speech
the Secretary announced that the au
dience would sing: "America." and after
the sir.jrirg he would resume his re
marks. He informed his hearers that
Mr. Knapp would lead the singing.
Th*>re was quite a lot of merriment
"hen it transpired that George A.
Knfgfct was the distinguished individ
ual that the Secretary had in mind
cvbes he spoke of Mr. Knapp. Sub
sÂ»<ju*m!y it was explained that Mr.
Knight was an crator and not a
finger. "America." however, was ren
dered in good style, the band leading
i.udJLb9 Â¦fmdience singing. At the con
cS'jsii'n of the hymn Secretary Shaw

â¢ "â¢ r.:rr> fsior.al Nominee S. C. Smith
and *nher eminent Republicans that
Ihe speech of the Secretary was one
of the greatest ever delivered in Cali

Th^ meeting was opened at the ap

Republican State Central Committee,
announced that the distinguished
\:s::or who had traveled across the
continent to address an audience in
Fan Francisco would be introduced by
the foremost native son cf California.
Hen. George C. Pardee. Governor of
the State. Great cheering hailed this
announcement and when the applause

Politics Is not a squabble for ofnee. Politics
Is the science of self-government. The issues
of a campaign do not hire their beginning
and endinr . in the election of men to office.
Candidates are csually acceptable men. The
Issues of a campaign are between measures,
cot between men. A political party must be
something mere, than an aggregation of or flee
eeekers. A political tatty ought at least to
represent some principle of self-government
and it ought to #tand for the same principles
of self-government Â¦ continuously. . :
Perhaps few of us recegniM the Importance
ef political campaigns. Neither mathematics,
nor pclence, eor statecraft are among the
natural intuitions of the human mind. They
must all be acquired. And about the only
tine that the American people study statecraft
Is daring a national campaign. Self-govern
ment is the hardest task erer yet undertaken
by laaa and If the American people continue
a self-governing and self-governed people It
will be because the rask and file study the
ecieeee of **lf-~>vernisent. Tea insist that
your representatives In Cosgress ehall under
stand the rroj-osiUons befcre the Congress
and you demand that they so vote as to best
conserve yocr interests. I am here insisting
that you at the polls shall so vote as to con
serve my Interests. I am here to demand the
same character, if not tie same degree of
BtatesmansctD at the pells as you demand on
the floors cf legislative bodies. State and
national.
The references In the Governor's
speech to President Roosevelt's sterling:
character and the brief review of his
work in the direction of the isthmian
canal enterprise elecited mighty shouts
of approval. There way a tumult of
applause, repeated and renewed, when
Secretary Shaw stepped forward in re
sponse to the Governor's introductory
remarks. The Secretary invited silence
by the motion of his hands. When
tranquillity was renewed he paid a
merited complJment to the audience.
OPENS THE CA3IPAIGX.
Secretary Shaw then spoke as fol
lows:
I. fcr cue. am glad they are. They tay that
be Is Impetuous. Maybe he Is. But where
has his Impetuosity gene wrong? We wanted
the Pestoffice thieves prosecuted. Roosevelt
waa impetuous *no-rh to send a half dozen
of them to Jail. We wanted the railroad
mergers broken up. Roosevelt's Impetuosity
did It.' xratViaTel'tEr coal "strike settled.
Roosevelt's impetuosity settled it. "We wanted
the isthmus canal. Had Jt not been for Roose
velt's impetuosity it would still be in the
dim and â.:Â¦::â¢- future. I like that kind of
impetuosity. It is the kind of impetuosity
that does things. It is the kind cf impetuosity
that scunis good to Americans and gives them
a feeling that we have as President a man
who can be depended npen to do whatever is
necessary to be done.
Lincoln cncÂ» said to seme one whi complained
to him that Grant was drinking whisky: "Ten
don't know what kind he drinks, do you? I'd
K-Ed a hogshead of it to each of our genera !s
if I thought it would make them as good
generals as he is." And. as- for me. I would
like to give all our public men a dose of
RDOsevelt'* impetuosity if it would make them
do the thills he has done.
Lfisc year California was honored by the
presence o' the President. You saw him. you
heard him and you recognized in him a true
American, patriotic, with only the highest and
best motives ever uppermost In tls mind.
Clean, hcne*t and with that kind of Im
petuosity which does things. With a sound
mind in a sound body, it is safe to say that
Roosevelt's coining four years as President will
be as successful ac his past three have beÂ»n.
I told him a few weeks ago that California
would give him a majority that would over
shadow til other Republican majorities she
ever gave. Was I right? Will she do it?
Cries cf "yes! yes'."
Secretary of the Treasury Shaw, one of the
President's official family, has come to Cali
fornia to te'.l us something mere than we al
ready know ef his chief, and to recall to oar
minds things which in a national campaign
It Is well for us to remember. Mr. Secretary,
a Saa Francisco audience Is before you. I feel
â¢ure that yea will roon be friends. Ladies

Four and eight years ago our opponents
could talk of nothing but free silver, and
they prophesied all manner cf evils if gold
were made the standard. This year you can't
ret them to eay a word about silver. But
they are trying to make an issue out of
Roosevelt.
FREE SILVER ABANDONED.

weeks, aad then we'll coxa* down Irom the
gold cress and take eff our crowns of thorns;
we caa stand it a little whi'.e if it will only

Asd think cf Bryan, the aj>o*t5* of freÂ«

as "minions of Wall street," even" one who
was net for free silver; think ol Bryan eup

this gastronomic feat was nowhere rear so

it swallowed its i>latfornis of 1SJK5 and 3300,
and forced Bryan to lunch on the cross of gold

aoyang attracts intense interest^ and
anxiety among the French officials
and public generally, as likely to prova
the turning point of the war. The
Foreign Onice construes the latest ad
ivices received . here this afternoon as
showing that General Kuropatkin haa
suffered a serious check, though not
yet amounting to a defeat or a; rout
The officers continue to say that hs
is executing a plan of slow withdraw
al toward Mukden, giving dogged re
sistance as he falls back. Military
experts point out that the magnitude
of the battle' is than'. any
fought during 'the Franco-German
War, the siege of Metz involving; 350,-
QOO'merv on both sides, whereas .there
were more than 400,000 at Liaoyang.
The Figaro says it Is the greatest
fight since the battle of Leipsic. The
newspapers here reprint the Berlin
Tageblatt's statement that King.-Ed
ward's visit to the Emperor, of .Aus
tria brought out a mediation move

on the subject to-day the Foreign Of

Good Points to . Remember.
General Stakelberg was slightly
wounded in the fighting before Liao
yang on August 31. He did not,
however, have to leave the field. A
dispatch from St. Petersburg, dated
September 1, said General Stakelberg
still retained command of his army
corps, although he was no longer in
chief command Of- the southern army.
. In a dispatch from, Liaoyang, dated
August 31. General Stakelberg: was de
scribed as personally having visited
and inspected the various Russian po
sitions.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 3.âGen
eral Baron Stakelberg, whose com
mand has been cut off by the Japan
ese, was in command of the Russian
troops that marched south in June in
an attempt to relieve Port Arthur. He
was defeated at Vafangow by the Jap
anese on June 14 and 1-6, and it has
been rumored that Emperor Nicholas
had decided to recall him because of
this defeat This rumor was never
confirmed.
Already in Disfavor Because" of the
VafanROw Defeat.
ILL LUCK OF STAKELBERG.
RUSSIANS ABANDON GUNS.
Unable to Remove Them Through the
Mud During the Retreat.
MUKDEN, Friday, Sept. 2. â After
six days' battle, on the last three of
which the heaviest fighting occurred,
the Japanese on Wednesday last
abandoned ' their direct attack | on
Liaoyang in favor of a flanking move
ment. The Russian artillery fire was
greatly aided by the sending up of
balloons southeast of Liaoyang, thus
locating the Japanese batteries. The
Russians were compelled to abandon
a number of guns, being unable to
remove them through the mud.
On Wednesday Japanese shells
reached the railroad station and the
railroad bridge over the Taitse River.
Others fell as far north as Yentai. The
railroad is being used almost exclu
sively by hospital trains and for the
transportation of Japanese prisoners.
The latter are in a dreadful state of
exhaustion. Many of them had been
without food for two Â¦ days, during
which downpours . of rain filled the
trenches. Their shoes are in tatters.
PORT ARTHUR SHIPS GO OUT.
Remnant of the Russian Fleet Shells
the Japanese Positions.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept." 3.âArt
vices from Port Arthur, datsi August
31, announce that Rear Admiral Ouk
tomsky's squadron went out August
2i> and shelled the Japanese position!?.
The- squadron consisted of the bat
tleships Retvizan and Pereaviet, the
armored cruiser Bayan and the pro
tected cruiser Pallada. This in the
first Intimation that the repairs of the
Bayan had been completed.
The vessels put to sea early in the
morning, under cover of the batter
ies, and returned safely after accom
plishing their mission.
The message adds that the Japan
ese are bombarding the fortress daily
and nightly, but are not causing se
rious damage, the inhabitants seeking
refuge in the bomb-proofs. This mes
sage, which was sent from Chefu, de
clares the Japanese continue to pro
vision their, armies from Weihaiwei
and Chefu, loading steamships outside
of these ports. . ,
CHEFU, Sept. 3.; 9 p. m. â On the
night of August 29 the Japanese sur
prised the worn out Russians at Pali
chuang and inflicted severe losses. The
Russians retired and the Japanese oc
cupied th6ir position.
The next morning at 3 o'clock the
Japanese, moving from their new van
tage ground, in- heavy force desper
ately assaulted Palichuang aria an ad
joining fort repeatedly until 2 o'clock
in the afternoon, when j they were
compelled to, retire, losing more than
1000 men.
Finding those forts impregnable, on
the morning after the 31st, at .4
o'clock, the Japanese forces hurled
themselves against another fort near
Palichuang. , By hand-to-hand fight
ing they succeeded in driving' out the
Russians and occupying their position
at '7 o'clock in the morning. Artil
lery was brought up and desperate ef
forts were made to make the position
secure, but after enduring for seven
hours the artillery fire from the other
forts the Japanese were compelled to
retire. The Japanese succeeded, how
ever, in rendering the position useless
to the Russians and it is now unoccu
pied.
- It is believed that this weakening
of the Russian line will attract fur
ther efforts to break through in this
quarter.
The bombardment of the town con

RUSSIAN SHIPS IN ACTION.
A copy of the Port Arthur No\1
Krai . of August 27 has reached here.
The paper speaks of the Russian bat
tleship Retvizan having shelled Jap
anese troops who appeared near the
village of Wudianfan, and this would
indicate that some of the" Russian
warships at Port Arthur are not so
seriously damaged as the reports from
Chinese sources have represented.
The Novi Krai confirms, the official
Japanese report that the Japanese
cruisers Kasuga and Nisshin bombard
ed two small forts near Golden Hill
some time ago, but it does not say
that these forts were silenced, as the
Japanese reported. These two forts
are in the vicinity of Wudianfan,
which is commanded by fort No. 2.
The Japanese mounted eight guns in
front- of -Wudianfan on August 25 and
have established one large and one
small fort to the northeast of the vil
lage. It was a detachment of Japan
ese cavalry and infantry, which ap
peared in the open in the vicinity of
â¢Wudianfan, that the Retvizan aided in
causing to retire. A gun of one of the
new Japanese forts was struck by a
Russian shell and ruined. The ac
count published In the Novi Krai does
not go into details, but the inference
is obvious that the Japanese have
been assaulting the smaller Russian
forts dominated by Golden Hill. The
paper makes reference to a trench
along the hills and remarks that only
the heads of the Japanese troops can
be seen above It
ASK FOR AID TO REMOVE DEAD.
On the night of August 25, accord
ing to the Novi Krai, a piece of white
paper on the end of a pole was hoist
eel above the Japanese trenches. The
Russians ceased fire and sent a de
tail forward to communicate with the
enemy. The Japanese, in imperfect
Russian, requested assistance in re
moving their dead. The Novi Krai
considers this request to have been
strange considering the fact that the
Japanese do not allow the Russians
to remove their dead.
At 3 o'clock on the morning of Au
gust 26 a Russian searchlight. revealed
the Japanese troops opposite fort No.
1. beginning operations, and thereupon
the entire Russian line opened upon
the enemy* with rifle fire, occasionally
usr'ng cannon. .
In reply the Japanese fired irregu
larly at fort No. 3. â .. '..
Daylight revealed the startling
fact that the Japanese had advanced
a trench to the north of fort No. 2.
This. trench was manned heavily with
artillery, which interfered seriously
with the Russian fire.
The Japanese then opened fire with
six-inch guns on the hill known as
the Eagle's Nest, In "the meanwhile
continuing to use sand bags for the
further strengthening of their newly
CHRONOLOGY OF THE BATTLE.
Aug. 28. â The Japanese armies under
Generals Kuroki, Oku and Nodzu
made a combined attack on the Rus
sian position in front of Liaoyang.
Oku's forces were held . back by the
Buriat Cossacks.
Aug. 29.â The Japanese drove General
Kuropatkin from Anshanshan and he
fell back upon the outer line of de
fenses of Liaoyang. The Japanese de
stroyed part of the railroad leading to
Mukden. A heavy artillery and infan
try battle was fought near Liaoyang.
General Kuroki's troops crossed
Taitse River on a flanking movement
Aug. 30. â Kuropatkin avoided a de
cisive . "battle at Liaoyang. The
trenches and forts of the city were still
held by the Russians.
Aug. 31. â The Russians repelled an
attack on Liaoyang. Four hundred
thousand troops engaged in a desperate
hand-to-hand flght in front of the city.
When darkness fell the battle was a
draw. j
Sept 1. â Ten thousand of the Mika
do's troops were slain in battle in front I
0/ Liaoyang. The greatest flght of the :
campaign lasted all day and the Jap- |
anese were repulsed time and again, ;
only to return to the attack. General i
Samsonoff .captured forty-six Japanese j
guns and two battalions of the enemy. ]
Sept 2.â Kuropatkin;; forced fromi
Liaoyang, sent a strong force torthei
outlying defenses of the city,, practical-,;
ly evacuating it. The Japanese pressed j
the enemy toward the Taitzho. The de
cisive con/llct of the campaign opened, i
Sept. 3. â The report of the evacuation !
of Liaoyang was confirmed. Kuroki â¢
advanced steadily "toward the railroad.'
Kuropatkin prepared for a tremendous 1
struggle. Liaoyang was reported, in
flames. General Stakelberg's Siberian 1
army corps was cut off and imperiled, i
The report from Tokio of Oyama
throwing the bulk of his army across
the Taitse River . Is considered at the
"War Office to indicate that the Japa
nese are rushing up reinforcements to
support Kuroki, the necessity for
whose relief may be urgent. .
The Tokio estimate of the Japanese
losses up to yesterday as being 25,000
is regarded her as moderate. The War
Office is not in possession of sufficient
data to estimate the Russian losses,
but it is believed that they will reach
15,000. Â¦> -\: .;,.';
The fighting at Sykwantun referred
to in General Kuropatkin's telegram
corresponds with the Tokio report of
the capture by the Japanese of a por
tion of the heights at Helyingtai, which
Is situated a mile eastward of Sykwan
tun. The latter place is two miles south
east of Siakhoutin, whither the Russian
advance regiment was forced back by
Kuroki during the night of Thursday
last : Â¦ : i*-*' : v:
"I have just received a dispatch from
the chief of the Liaoyang garrison,
timed 10:35 a. m., to the effect that the
Japanese attacked the fort situated in
the center of our position, but they
were repulsed with vdry great loss. We
had six men killed in the fort."
"During the night the Japanese vio
lently bombarded the interior of the
Russian position inside the town of
Liaoyang, the railroad station and the
railroad itself. Our losses were insig
nificant.
"At nightfall on Thursday the Japa
nese attacked our Sykwantun position,
but were repulsed after a hot fight.
They renewed the attack at night, this
time with success, driving back a regi
ment in the direction of Sakutun. The
retreat of the regiment led to the evac
uation of the positions held by other
troops. Toward morning the troops ad
varfced gradually in order to retake the
Sykwantun position.
"At dawn on Friday I assumed the
offensive against the troops of General
Kuroki's army. At midday the heads
of the attacking corps were in line and
preparations w;ere being made to retake
by artillery the position captured dur
ing the night by the Japanese, and the
infantry also is advancing to the at
tack. ' :
The General Staff to-day reconsidered
its determination not to make public
General Kuropatkin's dispatch to the
Emperor of yesterday, and the text was
given out, as follows:
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 3.â General
Oku yesterday afternoon assaulted one
of the strong Russian positions on the
Liaoyang side, which it is presumed
guarded bridges, but he was repulsed
with exceedingly heavy losses, the Rus
sians behind their works suffering only
slightly. The 'Japanese are using siege
guns on the Liaoyang side.
Kuropatkin did not delay after his
concentration on the right bank. Yes
terday morning he massed bis artillery
and at noon began to bombard Kuroki'a
position preliminary to an infantry at
tack.

ment of the hospital ship Ora. r Ow
ing to the" amount of the French sub
scriptions the Ora has been fitted out
sumptuously. She will sail on Sep
tember 27 for an unknown destination
and will fly the Red Cross flag, which
is expected to give her immunity from
seizure by the Japanese, '^i'0
Defenders of Taitse Bridges Repulse Oku
and Inflict Heavy Losses.
The Japanese armies continued to
press the Russians yesterday. They
moved forward and occupied a line
extending from Tatepjif to Yanchia
lintau. Orama telegraphed that he
hoped they would reach the right bank
of the Taitse this morning.
General Kuroki. after serious fight
ing, succeeded yesterday in taking a
portion of an eminence near Heiying
tai. Details of the fighting have not
been received. ;_ . 4:.. .T,,-. : "'^
The Russians again appear to be
concentrating in the vicinity of the
Yentai coal mines, twelve miles north
east of Liaoyang. Possibly another
great battle will occur there.;-.-.; :
The present trend of the movements
indicates that "possibly the Japanese
will move past Liaoyang, temporally
leaving the city untouched.
TOKIO, Sept 3.â The following dis
patch has been received here:
"Headquarters of the Manchurian
Army, Sept. 3, 9 a. mâ The remainder
of the defeated Russians are making a
stand outside the walls "of Liaoyang.
Our left and center armies are attack
ing them." . ."-.Â»Â¦;
The Russian force confronting Field
Marshal Oyama's left and center con
tinues slowly to give ground in retreat
and is crossing to the right bank of
the Taitse River. A portion of the
Russian armv occupies a line of de
fense works extending northwest from
a point south of Liaoyang. The Rus
sians also hold an eminence northeast
of Nutchang, on the rtght bank" of the
Taitse. This evidently Is intended to
shield the general retreat of both the
left and center.,... "
Japanese Armies Not Likely to Tarry
nt Captured Liabyang.
WILL CONTINUE THE PURSUIT.
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept 4, 12:25
a. in.â All Russia . will learn', by the
morcinr: newspapers that General
Xuropatbin's army Is in full retreat
to the northward; that Liaoyang. has
been abandoned and that General
Stakelbers's corps is surrounded and
t Bt Off.
The hopes of victory raised in Rus
fcian breasts by the telegram, of the
commander in chief, published yester
day, saying that the Russians had ad
vanced against General Kuroki.on Fri
day and that an attack on the Russian
r:?:ht had been repulsed, proved short
lived. General Kuropatkin had scarce-
Jy besrun the offensive against General
Kurohi's army when he was compelled
by the overwhelming force of the Jap
juiese flanking movement to give up all
idoa. of continuing his -advance and
hurriedly withdrew in the direction of
Uukden. . .
The retreat is the logical consequence
vt the Russian plrwi of Ieadfng on anÂ«l
lirinsr cut the Japanese at the succes-
Ffve stations of the road northward.
thus placing thÂ»ir foe at the constantly
growing <Ji?ac!vantape of lengthening
lines of oon-iUiunieation.
STAKELBERG BLUNDERS.
The success of this rlun was nmrred
by a blunder of General Stakelberg,
v. ho. In the words of General Kuropat
kin, "inel&ted on placing his own in
terpretation of orders instead of ful
filling them." General Stakelberg erred
in falling to cross the Taitse River
vhen General Kuropatkin desired that
the whole army should retreat to its
northern bank, as was exclusively re
parted In dispatches on September 2.
This blunder. It is feared, -will involve
the less of the whole of the First Si
berian Army Corps, consisting of the
First. Second and Sixth Rifie divisions,
the (tearl Cossack Brigade, the First
Siberian Artillery Hrig;ade and a sapper
battalion.
The abandonment of the -whole posi
tion at LidÂ£>yar.g involves the loss of n
jrreat accumulation of stores, though it
is believed that many of those already,
had been sent north before the com
mencement nf the fighting. It is more
than possible, however, that the Rus
fcians destroyed what they could not re
move.
Something akin to consternation pre
vails among Russians who have
learned of the disaster to General
Etakel berg's corps. All realize that
there Is small hore now for the relief
of Port Arthur, but the military of-
JieialE are unanimous In the belief that
it v III be only folly for General Kuro
patkin to remain and run the risk of
being surrounded with his whole army.
EXUDES TRAP SET BY OYAMA.
They assert that the commander In
chief, ' by his withdrawal northward,
has actually converted what might
have been disaster to himself itito
what is regarded as a reverse for the
Japanese, for the failure of the Jap
anese to hold General Kuropatkin's
array and inflict a decisive blow, it Is
claimed, cannot be regarded otherwise
than as a reverse. Field Marshal
Oyama's tenacious frontal attack and
the clever flank movement could not
Lave had any other object than to com
pel the Russians to accept a decisive
engagement.
General Kuropatkin's retreat un
doubtedly will have a discouraging ef-.
feet on the garrison of Port Arthur,
which can no longer hope lor any re
lief from this source. It is doubtful,
however, if the Japanese are in a posi
tion to press the slepe, and it Is more
than probable that they have diverted
a portion of the besieging army to re
inforce their corps' operating in Man
churia. This would account for the
temporary lull in the fighting. It is
noticeable that the siege reports reach
ing here do not mention further as
raults on the fortress, but only speak
of bombardments.
REPORT OF KUROPATKIX.
The following report has been re
ceived from General Kuropatkin,
dated September 3:
"The enemy last ("Friday) night at
tacked and seized most of the positions
occupied by our troops 'at Sykwantun
and the troops holding the positions in
Question retired to a rear, guard posi
tion between the villages of Shansun
tun and Shishanga,
"The same night the First Siberian
Army Corps, which has sustained
heavy losses during the last five days
and which was in danger of having its
flank turned, owing to the enemy's su
perior forces, retired several kilometers
to the westward.
. "In these circumstances, I ordered
Liaoyang evacuated and the troops to
retire northward."
r General, KuropaUdn says further:
"On the night .of September 1 Gen-
"At 3:45 p. m. the first Japanese shell
fell in Liaoyang and was followed by a
hail of projectiles.-which swept the rail
way station and the suburbs of the
town itself. Fortunately the station
v.as empty, all the rolling stock having
been removed. >".-.â¢; \h
"The first persons wounded were sev
en subjects of charity, a physician,
several Chinese and a commissariat
non-commissioned officer. ;
"By 5 o'clock in the evening several
fires had been caused by the bombard
ment, and the booming of the guns
followed our train as it carried off the
wounded. â¢_=*, .
"The Russian casualties in the fight
ing of August 31 and September 1 are
stated to number 7000. The enemy lost
double or treble that number.
"The Japanese prisoners appear to be
worn out" ...,v,-. 3 ;;a- K ,^..
"The losses to the Russian army have
not been ascertained exactly, but ac
cording to the latest account they ex
ceed 3000 in killed or wounded.
LOSSES OP THE RUSSIANS.
"In order to ascertain the enemy's
strength two regiments on the west
front were ordered to attack. After a
fierce fight it was discovered that the
enemy opposing the two regiments
were more than two divisions strong.
"At 9 o'clock In the evening there was
a lull in the flght all along the line,
and the only firing heard was the boom
of guns at Liaoyang. According to a
telephone report the garrison at Liao
yang repulsed the second Japanese at
tack.
Lieutenant -General Sakharoff, in a
report to the general staff, dated Sep
tember 2, says:
"To-day our troops assaulted the
heights of Sykwantun and after a des
perate flght we captured the whole
chain, but Immediately made the dis
covery that we had to deal with a
strong Japanese force, with, a front ex
tending from Yentai to the River
Taitse.
â¢ "A detachment, under Major Orloff,
which was guarding the Tentai' mines,
advanced a short distance, but; meet
ing the Japanese in superior force and
in a strong; position, had to recede.
"Major . General Orloff was wounded,
but the danger -of - the enemy's move
ment was averted by his return to the
station at Yentai.
"The gallant regiments of the First

THE. SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1904.
The flag of Japan flies over lAaoyang. Field Marshal Oyama,
who led his famous Second Army into Port Arthur durlns thÂ©
Chino- Japanese war of 1894-95, and who, in- that struggle, also cap
tured Weihaiwci and Talienwan, to-day, by dint of incessant fleht
; ine. In which his men were spared neither because of casualties nor -.
because of hardships, holds sway orer Iiiaoyanjr and General Kuro
patldn, through whom Russians believed their arms would be suc
cessful, is in full retreat northward, while one of Ms chief aids.
General Stakelbersr, with . his command. , the First Siberian Army ,^
Coi-ps, numberbie: 25,000 men, is cut oft* to the westward of ; JAao
yang. The Russians are concentrating: at Yentai, but the dispatches
thus far eive no intimation as to whether they will make a stand
'there. It is not known whether the Jnpanese will stop at Uaoyana
and [ fortify, or pursue the retreatina. foe. .;.:i;
Tills last blow to Russian arms, though it is spoken of in St.
Petersbure: as the logical consequence of Russian plans, doubtless will
be taken much to heart, by the subjects of Kmperor Nicholas, who,
after a succession of defeats and retirements by their army, had ex
pected a finality of the struggle at Uaoyanff in their favor. *
In the loss of IJaoyans by the Russians the Japanese probably
will gain little except hi the way of a strategical point, as the Rus
sians blew up the magazines and set fire to the enormous quantities
of 'army stores and provisions there before they evacuated.'
...T.'^ 1101 tlie effect of the retirement from Uaoyang .will be on.
the besieged at Port Arthur can only be conjectured, but certainly
it can but cause depression among the valiant defenders who have
been hoping that eventually they would bo relieved.

CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Sept. 3.â Cardinal Gib
bons, primate of the Roman Catholic
church in America, is in a fair way to
lose the greater part of his personal
fortune through the financial difficulties
that have overtaken Thomas Wagga
man, the treasurer since its foundation
fourteen years ago of the Catholic Uni
versity of America, and virtually every
Catholic Institution In the District of
Columbia, including many, churches,
faces the same prospect of disaster.
Waggaman's financial difficulties are of
the most extensive order. It is declared
that his great estate has been nearly
all lost in speculation.
So serious is the situation that Car
dinal Gibbons has called* the clergy of
his diocese to meet in a conference to
discuss the affairs of the university.
The Cardinal has expressed a willing
ness to sacrifice his own fortune to aid
In saving the university, and has
strongly urged the same course upon
the other clergymen.
The Catholic University of America is
Waggaman's largest creditor. It has
nearly $900,000 at stake, and Wagga
man's bond as treasurer is for only
575,000. ; -; ;

MAT SACRIFICE
HIS FORTUNE
And we cow ccme to the Congressional elec
tion of 1802. Our Democratic friends thought
it possible to secure control of the Lower
House cf Congress, and thought if they could
Becure control of that body in 3902 they might
perchance win the executive branch in lVOi.
A mest vigorous campaign was therefore in
aururatcd. and it became necessary to find
rn jFiue. Nothing theretofore tried would
ssswer the purpose. Thfy dared not more than
Kju:nt at a tariff for revenue cnly. It was
too Focn after 1S32. Anti-Imperialism had
in 1SJKJ. But I need not detain you. You Â«rÂ«
ell fanvliar with the ricture.
TVe now come to the campaign of IIKW.
Early in that year our Democratic friends
co:mner.ced castins about for an iÂ»eue on
which that campaign mlRht be won. Daring
air. McKinley'E first term much history had
be^n written. The Spanish war had been
Icupht to a successful termination. Cuba had
bfcome a temporary ward of the United States,
end Pcrto R1co and Ihe Philippines had been
Required. Labor had found constant employ
ment. "Wages were high. The American r*o
â¢p\f were eating three mcais a day. and
living expense* Â»tre r^sultantly high. There
tik r.o demand for a cheaper dollar, and our
Democratic friends again looked over their
previous platforms in vain to find anything
likely to prove a successful issue. Some ex
pedient must be fcund. and nothing oeemed
mo expedient as &r.ti-ircperiallaai.
The Chicago platform was reaffirmed. It is
true, but it was distinctly Fta:*d that the 6il
%er question should not be the paramount is
â¢ue. The contest was to be waged on anti
ts:per!a!i*n. The result I r.eed not mention
further than to Eay the Republican principle
cf eound rar.Ticy, every dollar the equivalent
of and exchangeable for 23. S grains of gold,
that that equally important economic principle,
the protective tariff, which guarantees to the
producer, artisan and farmer, miner and me
chanic, the best market in the world f8r his
labor and for thÂ« product of his laber, were
indorsed, and the Republican! party, remained
in possession of both the legislative and the
â¢xecutive branches of the Government. -
Continued From Page 27. Column 7.
It will be noticed that not even Bourke
fookriLn favored a declaration that the gold
standard was economically right or that It
cught to prevail. He pimply thought it "ab
solutely essential to any prospect of success"
that the establishment of the gold standard
by the Republican party "should be accepted
eÂ« a final settlement." But Judge Parker's
r.rst^and second lieutenants. Senator Hill and
Mr. Fheehan, thought otherwise, and they
voted against making B uch an admission. The
convention waa also silent on the subject. I
am not unfnindful that the nominee of that
convention, after ample time had Â«Iapsed In
which he might read the declaration of the
LEADERS DISAGREE.
And now we come to 19(M. Our Democratic
friends are again in trouble. I do not say it
would be difficult to devise some progressive
pclicy for the wise government of the nation,
but our friends have given no evidence of
having sought such. They give every evidence,
however, that they have sought an Issue for
the eole and enly purpose of winning this
campaign. As a matter of expediency they
have thought it unwise to declare in favor of
the f r- e and unlimited coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1 with gold, for that has
twice failed. They have thought it inex
pedient to declare in favor of the gold stand
ard, for it was discovered that the majority
of the convention did not believe in the gold
standard. They did not think It expedient to
df<lare that the money question was settled.
The New York delegation defeated, by a vote
of 50 to 26. a resolution offered by Bourko
Cockran in the following language:
"Resolved. That in the opinion of this dele
gation a plain statement In the Democratic
platform that the decision of the people as
twice expressed on the standard of value should
be accepted as a final settlement of the coinage
question is absolutely essential to any prospect
of KUCCf-ss in the election."
never struck a popular chord, and bo they
seized upon the alleged cruelty of the Ameri
can soldier to the Filipino people, and the
barbarity of the water cure became the issue
of that campaign. But the American voter,
from whose home the American soldier had
Rone, refused to rebuke his offspring or hl9
kin. and sound Republican financial and eco
nomic doctrines were again indorsed and the
Republican party remained In control of all
branches of the Government.

principal newspapers of New York statins in
most emphatic terms that he had no possible
chance ot Euccess on the non-commltal plat
form, did send a telegram to the effect that
he considered the Kold standard Irrevocably
established. He did not venture to say that
he thought the gold standard economically
wise or scientifically correct. He had twice
voted in favor of the free and unlimited coin
age of silver and must therefore be presumed
to believe In It. I assume that Judge Parker
is a very sincere and conscientious man and
that he would not twice support an issue in
which he did not believe, and I also assume
that he has the moral courage to eay that he
has changed his opinion whenever he in fact
changes it. I think I am also safe in assum
ing that in harmony with his party he recog
nizes the importance of expedients; hence his
telegram.
The telerram was received with great con
sternation and the remainder of the day and
more than half the night was given to its
consideration. Finally a reply was agreed
upon to the effect that the platform was silent
on the money question because it was not re
garded as a possible issue In the campaign.
It would have been more in harmony with,
the truth had the convention eald, "because it
is not deemed expedient to make the standard
an Issue In this campaisn, for If the conven
tion is silent no one will need ba embarrassed
whatever may be his individual views."
Eut the Democratic party does tender an
issue. It reaffirms one phrase of the tariff
plank of 1S92. Listen: "We denounce pro
tection as a robbery of the many to enrich
Â¦ the feV." It does not in terms reafflm the
Democratic doctrine of 1S02. that the Gov
1 eminent has no constitutional right to levy a
tariff except for revenue only, but that utter
ance having never been retracted or apologized
for still ftands as the doctrine of the party.
The Democratic position on the tariff question
remains, therefore, unchanged from what it
was In 1S92.' Protection from the Democratic
view point is therefore unconstitutional as a
principle and vicious as a policy.
It should be impossible to qualify this Dem
ocratic position. The plank does not declare
that excessive tariff duties amounts to rob
bery of the many In the interest of the few.
It declares that protection, high or low, is
robbery of tfTe many in the interest of th*
few. And here the battle should be fought.
I wish I might insist that upon this issue It
must be fousht. I anticipate that our friends
will dodge. They are Â»ometlmes good sprinters.
I am not unmindful oÂ£ the claim made by
some of our Democratic friendÂ« that the issue
shall be the candidate^. . This is also wel
comed. They will not attack the personal In
tegrity of Theodore Roosevelt. They will not
attack his patriotism. They will not attack
his courage. They will not attack his Inde
pendence. They will not attack his Intel
ligence. They will not attack the wisdom,
measured by results, of anything he has dono
or sought to do. They will not claim that his
administration has been vacillating or disas
trous. They will only express the opinion, i
that a man who does things must of necessity
do wrong things, and that a man who thinks
quickly must of necessity think incorrectly,
and that a man who Is ambitious for his
country's prosperity and for his country's peace
and safety must of necessity be unsafe. The
logic of their argument is that the only safe
man would be some one who can be whipped
Into a telegram to the effect that whatever may
have been his previous views or whatever may
be his present convictions, he is willing to
acquiesce, for the time being, in anything
he does not think It expedient to oppose.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Friday, Sept. 2.
A hot fight between Armenian insur
gents and Turkish troops occurred at
Van August 31, in "which more than a
score were killed.
Armenlansao the number of 100 raid
ed the town, charged four houses and
barricaded themselves. Troops attacked
the houses/ and in the fight which fol
lowed two soldiers arid twenty other
persons were killed. The authorities set
flre to a number of adjoining houses
bo that the troops might be better en
abled to besiege the insurgents. The
town was panic-stricken, and those in
habitants who had not fled j to H the
mountains took refuge in the churches
and convents. t " â¢ ! ; 7 :. ; ; ' ,
If is stated by the authorities that
other Armenian bands are preparing to
cross the Persian frontier.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 3.â Minister
Leishman at Constantinople cables that
the Armenian revolutionists are rather
active at Van. He says some Turkish
houses have been burned and small en
ccunters are not infrequent, but there
Is no indication of any particular dan
ger to foreign residents.
' The general deposits increased $9,
781,200, carrying this into the highest
on record. The required reserve was
increased, through the gain in de
posits, by $2,445,300, which sum, add
ed to the decrease in cash, made $9,
872,000, and the reduction in surplus
reserve to $47,503,400. Computed
upon the basis of deposits, less those
of $23,364,500 public funds, the sur
plus is $53,344,525. The statement
made a fairly gdod proof, the sum of
the increase in loans less the decrease
iu cash being $97,500 more than the
gain in deposits.
The expansion of $18,185,400 in
leans, which, it may be noted, makes
a high record which was entirely un
expected and was another striking
feature of the statement, can be
accounted for upon the theory that
there was extensive syndicate or cor
poration borrowing, the large banks
showing heavy increases.
Circulation was augmented by $1,
256,300, the greatest gain for a sin
gle week this year. The daily average
of bank clearings last week was $196,
000,000 or $27,000,000 more than in
the previous week. The clearings on
Saturday, reflecting Friday's business,
were 5213,175,045, much above the
average. Comparisons show that eight
banks expanded loans of 1? 2-5 mil
lions net, and that nine banks indi
cate a decrease in cash of 7 1-5 mil
lions net. Two of the larger insti
tutions contributed 11 millions to the
increase in loans and three banks lost
together 10 1-5 millions' cash.
NEW YORK. Sept. 3. â The Finan
cier this week says: One of the moat
noteworthy features of the official
statement of the New York Associated
Banks last week was the much larger
decrease in caji!i than was estimated
upon the basis of traceable movements
of money during the week, the loss,
as olticially reported, being $7, 426, 700,
while the estimates showed a decrease
of J2,lL'7,lÂ«0. This discrepancy is
partly explained, however, by taking
together the figures lor two weeks.
In the week ending August 26 the
estimates indicated a loss of $4,872,
700 cash and the statement a decrease
of $l,Â»04, 6uU. Last week, us above
noted, there was an estimated loss of
$2,127,100, while the two weeks in
dicate an estimated loss of $6,ya9,800.
The official report decrease was $8,
511,300, leaving a discrepancy of $1,
511,500, which may be accounted for
by the fact that the estimates are
based upon actual movements, while
the bank statement figures represent
averages. The ract also appears that
thÂ«: withdrawals of cash from the
banks were the largest in the last few
days of the week.
CHICAGO. Sept. 3.â President Gom
pers of the American Federation of La
bor has refused to call a meeting of the
national executive â¢ council to recom
mend a general sympathetic action of
unionists' in support of the packing
house strike. The requesjt that he call
a meeting of the national council in
Chicago waa made last week by Sec
retary Edward N. Nockels of the Chi
cago Federation. To-day Secretary
Nockels received a letter from Gom
pers, in Avhich he said:
â¢'A meeting of the executive council
has been called for September 12, and
the members cannot attend a meeting
earlier. Several of them are away from
their headquartersâ some of them near
ly 1500 miles away, to make Labor day
addresses next Monday. It would be a
pleasure for me if I might have com
plied with the request of the Chicago
Federation cf I.abor, but you can read
il>-' see how utterly impossible is such
a course. The strike or" the butcher
workmen has received and is receiving
my most watchful care, and I would
be pleased to do anything in my power,
and I know my colleagues of the coun
cil would join me in this expression if
1 could be of any service in the interest
of our fellow workmen."
"The American Federation of Labor,"
said Secretary Nockels, "has no power
to call strikes. It could recommend
sympathetic strikes."
Complaints have reached the union
headquarters at the stock-yards frqpi
several Quarters that the local unions
are not supporting the stockyards

URUGAYAN INSURGENTS
MEET DEFEAT IN BATTLE
TRINIDAD. Colo., Sept. 3.â President
Howells and Secretary Simpson of Dis
trict 15, United Mine Workers of Amer
ica, have issued a call entreating non
union coal miners who have assumed
the positions made vacant by the strik
ing union miners to strike September 7.
The call appeals to every non-union
man in the Southern Colorado coal dis
tricts, and guarantees them the same
protection and help that Is being fur
nished the union men who are on
strike.
Labor Leaders Entreat Non-Union
Miners to Leave Work.
URGE MEN TO QUIT.
It is wonderful that the commissary
arrangements made it possible to con
tinue to supply the men during such
a continuous battle. The Russians
were better fed, being nearer their
own base, but the terrible strain of
the continuous fighting caused some
of them to fall asleep in the midst
of the cannonade and even on the fir
ing line.
During the ten days' fighting the
condition of the soldiers of both armies
has been pitiable. Many of the Japa
nese prisoners were starving and al
most naked when captured, which
speaks volumes for Japanese endur
ance.
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 4. 2:50 a.
m. â The battle of Liaoyang. which be- â¢
gan with the Japanese advance on Au- !
gust -i. the day of the christeninz of j
tliti Czarevitch, and concluded on Sat- j
urday, September 3, with the retreat of 1
General Kuropatkin, is believed to
have l>ven the longest and the bloodiest |
of history. Nunn-rous incidents in the
lighting upset the theory evolved by
experiences in the Boer war. that a
modern battle must necessarily be
loufcht at long ranee. Both sides re
peatedly came to hand-to-hand en
counters in bayonet charges, and the i
men on both hides were often so near I
one mother that they could distinguish i
features and hear words of comment, j
la oÂ£t instance they were separated"!
o:i!y by the width of the railway, and !
actually threw stones at one another, j
2 he mad cei uism of the Japanese and !
the stubborn tenacity of the Russians
have not been paralleled anywhere,
save in some of the desperate encoun
ttife ol the American Civil War.
Correspondents state that several of
the bayonet attacks made by the Jap
anese throughout the battle were)
forced by the depletion of ammunition. I
at which modern arras entail such ex- J
tra.vag;int expenditure. The Japanese
came on with empty gruns and with
hopes of finishing the attack with cold |
steel, but it was proved Â£.t their own j
cust that such attack could not be j
driven home in the face of the fire of '
brcachloadingr guns. j
The Russian artillerymen suffered Â¦
terribly in the prolonged fighting south |
of the Taitse River. One battery lost '
forty men killed ; and the remainder j
uounded, and when a fresh battery ;
was brought up into position the sur
vivors protested with tears at being
removed, begging to be aliowed to die
beside their own guns.
The work of the Red Cross Society,
which, throughout the war, has been 1
devoted to both sides, proved almost i
as dangerous to doctors and nurses â¢
as did the work of the combatants. \
Many bearers and their assistants have â¢
been killed or wounded in attending*;
to injured under fire. A Sister of Mercy ;
was killed and a surgeon wounded in |
the final assaults on Liaoyang.
Telegraph operators and correspon- j
dents have suffered severely. Two cor- !
respondents of the Associated Press |
have been shot and one has been dec- |
orated for bravery. ;

ONE OF WORLD'S GREAT FIGHTS
Haskins came to Chicago in 1879.
He was well known in the electrical
world as an inventor and writer. In
1844 Haskins is said to have sent the
first telegraphic message that ever
passed between two countries, .wiring 1
it from Buffalo to Queenstown,-Cana
da. His most notable., achievement
was evolving the multiple switch
board now used for telephones all
over the world, which makes it pos
sible to operate any number of lines
from the same exchange. Â¦'
CHICAGO. Sept. 3.â Clark Caryl
Haskins is dead from inanition at his
residence here after an illness of sev
eral months. He was born in Buffalo,
N. Y., . November 22, 1827, and was
the- son of R. "\V. Haskins, A. M., a
well known scientist and writer.

to bicycles, has, died in Paris, aged
eighty-three years.
Despite his numerous inventions and
improvements in the steering gear of

have brought him a fortune, Sargent
ended his life in extreme poverty. His
inventions comprised the tandem bi

DEATH'S CALL
IS ANSWERED
BY INVENTOR
"There is no legitimate field for in
ternational suspicion or jealousy. All
that is being done is for the benefit ot
the civilized world in its entirety."
NEW YORK. Sept. 3.â In connection
I with the recent cable reports from Eu-
I rope to the effect that extensive fortifl
j cations are being constructed by the
j Belgians on the western border of the
j Congo F*oe State. Carten de Wiart, a
Belgian commissioner to the St. Louis
! International Peace Congress, now
j here, declares that the so-called forti
fications are little more than entrench-
I intnts, necessary as a precaution
i a gainst the great native population.
j "Naturally these have been erected
j by the Congo Free State," said he.
"The country is about as large as half
of Europe. It has a population of some
, thing like 40,000,000 negroes. There are
I about 12,000 Europeans in the country.
j Many of these are Norwegians and
I Swedes holding important offices. There
j are also a good many Swiss, who like
j wise take a prominent part in the ad
i ministration of affairs. Of late a rather
; heavy contingent of Italians has been
| coming in. Of course, with this over
j whelming population of blacks all
I about it has been necessary in pushing
' Into the interior to take certain pre
i r-autions in the way of entrenching ad
| vanced centers. That is the beginning
j and the end of the 'fortifications.'
The Newburg left her berth at Mis
sion street wharf about 7:50, bound for
Grays Harbor, with full cargo arid ten
passengers. The life saving crew im
mediately boarded the steamer and
brought Captain Anfindsen ashore. He
telephoned a Redstack tug to pull his
vessel off the beach in the morning at
high tide, which will be at about 5:30.
The steamer lies in an easy position
and there being no swell is not in the
slightest danger. - Captain Anfindsen
says it was so foggy he could not see
the lights and he was too far inside
the bay to get his bearings from the
sound of the foghorns outside.
Creeping out of the harbor under
slow bell in a : . dense fog last night
about 8:30, the Pollard Company's
steamer Newbuirg, Captain B. Anflnd
sen, went aground inside of Fort Point,
500 yards west of the Fort Point Life
Saving Station and about 100 "yards
from shore. The tide was about half
high running out and, the vessel settled
easily down in the sand. Her engines
were backed, but the steamer stuck
hard and fast.
With Whitman throughout was C. S.
Corrls of Syracuse, N. Y., and the pair
alternated in driving the car.
Whitman and Corris officially ter
minated the journey at the rooms of
the Automobile Club of America, where
Whitman delivered to W. T. Scarritt,
president of the club, a letter intrusted
to him by R. P. Pchwerin, president of
the. Automobile Club of California.
Scarritt indicated the widespread ef
fect of the record ride when he mailed
an answer to Sehwerin to-night.
NEW YORK, Sept. 3:â Across the
continent by automobile in scarcely
thirty-three days is the remarkable
record achieved by L. L. Whitman of
Lios Angeles, who to-day completed a
transcontinental run to this city in- a
light ten-horsepower Franklin car. The
best previous time for the trip was cut
almost in half, and the little four-cyl
inder machine dashed along Jerome
avenue in New York as if its journey
might have been only begun.
San Francisco was left at. 5 o'clock
in the evening of August 1, and Cen
tral bridge. New York, was reached at
12:30 o'clock this afternoon. By the
route followed more than 4500 miles
was traveled, the average run being
nearly 140 miles daily. On several days
more than 200 miles were covered, and
on other days the mileage was light,
to give the tourists an opportunity to
rest.

Objects to Term "Old Maid."
j | Miss Ellen |j Thorneycrof t Fowler has
recently been protesting against the
use of the term "old maid" in connec
tion wlth__unmarried women, says the
Lady's -Pictorial. Spinster is the word
she recommends ; to describe mai
dens, whom she strongly reproves for
their disparagement of marriage and
men, while at the same time she up
braids married women for the \ ridicu
lous : air Of -superiority they, assume
over their spinster: sisters. The spin
ster, she rightly maintains, should be
as much respected as the matron, who.
on the ' other : hand, Â¦ has no ' occasion - to
feel specially proud of her position. . '
CHICAGO, Sept. 3â According to a
decision . rendered to-day by Judge
Chytraus of the Superior Court, Board
of Trade operators who succeed in en
gineering a "corner" in wheat, corn or
other commodities which are made on
'change have no right to compel pay
ment of the manipulated price instead
of. the actual value of the commodity at
the time set for settling of the trades.
The case was that of a number of
firms and individuals on the Board of
Trade, operators and the Bank of Mon
treal. Nearly $500,000, representing the
difference in price for July oats, 1902,
-which 'was demanded by the manipu
lators of the "squeeze," and the actual
market value pries, was tied up in the
bank.

WASHINGTON. Sept. 3.â John Bar
rel t. the American Minister to Pan
n:r.c, has ::iadc a tp<'cial report to the
i>:a.te D-jpartir.ent relative to the pres
ent arc! future conditions on the isth
mus as affected by the building of
\hr Panama canal, vhlch Is Intended
to pi event sore disappointment on the
rart of adventurous Americans at
i!acted toward Panama by the resump
tion of the work on the vast enterprise.
Jt Is understood that the Panama
1 ommlsricn is especially desirous to
ttcure the widest publicity ..for the
naming sent out by Minister 1 Barrett.
The report in substance Is as follows:
1 â No man seeking & position as
cierk. Btencgrapher, typewriter, engi
neer, foreman or any similar class
h . 1 com* to the isthmus In expec
tation cf securing a positions unless he
: Â¦-.* made eomo previous arrangement
for employment or has sufficient funds
to pay his expenses In Panama and
jÂ«:urn to the T'nlted States If he finds
r." opening. More men of this kind are
row coming to Panama and Colon
then there are positions "to be filled.
The coet of living is very high, prices
having Increased nearly 300 per cent
la the last six months, and there Is a
grÂ«Â»Â£t shortage of cheap and whole-
Fomf lodging and boarding accommo
riatioES.
2â Â¦vThll* Panama and Color!, as well
us LowBS'in thÂ« zone and In the Interior
of Panama, are sure to experience a
- Â¦ nsi durable measure of material and
industrial progress through the exca
vation of the canal, there are not at
present many opportunities for the es
nbiishment of new mercantile,^busi
ness and professional firms, and there
j-hould not be an inrush of merchants,
1-asiness and professional men in the
â¢ xpectation of finding considerable and
:-ady openings for establishing tbem-
Zâ It Is the consensus of opinion
: â¢ i'ieb members of the commission and
< : her? who have studied the situation
that both Americans In the United
states and Panamans have greatly
â¢ xapgerated the increase of population
â¢Â¦> hit-h result from the construc
lioa of the canal and of the number of
nun who will be employed by the com â¢
mission for the carrying on of the
undertaking. Including thoÂ«e who
â¢ ill be employed on the canal and
: h'.-rs who will come, the increase will
':â¢' about Zi.000 people. This number,
moreover, will not be coming here at
â¢ rice, but pradually through a period
Â¦ f year? and as they may be required.
4 â There is not yet any real boom In
Panama, in Colon or in the zone, but
;â¢ nts for houses, stores and offices have
doubled and trebled during the last few
months and are now almost exorbitant-
I â¢ higrh; in fart, the Panama landlords
arp â *ome of thÂ»*m â so unreasonable in
their charges that there is danger of
Jheir driving business from Panama
piujH r into a neighboring zone.
t â The disajjreeable and unhealthy 1
tcctum cf the Panama climate have ;
(-â¢â¢en ridiculously overstated by those 1
u ho have studied the situation super
!iÂ« ially while parsing across the isth

As a. matter of fact there
hna not been during the months of
July and Atigurt a single uncomfort
:i!ile night for sleeping, while the aver
; ce days have not been hotter than
1 hose of New York and Washington.
There has been hardly a single instance
of serious illness among the consider
able number of young men who are
here in the employment of the Canal
< 'ommission, while the percentage of
sickness among the larger group of la
borers employed at Culebra is not
prrater than that upon similar excava
tion work In the United States.
There has not been a single case of
yellow fever for over a month, and
there Is less malaria than Is often found j
in sections of the United States where;
there Is considerable turning of the soil, j
My corrections of overdrawn criticisms
of the Panama climate must not, how- 1
Â»ver. be Interpreted as meaning that j
t here ere not unfavorable features here.
They exist, as they do In all tropical
lands, and. of course, the conditions of
maintaining health and enjoying life
are not by any means as favorable as
t hose In the average temperate climate.
When the present able sanitary corps
â¢ ho have charge of improving health
condJUons In the Isthmus have carried
out their plans for the Improvement of
the canal etrip and of the cities of Pan
ema and Colon there 1Â» no reason why
this Isthmus should not be one of the
healthiest places In the world.

A Team of Oakland Creek' Bailors
Loses Interesting Match by a
Narrow Margin. - \
In a close and an interesting
match played yesterday on the ground
near Clinton station, Oakland, a team
of cricketers selected by the Rev. S.
H. Wingfield-Digby, chaplain of the
Seamen's Institute, defeated an eleven
of sailors from vessels lying in Oak
land Creek by the narrow margin of
S runs. The Oakland Creek sailors
went to the bat first and compiled a
total of 96 runs. Holland (16), Pod
more (33) and Thompson (17) being
the chief contributors. The Rev. S.
H. W. Digby took six wickets, Storrs
three and Lewin one.
For the Seamen's Institute the prin
cipal scorers were Casidy (25). Lewin
(23), Wilding (24) and Wilkes (10).
Wilkes went in eighth wicket down,
and, with the aid of Bruce, chaplain
of the Seamen's Institute of Portland,
Oregon, made up the number of runs
requisite to pass the creek sailors' to
tal. Casidy was finely caught by Mc-
Arthur, who slid along the ground at
full length, but held the ball. The
details are given herewith:

TENNIS DOUBLES IX)R MEN
ANI> WOMEN AT SAN RAFAEL
SEAMEN'S INSTITUTE TEAM
WINS THE CRICKET GAME
As was expected, the tennis played at
San Rafael yesterday was much better
than on the previous day. Most of the
poorer players were out of the compe
tition and the contestants, as a rule,
were more evenly matched. As a re
sult of the two days' play nine men
are left, seven of whom have reached
the third round. Of these nine four are
from the south, one from Oregon and
the remaning four are home players.
Only the best of the players are left
and the remaining matches should all
prove close and Interesting.
The best match was that between
Will Allen and Percy Murdock. Allen,
as usual, proved a stumbling block for
Murdock and the latter narrowly es
caped defeat at the hands of his
smaller opponent. After winning the
first set handily, Murdock let down
somewhat and, as usual, Allen was
quick to take advantage of the action.
He took the second and third sets easi
ly and it seemed Murdock would lose.
He got back into his stride in the
fourth set and won this and the last
set by a score of 6-4, 6-rf. â¢
Trowbridge Hendrick and H. Elliott,
both of the south, put up an interest:
Ing exhibition. Hendrick won three
sets out of four, but had to play his
best game to do so.
Reuben Hunt's play was much better
than on the first day and he will be
hard to beat in future. He is getting
accustomed to the courts and his gamÂ©
Is faster. He won both his matches
easily.
The haat was insufferable and thÂ«
players lacked their usual dash. Most
of them played a slow, listless game,
being content chiefly in getting the
ball back. Cooler weather next week
will bringr out much better tenni3.
Only three matches were played by
the women and they were too one-sided
to be interesting.
BRAKES OX LOGGING TRUCK
FAIXi TO WORK OX A GRADE
Heavy Wagon Rushes Down on the
Horses Attached to It and
KJIls the Wheelers.
REDDIXG, Sept. 3.â A logging truck,
welching seven tons and loaded with
six immense logs, rushed down upon
twelve horses attached to it at noon to
day at Knights sawmill j.lant. near
Castella, aa the result of the brakes
failing to work. Two of the horses
were killed outright and another had
its leg cut off and had to be shot. The
accident happened on a steep grade
When the driver realized that the
brakes would not work and that a aerl
ous runaway was inevitable he drew
the horses sharply to one side and
leaped to safety himself. In response
to his pull on the / lines the horses
turned out sharply and succeeded in
cramping the truck and Its heavy load,
but not before it had crashed down on
the wheelhorses, killing them.
Sudden Death of a Physician.
SAN JOSE, Sept 3.â Dr. F. X.
Spranger, a well-known physician of
this city, died suddenly this morning at
his home at 53 North Second street.
Death resulted from apoplexy. Dr.
Spranger was a native of Bavaria, Ger
many, and C4 years of age. He leaves
a wife and four grown children.
James D. LIghtbody of the Chicago
Athletic Association clipped three
fifths of a second off the Olympic record
fc?r the 1500-meter run.
There was an unusually fine field in
the pole vault contest. Five men broke
the Olympic record before the event
narrowed down to the final jumps with
three men eligible. Charles E. Dvorak
of the Chicago Athletic Association
then demonstrated his class and from
the 11-foot mark he competed alone,
the other four men being tied at that
mark. Dvorak's best was 11 feet 6
inches, breaking the Olympic record of
10 feet 9 9-10 inches, held by I. K. Bax
ter of the University of Pennsylvania,
made at the Paris Olympiad.
The keenest competition of the en
tire week's programme developed In
the discus throw. M. J. Sheridan of
the Greater New York I. A. A. and
Ralph W. Rose of the C. A. A. tied for
first place with throws of 128 feet 10%
inches, breaking the Olympic record
by more than 10 feet.
As splitting points is not allowed in
an Olympic championship the men
were forced to throw over the tie. The
best that Rose could do was 120 feet
0% inches, while Sheridan, although
beating Rose, also shoTved a reversal
of form and the distance that gave
him first place was 127 feet 10% inches.
Should the protests be allowed by
that body it will result in a tie, as De
witt won three points and the tug-of
war team one point for the New York
Club.
The final scores, according- to the of
ficial records, of the four clubs follow:
New York Athletic Club 63, Chicago
Athletic Association 59, Milwaukee
Athletic Club 46, Greater New York
Irish Athletic Association 31.
The Chicago Association, however,
has protested the entry of John R. De
witt of the New York Athletic Club,
who won second place In the sixteen
pound hammer event, and the New
York Athletic Club tug-of-war team,
which finished fourth in that " event.
The result of these protests will be,
unless the charges are withdrawn,
the awarding of the championship cup
will be delayed until after the meeting
of the governing board of . the Ama
teur Athletic Union in New York next
November.
ST. LOUIS. Sept. 3.â With the finish
of the international team race, the last
event on to-day's card, the 1904 Olym
piad came to an end. Owing to protests
made by the Chicago Athletic" Associa
tion the award of the magnificent lov
ing-cup emblematic of the Olympic
championship was not made to the ath
letic organization whose representa
tives scored the most points in the
Olympic championship events during
the meet.
Jones had the Brownies snowballed
yesterday at Recreation Park. They
were his and he knew it. Still he could
not win. An error did It, just as the
error has been upsetting all the wise
calculators during the week. Mr.
Schlafley fell down this time, and hard,
too. Mr. Ganley helped him in his fall,
and then it was curtains. Score â Port
land 3, Oakland 2.
Jones is the hard luck kid, and no one
will dispute It after the struggle of yes
terday. The best the Brownies got
were three safe ones, but these would
not have chaperoned the runs In had
Mr. Schlalley not erred. Instead of
making a double play, "Shoofly" made
I one of the juiciest errors of the year,
and Ganley did likewise on the same
ball.
It happened in the seventh spasm.
Steelman had partaken of a base on
balls, and Clynes, fresh from the
bushes, bingled to right to celebrate his
break into high society. Both rested
anxiously on the sacks when Drennan
came up and swung softly on a slow
one that flitted right down to Schlalley.
Every one said "double play," but
nothing doing. Schlafley got cramps in
his fingers and the leather was making
a bee line for Ganley. Ganley had
cramps In his legs and then the
leather was breaking away to the fence.
It finally got there and both runners
landed. Drennan reached third, but
only waited there an Instant, for Mr.
Teeley Raymond had a double In his
stick and It meant another tally. .
After that the Brownies played the
game and had it won all the time, but
the Commuters gave them a hard run
for their victory. They had assumed
the lead In the first spasm when
Francks started the procession with a
double to left and Ganley swung
through to right with a single that did
the trick. That was all for them till
the eighth, when another was eased
through.
Francks again was the start-off kid,
landing one through second. Ganley
advanced him on an out and Dunleavy
clouted to the left garden. Francks
was held at third, but Dun started for
second. Steelman whipped the ball
there. Spencer missed his man and in
a race for the plate between Francks
and the ball the human being won out
and the score was 3 to 2.
Again the Brownies got the jimmies
in the ninth. "With two gone Raymond
fumbled Byrnes' grounder and then
threw it away over the first baseman's
nut. Jimmy traveled to second. All
hearts beat hard when Dr. Mosklman,
In immaculate dress, sauntered leis
urely to the plate, only to be fanned
by Ham. The score:

CHICAGO, Sept. 3.â Saturdays and
holidays are always looked upon as
"red-letter" days for "talent," for it is
then that surprises invariably occur.
To-day was no exception at Harlem.
The shock came in the Speed stakes,
the feature of the card, when C. E.
Durnell's Big Ben, a cast-off from the
Keene stable, won at 13 to 1. He ran a
sensational race, coming with a wild
rush at the end and getting up in time
to beat McGee. the heavily backed 6 to
5 favorite, by three-fourths of a length.
The latter had only a head to spare
over Irene Llndsey. The stake was
worth $1S85 to the winner.
Don Domo, the Texas "gray streak!"
came to life in the second race, which
was at six and a half furlongs. He
led from start to finish, winning easily
by a half-dozen lengths from Matador,
the favorite.
The track was fast, the weather
cloudy and the attendance the largest
of the meeting. Summary:-

Thomas' three-year-old colt Stalwart
defeated John A. Drake's three-year
old colt Ort Wells for* the $20,000 Cen
tury stake to-day In the presence of a
crowd surpassed only at this meeting
by Futurity attendance.
The victory of Stajwart made a dif
ference to his owner and to John "W.
Gates of not less than 5100,000, count
ing: the value of the stake. "Billy"
Cowan took one commission of $20,000
on Ort Wells at 3 to 5 from one of
Drake's party. Henry Harris handled
one bet of. 510,000. "Al" ] Dwyer and
others identified with, the Gates-Drake
party were offering any number of one
thousand dollar bills to various book
makers, nearly all of which were taken.
E. R. Thomas and his partner, Alex
ander Shields, backed their colt Stal
wart for the place at even money main
ly. The handicappers, track watchers
and others fancied Stalwart and it was
that class which helped to reduce the
odds from 6 to 4 against the Thomas
colt.

I am compelled bj a sense of gratitude
to tell you the great good your remedy
has done me in a case of Contagious Blood
Poison. Among other symptoms I was se-
verely afflicted with Rheumatism, and got
almost past going. The disease got a firm
hold upon my system; my blood was thor-
oughly poisoned with the virus. I lost in
weight, was run down, had core throat,
eruptions, splotches and other evidences
of the disease. I was truly in a bad shape
when I began the use of S. S. S., but the
persistent use of it brought me out of my
trouble safe and sound, and I have the
courage to publicly testify to the virtues of
your great blood remedy, S. S. S., and to
recommend it to all blood-poison suffer-
ers, sincerely believing if it is taken ac-
cording to directions, and given a fair
trial, it will thoroughly eliminate every
particle of the virus. James Cubrak.

BLOOMINGTON, 111., Sept. 3.â So
rich has grown the village of Thornton
that the Board of Trustees has voted
to abolish the village taxes for the com
ing year, l^pon counting up the funds
on hand the Trustees found that the
treasury contained $3900, enough to pay
all the ordinary expenses for a year or

State Election in Arkansas Will Be
Held on Monday.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Sept. 3.â The
State campaign closed to-day and the
election for State and county offices
will be held on Monday. An active can
vass has been made by both Democra\s
and Republicans and the latter are
claiming to-night that they will ma
terially reduce the usual Democratic
majority. Other than a nominee for
Governor, Barry H. Myers, the Repub
licans have no State candidates. Gov
ernor Jefferson Davis is the Democratic
nominee for a third term. The other
candidates for Governor are J. E. Wil
mans. Prohibitionist, and William Pen
rose. Socialist. The Democratic State
ticiiet, except for Governor, has no op
position.
While State Issues figure largely in
the campaign. Governor. Davis, in his
speeches throughout the State, has em
phasized the race question. He has
voluntarily pledged himself to recom
mend to the Legislature that the school
funds be divided so as to make the ne
gro public schools dependent upon
taxes paid by the negroes. -

CLEAR TWENTY MILLIONS
IX TIMBER -LANDS DEAL
Rise in the Value of Washington Hold
ings Gives Stockholders Immense
Profit on Their Investment.
TACOMA, Sept. 3.â Less than twenty
men have made more than twenty mil
lion dollars during the last four years
by the rise in the value of Washington
timber lands. Learnfng that the
Northern Pacific Railway was willinsr
to sell its holdings ln this State. Fred
erick Weyerhauser. a lumber kinc of
the Upper Mississippi ".Valley, formed a
syndicate four years ago and called for
subscriptions . to the company's : capital
stock. Fourteen millions were sub
scribed and only six millions' ac
cepted. The paid up capital stock has
gradually been. increased to twelve and
a half millions. The lands purchased
of the Northern Pacific comprised the
finest body of timber in the State, its
value being greatly augmented because
held in large continuous tracts. Subse
quently several hundred thousand acres
of land were purchased from timber
claim owners and mill concerns willing
to sell. The company's property is now
valued at more than S30.000.000. Re
cently- some of its stock was sold at
$260 a share. The members of the com
pany say that within a comparatively
few years their timber will easily be
worth $50,000,000. The stockholders
comprise lumbermen of Minnesota.
Wisconsin and Iowa, including Freder
ick Weyerhauser, president, and R. L..
McCormic. secretary. McCormic is
president of the Lumbermen's National
Bank of Tacoma.

EEOPL'S, Sept. 3. â Josiah Quincy,
former Mayor of Boston and manager
of the literary bureau of the Demo

campaign, came to Rosemount to-day,
liringing with him proof *heeas of the

Upon leaving Rosemount Quincy *aid
thct the compilation of the handbook

Special Dispatch to Tbt Call,
NEW YORK, Sept. 3. â Following
their plan to make their fight in the de
batable States, the electoral votes of
which will decide the Presidential con
test, the adherents of Thomas E. Wat
son, are preparing their campaign in
New York and New Jersey. In the
opinion of many of the Republican
leaders the Watson movement is a mis
take, because it may draw as many
votes from the Republican as from the
Democratic electors.
The call for a Populist State conven
tion in New Jersey, issued to-day, like
Watson's speech of acceptance, teems
with" denunciation of the Democrats,
but allows the Republicans to go un
scathed. The call summons all the
Jersey Populists to meet in mass con
vention in Atlantic City next Saturday
to place a full ticket in the field.
"The nominee of the St. Louis con
vention for the office of President does
not represent the tenets of true Democ
racy," the call declares. "His Bilence
upon the most vital questions of civil
policy, before and after the convention,
is significant of the nominee's insin
cerity and uncertainty. His eleventh
hour telegram to the convention on
the money question was a Wall street
inspiration. The management of the
Democratic party by August Belmont
and Judge Parker's allegiance to his
managers show the degradation of the
Democratic party and the subservience
of its candidates.
"The platform adopted at St. Louis,
as interpretefl by the Presidential nom
inee and his sponsors. Hill and Shee
han, presents no appreciable difference
from the Republican platform. In ef
fect, it manifestly seeks to evade an
honest utterance upon living isues. It
is an apology and not a platform."
It is expected that a similar "call"
will be issued in this State within the
next few days. : *; '
WASHINGTON, Sept. 3.â The feature
of the annual report of Major General
Arthur MacArthur, commanding the
Department of California, is the strong
language used in reference to the treat
ment in San Francisco of the soldiers
returning from the Philippines and
mustered out there. He says the great
est matter of concern which occupies
the attention of the department is to
get the soldiers returning from the
Philippines Into possession of' their
money due on their final payments and
safely out of the city before they can
be swindled. The ingenuity of the
criminal classes of San Francisco to ef
fect this purpose, he says", and the sim
plicity and apparent inability of the
soldiers to protect themselves are alike
amazing. -, ('
Everything has been done in the
premises that is possible in behalf of
the soldiers' interests. Quoting from
Colonel Markley, the chief paymaster,
on this subject, General MacArthur
writes:
"The stupidity and imbecility of these
'short term' men coming from the
Philippines is almost unbelievable.
Young Americans, amply able to take
erire of themselves anywhere un
der any circumstances while in
service abroad, seem to take
leave of their senses when they
arrive on United States soil and will
ingly become the prey of Jhe sharks
found in every big city. Instances and
figures could be given to prove that out
of 200 of these men paid off and permit
ted to go to the city on the evening
boat, with railroad tickets purchased
and money orders (payable to them
selves at their homes), fifty would turn
up next morning robbed of everything,
many dangerously injured by blows
and drugs. On one occasion out of
thirty-one men who foolishly stayed
over one night, nineteen turned up next
morning beaten, robbed of tickets, or
ders and clothes."
A satisfactory wireless telegraph
system , has been maintained at Fort
Mason and Alcatraz Island, the details
beinj? very much improved in design
by the operator in charge.
General MacArthur, in conclusion,
commends the staff officers for excel
lent service.
CHICAGO, Sept. 3.â Members of the
Association of Meat Cutters met here
to-nijrht at one of the downtown hotels
to discuss ifce stand taken by the
dockyards strikers in endeavoring to
force a meat famine. No specific action
was taken by the meeting, but at its
close it was announced that all of those
present had determined to handle meat
just as though there was no strike. It
was announced that there would be no
famine and that the dealers would see
i hat the public secured all the meat
.that it desired to use.
The lacking-house teamsters alr.o
took ar-tion against the striking butch
ers by announcing that thty would not
leonatcnanoe the strike ordered by the
butchers rgainst the independent pack
â¢ re, but would continue to handle all
:he meat that the independents turned
out.

SOLDIER BO YS
ARE EASY GAME
OAKLAND DOG SHOW COMES
TO A SUCCESSFUL EXDIXG
The finest collection of young grey
hounds in America started at Union
Coursing Park yesterday in the 'fifth
renewal of the California Futurity.
James Sweeney's Rocked Asleep, which
the coursing men have been sweet on
for some time because of his public
trials, has lived up to his reputation
for speed and has been installed stake
favorite at odds of 4 to 1 in the over
night betting. He led Dr. F. P. Clark's
Son of Erin three lengths and won de
cisively in a trial lasting but nineteen
seconds. With ordinary coursing luck
the son of Rocker-Gallant Foe should
experience no difficulty in winning to
day.
The three greyhounds which made the
best impression yesterday are grouped
in the middle of the stake. These are
Rocked Asleep. Belle Marie and La
Rosa. At the top Panoche is well
placed, while at the bottom Fearless
Lad appears to the best advantage. He
has a bye course to-day_ and is expect
ed to run well into the money.
Four of the trials yesterday went the
full two minutes, the sufferers being
The Duke, The Delta, Lady Waterford
and Siroc. 'Â£?Â« : : 5*;
There were several upsets in the bet
ting during the running .of the stake.
Free Erin beat the 1 to 3 choice Stinga
ree, and Fortunate Dawn beat Good as
Gold at the same price. D R after be
ing led by Sampler beat him, the fol
lowers of the outsider getting 6 to 1 for
their money. Siroc defeated the 1 to 5
choice Angus Cissus by a wide margin.
In the betting on the result of the
stake Rocked Asleep is at 4 to 1; Rusty
Anchor, Panoche and Sunny Brook 6,
Flower Girl 7, Secretive and Belle Ma
rie 8 and Confident 10.
The class stake has such an open look
that a good price can be had against
any entry. Silver Heels and Frisky
Barbara are quoted at 6 to 1; Rector,
Sacramento Boy and Charter Member
8, Palo Alto 10. Honest John and Lost
Chord 12 and New Home Boy 15.
Carlow Boy is favorite for the reserve
stake, with Rocker Arm. Loretta and
Crawford Belle pressing him closely.
The card for to-day is an exception
ally strong one, the class in all the
stakes being unusually high.
The day's results, with Judge P. J.
O'Reilly's official scores, follow:
California Futurity stake â Rusty An
chor beat Water Maid. 14-2; Panoche
beat Lady Sherwood. 11-3; Story's Sis

ROCKED ASLEEP
A FAST PUPPY
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 3. â Seven persons
were killed and nineteen were injured,
eight seriously, to-day by the collision
of a Wabash world's fair train with a
Suburban electric car at the Sarah
street crossing. There were twenty
five passengers ln the car and none es
caped injury. The dead:
JOHN W. WILSON, Kirkwood, St.
Louis County, aged 70 years.
GEORGE 'W. MAJORS, aged 60 years,
St. Louis County.
HARRY B. CULP, aged 60 years, St.
Louis.
ANDREW McKlNLEY, aged 12
years, St. Louis.
M. B. BRISTOL, aged 60 years, Web
ster Grove, Mo.
TWO UNIDENTIFIED WOMEN.
Seriously injured â Raymond iteister,
aged If years, St. Louis, right leg lacer
ated and body bruised; Mrs. L. it. Wil
son, St. Louis, body bruised and cut
and face cut; Miss Mary Budd, St.
Louis, right leg broken; C. K. Schu
macher, St. Louis, cut and bruised
about body; E. J. Coleman, Old Or
chard, St. Louis County, left leg
broken; L. R. Wilson, severe injuries;
Alfred Jenkins, face cut and body
bruised; John Gillespie, Kirkwood, St.
Louis County, internally injured.
After temporary assistance by physi
cians at the scene of the wreck those
most seriously hurt were taken in am
bulances to the City Hospital, while the
others received attention at their
homes; All the injured will recover.
The Wabash train was returning to
Union station from the World's Fair
grounds at the rate of about twenty
miles an hour, it is stated. The street
car, which was on its way to the sub
urbs with a load of people, stopped di
rectly in front of the engine and was
cut in two. The trucks of the car were
knocked 100 feet away, while part of its
roof was carried 100 feet farther by the
train. Bodies of the dead and injured,
with the wreckage of the dismantled
car, were scattered along the track for
a long distance.
A. W. Burdick, engineer of the train,
who blames the motorman of the elec
tric car for the accident, said:
"I was within 100 yards of the Sub
urban crossing when I saw the Sub
urban car start across the track. It
looked to me as if it had ample time to
get across." .
The watchman and flagman at the
crossing and some of the passengers
confirm the 'statement that the car
stopped, started across the railroad
track and then stopped where it was
struck.
No satisfactory explanation has been
given why the car stopped in the mid
dle of the track after it started across.

No California trip is complete without
a visit to Yosemite Valley, and August
and September are delightful months for
the trip.
For excursionists from the East and
accompanying friends a special round
trip rate of $25.90 from San Francisco
Is made. From Merced the rate is $20.00.
No sleeping-car expense Is necessary,

Giants.
Yosemite Valley.
Contributions of chickens, fruit,
cakes, etc., will be thankfully received
and may be left at the home of Mrs.

Contrary to popular opinion the

Charles Crocker presented the grounds

On September 5, 6 and 7 there will
be a smart luncheon served at 207
211 Grant avenue, from 11 o'clock
a. m. to 2 p. m. As a culinary in
vestment the luncheon will be worth
while, as an act of charity it will be
doubly so, for It is for the benefit of
the Crocker Old Ladies' Home.
LUNCHEON FOR
CHARITY TO BE
GIN ON MONDAY
H. K. Wolff, by his attorney, Otto
Irving Wise, yesterday began suit
agrainst the city and county for the
return of an aggregate of $8449 31 on
more than four hundred assigned
claims for illegally collected taxes,
The suit asks the court to declare
that the assessments in 1902 of iy 2
: cents on the hundred dollars for a
new City and County Hospital and the
same amount for new school build
ings be declared void, in that the
levies were an attempt to suspend
the limit of taxation for that year.
The claim named as the basis of the
suit is that of A. Abrahamson, who
paid $28 05 alleged to have been col
lected "erroneously and illegally.".
In the list of hundreds . of others,
'whose claims Wolff is prosecuting, ap
pear the American Biscuit Company
for $203 02, H. H. Bancroft Company
for $386 63, George H. Moffat estate,
$325; Standard Oil Company, $401 70.
Suit Begun by H. K. Wolff to Invali
date Levies for Hospital and
School lluildhigs in 1902.
HUNDREDS OF CLAIMS
FOR RETURN OF TAXES
larg'e American flag fell over against
him. He rushed it aside, saying: "We
vill not pull it down â Republicans
never rull down the flag."
The turnout at La Plata was large
and t!i<? Senator was enthusiastically
jrieetf-d. -"-i â¢- Â¦
"There then were many "empties' and
'dead' engines, whereas to-day the
equipment of the road is taxed to its
utmost. There are more engineers at
ihe throttle to-day than there were
in 1S96. Why? My good friends. I will
tell you why. Because during the last
peven rears vie have been operating
under Republican politics and there
have be<?n two grf-at, patriotic Ameri
can statesmen at the throttle in Wash
ington. One of them. William McKin

cessor, who is carrying into effect the
f-ame policies and the Fame principles
for which McKinley stood.
While the Senator was speaking a
Mr. Walbridpe. the Republican
nominee for Governor of Missouri,
rho was aboard the train, also spoke
foi a few moments.
At Marceline there was another crowd
find also a brief speech by the Vice
Presidential candidate. Senator Fair
banks in his speech recalled a trip he
had made over the Santa Fe Railway
in 1SS6. and said there was by no means
as many Figns of prosperity along the
line thrn as now. He said:
MARCELIXE. M<x. Sept. 8. â When
Senator Fairbanks left Kansas City
on bis return to the East to-day he
was scheduled to make brief stops at
several points in Missouri and his
plan was pursued. The first stop was
made at Lexington Junction. There
the Senator made no . speech, but he
personally greeted all who were as
sembled.
At Carrolton there was a longer
stop and & larger crowd, and he made
a brief speech from the rear platform,
saying: among- other things: "- :
"It is gratifying, indeed, to witness
as I travel through the great State of
Missouri the evidence of interest
which you are taking in the great po
litical question which concerns the
American people. Missouri, during the
past few years, has enjoyed a meas
ure of prosperity that has been un
usual to her. There has been pros
perity In the factory, prosperity on the
farm, prosperity upon all the great
lines of commerce. All of this in the
fullest possible degree is a high trib
ute to the efficiency and virtue of Re
publican policies and Republican ad
ministration. Do we wish to continue
with our progress? If we do, then
we should hold fast to the policies
under which we have accomplished so
much and we should support the ad
ministration which is achieving so
much in our common interests. We
have to-day in the White House a
brave, splendid man, worthy of the
continued confidence of the people of
Missouri and of the entire United
Mhtes, Theodore Roosevelt, and I am
plad to see evidence in the State of
Missouri which leads me to believe
that the Republicans of this grand old
commonwealth have determined to
put a magnificent Republican in the
Governor's office."
Judge Morrow went on to say that
a title obtained by fraud is no title at
all, and that when the accused ex
changed lands to which they did not
hold a valid title, they defrauded the
United States.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday refused to grant a "writ of
habeas corpus to F. A. Hyde and H.
P, Dimond, under Indictment by the
<Srand Jurv of the District of Colum
bia. Judge Morrow held that the ln
' dictment was vaUd and that it charged
a crime against the United States.
Bert SchleEinger, counsel for the de
fendants, presented papers on appeal
to the Supreme Court of the United
States; and the defendants were re
quired â¢ to clve bonds of $10,000 each,
â¢which they did. â¢<' â .
Francis Heney of counsel for the
Government asked that defendants be
required to give bonds of $50,000 each.
j He said that the offense of which they
i were charged was not an extraditable
one and that the defendants, if they
wished, could go to British Columbia
or Mexico, and thus escape punish
i ment. Garret McEnerney remarked
Â¦ that the accused were able to ffive
: bonds for $50,000 each, but that such
j a sum was unreasonable. He also took
_ exception to Heney's remark that the
j accused had realized half a million
[dollars out of the alleged frauds.
Judge Morrow, in the course of his
i opinion, said:
"In this case I have considered very
carefully the auestion whether or not
' the District of Columbia has Jurlsdic
! tion, and I am satisfied that it has.
i â¢ â¢ â¢ The important question is
: whether or not this indictment charges
i the petitioners with' any crime against
: the United States. â¢ â¢ â¢ The charg
â¢ Ing part of - the indictment is not very
.' clear in its language. The objection
' Is that this indictment charges the
i petitioners with having obtained title
I to certain lands from the States of Call
1 fornia and Oregon in the names of nc
j titious persons, and that this has been
j used In obtaining title from the United
i States for lands which the United
States owns. It is said that this is
: not an offense against the United
: Statees; that if these petitioners have
Â¦ secured title, they are entitled to
; change that title for land belonging
to the United States. An exchange
does not mean a fraud. â¢ â¢ â¢ judge
de Haven has reached the conclusion
that while the language of the indict
ment is open to criticism it does allege
an offense against the Taws of the
United States, and I also am of that
opinion."

not enough to excuse the eater from at

The, man who says all circuses are
alike will wear an uncomfortable smile
this .week. Newspaper reports from
every course compel this outlook for
the man who knows it all. ' Some
thing new in bareback riding and
something new in acrobatic feats has
at last been proved possible.
The evidence of these things, which
must/be,a relief to every one who en
joys outdoor shows, is brought forward ,
this year -by the' enterprising Ringling
Brothers. The circus programme they
offer; is always acceptable to San Fran
cisco people, judging from the heaping
patronage of the past, but this season
they /are declared to have excelled
their best previous showing in this city.
â¢ The 'four; Eldreds, riding celebrities
of England, and .the four Bedinis,
equestrian stars of Italy, .are the in?
ported acts that give a new and:zest
fur interest to : bareback riding.- These
performers, for instance, jump from
the" ground -in perfect unison to the
back of- a galloping horse, facing in
an opposite direction.. This is a sensa-'
tional performance arid has thrilled
European countries because of its nov
elty and difficulty.- They also do tricks
on the backs of swiftly moving horses
that are ordinarily effective upon the
firm foundation of a stage. The seven
Glinserettis. from Germany and thÂ«!
â¢Tasmariian family from Australia per
form acrobatic acts that are entirely
new to this work, and have bi-ought
them distinguished fame; in their re
spective' countries. ; To the
Glenserettl troupe turn somersaults
from shoulder to . shoulder,, standing
two and three high, as a circus phrase
goes. To do this on the flat surface
of the ground has hitherto been looked
upon. .as extremely hazardous and un
usual. The Colllni-Cairon troupe give
variety spice to ..the circus programme
and have been immensely effective
in their whirlwind dances. They oc
cupy '.. two * stages, dress stunningly
and 'combine Â¦ the -most graceful
features of- dance with, difficult
gymnic acts. All 'these . perform
ers are; .new" to America' and "were
broueht here by Ringling Brothers. .
i Another stunning act is that of the
Kauff man family, who present a mar
velous bicycle performance. Some one
has said that they are the "last word"
on bicycling. However, this may be,
their' performance is the most effective
and expensive in the variety field. The
Jackson family are in this same class
It has been. finally, settled that Nor
way and .'Sweden, about- which' there
was some doubt, will both have exhi
bits. The ..other foreign .countries
which will be represented here, so far
rS known at present, are Austria,- Ser
via, France, Germany. Belgium. Switz

elated over the information received
:â¢ ttterday from Yreka, Sisklyou Coun
ty, that two of the market hunters of
that section of the State had been ar
rested for violation of the deer law.
Some of the inhabitants of Siskiyou
County have been conducting a profit
able business in deer hides in and out
of the close season. The Fish Com
mission has had a difficult task in
attempting to apprehend the law
breakers because people did not wish
to tell stories about the offenders to
the officers. L. Edwards and E. Hixon
have been arrested and will appear
in court at Yreka. Vogelsang thinks
That the conviction of these two men
Â¦will cause the people of the vicinity
to be more observant of the game laws
in the future.

Blazing emblems appear on every side.
Those who come down town in the

The uptown I illumination was g par
ticularly, beautiful at the, Mechanics'

and had the Insignia of the, order hung
upon . its -,' walls. A * huge sign $ that

"Headquarters. California'Commander

tho banquet hall, - on the Hayes j street
the center- of the colonnade is a. three
column triumphal arch, from which -is
suspended the cross . of the most- emi
nent grand master, which is embossed
with lights, and, together with ..the
loops of lights strung from curb to cut b

crowds to the colonnade. From the col
onnade the strings of lights continue at
regular intervals to the > intersection I of
Tenth, Fell and Market streets. <i- .
The City Hall, '-(.which has always in
past illuminations. been a feature of the
celebration, was* more gorgeously deco

UPTOWN ILLUMINATION. :
Both sides of Geary street were light
ed with arcs as far as the Hotel St.
Francis, which was also brilllantlv il
luminated and decorated. .
Unlou square is surrounded by white
masts that support girdles of lights,
while conrecting the masts are strings
of lights and Japanese lanterns. At the
four corners of the square are sus
pended large ., Japanese lanterns, with
clusters of electric lights inside.
On Market *street,;.after- leaving the
grand ccurt Of honor, : the, canopy of
lights continues to the 'grand .colon
nade, that extends midway between
Fifth and Sixth streets. The approach
to both sides of the colonnade is made

with Â¦ strings of â¢ frosted lights, Â¦ while, in

from the huge ring that has ' taken
much thought and work to accomplish,
were suspended at intervals other em
blems of the order, all richly illumin
ated. The nearby buildings, including
the Palace Hotel and the Call building,
were outlined with lights- and hung
with mottoes and insignia. . The thou
sa-'"- of lights concentrated in this
court made that "part of Market street
as light as day.
GEARY STREET LIGHTED.
At Post and New Montgomery streets
the Masonic Temple was ablaze with
lights and all the insignia and emblems
cf the Templars hung illuminated on its
walls.' The Union Trust building, op
posite tha Masonic Temple and partly
facing Market street, was also outlined
with lights.' From this point streamers
and flags are strung down Montgomery

electric lights are strung at intervals
along Post street as far as Powell.
The court 'of honor at the intersec

Third streets, over which much
thought and care havp been expended,
proved to be the grandest display, that

Could the padres of o!d have stepped
from the ferry at the foot of Market
street last night after the current had
electrified the jnyrlads of lights on
that broad thoroughfare they would
havÂ» been amazed at the wondrous
sight of their beloved San Francisco.
If tiziy of our visitors were to arrive
E.t night their first impression from
the ferry-boat would be that the city
v. as aflame.. Seen from the bay, the
illumination cast a glow upon the sky
puch as is caused only by great con
flagrations.
Colonnades, columns and arches,
buildings, stores and emblems all alight
with the glowing bulbs, was the sight
that greeted San Franciscans last
nUrht. The brilliant display . stretched
from the ferry building, at the head
of Market street, to Tenth street, and
included one great loop that reached
out to take in Union Square. Besides
this there were manyside illuminations
just off the great thoroughfare that
added their share to the general glory.
The fluttering flagi clustered on poles,
from which were suspended strings of
lights, added life to the scene.
And while the city was doing her
best to dazzle the visitors the State
was not behind in giving her contribu
tion to the illumination. At the ferry
building the Harbor Commissioners
had every light in the place working
and the great nave, with its band of
lights, was well worth visiting. Out
eide the building was outlined In fairy

under the JarcÂ© clock wu a twentjr-

forest of redwoods, while the cedar
trimming on the roof beams and cross
trees adds to the effect.
The main floor has been converted
into a California forest of tall redwood
trees. On all sides rise the high tops
of these trees, their heads reaching far
above the galleries and their boughs
forming a canopy overhead. The gal
leries are covered with green, forming
a continuation of the trees rising from
the floor and the forest appears to
reach from .the floor to the ceiling.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 3.â Ordnance ex

months of wprk, . have . succeeded 1p
constructing a magazine rifle which is
believed to be superior to any in use
in foreign armies at this time. Every

until 100,000, the number requisite to
supply the maximum strength' of the
army on a war footing, have been com
pleted. At the present rate of prog
ress this probably will be about De
cember'l and the issuance will be im
mediately begun. . , ; . \'''
The rifles which were in use in the
Spanish- American war are to be re
turned to . the arsenals and later re
issued to the various militia organiza
tions, now armed with the ancient
Springfield rifles, which are regarded &a
almost as obsolete as the old flintlocks
or percussion guns. .
The most noticeabl: " difference be
tween the old and the new arm. p.ppar
ent at first glance, is the fact that the
barrel of, the lattc-- is entirely, covered
with wood. .After the -campaign in
Cuba and the Philippines, many com
plaints were made to the ordnance of
ficers, who said that, after, a period of
rapid discharge the rifles became so hot
that It was sometimes necessary to
cease firing for a. time to permit them
to. cool. i ?:.; â¢ -. - .,' > â¢ ' ,
The bore of the new rifle is a smaller
caliber, being, about r.30 inch, while the
initial velocity and penetrating power
are both greater than the old arm.

A medical man is responsible for the
theory that the smoking of tobacco
tends to develop baldness. For some
reason or other every mysterious dis
ease Is attributed â¢ sooner or later to
tobacco. But there were hrave men
before Agamemnon, and there was dis
ease before the days of Sir Walter
Raleigh. Julius Caesar, who lighted
neither churchwarden nor havana, was
wont to comb h!s thinning locks for
ward over his brow In order to cloak
his baldness and Elisha certainly could
not have Â©reserved his hair at the pe
riod when he was Insulted by ribald
boys. From earth's earliest ages there
have surely been men" walking under
the everlasting firmament with smooth
and shiny heads, and we altogether
protest, therefore, against the addition
of baldness to the cumulative charges
brought against tobacco.
It Is one of the saddest evidences of
mortality's inherent and ' incurable
baseness that tobacco, which is cer
tainly one of mankind's chlefest bless
ings, should be forced to beat out Into
the wilderness of medical theories
nearly every sickness and evil which,
so far, the sacred weed has been unable
to remove.â London Globe.

LINCOLN, Neb., Sept. S.â A cousin
of President Garfield died at the
County Poor Farm yesterday.
H. P. .Garfield was 80 years old and
was the first cousin of the * President.
Their fathers were brothers and lived
near each other. in Ohio for years. The
aged man . told . many stories of his
boyhood with the youth later to be
mourned by the nation.
Two years ago Garfield went to the
poor farm. After he was there four
months his friends learned of his situa
tion and gave him a home. Two
months ago, when very low with his
Fickneas, he was again taken to the
farm; because he would not ask his
Ohio relatives for aid. '

GARFIELD'S FIRST COUSIN
DEES. ON A rOOR FARM
The receipt this week of the first cot
ton bills, with the probability that
within a fortnight they will be offered
in abundance, directs attention to the
methods of negotiating them, the way
in which the Southern grower gets hi3
money, and the means used by foreign
spinners In settling for purchases. The
common notion is that the producer
is Dut to the trouble of borrowing the
necessary money In order to dispose of
his cotton. The reverse of this is true
âas the buyer of the cotton usually
pays the farmer in cash when the
staple is delivered, or as soon as it ia
bargained for.
A cotton bill la like any other com
mercial bill drawn against the purchase
of a particular article. Where the sta
ple is intended for shipment it ia ac
companied by a bill of lading. Invoice
and policy of insurance. The most im
portant device, however, is the draft
which accompanies* It, thia being thÂ»
instrument whereon money ia raised
to pay the planter. Most of the cot
ton ia handled bv "factors." The fac
tor, or Southern representative of the
spinner, concludes all arrangements
for paying for the cotton. Here la a
case in point:
A Liverpool spinner wanta to buy
$200,000 worth of cotton in America-
He secures a letter of credit from a
foreign bank of international standing
and sends it to his American agent
with drafts in blank. The. agent con
tracts for his cotton, goea to a South
ern bank, which buys the bllla at cur
rent ratr- -"f foreign exchange, .and in
return givea a check for the sum re
quired. The buyer then turna thia
check over to the owner of the cotton
and the latter ia paid. The purchase
has been closed so far as this coun
try Is concerned. The draft, which ac
companies the cotton bill, being a nine
ty-day note, bearing an agreed ! rate
of Interest, la finally returned to Tjiver
pool and there presented for payment
at maturity. It is chiefly for the pur
pose of taking up these bllla that larga
currency shipments are made by New
York banks every autumn. -

SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. 3.â Bert
Laurence, a young farmer, was en

and dragged for 300 feet by a team of
runaway horses, sustaining injuries
from which he may die. A youth
named Tagg, the son of a dairyman,
was driving the horses to a hayrake
in a field, when . the animals became
frightened and ran away. They col

having thrown Tagg out of the rake.
A great stretch of the wire was torn
off and became fastened to the rake
and when the runaway horses 'passed
near Laurence he stepped on the wire,
which immediately coiled about him
like a snake. The horses then dashed
on toward a deep ditch, but Tagg suc
ceeded in heading them off and stop
ping them before they took the plunge.
Laurence's. clothing was nearly torn
to shreds, while all over his body were
great, deep cuts from the barbs in the
wire and the sharp corners of the
stones in the field. It took several men
a quarter of an hour to free him from
the coils of the wire, which* were tight
ened to such an extent that for a while

forming a magnificent court, have
been placed in sections 2 and 3 of
the gallery. Each colonnade lsjnount
ed with a large eagle, about thirty-six
inches high, and a fine silken flag. Be
tween sections arbors com
posed of colonnades and made so as to
represent the California missions make
a beautiful effect. The arbors contain
a number of red lanterns from which
electric bulbs cast a soft light. The re
ception room at one end of the building
is fitted in Chinese fashion, the fittings
consisting of the choicest furnishings
obtainable in Chinatown. A miniature
forest has been planted at the west end
of the upper gallery for Santa Rosa

deries which will jointly occupy one
section of the Pavilion have taverns
built of rough timber, typical of the
early days of California.
held just beyond his reach. At the op
posite side of the gallery is the original
copy of Earl Cummings' "At Play."
In the annex California Commandery
has its headquarters and dispenses re
freshments in the Chinese tea garden,
fitted up in keeping with the original
article, as though transplanted from
the Celestial empire. The art gallery
will probably be the finest piece of dec
orative work ever done beneath that
roof. The ceilings and alcoves have all
been tinted in cream and green. The
walls and floors of two sections are
covered with green burlap and two
other sections are covered with burlap
in the natural color. More than 2000
yards of burlap are required in this
work.

Of knowing that the title to your property is
clear and incontestlble Is most apparent when
you figure up the expense of litigation and the
possible -loss of your Interests. Â¦
We examine titles and if through weakness !
they are subject to dispute or contest we pro- J
toct you against all loss by Insurance.
Doesn't cost much either.

Frultvale will be materially benefited by San
Francisco's expenditure of 517.0CO.00O for public
improvements.
WHY?
Because the money to be thus expended will
benefit mechanics, laborers and all classes of
business men, giving them plenty of work,
good wages und business and enabling them to
have a surplus with which to buy homes, and
they can buy their homes here in Frultvale
better and cheaper than any other place around
the bay, and for tbe following five reasons:
First â They can own their own homesâ th*
monthly payments beln? much less than city
rents, which bave doubled in the past two
years.
Second â Quick and cheap transportation to
Ean Francisco; commutation tickets $3 per
month.
* Third â Tbe same advantage* that are of-
fered In the city â namely, water, jras, elf o-
trlclty, sewers, fine roads, churches and
schools. Â¦ * :- \
Fourth â No city taxes, only . State and
county.
Fifthâ Besides all the above. Fruit-rale ts
noted for her wonderfully fine climate, un-
doubtedly the best around the bay; her fruits,
flowers and shade trees, and her law-abiding
citlsens make Frultvale an Ideal place to live.
Our list is so large and so varied In prloe
that it would be useless to advertise the dif-
ferent styles and advantages of each separat*
property, but wo can show you 2-room, 3-
room and on up to 10 and 12 room houses, and
at prices ranging from $500 to $20,000.
Property bought to-day will, without doubt,
advance in price during the coming year suf-
ficient to pay, not only a good Interest, but also
to give rent free. _^
We feel that If you wilt call and give us th*
privilege of drtvlna- you about Frultvale that
you will decide, as many have done, to buy and
settle in Fruitvale.

WEATHER .REPORT.
The Stock Exchange side of these war
scares has all along been Interesting,
because such* occasions are peculiarly
those when a stock market speaks
from secret Â¦ knowledge. The probable
source of the early buying or selling or
ders is the community of important
bankers who are associated with the
financial operations of the state. In an
emergency which threatens war. a
prudent government must know what
It could depend on, if war were to
come, from the money market, and
conversely, the banking interests must
know what the Government really
means to do before they can give their
answer. Hence the private Information,
which runs with - extraordinary speed
through the markets, even when its
source Is unknown to the bulk of those
who listen, and Its basis not in the least
understood.â New York Evening Post
"Traveling through & State where hÂ«
knows the law favors him the pro
fessional black litigant, while he Is
seated in the smoking car just about
the time the sleeper berths are being
prepared, hands his sleeping car cou
pon to the sleeper conductor. -
" 'Sorry.' says\the sleeping car con
ductor, If he is under Instructions from
his company thus to act, "but this car
has got a flat wheel and is going to be
taken off the train at the next sta
tion'âthis while the porter Is going
right ahead with the work of getting
the berths ready.
"Nothing suits the professional black
litigant better than this. His white
confederate sleeps In the car that Is to
be 'taken off because It has a flat
wheel,' and upon the presentation of
this evidence in the States where the
conditions are favorable the black
wins his suit against the sleeping car
company more often than not."âWash

MARKETS "ADVANCE NEWS."
"The professional black litigant walks
Into a first-class hotel in a city where
he knows the civil rights clause is still
a living affair and begins to write his
name on the register.
" 'Not a room left in the house,' re
marks the clerk, knowing about half
the rooms to be vacant.
" That so?' eays the colored man
'Are you absolutely certain of that?*
" 'Certainest thing you eyer heard,*
replies the clerk.
"The colored man strolls out and two
minutes later his white side worker,
an impressive looking man, steps off
a car or out of a carriage In front of
the hotel, walks In, registers. Is re
ceived effusively by the clerk, and gets
his pick of a whole lot of roomsâ and
there's another case for the profession
al black litigant. -
OX SLEEPING GARS.

"He has a case In law for extortion*
under the civil rights clause. He.
clinches his case â I speak now of a *
case that .actually happened In New
York not long ago â by sending Into
the barroom, after he himself leaves
It, a white confederate â mkny of tho
professional black litigants have these
white working partners.
"The white partner calls for a milk
punch, gets it, drinks it and pays the
regular market price for milk punches.
That's the finishing touch to the pro
fessional black litigant's case.
"Or, supposing the bartender, finding
that his black customer is willing to
pay the dollar demanded for a milk
punch, says:
" 'I've got no milk.'
" 'There are several bottles of milk
on ice in that case behind the bar,' re
plies the black man, having the lay of
the land all fixed before setting about
to build up his case, and I am speak
ing again of a case that actually hap
pened.
"That milk soured during the thun
derstorm this morning,"aBays the bar
keep.
" 'O, it did?' says the black man, and
he walks out.
"He immediately send3 his white con
federate into the barroom. The white
confederate gets a milk punch manu
factured out of sweet milk from one of
the bottles that the colored man haa
previously pointed out to the side-step
ping bartenderâ and there's the case.
Games like these are worked 'time and
again by the professional black liti
gants and they get by with them in
New York courts more often than they
lose out.
"'All right," says the professional
black litigant, and If the bartender puts
up no further excuse and serves the
drink the colored man . drinks It, pays
his dollar and walks out.
HAVE WHITE AliMES.
A lawyer was speaking of the inci
dent at Oyster Bay, President Roose
velt's home, the other day, in which
the white barber declined to shave the
colored preacher.
"It may not be generally known,"
said the lawyer, "that there Is a con
siderable class of professional litigants
among the colored people of New York.
They make a business of suing rail
roads and sleeping car companies and
proprietors of hotels, restaurants, bar
rooms, ice cream parlors and soda wa
ter fountains for refusing to grant
them the rights and privileges which
are freely accorded white persons.
"The professional black litigants
have many ways of meeting and beat-
Ing the scheme of the white purveyors
of commodities and accommodations
who desire only white patronage. The
professional black litigant, for exam
ple, walks Into a barroom that he
knows is a drinking place exclusively
for white men and . calls for a milk
punch.
" 'Milk punch costs %l to-day," says
the barkeep, thinking that the black
will Immediately go out and take the
air.
"The "Fashoda incident" of 1S9S had
an element of the;comic In it, but the
stock exchanges took it somewhat
seriously. Fire-eating Major Marchand,
with a French commission and a native
convoy, had penetrated the African
jungle to a point on the Upper Nile
claimed as Egyptian territory, Â» ; and
therefore as to .Great Britain,
There he set up the colors of France.
Sir Herbert Kitchener, moved deliber
ately down to . put . him back , Into
French domain. The ; question was,
would the two forces collide? s
Consols had opened September *- : at
110%. French rentes at 102% ; they fell
to 109% and 102, respectively, but that
was alL Kitchener behaved with ex
emplary discretion, and while Mar
chand did not, he only succeeded in ex
citing laughter, because, while his ve
hement protests were arriving. It .was
well-known that he was out of food
and living on Kitchener's good-natured
hospitality. It apparently under
stood by all well-informed people^ from
the start, that .when the j Paris news
papers had been allowed a few weeks
of Inflammatory outburst, M. Delcasse
would yield gracefully, as, In fact, he
did. Market 9 refused to be frightened
and -were quite warranted Â¦ In ' dolngr so.
The war scarÂ© was a matter of news-
MARCHAND AND FASHODA.
The "war scare" at the end of 1S95
and the beginning of 1836 was equally
sensational. First came President
Cleveland's "Venezuela message" of
December 19, on which British consols
in five days broke from 107% to 105%.
with a crash on the general English
and American stock markets which will
be well remembered. From this col
lapse a rapid recovery ensued, and con
sols were back to 107% when, on
Wednesday, January 1. came the news
of the Jameson raid. The price fell by
the close of the week to 105%. The Ger
man Emperor's telegram to President
Kruger less than one week afterward
and the hasty mobilization of the Brit
ish flying squadron sent It down to
105%. Yet this cloud, too, blew over
as quickly and completely as the oth
ers; the Jameson prisoners were' re
leased by Kruger, Germany explained,
the Venezuelan quarrel went to an ar
bitration board and by January 16 con
sols were back at 108.
The first and perhaps the most nota
ble was the high sensation over the
"Pendjeh affair" in 1885. A boundary
dispute on the Afghanistan frontier be
tween Russia and England had not
greatly influenced the markets until in
March the Russian troops suddenly
moved on the Afghans in the disputed
passes. At the close of March the Rus
sian general, Komaroff. had summoned
the Afghans to surrender; they had re
fused on the advice of the English com
mander, whereupon they were attacked
and routed. Consols, which in March
had fallen from 98% to 96%, had recov
ered to 98 again when the news of this
fight came in on April 7. In two days
they broke again to 94%, with French
rentes falling 2\i points, and the Lon
don Stock Exchange was In a condi
tion of which a financial critic wrote:
"To find a parallel we should have to
go back to the commencement of the
Franco-German war." But England
and Russia did not fight. M. de Gierg,
speaking for Russia, alluded to "this
regrettable incident." The dispute was
referred to the King of Denmark, and
by May, when negotiations were re
sumed, consols and rentes were above
their price for March.
THE VENEZUELA MESSAGE.
The fact that this week's "war scare"
occurred when a war was already go
ing on was not unusual. Such scares
are regular incidents of both politics
and markets whenever a war is going
on. The flutter In our markets during
the episode with the German Admiral
Diedrich, at Sublg Bay In the Philip
pines, during July, 1898, was one, but a
very small one. The Russian advance
on Constantinople, in 1878, when the
treaty of peace with Turkey was under
consideration, and England's prompt
dispatch of its fleet to the Bosporus,
was another case in point. A far more
interesting case was that of the "Trent
affair," in November, 1861, when Cap
tain" "Wilkes* seizure of Mason and Sli
dell from the British ship brought
England and this country close to the
verge of war. This was a case where
the markets grasped the situation's
real meaning very slowly. It was only
when the attitude of Lord Palmerston
became known to the London bankers
and their friends that the crash began,
which brought United States 6 per
cents to S3. as against 95% before the
incident, and sent down British 3 per
cent consols to 89*4, as against an
earlier price of 94. But, as a rule, the
most interesting "war scare" chapters
on the markets have been those where
the possibility of war appeared sud
denly in the diplomatic sky and took
the markets fairly oft their guard. - Of
this there are three notable precedents
in the' past generation.
AFGHANISTAN IN 1885.
WAR SCARES IX WAR TIME.
The sudden fright of the foreign
stock markets over the passage of
Russian privateers through the Bos
porus and the seizure of English and
German mails has had all the ear
marks of a traditional "European
war scare." British consols dropped
a full point, French rentes }Â£. and
prices on all European bourses fell
steadily for three days. Then they
began to recover and it was character
istic that recovery set In while actual
news of the action of England and
Russia was most disquieting. The
Paris banking community had appar
ently learned from the highest quar
ters what the Russian Government
proposed to do before any outside
channel of news had been similarly
favored. The episode naturally excit
ed reminiscence, for the "war scares"
are landmarks in the history of Euro
pean .finance and some of them are
the best of all reflections of historic
incidents.

VIAVI. \
A WAV TO HEALTHâ Home treatment for
mothers and daughters. A stenographer
wriUs: "I was wretched and Viavl has
rcido too feel that life is still worth the
living. My trouble was leucorrhoea, from
which I had suffered for fifteen years. Dur-
ing this time there are not many remedies
one could mention I had not tried. From
nervous DroRtration was obliged to give up
my work for two years; when I did resume
I was far from fit for It, and think now I
could not have continued it but for Viavi.
I heard of it about this time, but thought
it was like all the other medicines I had
tried, when a friend said she had investi-
gated its merits before commencing its use,
and that it was all that was claimed for
It. I beran Its use with many misgivings.
To be brief, Viavi has donn more for me in
!e*s than one year's time than all the med-
iclnee and doctors did during fifteen years
that I Buffered and doctored for this trou-
ble. I etlll use It occasionally. Many girls
puffer. Mothers should not let It run on,
as mine did. but use Viavl and be cured."

means of sticks, the snake was put
into a box. It was more than seven
feet. long and three inches ln diameter
at the thickest place. The copperhead
is still at large.

ers. Every* seat had an occupant and
every telling point -made on the stage
was followed by the hand-clapping
that goes like balm to the nerves of
both manager and mummer on an
opening night. Nor was the audience
of the kind that is predisposed to flat
ter. Socially speaking,. it was a hetero
geneous assemblage. While the boxes
contained costly raiment and jewels,
the remainder of the house was largely
filled by folk who were not there for
sartorial display, but to watch the per
formance and judge it on Its merits.
Applause from these folk means much.

the fact that the differences existing
between certain departments of the
Â«ity government should have led to
the disfigurement of our principal
thoroughfare during the visit of fo
large a nvmber of welcome guests."
The Federation of Mission Improve

passed the following resolution:
The Board of Works yesterday
Issued orders that the street in front
of the Pheian building be barricaded
owing to the bad condition of the
pavement.
The Board of Works has been un
successful in its efforts to induce the
Board of Supervisors to appropriate
money out of the urgent necessity
fund to repair the pavement. The con
tractor for repairs refuses to do the
work, as it is a special pavement, not
included in his contract, and the
Works Board holds that it has been
crippled by the Supervisors, who not
only cut down their allowance, but
apportioned it for specific purposes.
Commissioners Schmitz and Mae
ptretti at 5 o'clock yesterday after
noon superintended the barricading
of the block. Planks were laid, over
the alleged dangerous holes to pre
vent teaming traffic. They will not
stop progress of pedestrians when the
barricades ai* taken up for the pa
rades on Monday and Tuesday. Signs
tv ere put up at each end reading as
follows:
'â¢Notice to the Public â This street
is barricaded because the Board of
Supervisors in. its continuous effort to
injure the administration of Mayor
Schmitz hns refused to furnish the
necessary funds to repair this pave
ment. In its present state it is a con
stant menace to life and limb. The
following Supervisors are directly re
pponsible for this shameful condition:
Brandenstriii. Braunhart, - Booth.
Comte. Connor, Eggers, D'Ancona.
