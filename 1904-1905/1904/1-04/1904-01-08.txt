AND â¢ PORTRAIT OF-'A.-FA
MOUS â¢ DIPLOMAT. V â¢> SS !
Japan's attitude was outlined in
dispatches received to-day by the
department from Minister Gris
com in Tokio and some of trie
American Embassadors in Eu
rope. These advices agree that
Japan will positively refuse to ac
cept the Russian proposal that a
neutral zone embracing nearlv
one-third of Korea be established,
and would insist upon *be main
tenance of the territorial integrity
of China and Korea, while willing
to recognize Russia's special in
terests in Manchuria in return for
recognition by Russia of Japan's
special interests in Korea. The
tone of the department's advices is
not hopeful and sensational news
will not surprise the officials here
Rumors in Japan that the
(JALL BUREAU, 1406. G
STREET, N. W., WASHING
TON, Jan. 7. â A prominent
official of the War Department,
who refused to permit the use of
his name, declared this afternoon
that war between Russia and
Japan was almost certain. He add
ed that news of the beginning of
hostilities might be received in
.^Vi^ir^on^withTn "the ' next
twenty-four hours, although he
did not look for a rupture of Rus
so-Japanese relations for a week
or ten days.
"The situation is such," said
the War Department official,
"that the clash between the forces
of Russia and Japan may occur at
any moment, and in any event
cannot much longer be averted."
READY TO INVADE KOREA.
Information came to the State
Department this evening from one
of its diplomatic agents in Europe
that 35,000 Japanese troops . are
ready to be landed in Korean ter
ritory. On account of this and
other advices the administration
practically abandoned its hopeful
view. The statement concerning
the 35,000 Japanese troops was
sent as a "report," but the high
standing and reliability of the
sender give it the greatest conse
quence in the minds of the au
thorities. It conforms to advices
cabled to the State Department
within the past twenty-four hours
by the American diplomatic estab
lishments in Tokio and the capi
tals of Europe, indicating that
the Russian response to the last
Japanese proposals was unsatis
factory to Japan and showing that
the situation was very grave in
deed.

War Corresponderits Sail.
Among- the war correspondents that
sailed on the Siberia yesterday were:
Captain Lionel James of the London
Times. Percival Phillips of the Lon
don Daily Express and Frederick
Palmer of Collier's Weekly. All of
them, however, arrived in the city in
time to board the liner before she
pulled out from the wharf at 2:30 yes
terday afternoon.
James served in a British volunteer
regiment through England's recent
war in South Africa and the smell of
powdef is familiar to his nostrils.
Phillips, although on the staff of a
London newspaper, ia an American by
birth. He received his journalistic
training in the local rooms- of the New
xork newspapers.. He is related to
Attorney General Knox arid is prouder
of his Yankee citizenship than of the
important assignment upon which, his
paper hag sent him. He thinks a good
aeal of his paper, which is owned by
Alfred Harmsworth, and is said to
come nearer the American idea of a
news Journal than any other paper
published in the British Isles.
Palmer is by no means a new man
in the war corresponding: field. He
served as . the. correspondent of Col
lier s Weekly in the Spanish-American
War and is a capable man."

According to the Standard's Tokio
correspondent, an increasing number of
steamships are requisitioned daily as

The correspondent of the Daily Mail

newspaper Chuo that one Japanese has
been murdered near Port- Arthur and
that four others have been injured. -

FAMED CORRESPONDENT.
The Call and the Herald, in
keeping with their policy of giv
ing to the public the most accu
rate and quickest news service in
the United States, and, realizing
the grave character which the sit
uation in the Orient has assumed,
at once decided to place in the
field a special correspondent. Hav
ing been always first in â¢ the
presentation of news in all inter
national matters, The Call and the
Herald selected in Mr. Davis a
man who is equaled by none in
the country. Mr. Davis is an
experienced war correspondent
and a sagacious and farseeing
writer. He is a keen observer and
one not given to spreading rumors
stream below Alcatraz. The decks
of the steamer presented an ani
mated sight as the tug drew up
alongside. Passengers crowded
to the steamer's sides to see the
late arrival. Mr. Davis, who was
accompanied by his wife and
child, climbed up a steep ladder
to the towering deck of the liner,
which had been waiting since 2 130

or sensations. With him at the
seat of the differences between
Russia ajnd Japan, which have at
this time reached such a critical
stage that any day may bring
forth a declaration of war from
either of the nations, the Herald
and The Call will be in an excel
lent position to keep their readers
accurately informed of all that
transpires in the Orient.
WILL HURRY TO T0KI0.
Mr. Davis will disembark at
Yokohama and proceed at once to
Tokio to ascertain the exact situ*
ation that the trouble has as
sumed during the time he will
have been cut off from the world
on shipboard. He will go with
the Japanese troops and rough it
as a soldier, being constantly at
the front of operations, where he
can see all that transpires.
Oscar King Davis- is well
known in newspaper and literary
circles. He served as a war
correspondent for the New York
Sun and Harper's Weekly during
the Spanish-American War and
the Philippine insurrection. He
was also correspondent in China
during the trouble in 1900. Davis
was born in Bachvinsville in 1866.
He graduated from Colgate Uni
versity in 1888 and a short time
afterward began work as a news
paper man on the New York Sun.
He has written several books,
among which are "Our Con
quests in the Pacific," '-Dewey's
Capture of Manila" and "Sher
reaf's Exclusion."
It is insisted at the Japanese .leg*.-:
tlon that Japan never requested the
view of/ Russia upon the question of
dispatching troops to Korea, and it is
asserted ; that this action would be|
taken, if necessary, without consulta
tion with, that- Government. . :*/Â¦
PARIS, Jan. 7.-A dispatch to the
Patrie from Constantinople says that
Russia is negotiating with Turkey to
permit her Black Sea' fleet, said to con
sist of seventy-six ships, to pass
through the Straits of the â¢Dardanelles.
Officials and diplomatic circles here
claim to be' without information re
garding the contents " of the Russian
reply to Japan, but the tone is dis
tinctly ..'pessimistic and there are but
slight hopes of a peaceful exit from the
position in which" Russia and Japan
find themselves."
The diplomats are making inquiries
as to the attitude of the powers in case
of war, that to be adopted by the
United States being regarded as par
ticularly important. The Japanese
Minister said to-day.
"The attitude of the United States
will mean much. She has negotiated a
treaty with China for the opening of
three ports In Manchuria to the com
merce of the world. These ports have
been occupied by Russia and thus her
treaty rights have been violated. Japan
is not guided by selfish motives, but is
acting in the interest of all nations. I
hope the United States will clearly un
derstand our position and will favor 'us
with.IW support.'* ' *:â¢â¢<?'.Â¦-',
â¢ The'-Chineae legation claims.', to be
without information in regard to the
attitude at China* regarding v the war.'
It was said that'at the outset ;it was
certain neutrality would be proclaimed,
but in case of Japanese victories it
would not. surprise the legation if the.
Chinese should cast their lot with
Japan. This would seriously embar
rass Russia, not because of the im
portance of the Chinese as a fighting
force, but because of the danger of the
interruption of the Russian communi
cations.
The action of the United States in
sending marines *to Seoul is regarded
here la being a "significant indication
of the trend of its sympathies," and
it la known to be gratifying to' Japan j
because" it establishes a precedent
which the Japanese can follow, if ned
essary, in debarking a strong force bn
the peninsula. : : . ;
Russia Wants to Send Black Sea Fleet
Through Dardanelles.
NEGOTIATING "WITH TURKEY'.
Russian marines, iVho 'landed at Che
mulpo and were refused transporta
tion to Seoul over the Japanese rail
way, have reached the capital, jnarch-
Ink overland. Minister Allen's dis
patch is very brief, reading simply:
. Russian marines marched to-day
(yesterday) to Seoul." '
The railroad between Chemulpo and
Seoul is a single line steam road, and
owing: to its meagre equipment it is
believed at the State Department that
the Japanese officers declined to trans
port the Russian marines over it only
because of lack of rolling stock.
It is understood that the purpose in
sending American marines in such
haste to the Korean capital ahead of
all European marines was because of
a desire to protect not only the Amer
ican legation, in the ; Korean capital,
but also the property of the Chemulpo
electriq railway and the electric light
works, in"b'6th of which Americans are
interested' largely, i Colbrand and
Bostwick, the former a naturalized
American citizen, built -this railway
and also the 'railway conecting Seoul
with Chemulpo, which latter property
was ultimately purchased by the Jap
anese; ',Â¦";;â¢;
There are other large American in
terests in Korea; in fact, It is said at
the State Department that they are,
perhaps, more important than those
of any other nation.
\The death of the Empress Dowager
is likely seriously to complicate the,
situation at Seoul. Following the very
rigid etiquette of the Korean court, the
Emperor must now go into an extend
ed period of mourning, which certain
ly will last thirty days and has been
kpown to cover a period of two years.
During this' time of mourning the Em
peror absolutely refuses to touch any
public business, so that it is feared
that Allen, our .Minister, will be pre
cluded from urging his request for the
opening of- the Wiju as a trade port.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALt t FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 190*.
TOKIQ, Jan. 8.-â Russia's 'reply to/. Japan practically removes all hope of a peaceful settlement. Russia has made new demands,
which it wHl be impossible and the British bluejackets landed at
Chemulpo are expected to go to Seoul immediately Constant telegrams are passing between M. Povloff, the Russian Minister to Korea;
Baron de Rosen, the Russian Minister to Japan, and Viceroy Alexieff. The Japanese nation is deeply stirred. Public sentiment favors
the abandonment of negotiations, believing them to be useless, and urges a resort to arms.

District Attorney Summers, in his (
opening statement, said the evidence
would show Senator Dietrich's election
as United States Senator. He recited
the details of the alleged transaction,
by which the appointment of Post
master Fisher was made. The evidence
would show, he said, that Dietrich re
quested William j Dutton to notify
Fisher that if the latter would pay
5500 for certain postomce fixtures and
turn them over to the Government and
in addition thereto .pay 5S00 In cash to
him (Dietrich) Fisher would be t ap
pointed postmaster; that Dutton so no
tified Fisher; that a conference fol
lowed between Fisher and Dietrich, ar
ranged by .Dutton, during the course
of which the terms of the appointment
were agreed upon and that Fisher had
admitted that the alleged transaction
had been closed between himself and
Senator Dietrich.
OMAHA, Jan. 7.â The trial of United
States Senator Dietrich on an indict- [
ment alleging bribery in connection j
with the appointment of a postmaster
at Hastings, Nebr., progressed rapidly j
to-day until a point was reached wher<s
the first witness for the Government
was placed on the stand, when General
Cowin. chief counsel for Senator Diet
rich, interposed a demurrer on the
ground that Dietrich had not taken
the oath and was not, therefore, a
United States Senator when the alleged
bribery* occurred.
This question was acknowledged by
counsel for both sides to be a new one
and each had prepared arguments on
the subject. The court will hand down
an opinion to-morrow morning.

Schwab then testified as to the ex
tent of his holdings of shipbuilding
stock, and produced a list of the" men
who aided him in procuring the cash
whereby Morgan & Co. were paid for
the Bethlehem plant when it was
turned over to the shipbuilding com
pany. Counsel agreed to keep this list
from publication- Schwab said that
rie. until their tempers were apparently
strained nearly to the breaking point.
In this statement it was said that
Schwab had deposited his holdings of
SS50.000 worth of first mortgage bonds
iof the shipbuilding company under the
Sheldon agreement. Schwab admitted
that the statement was inaccurate, be
rause he did not hold that amount of
bonds, but he claimed that the inac
curacy was due to- the preparation of
the statement by Max Pam, his per
sonal counsel, and the fact that his
Schwab understood, he testified, that
before he obtained the option under
which Bethlehem was transferred to
J. P. Morgan & Co., in lS01,,a. prior op
tion had existed, expiring only a few
days before his was procured, the first
option calling for a price of 523 50 per
share and his far 524 per share.
John "vV*. Gates, the witness testified,
had assumed half of his (Schwab's)
subscription to the first mortgage bonds
of the United States Shipbuilding Com
pany, otherwise Schwab still retained
his original holdings of the shipbuild
ing bonds.
Â¦ Schwab wa- asked about -The state
ment given to the press in his name
immediately after this suit was begun,
jhe statement repelling the charge of
fraud, and expressing confidence in the
Sheldon reorganization plan. This
Hne of questioning developed a
heated three-cornered colloquy be
tween Schwab. Untermyer and Guth-
OPTION'S OX BETIILEIIE3f

to the Bethlehem plant and Schwab's
connection therewith, which, the wit
ness said, had existed since May. 1901.
though he was familiar with its history
since the formation of the company.
til within the last few months.
Schwab said that he bought the
Bc-thlehem property shortly after the
f ale of the^ Carnegie properties to the
Fteel corporation. He did not regard
the value paid in securities for the con
stituent plants of the steel corpora
tion as at all inflated. Against Guth
rie's advice, Schwab said that, since
the formation of the steel corporation.
he had sold a considerable amount of
Fteel securities, but an examination of
his accounts would show that most of
1 he sales were bonds, and that despite
the sale of some of the stock he be
lieved himself to be the largest owner
of steel stock.
"So far as properties with which I
am connected are concerned there has
been none, except so far as due to a
period of general prosperity."
The crest of the wavf of prosperity
in the steel industry, he said, was co
incident with the formation of the steel
Â« corporation, but the demand, he de
< !ared. had not fallen off materially un-
"Has there not been a period of in
flation in the steel business during the
last five years?"
You are considered the leading ex
pert in that line, are you not?" was
a?ked.
"I do not take that honor to myself,
he answered.
FALLING OFF IX DEMAND.
â¢ NEW YORK, Jan. 7.â Charles M.
Schwab, ex/-president of the United
States Steel Corporation, took the
stand to-day, in the hearing to make
permanent the receivership over the
United States Shipbuilding Company,
to tell of his connection with the sale
of the Bethlehem Steel Company to the
shipyards concern.
. The attendance at the hearing, which
had fa5!en off during the taking of tes
tiir.ony, was greatly increased to-day,
interesting testimony being expected
from the man who arranged the sale
of the Bethlehem plant from J. P. Mor-
Ban & Co.. to whom he had transferred
It as svndicate managers, to the Unit
ed States Shipbuilding Company, the
arrangement being such. Receiver
Smith alleges, that the shipbuilding
company has been unable to control the
Bethlehem company or gain possession
of its earnings to keep the shipbuilding
company from insolvency.
Counsel Untermyer. for the complain
ant bondholders, protective Association,
immediately began the examination of
the witness. Schwab gave his age as
41 and said he had at present no occu
pation, having ceased to be president
of the United States Steel Corporation.
He had no connection, executive or ad
'Visory. with the Bethlehem Steel Com
pany* at this time, he said, though he
had "an enormous pecuniary Interest
in that company." He severed his con
nection with the management of the
company on account -of his going
abroad in 1302. His whole life, he said,
had been connected with the steel in
dustry.
Continuing his testimony, Schwab j
said he did not know whether any of i
his shipbuilding stock was registered
in his own name. A large part of it,
he said, no doubt was registered in the
name of Oliver Wrenn of his office, but |
he refused to answer when asked if, in
the case of the shipbuilding company
and other industrial enterprises, large
parts of this stock were not carried in
the name of his employes. He said
that the actual beneficial ownership,
so far as stock liability was concerned,
was his.
TOOIi OX ARMOR PLATE.
The witness said he had known
Lewis Nixon, president of the United
States Shipbuilding Company, for a
long time, socially and in a business
way. Before the shipbuilding consoli
dation his (witness') acquaintance
with this industry was slight.
â¢'Did you know that the Government,
when it asked the Carnegie Company
to build an armor plant, expected the
two to compete for contracts in good
faith?" Untermver asked Schwab.
"No, the Government did not,"
Schwab answered, saying that the
understanding with the Government
Â¦was that the two companies were to
share the work at a price understood i
by the Government before the bids
were submitted.
As bearing upon his knowledge of
steel properties in 1901 and 1902
Schwab was asked if he had not been
interested in the organization of the
American Steel Foundries' Association
and other steel properties and consoli
dations, but he declined to answer, ex
cept to say that he was not. interested,
except as an underwriter, in the foun
dries" association, and that he could
form no opinion as to whether the val
ues of steel plants were inflated at the
time.
During a series of objections over a
question about the amount of steel
stock held by Schwab, Untermyer said
.that his intention in asking this line
of questions was to show that the
prices paid for the constituent plants
of the steel corporation had a great
effect in inflating the prices asked for
other similar plants and that if it were
shown that Schwab had parted with
much of his stock it would indicate in
flation. During the colloquy Guthrie
protested against this line of inquiry
as an outrage and asked the examiner
to suspend the examination until the
matter could be certified to the court.
RESENTS COUNSEr/S QUESTION'.
Schwab declined to state the amount
of steel stocks and bonds he now held
or had sold, declaring that he did not
intend to permit such an investigation
of his private business by Untermyer.
The witness accepted Guthrie's advice
not to answer in regard to a long series
of questions along this line.
"Mr. Guthrle is my personal coun
sel in this and all other litigation," he
said.
DECTJXES TO GIVE ANSWERS.
Untermyer asked if the sale of the
steel properties to the corporation at
that time had any effect upon the
values of steel properties; but. follow
ing the advice of Guthrie, Schwab de
clined to answer that question or to
make any statement regarding alleged
inflation of the value of the Bethle
hem plant.
Schwab testified that at the time the
Bethlehem plant was in competition
with subsidiary plants of the United
States Steel Corporation in the manu
facture of armor, but in no other re
spect, the bulk of Bethlehem's business
consisting of the manufacture of armor
plate, projectiles, guns and gun forg
ings, etc.
Max Pam was on the list, but he de
clined to state whether the list in
cluded high officials of the steel cor
poration. The arrangement was, he
said, that the shipbuilding securities,
representing: the proffTin the trans
action, were to be shared an\ong e
associates proportionately to the
amount of money contributed by each
to the pool, and the allotment of the
$10,000,000 bonds had already been
made on this basis. The allotment of
stock/- he said, was never made,
having been postponed until the ex
pense of the transaction could be as
certained, and he still retained all of
the stock â 520,000.00. Schwab testi
fied that of the bonds allotted he. had
repurchased all but J495.000, being
now the owner of $9,505,000 worth of
the $10,000,000 bond issue'.
Schwab said he was not a defend
ant in the present suit, but that he
had retained counsel personally.

for seven months. It was more pro-

and I was at a loss to know what to do
to set relief when I read an account of
Doan's Kidney Pills being a specific for
just such symptoms as I had. The use
of the pills clearly proved that what has
been said about them is not over-esti-

death of one man and injury to
twenty. . " . Â¦ .* < ~-
Wilson declared that another man
is in the penitentiary serving a sen

ease his own conscience and give this
man his freedom that he has surren

fire the hotel intentionally, but that
he accidental dropped a burning
match in the hallway and when he
saw the flames spring up he ran off
instead of raising an alarm. He fled
straight to St. Louis and later learned

' . SALT LAKE, JariT 7.â One hundred
street car men; infuriated by the mur
der of Motorman John Gleason and
the mortal wounding of Conductor
Thomas B. Brighton by a lone masked
highwayman early this morn_ing, made
an ineffectual attempt ttf-night to
storm the city jail and lynch John
Shockleigh,^ who wasarrested during
thes afternoon on information fur
nished by his roommate, Bert Pro
thero. Prothero toKL the police that
Shockleigh had, confessed to the mur
der upon his return home early this
morning. Shockleigh , ! denied all
knowledge of, the crime when arrest
ed, but was unable to give a satisfac
tory explanation of his whereabouts
at; the time the murder was commit
ted. ' .
Conductor Brighton died at the hos
pital- to-night.
. The news that the highwayman had
been captured spread with startling ra- v
pidity throughout the city and within
half an hour fully 100 persons, mostly
fellow employes fit the murdered men,
had gathered In front of the- jail, cry
ing loudly for the prisoner. The- action
of the crowd became so threatening
that every available patrolman and
deputy sheriff was held at the station
to protect the prisoner in case an at;
tempt was made to storm the jail.
Shortly before 6 o'clock a number of
the men forced their way into the jail
yard from the rear and were prepar
ing to batter down the door,- when they
were discovered" by the officers and
driven away.
"We. want that man!" yelled the
crowd. "He belongs tcr us and we are
going to have. 'him!" .:
As the crowd showed no inclination
to disperse, the police resoried to
strategy. They sounded an alarm of
fire from the engine-house next door
and during the temporary absence of
the crowd Shockleigh was hustled into
a closed carriage* and quickly driven
to the State prison, a few miles away,
where he was safe from all mob vio
lence.
When the crowd returned they were
informed that the prisoner had been
taken to the penitentiary and, to satis
fy them on that point, a committee of
carmen was allowed to go through
the building. After fhis the crowd dis
persed. â¢ Â¦ '-.
Engineer Raridan of the freight
train, which collided -with the passed
ger, testified that Benjamin had told
him immediately after the accident
that he had no orders to meet the
freight. Raridan also reported a con
versation he had with Conductor
Nagle in the hospital. Nagle said to
him: _
"Engineer Benjamin may as well
come . here and own up to the truth.
His action in disregarding the orders
caused the wreck."
TOPEKA, Kan., Jan. 7. â An official
investigation of the Rock Island
wreck at Willard was started here
this afternoon by Coroner Sllver
thorne.' Testimony was taken which
showed the . eastbound freight train
had orders to pass the passenger
train at Willard. No inquiry as to the
responsibility of the passenger crew
was made, on account of ""the inability
of Engineer Benjamin and Conductor
Nagle to be present. The engineer Is
suffering .from nervous prostration at
his home in Kansas City and the con
ductor is In a hospital here. As soon
as these witnesses can be present, the
inquiry will be resumed. .
It is announced that whoever is re
sponsible for the wreck will be held
on a charge of manslaughter.
It was announced at the Inquest to
day that the "train dispatchers in this
city learned that one train had left
Mapie Hill arid the- other had left
Willard.' knowing that no human
power couni prevent a. collision, they
immediately ordered out the wreck
ers. They also notified the Maple Hill
doctors to get ready for service. The
doctors received this notice eight
minutes before , the \ereck occurred
and reached the scene of the acci
dent thirty minutes later. Dr. Silver
thorne, the Coroner, is a surgeon and
operates a hospital at McFarland for
the Rock Island road.
' McQuillan did justice to the drink
nr.d came up smiling for another.
T5ut s'ar! that smile was his last. He
no sooner finished smacking- his lips
than he reeled over and fell to the
floor with a heavy thud. The barten
der hastily picked him up and set him
in a chnir. thinking thaf his customer
had merely fallen in a drunken fit.
But The man could not be roused,
so the bartender, becoming alarmed,
informed a policeman. By this time
Tho body of McQuillan had become
Â¦Heri<1 : n d^rirh. It was removed to the
Morcae, where an autopsy will be
held. ââ¢
It seemed to strike the .mariner as
being about the proper thing to fol
low the whisky, and he disposed of
the red fluid without much ceremony.
He was still willing to continue, and
the bartender was willing that he
should, find forthwith handed out an
other schooner of the red stuff.
This disappeared even faster than
the first, and so the bartender filled
up another glass and prepared to mix
something else for the sailor as soon
as the third schooner of the evi
dently pleasing beverage had gone the
route of the other two.
This the famished sailor absorbed
in a trice, anÂ£ a smile overspread
his countenance as he thought of the
other drinks that were coming. The
bartender lived ur> to his agreement,
and when the whisky was all gone
handed the sailor a big schooner of
claret.
McQuillan entered the place late
last night and made a talk to the bar
render to the effect that a thirst had
< apUvated him and that, a drink
would be a godsend. The bartender
then did what most bartenders would
not do. He informed the .man in
front of the counter the he was wel
come to all that he could drink and
commented by handing the thirsty
man a pint of whisky.
Just because he partook of the gen
erosity of a wuter-front bartender
Darney McQuillan â¢ fell dead after
drinking a pint of whisky and three
schooners of claret late last night. The
tragedy took place in the Progreso
saloon, at 28 East street, and when
the sailor fell lifeless to the floor the
bartender closed up his place of
business.
After being brought to Berkeley the
specimen was permitte'd to lie In the
university museum for a year or more,
there being no instruments sufficiently
delicate to chisel out the remains with
out injury. A high-power dental en
gine was recently received, however,
and the work was carried on until the
whole form of the animal was exposed.
Professor Merriam says the remains
represent not only a new species, a new
family and a new genus, but a new or
der, a statement the importance of
which will be appreciated by scientists
as a very considerable one. He believes
that it will also be valuable in assist
ing scientists in other parts of the
world to clear up some mysteries that
now prevail in palaeontological science,
particularly In regard to a number of
specimens now- In museums that they
are unable to classify and which may
be found to belong to this newly dis
covered group. â¢
The animal appears to have been of
a family entirely unknown to palaeon
tologists, and has been named the Tha
lattosaurus. It Is a huge sea lizard
and is estimated to have been at least
seven feet long. Originally It was a
shore form, but became after a long
period a marine animal.
The specimen was found in the
Shasta limestone pits not 100 feet from
the spot where the Shastasaurus, the
most perfect of its kind in the world,
was discovered two years ago by the
university scientists. It Is supposed to
have been derived from the same group
of ancestors as the ichthyosaurus. It
differs in a number of ways, however,
from the genus ichthyosaurus, but
more especially in the structure of the
teeth and the roof of the. mouth.
The Shasta fossil beds, those lime
stone areas in Shasta County that have
been so prolific In the production of the
remains of prehistoric extinct animals,
tiave yielded still another specimen new
to the scientific" world and the zoological
kingdom. It was discovered by John
C. Merriam, professor of palaentology
at the University of California, who
has just announced it after two years
of labor, having kept it a secret until
he was. certain of his premises.

of Mme. Emanuel Marie Paget. A
large number of her friends gathered
at the home of the revered woman, s-j
long Intimately associated with the
Town and Gown of Berkeley, and apokÂ»
their final farewell. They brought flow
eraâdelicate messages of loveâ and
spread them upon the bier of their
frfend, last tokens of their esteem and
reverence *for a good woman.
The services began at 10:30 o'clock
and were conducted by Rev. Joseph
Worcester, pastor of tha Swedenborgian
church of San Francisco, the most in
timate friend of the late Professor and
Mme. Paget. The minister spoke of
the influence for good that had been
exerted by the lives of his friends, an
Influence that will not pass away with
them, but that will live on. This was
as much due to the example of blind
devotion that she had set for her hus
band and he for his wife as to the kind
liness and sympathy and generosity
with which both had received their
friends.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.â Rear Ad
miral Evans, commander in chief of
the Asiatic fleet, which recently made
a cruise from Yokohama to Honolulu,
says that the cruiser squadron made
twelve and a half knots and was
c-bllged/to droo the collier because it
was deficient in speed, and that the
battleships could have increased . the
speed a knot or a knot and a half. As
to the performance of the battleships
under, trying conditions of -weather in
the great Pacific swells the admiral has
this to say: - >
: "Heavy swells with practically no
wind continued from the fourth day
out until the third day before arriving:
at Honolulu. ' and I dc-ubt whether at
any .time during my experience of
forty-two years I have seen swells so
uniformly high as was experienced. I
estfmate that the height from crest to
hollow of the waves, for about three
days of . this run, ranged as bieh as
thirty, feet, and the general average
heightrof the swells would be at least
twenty feet! The behavior, of the bat
tleships'during this weather was par
ticularly good, and their speed practl
cally,notat all hampered. The Oregon,
considering | her.age and design, acted
particularly, well throughout the pas
sage. ' During the entire trip, the en
gines of 1 none of the three battleships
was stopped except for thirty minutes

George W. Stetson of Bingham,

made the asbestos curtain, said that
there were two kinds of asbestos cur
tains, one in which a fine brass wire
was interwoven, the other being with
out wire. Both curtains were of equal
use against flames, the wire being
merely to provide greater tensile
strength to the fabric. When asked
by Coroner Traeger how he accounted
for the burning up of his fireproof
cr.rlaln. Stetson replied that he did
not believe it had burned up, and that
he had every reason to believe that it
did not. In his opinion, the greater
part of the curtain was lying: at the
present \ time on the theater stage,
covered with soot and ice.

"I hollered and hollered for them to
lower the curtain and then I felt what
I should describe as a cyclone. It was
a whirl of smpke and when 1 looked
around the scenery had broken and
was flying all around me. There was
a heavy, cold draught, evidently from
the outside, and there was an explosion
of some kind, as though . you would
light a match and the whole box woula
go off. I did not know whether to go
front or back, as it looked about an
even thing for my life no matter which
way I went. Then I thought of my boy
and that perhaps the man did not take
him out. so I went to the back door. I
went out and found my boy in the al
ley."
Foy testified that the only precau-
During the second act Foy testified
he was in his dressing-room and heard
a noise, to which he at first paid little
attention. The noise grew louder, and
being anxious about his son he ran to
the theater stage, picked up the boy
right in front of the switchboard and
saw a fireman trying to put out the
fire. He ran with the boy to a door at
the back of the stage. -When he arrived
a number of people were trying to es
cape. He gave the boy to a man, tell
ing him to take him out, and then ran
back to the stage and out to the foot
lights. The audience was becoming
panic-stricken and in order to quiet the
people he called to the stage hands,
"Drop the curtain," and to the musi
cians, "Keep up your music." He urgea
the' audience repeatedly to remain
quiet and not get excited. When
the curtain came down it stuck about
three feet above his head. The rest of
Foy's testimony is as follows:
FIRE PROTECTION LACKING.
Lester Sackett of Elgin, 111., with two
women and a little girl, occupied seats
in the third row of the first balcony.
They made their way out of a rear exit
and down a fire escape. In going down
the fire escape Sackett had great trou
ble in closing an iron shutter which
projected across the stairway at right
angles and shut off escape.
Eddie Foy,' comedian, said he
r.ent to the matinee with his six-year
old son. He sent him out before the
first act in charge of the stage mana
ger, who brought him back and said
there were no seats.
Frank Houseman declared that he
bought two seats in an upper box for
the matinee. He reached the first floor
before the fire gained headway and
opened a door which he was told by
an usher was an exit. Outside of this
door was another of iron, which it was
impossible to open.
Charles Dexter was with Houseman
and gave similar evidence. When the
panic started he endeavored to open
doors on the first floor, and found be
hind them doors of iron, across which
were Iron crossbars. One of these doors
he could not open, but another he man
aged to force and got Out a number of
small children. Sf.
No person was admitted to the Coun
cil chamber without an order or a sub
pcr.a from Coroner Traeger. Even
members of the City Council who ap
plied for admission were turned away.
Among the witnesses were Eddie Foy,
a comedian of the "Mr. Bluebeard"
company, and George W. Stetsgn, a
representative of the company which
manufactured the asbestos curtain. The
evidence of Foy did not differ greatly
frorn the statements which have been
published heretofore concerning his ac
tion on the day of the fire.
Stetson and Coroner Traeger became
involved in a long discussion as to the
merits of asbestos curtains, during
which Stetson admitted that asbestos
curtains, if subjected to extremely high
heat, would lose their "life" and crum
ble- He declared that in his opinion
the greater portion of the asbestos cur
tain in the Iroquois Theater was still
in good condition and expressed him
self as anxious to make experiments
to prove the truth of his assertion. Â¦
Antonio Frosolono, leader of the or
chestra, testified that the asbestos cur
tain came down after each performance
and that it came down within a foot
cf the stage at the time of the fire.
Then, he asserted, it appeared to
straighten out and the flames came
from beneath. One Email piece of hose
was the only fire fighting apparatus he
had found about the theater.
Ella H. Churcher attended the mat
inee. She was positive that the curtain
that -was lowered was not the asbestos
curtain, but the curtain which had been
lowered after the first acL (

Morgan maintained that the Bogota
was warned not to make any bombard
ment at any time. This fact, he said,
made the United States a belligerent
nation against Colombia, This attitude
was continued by our forbidding Gen
eral Torres and his force to go from
Colon to, Panama.
"These acts of hostility and defiance
were in violation of the statute laws
of the United States," he said.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. f 7.â Morgan oc
cupied the time in the Senate to-day
in a reply to the speech of Lodge, de
livered on Tuesday. Morgan -again at
tacked the President and the attitude
of this Government in connection with
the Panama republic. He introduced
numerous newspaper extracts to bear
out his contention that the revolution
was assisted by officers and citizens of
the United States.
Morgan put into the Record a large
number of letters written by corre
spondents of newspapers which, he
said, gave the facts concerning the
overturning of the Colombian Govern
ment on the isthmus and which were
not disputed by the President in his
two messages to Congress. Many of
these article* made reference to" Colonel
Black, who is alleged to have raised
the first Panamaian flag on the isthmus,
and Consul Ehrmann, who is alleged
to have made thp- arrangements for the
raisins: of money- to '.buy the peaceful
withdrawal of Colonel Torres and his
Colombian troops.

questioned the action of the represen
tatives of the United States in warn
ing the Colombian gunboat Bogota
from bombarding Panama In view of
the fact that the bombardment was
without the time warrfing required by

of Samuel Olsen and Fred Davel, who
were killed by an . explosion in the
Michael Davitt mine, J. H. Trerize, a
Helnze superintendent, admitted that
he had personally blown air, dust and

"Erava! Brava! 1 ' cried the men and
women waved their dainty handker
chiefs or beat the palms of their
gloved hands. Repeated returns of the
singer to the stage did not quell the
tumult of applause, and Patti once
again delighted her admirers by sing
ing "Coming Through" the Rye" with
all the dainty gestures that character
ized her rendition of the song when
she first sang in San Francisco. ,
Again and again the diva was
forced ' to return and bow her
acknowledgments, and finally reap
peared with her traveling cloak. over
her shoulders and kissed, her .hands
to fhe audience that was still cheer
ing wildly. . V .
â¢ Then the vast gathering, of men and
women filed slowly out into the street,
many with the echo in their ears of
a voice they had listened to for the
first time, while others thought of the
changes. in their livps wrought by re
lentless Father k Time since the day
that first gave them an opportunity
of hearing the faultless voice of the
diva. Adelina Patti. '"
Madame Patti and her husband,
Baron Cederstrom, accompanied by
their servants, boarded the private
car Cralg-T-Nos last night at the
Third and Townsend i streets : depot
They will leave this morning on the

night were a trifle more than $11,000.
bo bumble, there's .no place like
home."
Patti's voice quivered with emo
tion as she finished j the song, and
there were tears in her eyes also. For
a second after the eong died away,
the audience sat as if under a spell
and then it was broken.
AUDIENCE CHEERS WILDLY.
HUNT IN VAIN
FOR HEBBARD
: It was not Mr. Hegner*s fault that
his. 'cello solos, Lalo, Hegner and Pop
per, fell on rather Indifferent ears.
He Is an artist of accomplishment,
with a light but agreeable tone, but
even If he had given something more
interesting than his too tight group it
would have been Just the same. Mr.
Cunningham followed, an" excellent
barytone. He sang in smooth and emi
nently dramatic fashion Verdi's "Eri
tu," giving .an encore to a very en
thusiastic demand. He was honorably
re-encored. Miss Zamels then 'played
the Preislied and then came again
Mme. Patti.
Transposed as it is there are' none
of us who have heard the "Jewel Song"
sung with livelier charm by .even Sem
brich or Melba. It was a revelation.
Then came "Home. Sweet Home" and
madame bowed to her smiling husband
after her greeting. It was not until
"Coming Through the Rye" that .she
aulte flung off all restraint. -That she
sang and acted until the house was a
unit of Idolatry. She came out until
she was tired. Then came on in her
shawl. Then in her purple opera cloak
and at last disappeared. It was a
Patti night. -
BLANCHE PARTINOTON.
They took a big breath then, and then
came the little woman who has reigned
In* the song realm for the unexampled
period of forty-flve years. Fourteen
years . ago she came here, then on a
farewell tour. She sang then her in
comparable "Vloletta" In "Traviata,"
brought "Lakme" with its "Bell Song,"
"Semiramls," and the city was capitu
late. Last night it seemed as though
she might do- the same thing ten years
hence for the conquering of a new city.
"With her characteristic little trip, she
came on, holding up her cloth of silver
gown in her old, pretty way* One
heard the old-time sigh, "She looks Just
the same," the young folk wonder.- as
Patti bowed her auburn head. , Fifty,
one might- give . her, . a youthful, fifty.
Her eyes, dark and brighW are still full
of .fire. Her small ladyship Is stouter,
but only becomingly so. and her voice!
If one could imagine It possi&!e, Patti
was a IlttFe nervous as 'a&pcame' fft
greet us last night. There'was perhaps
appeal in her dark eyes as- she lifted
them to the sea of faces a-front. i She
came, not to an audience of Idolaters
as in the old days, but to a house to
whom her name was largely a lovely
myth. Sensitive, as is eveFy great art
ist. It is not to be wondered at that
she felt the doubt in the atmosphere.
But after the first few notes she knew
she had us, and at the Califoralan,
shout after the "Home, Sweet Home."
she preened herself like the bird she is,
and sang "Comin' Thro' the Rye" until
the house rocked.
Here' was still the historic voice one
felt, gold and honey, roundness itself
and flowing like syrup from a pitcher.
As Patti herself says, she never at
tempts to do the impossible. Therefore
the Faust "Jewel Song" was transposed
until its lower notes were a chocolate
ccntralto. Cadenzas the singer does not
attempt and tempos are taken easily.
One felt the breath a little short occa
sionally and the high notes, alas! have
taken flight. But rarely does one feel
this, the singer keeping wonderfully
within her limits. And withal, despite
every tradition and in violation of
every physical law. this woman of
sixty-something still has the noblest
note of them all. "-'.', â¢,
â¢ She fittingly began with Mozart s
"Voi che Sapete." and to hear It was an
education. Her phrase is the ultimate
of phrasing, her enunciation the art
itself, her shading the very color ot
song's perfection. She was of course
encored, and 'twas "The Last Rose of
Summer" she sang. But it was in
"Robin- Adair." the second encore, that
th* deeper Patti was felt. The audience
yelled after it until Fatti's auburn head
was tired of bowing.
Miss Vera Margollesy pianist of the
company; followed, with a robust hand
ling of the Llzst Rhapsodle . No. 12.
Even for this famous old war horse,
brilliantly enough handled by Miss
Margolies. the audience had an encore,
with Patti to follow.
How is Patti? Ask thoseâ if you
were not of the Joyful bandâ who made
the- house rock last night after her
â¢'Comln' Thro' the Bye." Has she any
voice- left? j Ha* Â«hjsu los.t .any? one
miÂ«ht -reply. Hardly would jroa get
any.- of the great audience ..that last
night greeted the still, greatest; singer
the world knows to acknowledge so
much- The old-timer, with tears of
delight, protested^she had never sung
better. Which., was always ,the way
with Patti; the last time always the
best. Nay! the .old-timer proclaimed
that the diva had:, never in certain
things sung so. well! "And -one was
quite ready to believe him.
..She -came -fifth, on the programme,
with "Voi che SapeteT as her number.
Â¦Half ''fearful, the old-timer, trembling
for the reception of hla former divin
ity, the younger afraid of disillusion
ment, the audience listened leisurely
to the opening numbers. An interesting
trio by Widor, who Is, however, less In
teresting here than in his brilliant or
gan symphonies, opened the pro
gramme with Miss Boxa Zamels. Miss.
Vera Margolles and Mr. Anton Hegner
to Its rendering- The audience also
listened, patiently, to an indifferent
handling of the Gounod "Lend Me
Your Aid," by Mr. Wilfrid Virgo. For
Miss Roza Zamela, who is a very pleas-
Ing violinist, supple of bow, nimble of
left hand and with a finish and matur
ity of style marred only by a little ten
dency to sentimentalism, the house de
layed the Patti entrance by three en
cores. Miss Zamels gave Wleniawakl's
"Airs Russes,"- her temperamental ren
dering lending new Interest to the fa
miliar number. .She responded in kind
to the ' enthusiastic â¢ encore. _

San Francisco, represented' ' by its
wealth, beauty, culhire and education,
once again laid a' tribute" at thtf feet of
the Queen of Song-.lasf night, r when
Mme. Adelina Patti. ; Baroness Cede
strom, reappeared at the; Gr^nd Opera
house in thp : first o( her farewell con
certs in this city. â¢
It was a Patti" nfeht as of yore, and
Patti nights are few and far between
in any city. , Not even the days when
the world-famous diva first appeared
in San Francisco did she receive a
more, hearty welcome or please her au
dience any better.
. Men and women who heard the al
vjr.e artist ten, twenty and aye, thirty
and more vears ago, marveled and
wondered if this could be the same pe
tite songstress who had charmed them
in the past.
There was but one general thought
in the minds of the vast audience that
filled the Grand Opera-bouse last night
arid that was that Adelina Patti is still
the Quetn of Song and that another
such as she may never " e Iieard.
GUARD SAFETY* OF AUDIENCE.
The audience commenced to arrive at
the opera-house when the doors were
opened at 7:20. The police arrange
ments were perfect and everything pos
sible was done to insure .he safety of
the spectators. Captain of Police Spil
lane had forty picked men under his
command and they were placed both in
front of and inside t" i opera-house.
Chief Sulliran of the Fire Department
sent a dozen men vflto patrolled the
house, and detective officers were also
on hand in all parts of the theiter.
There was an elaborate display of
the modiste'F art and some very
charming gowns were worn by promi
nent members of the fair sex. Evening
dress for men was de rigueur. The early
coiners followed the usual g^and opera
custom by taking up places of vantage
in the foyer and watching the arrival
of the crowds.
It was 8:30 last night ere the curtain
ascended and disclosed a pretty stage
setting of a drawing-room. There was
no orchestra, only a grand piano to
furnish accompaniments to the singer
and other artists who appeared.
Of course the appearance of Madame
Patti was the chief attraction of -the
evening. The audience was in friendly
mood and gave to all the associates of
the diva a cordial welcome.
DIVA TKIPS ON* STAGE.
"Patti is coming now" was the whis
per that ran through 'the house as the
gTand piano was put in place. There
tFMM a hush and then a roar of plaudits
as the famous songstress lightly, trip
ped upon the stage arrayed in a beauti
ful evening gown.
A few chords from the grand piano
and then the voice of the diva rang
clear and true through the vast eudi
torlum in llozart's "Voi che -Sapete,"
from "Le Nozze di Figaro."
â¢'Marvelous!" was the ejaculation of
the great audience of men and women
all-over the theater when the song
ended and the einger bowed # to the re
peated plaudits. . ......
Again and again she was called to the
stage, and then a remarkable scene
was ' witnessed. Patti sang as an en
core bxr favorite ballad, "The Last
Rose of Summer," and when the last
notes died away men and women rose
from their seats and pelted the smiling
artist with a deluge of California flow
ers. Bunches of flowers fell from the
boxes and were thrown from the or
chestra srats, the tribute of men and
women of the Golden State to the wo
man who has charmed millions and
whose voice has trilled aroundthe civ
ilized world.
Round after round of cheers greeted
the singer and she was forced to re
turn to the stage and finally was com
pelled to sing "Robin Adair" ere the
audience was satisfied.
There was no interval In the concert,
and when' Madame Patti again ap
peared as scheduled on the programme
she was again given a reception that
made the rafters of the building fairly
ring.
WIXS TEARS AS A TRIBUTE.
Up to the very roof of the opera
riouse soared the bird-like tones of
the singer and the enunciation rang
true of the sacred lines, "be it ever
The selection from "Faust" was
barely ended when the audience de
manded the return of their favorite.
There must have been some magnetic
impulse flashed from the body of the
house to the singer, for on all sides
were beard Quiet expressions "If she
would only sing 'Home, Sweet Home/."
And then Madame PattI, without mu
sic, turned to the. accompanist and
whispered to him and the piano strains
of the sad aria sounded through the
theater and the cheering was renewed.
The songstress raised her head, and
n. strange hush fell upon the audience.
Patti sans "Home, Sweet Home" as
only Patti can sins it, and men and
women thought of the long years
gone by when they had listened to the
same song by the same singer. Mem
ories of dear ones departed filled 'the
mind and dozens of the audience
could be seen quietly wiping the tears
from their eyes.

Miss Gannon, Sec'y Detroit Amateur l wj
Art Association, tells young women what to
do to avoid pain and suffering caused by
female troubles. .
" Dear:Mr3. PrNKHAK Â«I can conscientiously recommend liydlft B*
Plnkhani'i* -Vegetable Compound to those of my sisters suffering witr*
female weakness and the troubles which so often befall women. I suf-
fered for- months with general weakness, and felt so weary that I had
Jiard .work .to keep up. I had shooting pains, and was utterly miserable.
In my distress I wm advised to use Lydia K. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, and it was a red letter day to me when I took the first dose,
for at that time ray restoration began. In six weeks I was a changed
woman, perfectly well in every, resect. I felt so elated and happy that
IwantaU women who suffer to get well as I did." â 3Iiss Guila Gajtson,
359 Jones St., Detroit, Mich., Secretary Amateur Art Association.
It is clearly shown In this yonnjc lady's letter that I*ydia E.
Pinkham's "Vegetable Compound -will certainly cure the suf f ering*
of women; and when one* considers that Miss Gannon's letter is
only one of the countless hundreds Trhich -we: are continually
publishing- in the newspapers of this country, the great virtuÂ© of Mrs. Pink-
ham's medicine must be adraitted'bv all ; and for the absolute cure of all kind*
nf female ills no substitute' can possibly take its place. Women should bear
this important fact in mind when they po into a drupr store.' and be sure not
to accept anything- that is claimed to be " jnst as good " as Lydia E. IMnk-
ham's Vege table Compound, for no other medicine for female ills has
nade so many actual cures.
How Another Sufferer' Was Cured.
** Dear Mrs. Pintchak : â I cannot praise yonr wonderful remedies
enough, for they have' done me more good than all the doctors I hava
had. For the last eight years and more I suffered with female troubles,
-was very weak, coufd not, do my housework, also had nervous pros-
tration. Some days I would remain unconscious for a whole day and
night. My neighbors thought I could never recover, but, thanks to
your medicine, I now feel like a different woman.
â¢"I feel very grateful to you and will recommend I.ydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound to all. It has now been four years since
I had. the last 1 spell of nervous prostration. I only weighed ninety-
eight pounds at that.time ; now I weigh one hundred and twenty-three.
"I i consider your' Vegetable Compound the finest remedy made.
Thanking you many times for the benefit I received from your medicine.
I remain, Yours truiy, Mrs. J. H. Farmer, 2809 Elliott Ave.,*St. Louis, Mo.*
Rememher Mrs. Pinkham's advice is free and all sick women
are foolish If they do not ask for it. She speaks from the widest
experience, and has helped multitudes of women.

Two children of superfluously wealthy
families were to be joined in the holy
bonds of matrimony. The best of San
Francisco's society had been inrited to
attend the wedding ceremony and the
best of San Francisco's society was
there to see at the- appointed time and
place. The prospective husband had
traveled an exceedingly rapid pace
.since he had become of age and was
well known In those circles where the
day's pleasures begin only when most
people are abed.
A Iifelorfg friend of his had been se
lected to officiate as usher. The chum,
a well known wag, was impatiently
awaiting the arrival of the wedding
party. Suddenly an acquaintance, who
was also chafing at the delay, addressed
him with the question, ""Who is going
to give the bride away, Jack?" "Her
old man," was the response in such a
strenuous stage whisper that many of
that well bred audience craned their
necks to see what it was all about.
Then he added in the same tone and
with just the suspicion of a smile on his
face: "Lucky for the groom that they
didn't select me to give him away, be
cause I am afraid she would stop the
festivities before I had told all I know."
It is alleged that there was a brutal
exchange of fisticuffs between two gen
tlemen at a swell club the day after
the wedding tour had been completed.
Giving Him Away.
THE SHAMROCKSâ A. O. S., City.
The cost of the three Shamrocks which
took Dart in Â¦ the American cup race
was about '$200,000 each. Sir Thomas
Lipton has never given out the exact
figures as ta the cost of each vessel.
They say that St. John introduced Christianity into
Ethiopia and that it exists there in its primitive simpli
city, as it was understood in the time of the apostles,
and without any of the modern improvements whatever.
The Negus rules, and his people live, according to the
Christian precept as it was" understood in the days of
Caesar, and without any ecclesiastical establishment or
ponderous machinery. There is also religious equality
in Abyssinia and there is no record, known to the out
side world,' of religious persecution there. Of course,
this shows the people to be horribly backward, and sunk
in simplicity, without even displaying .that that
shines in a heresy trial.
We are glad to give any information at hand concern
ing our new great and good friend Menelik and his
country. We fear that he does not indulge in the luxury
of foreign ministers, so we may not hope to see the
jewel of diplomacy in. an EthiopY ear at Washington.
The foreign policy of the Negus is simplicity itself.
Foreigners who enter his country in friendship are wel
comed as friends and treated to raw beef; but those who
come as enemies are met and whipped, -:as he whipped
the Egyptians and Italians.
We are not informed as to the articles of commerce
we may expect to find there in exchange. for. what, we
may sell under the new treaty. The Negus himself ;was
delightfully robust in the gifts to our Embassador for the
President, for they were a pair of lions and a couple of
elephant. tusks. It, is lucky that he did not reverse the
order and send a pair of elephants and a couple "of lion's
tusks, for elephants make clumsy baggage, and 'would
eat their heads off getting them here.
The roval EthioD was told all -about the St. Louis ex-
The world has always "fought shy of Ethiopia. The
Romans never conquered that country. The "last Ro
man general, Belisarius, who served Justinian â¢when
Constantinople was the seat of the empire, marched all
around the Mediterranean and fought and .whipped
everybody, but he kept ojut of Abyssinia, and that land
has remained a mysterious place, where the people are
Christians and eat raw beefsteaks cut out of the Hying
cattle.' -^
WE have entered into treaty relations with Abys
sinia. The Ethiop will change his skin now with
us, as well as with Europe. Heretofore his con
tact with Americans was confined to an awful licking he
gave to the Egyptian army led by two American gener
als. But he has forgiven us that ill-starred , expedition
which Ismail, Khedive of Egypt, sent against him under
American leadership.

"Take the buggy, George." Captain
Gray had said in sending Harvey on
some business that called for expedi

â¢Now Harvey had never driven a
horse, but was too good a sailor to re
fuse an order and too proud to admit
ignorance of knowledge.
All went well until .Harvey's steed
had carried him as far as the ferry
depot. 'Approaching the Market street
car tracks,' the buggy's course was sud
denly crossed by a street car. The car
stopped. The buggy held on its way.
Harvey's. right hand went groping into
the comers of the buggy and finding
no signal levers there shoÂ£ above his
head in equally fruitless search for the
whistle cord. The lines lay limp in his
left hand and the horse kept on his
way, only, stopping when he had poked
his head through one window of the
car, raked two others and smashed a
panel with the shafts of the buggy.
"Why the blank dfdn't you stop?"
yelled the car crew in unison.

for a canal across that part of the isthmus. Even if
negotiations had been reopened before the revolution in
Panama, the protocols could not have been exchanged,
and the President would have been entirely justified in
turning again to Panama immediately upon the appear
ance of a chance to outwit the greed and dishonor of
Bogota.
The people want a canal and so does the President.
The treaty made with Panama is as legitimate as any ever
made by any' nation. It gets more iavorable terms than
the United States ever dreamed of, and v brings in sight a
consummation that, has been the talk of the' world for a
hundred and fifty, years. Senator Morgan calls it "a
strange, and frantic usurpation, a national scandal that
would disgrace Turkey." Of course he can choose his
own language in describing his own country, but when
one remembers his .prompt indorsement of the revolu
tion in Hawaii, and his vindication of all its features,
and his subsequent participation in. annexation of the
'islands, it rouses curiosity to know at just what particu
lar point of time^his conscience lost its sea legs and pre
pared to get sick over Panama.
The tact is that his reasons are purely personal. For
many years he had canal matters in charge. He was
consulted about treaties and his advice was followed,
with no results. Growing tired of temporizing, Presi
dent McKinley wisely turned from the Morgan canal to
Panama, andthis successor has projected his policy in
that respect. Morgan fought the change. In the last
session he spoke for days against a treaty with Colombia,
and fought.it with all the weaponry of his experience.
He did not like the Spooner bill. He the dis
cretion given to the President and worked himself into
all sorts of temper. : : < â¢>
If he had been the original proponent of Panama, he
would now be patting the President on the back instead
of vituperating him. His motives are original in his
self-esteem and his pride of position. This is entirely
well understood by .his Southern colleagues, ,who, like
President McKinley, long ago grew tired of waiting for
Morgan to dig a canal by speeches in the Senate. He
is a theorist and declaimer. But theory and declamation
will not dig a canal. President Roosevelt is a man of
action and he has brought a canal in sight without mak
ing any entangling alliance, but under conditions of
perfect security and independence.
The country is with him. Americans do not believe
that their government is. lower than Turkey or that it
deserves the defamation and abuse which are the last
resort of Mr. Morgan. He is in the habit of doing the
vial of wrath act, and. has thereby injured himself as a
public man. In one aspect his position is serious. He
has the vocal gift of unlimited continuance, and will try
to talk the long session out, if he is physically equal
to it.
Senator Morgan should know .that the making of a
treaty with those two states during that time was im
possible. He is familiar with their past demands,
which were held, by Mr. Cleveland to be intolerable.
Since then they have given no evidence of abatement.
Nicaragua is in an unstable condition politically and
physically. Not only is the government weak, crafty,
avaricious and corrupt, with indications that renewal of
canal negotiations would bring on a revolution, caused
by the desire of such robbers as are out of office to
get a chance at the- swag, but the earthquake/ and
volcanoes of last year demonstrated the lack of safety
SENATOR Morgan of Alabama is irreconcilable to
the Panama matter. He has taken to writing on
the subject, and as his gorge rises he puts it in
the'papcrs. It is evident that Jie has been made aware
that a considerable number of Southern Senators will
support the treaty and help to secure the canal. This
leads him to vitriolic indulgence against the President,
whom he attacks for waiting just four weeks after
Colombia rejected the treaty, instead of immediately be
ginning to bargain with Nicaragua and Costa Rica. .

When the fJyjns machine built by
Wilbur and Orville Wright of Dayton,
Ohio, made, a three-mile flight at Kit
tyhawk, X. C. December 17 last aerial
navigation became a fact. The box
kite-like structure, which carried a
man three grood miles, was under per
fect control and was not held sus

its propellers for the forward move

gineers regard the success of the Day
ton aeronauts as a decided advance in
s-ir navigation and a* offering a larger
promise of a successful practical so
lution of the problems presented by
aerial navigation than the accomplish
ed feats of the Parisian bal'.oonists.
Back of the Wright brothers' tri
umph is the sequence of aeronautical
experiments conducted by Herr Otto
Lilienthal, who made over 2000 flights
in Germany before he was killed; a
young English engineer named Pil
cher. Octave Chanute, at one time
president of the Western Society of
Engineers, and some years of efforts,
failures and partial successes of Wil
bur Wright and Orville Wright.
The aeronautical history of the
Wright brothers is interesting; it is
the record of two young men deter
mined to solve the mysteries of me
chanical flight.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The unfortunate death of Lilienthal,
Â¦w ho was dashed to earth in one of
his flights, directed the attention of
Wubur Wright to aeronautics. He
begar. in 1&S6 to study and experiment
*r.d soon his brother Orviile joined
him. Their preliminary tests were so
?satisfying that in 1900 they carried
their experimental flying machines to
Kittyhawk. a sar.dy beach on the
shore of North Carolina, and it was
there they demonstrated their ability
not only to soar, but to manage their
air craft and to a limited degree con
trol its flight. They had ascertained
that the difficulties which obstructed
'he pathway to success in flying ma
chine construction were those which
related to the construction of sustain
ing wings; those which related to the
generation and application of the
power required to drive the machine
through the air and those relating to
the balancing and steering of the ma
chine after it was actually in flight.
Before they began their experiments
men bad constructed wings or aero
planes which when driven through the
air at a sufficient speed not only sus
tained the weight of the wings them
selves, but also of the engine and en
gineer as well. Fifteen years before the
lightest steam motor was the marine
engine, which weighed sixty pounds to
The horsepower, while the gas engine
weighed more, and the locomotive
weighed 200 pounds to the horsepower.
But great improvements effected radi
cal changes, so that when the Dayton
a!r navigators took their huge kites to
teat the carrying abilities of Atlantic
breezes steam motors had been made
which weighed but ten pounds to the
horsepower and gas engines had been
cut down to twelve and one-half to fif
teen pounds to the horsepower.

WHILE it ls_by no means certain that Olney, will
receive the Democratic nomination for . the
, Presidency, it is evident the boom given him in
Massachusetts and New York has jnade a strong impres
sion upon the country and that Republican leaders are
getting Kafly to meet an Olney campaign. For a long
time past Republican criticism of Democracy has betn
directed so exclusively against the Bryanites the public
has doubtless lost sight of the fact that the position of
the gold wing of the party on othe'r issues is about as
weak as that of the silver men on the money question.
Consequently, the opening of the campaign against
Olney will have something of the charm of novelty and
prove interesting for a time at least, J on that account rf
on no other.
An illustration of the turn given to partisan discussion
by the appearance of Olney in the forefront of the fight
was furnished during the debate in the Senate on Tues
day, when Senator Lodge took occasion to reveal some
of the weak places in the record on which Olney would
have to make his fight should he be nominated. In the
course of his speech, the Senator, after referring to
Olney as a personal friend with whom he never agreed
on any political subject, said that Qlney's commendation
of Cleveland had greatly interested him. He then added:
"I do not regard, the Democratic party as always
abounding in good sense, but they had too much sense to
fight the campaign of 1806 on Mr. Cleveland's adminis
tration. They repudiated him and his administration
and we are deprived of the opportunity of discussing it.
We can say what we want about the silver issue, but it
was a better issue for the Democratic party to meet the
country on than the one gone before; and when I saw
the accounts of this delightful banquet in New York and
read those inspiring- speeches and observed the Demo
cratic party once more, through its chosen leaders, there
preparing to stand across the pathway, of American
progress and proposing to put at their head .the man
who held power last in their name, I confess my spirits
rose higher than ever about the Republican prospects."
Of course Senator Lodge knows very well that Cleve
land is not in the race and wjH not be renominated.
Therefore, when he held up the weakness of the Cleve
land administration, it was done for the purpose of for
mulating charges that Olney will have to meet should he
enter the field; for of course he could enter it only a"s
the champion and defender of the bygone .Cleveland ad
ministration. Senator Lodge recails a striking series of
blunders on the part of the Cleveland regime. He says:
; 'What a pleasure it would be to contrast the policy
which .tried to set up Liliuokalani in Hawaii with the
policy of the Republican party "which has made thpse
islands a part of the United States; to contrast the tariff
which they passed, and which their own President called
the tariff of perfidy and dishonor, with the tariff we
passed; to examine the history of the loans which they
made in a time^of profound peace to the bankers of New
York with an interest rate far above what the United
States could borrow at even then, and contrast them
with the loans which we made in time of war; and then
compare that era of panic and depression with the pros
perity that followed."
With such a blast of criticism to start the fray, it is
easy to foresee that the nomination of Olney would
bring about a revival of the old party war over issues
that were dropped when Bryan raised the flag of free
silver and Populism. in the Democratic camp and drove
the old war horses out of it. The Â¦, fight would not be
bitter, but it would be vigorous; for of course the whole
surviving Cleveland old guard would rally behind the
Massachusetts man and work like Trojans to beat
Bryan's record as a vote getter. Altogether an Olney
campaign would be red hot â a reminder of good old
limes.

It seems to be the common thing for
a'.rsh'p inventors to Insist that they
will attain speeds of 100 to 200 miles
an hour, provided their airships work.
It is interesting to note that Wilbur
Wright, the first man to attain' me
chanical flight over any considerable
distance, is extremely modest in his
ideas of flying machine speed. He said
to the western engineers: '
"The probability is that the first
flying machines will have a relatively
low speed, perhaps not much exceed
ing twenty miles per hour, but the
problem of increasing the speed will
be much simpler in some respects
than that of increasing the speed of
a steamboat; for, whereas in the lat
ter case the size of- the engine must
increase as the cube of the speed, in
the flying machine, until extremely
high speeds are reached, the capacity
of the motor increases in less than
simple ratio, and there is even a de
crease in the fuel consumption per
mile of travel. In other words, to
double the speed of a steamship (and
the same is true of the balloon type
of airship) eight times the engine and
boiler capacity would be required,
and four times the fuel consumption
per mile of travel, while a flying ma
chine would require engines of less
than double the size, and there would
be an actual decrease in the *Â»Â»ai con-
The 1901. flying machine was 22
feet wide. 14 feet long, including the
rudder, and 6 feet high. The machine
was first tested July 27, 1901, in a
wind blowing thirteen miles an hour.
It was without any driving apparatus
for gravity -was still the "motor force"
of the experimental aeroplane. The
sequence of experiments disclosed
errors in construction and curves.
These were corrected and glides of
several hundreds of feet in length
were made repeatedly. The flying ma
chine was tested with a man aboard in
a twenty-two-mile wind â a somewhat
reckless proposition considering that
the navigator had had a practice of
less than five minutes spent in actual
flight. But the control of the machine
was so good that many successful
glides were made. The machine
weighed a trifle over 100 pounds, or
with a man aboard, 245 pounds. Its
immense spread of double wings gave
it the " appearance of a gigantic box
kite when in the air. The frampwork
was trussed to give strength with lit
tle weight, and the operator lay in a
framework in the center.
This machine was the model for
the flying machine, equipped with
gasoline motor and propellers, which
carried Wilbur Wright three miles in
the teeth of an Atlantic gale a few
weeks ago.
The experiments of 1900 were so
successful that the Ohio air cruisers at
once went to work to design a new
machine for 1901. They increased the
surface area from 165 to 308 square
feet. Compare this to the Lilienthal
flyer, which had an area of 157 square
feet, the Pilcher machine with 165
square feet and Chanute's famous
double decker with 134 square feet
and the nerve and audacity of the
Wright brothers can be appreciated.
Never before had so large a machine
been deemed controllable. -
"The slope of the hill was 9.5 degrees,
or a. drop of one foot in six. We found
that after 'attaining a speed of about
twenty-five to thirty miles with refer
ence to the wind or ten to fifteen miles
over the ground, the machine not on}y
glided parallel to the slope of the hill,
but greatly increased its speed, thus
indicating its ability to glide on a some
what less angle than 9.6 degrees,, when
we "should feel it safe to rise higher
from the surface. The control of the
machine Droved even better than we
had dared to expect, responding quick
ly to the slightest motion of the rud
der. 'With these glides our experiments
for the year 1900 closed. Although the
hours and hours of practice we had
hoped to obtain finally dwindled down
to al>out two minutes, we were very
much pleaded with the general results
of the trip, for setting out as we did,
with almost revolutionary theories on
many points and an entirely untried
form of machine, we considered it quite,
a point to be able to return without
having our pet theories completely
knocked in the head by the hard logic
of experience and our own .brains
dashed out in the bargain. Everything
seemed to us to confirm the correctness
of our original opinions: Firstâ That
practice is the key to the secret of
flying; second, that it is practicable
to assume the horizontal position; third,
that steering up and down can be at
tained with a "rudder without moving
the position of the operator's body."
The first flying machine built by the
WriRht brothers was a double-decked
kite having a surface area of 165 square
fret. The operator lay extended on his
face crosswise of * the center of ths
lower deck. The rudder was a smaller
aeroplane extending forward in front
of the machine; therein the Wright
machine differed radically from others.
The first attempts at "gliding" were
made from the top of a sand hill which
rose from the flat sand to a heicht of
one hllndred feet. Wilbur Wright, in
describing the first flights, said:
"On the day of our arrival the wind
blew about twenty-five miles an hour,
and as we had had no experience at all
in gliding: we deemed It unsafe to at
tempt to leave the ground. On the day
following, the wind having subsided to
fourteen miles per hour, we made about
a dozen glides. It had been the original
intention that the operator should run
with the machine to obtain initial ve
locity and assume the horizontal posi
tion only after the machine was in free
flight. When it came time to land he
was to resume the upright position and
light on his feet after the style of-pre
vious gliding experimenters. But on
actua! trial we found it much better to
employ the help of two assistants in
starting, which the peculiar form of our
machine enabled us readily to do, and
in landing we found it was entirely
practicable to land while still reclining
in a horizontal position upon the ma
chine. Although the landings were
made while moving at tpeed of more
than twenty miles an hour neither ma
chine nor operator suffered any injury.

Haars on July 8 for $950,' on his
statement that it was free of nay in
cumbrance. Haars acted as agent for
Airs. Margaret Clouston. Â« .
A .few days ago Mrs. Lyons was
notified of the fact that there was a
mortgage of $700 on the lodging
house and that it would be foreclosed
unless redeemed. She saw Mrs.
Clouston,. who informed her that
K.tars knew of the mortgage and had
given her $250, promising to pay off
the mortgage with the remaining
$700.
Haars at the time of the sale was
doing business at 850 Market street
under the name of the Donald In
vestment Company. After his arrest
he said he would get his lawyer to
straighten things out. .'

ACCUSED OF DUPLICITY
The couple were found by Officer,
McMurray of the Society for the Pre
vention *f Cruelty to Children living in
a filthy basement on Howard street
with four children, the eldest of whom
was 7 years. The children were m an
almost incredible state of filth and
wretchedness. How they survived the
neglect was a miracle. The father and
mother were almost continually drunk.
Rev. Father Crowley secured the cus
tody of one of the children and placed
it in a comfortable home. The society
cared for the other three little ones.
James Delury and his wife, Laura,
were convicted of cruelty to children in
Judge Conlan's courÂ£ yesterday. The
husband was' sentenced to six months
in the County JaU and the wife will be
sentenced to-day. Her sentence will
not be so heavy as that of her husband,
as extenuating circumstances . were*
shown in her case. m
"This court has no. way of furnishing
you transportatkm to Baden," said the
Judge, "but I'll do the best I can for
you. I'll send you out to Ingleside with
a stopover privilege, and from there
vou can continue to your destination.
Twenty days in the County Jail."
James McDermott appeared before
Judge Fritz yesterday on the charge
of begging. "I was trying to get to
Baden," explained the defendant. "I'm
broke, but if I could get there I would
be all right, because I can get work
right away."
C. J. Janssen, who was arrested last'
November on two charges of passing
fictitious checks, was released by Judge
Conlan yesterday. He has settled the
obligations and has. been in jail ever
since his arrest. The Judge thought he
had been sufficiently punished.
Janssen's crimes were committed In a
spirit of good fellowship. He was tread
ing the primrose path and ran short
of n.^ney one night while on a spree
and took an unlawful method of re
plenishing his. purse. He Is said to
have prominent relatives in the State
and to be perfectly reliable when not
drinking. .
Before Judge Conlan Francisco Rossi
and Giovanni Fossa, accused of the
muruer of Vincenzo Lavagnino, were
arraigned and their hearings continued
for one week. Â« j
"./illiam, H. Atkins, who shot and
killed Muldoon McDonald, the colored
prize fighter, also appeared before
Judge Mogan and his preliminary hear
ing was set for January 11.
Judge Cabaniss heard the story yes
terday and consigned the defendant to
six months In the County Jail on the
charge of misdemeanor embezzlement.
Custodio is not taking any paper money
these days.
L&st Tuesday the saloon-keeper was
called, upo/i to pay for a consignment
of imported sausages and not having
any small change^ he tendered the $100
bill to the 'collector. The latter looked
at it a moment and passed it back.
"Not for your Uncle Dudley," he said.
"Do I look like a Yolo County man?"
After some investigation Custodio
learned that his friend Rose had handed
him a $100 bill that is used in the book
keeping courses of commercial colleges
He waited until Rose came in to draw
the last $2 50, and then had him ar
rested. .
Custodio a $100 bill to keep for him.
The following day he wanted $40 to send
to his mother in Opiak, Aleutian Isl
ands, and the saloon-keeper gladly let
him have the money. Thereafter Rose
drew the sum of $5 and $10 occasionally
against his deposit until the amount
appr6ximated the bill on* deposit.
Edward Richards, who shot and
killed Joseph^ Martini, a saloon-kee"per
oh Pacific street early . Wednesday
morning, was formally accused of the
crime of murder before Judge Mogan
yesterday. The complaint was sworn
to by Delia Martini, wife of the mur
dered man. She is a remarkably pretty
woman. Under, the^ ordeal of making
the charge she broke down completely
and the procedure had to be delayed
fifteen minutes while she was removed
to the Judge's chambers to regain her
composure.
M. J. Costodio has a saloon at 325
Drumm street. One of his most en
thusiastic admirers was Joseph Rose,
who, although a new acquaintance, was
fervent and unstinted in prafse of Cus
todio's natural abilities. As the latter
cannot read or write, his natural abili
ties and the booze he keeps on tap are
his particular prides. '
Rose told Custodio that he would
trust him with his life. To demonstrate
the sincerity of the statement he gave
William McNamara lied himself into
Jail yesterday before Judge Mogan. He
was accused of stealing a mop from' a
grocery on May street. The Judge
was inclined to let him go, as the arti
cle was of small .value and had been
recovered. "I suppose you were a Jittle
full when you took this mop," said the
Judge, "and didn't realize what you
were doing." "I wasn't full," said the
defendant and I didn't steal that mop.
I bought It from a man for 15 cents."
The Judge sat up and began to take
notice. "A man who is a liar as well
as a thief deserves punishment," he
said. "I'll find you guilty of petty lar
ceny and sentence you to-morrow."
Kelley was sentenced to twelve
months more in the County Jail, mak
ing two and a half years he will have
to serve. According to Clerk Jack
Rice, who is the official statistician of
Judge Conlan's court, if Kelley can
keep on appealing his cases to the Su
perior Court and secure securities and
his stock of Confederate bills holds out
he will have an unserved term of 48,212
years hanging over him by the time he
becomes a millionaire.
At his hearing before Judge Conlan
he was sentenced to six months in the
County Jail on each charge, m.aking a
total of eighteen months' imprisonment
altogether. He did net relish the idea
of his Napoleonic career in finance be
ing .interrupted by such a pause, so he
appealed his cases to the Superior
Court and was set at liberty on bail.
Yesterday Kelley appeared before
Judge Conlan again, charged with hav
ing resumed his operation with $20
Confederate notes. He bought some
sausages from a factory on Vallejo
street and two bottles uf olive oil from
an Italian firm on Sansome street. To
each vendor he tendered a crisp bill
bearing a promise signed by Jefferson
Davis to pay the bearer $20 in gold on
presentation at the treasury in Rich
mond. He received $46 50 in money
that does not have to be put through
the tedious process of hunting up Jef
ferson Davis to give it a commercial
value.
Thomas Kelley is a persistent offen
der along certain lines. Two months
ago he passed â¢ three $20 Confederate
bills on as many groceries out in the
Mission, in return for which he re
ceived $3 worth of merchandise and $57
in good American money. He was at
tempting to pass a fourth piece of dis
credited currency when he was ar
rested.
Judge Mogan called up" "Detective
Freel. "See if you can find any record
of this fellow." he said. Freel went to
the identification, bureau and returned
in a few minutes 'with a copy 6f the
"Detective," wherein are. published the
photographs of criminals taken all over
the country. There, large as life, was
the bright-eyed angel boy, who never
had been arrested before. He really
couldn't recognize his own picture,
which was taken in St. Louis-February
23, 1903. Still it was a striking likeness.
The fact of his arrest had likewise es
caped him, although he admitted he
had been taken into custody in New
Orleans about that time.
"Dangerous and suspicious charac
ter," read the Judge, "19 years old.
Now you're 17. You seem to have
backed down some in the betting. I
think myself you are about 22 and a
penitentiary- is a good place for you.
I'll hold you over to the Superior Court
when your case comes up again."
shame to spoil his bright young life
by sending him to the penitentiary."
"Only 17?" asked the Judge, eyeing the
young culprit. "Yes, .sir,", said the boy.
â¢'Ever been arrested before?" asKed the
Judge. "Oh, no,' sir," quavered the
youth. . â¢

, Seven years ago the original ready-cooked, predigested Grape-Nuts Food was discovered
and placed before the people.
Its early history shows that the inventor, after recovery from a long attack of nervous
prostration and a well-nigh fatal attack of appendicitis, was brought to realize the urgent neces-
sity for a predigested cereal food that the system could absorb, and that would furnish the body
with energy and also rebuild the Brain and Nerve Centers.

PROBLEM
With years of training at his back, perhaps no. man was bettei ,
iquipped to solve that problem.
He knew that weak intestinal digestion meant either leave off
eating any starchy foods, Potatoes, Wheat, Oats. Bread, .Cakes anc
Puddings, or suffer distress and disease.
He knew that some starchy food is necessary to supply-
He also knew that delicate particles of Phosphate of Potash
issimilate with Albumen in the food and go to build the gray mat-
ter in' the Brain and Nerve Centers, so the experiments began
md extended over a period of about 2 years,, resulting in the now
world-famous food Grape-Nats.
j Special parts of the Wheat and Barley are selected and so
treated by moisture, heat and time as to change the starch into â¢
sugar, which can be seen exuding from every granule of Grape-
This form qi predigested starch (now sugar) is quickly taken
up by the blood and deposited in the muscles and tissues, stored
and ready for use when energy- is demanded. ... -.
* â¢ ' Then the little particles (microscopic) of Phosphate of Pottsh
are there as .well, and with the Albumen of food, surely, steadily
and perfectly do their work in rebuilding and making new the
1 . worn-down Brain and Nerve Centers.
Â« That is the reason why people who know these facts and have
proven them use Grape-Nuts.
Truly "There's a Reason."
Persons who have been built back to strong, sturdy men and
women by adopting scientifically made food, particularly when de-
licious to the taste, are not quick to forget it.
A great original success is always a bid for imitators, but
Grape-Nuts was so hard to copy that for the first five years but
feeble attempts were made by any one to imitate either the food
or the announcements of its merit.
However, about 2 years ago a tremendous rush was made to
get into the ready-cooked food business.
It was like a stampede to the gold diggings.
Several hundred factories were built and the hopes of the
stockholders ran high.
â¢ Had these money-seeking followers gone through the days,
weeks and years of hard experience, in sickness, investigation,
study and experiment that fitted the old originator to bring forth
from his food laboratory a genuine article, intended for a purpose,
. and so skillfully and scientifically blended and made that it would
Do what it was intended to do!!
Or were they forced from lack of early training to "grind" upr Something and "advertise!
thaf will make it go?" *
* The first year of the life of these imitators they did not assume that their foods were "pre-
digested"' or were "brain" foods, but when for some unexplained reason the demand did" not
come up to expectation, they concluded perhaps it might be because they were not advertised as
So. without any change in the articles, and with most amazing effrontery, the makers of
some have now suddenly begun to talk "Brain Food," "Predigested," etc.. etc., copying the an-
nouncement of Grape-Nuts that the public have been familiar with for seven years past.
When you read our words and phrases, "Predigested," "Made from entire Wheat and
Barley," "A Food for Brain and Nerve Centers," etc., etc., fitted to some breakfast food, vou
may know these claims have been cribbed from the original, and are pretenses.
A' genuine originator must have as his actuating motive, honesty of purpose.
â¢V Imitators Have but one object, MONEY, and that to be gained from the thought and

Dillon's record of 2:05 to a high wheeled

; SUMMARY.'
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 7.â An attrac
tive programme , at Ascot Park this aft
ernoon drew, the largest crowd of the
season. More than 8000 persons passed
through' the gates, three-fourths of
them being women. The racing was
exciting and,* notwithstanding the, de
feat of five mt of six favorites, the
public seemed to" have. the best of the
argument. "
The first - race, over the Slauson
course, went to Geisha Girl at odds
of 5 to 1. Jingler. was second, a length
in front of Brown Prince.
- The second race was for two-year
olds at three furlongs. Lady Lasca,
having started once before and hav
ing finished a close, second "to Pinker
ton, winner of the first
dash ofthe year, was made a red hot
favorite at 1 to 2. At this price it
looked' good and was forced down to
1 to 3. The Libertine filly ran away
from the' others, finishing a half dozen
lengths ahead of Azellna, with Hilona
third. -

EXTRIES'FOR TO-DAY.
Larsen piloted two winners and once
finished second.
While Henry Ach was carried wide
on the stretch - turn the Schreiber
youngster lacked speed when headed
for the wire. He must have been suf
fering some ill effects from his first
race. 'â¢ Â¦ .. '
It was supposed that the speed pos
sessed by Flyer would carry him to the
front, on the strength of - which the
Ryan horse was backed to win the
fourth race. In Jack Martin's hands
this electrifying turn of speed was as
dull as a boarding-house carving knife,
and the sorinter.. finished among the
"alsocrans." â¢ ,
A LONG SHOT SCORES.
First choices fared none too well, de
camping with but two purses. The sur
prise of the afternoon was furpished
by Lamorie, which I won the . first race
at odds of 50 and 60. to 1.
Fourteen maidens started in the
opening six-furlong run, and the win
ner turned up in the 60 to .1 shot
Lamorie, ridden by Crossthwaite. The
gelding had. but 85 pounds to shoul
der, and after cutting out all the pace
lasted long 1 enough to beat Cracko,
another outsider, a neck. Libervale
ran third. Dundreary, the favorite,
from. the Burns & Waterhouse stable,
got away almost last of the big
bunch, and then ... finished fourth.
Away better he could not have lost.
The maiden six-furlong event saw
fourteen "more platers of all ages face
the webbing. Celebrant, . which
started for the first time in the Ham
ilton stable colors, was a pronounced
favorite, and with Larson on his back
won in ragtime. Bright Moon .took
the place from Gene Handlan in a
hard drive. The latter was away
poorly or he would have been a con
tender at the end. |
El Oriente did not last long â¢ after
being installed as favorite for the mile
and fifty-yard selling affair. The odds
receded from 2^ to 5, and his show
ing: Justified the betting. Because of
possessing a. bunch of speed the tal
ent finally settled on Flyer as favorite,
but the Ryan horse also proved a
disappointment. Hipponax, at 3% to
1, piloted by Bell, made all the run
ning, and scored hands down from
Gawaine; a 15 to 1 shot. . Burns
dropped Emily Oliver down in the
show. Marelio quit after beinpr the
runner-up for most of the journey.
HAGERDOVS IIiL LUCK.
Poor racing luck more than any
thing else accomplished the dÂ«feat of
Hagerdon, favorite for the five and a
half furlong purse run. He was
bumped at the start and soon after
ward was cut off by Hildebrand on
Money Muss.
Letola, from the Jennings stable,
developed to be the real hot one and
after leading to the paddock was
nabbed and beaten a length by Money
Muss in 1:07. Hagei*don ran third.
The winner's odds receded from 3'/i
to 5.
With weight off. from his preceding
race and well handled by Larsen, Car
onal annexed, the last event, a mile
and a furlong- selling number." The
Chappelle entry was well played at
9 to 10 and passing Meehanus in the
run home, Larsen stalled off the rush
of Hildebrand astride Stilicho. re
ceiving the decision by half a length.
Heather Honey ran a fair third.
NOTES OF. THE TRACK.
\IÂ£ his first' public essay was not a
pronounced success, Prince Brutus
wiped out the memory. of that defeat
by/ taking,, the second two-year-old
event of the season in a common gallop
yesterday at Oakland - . ,
Because he had on*e nick on his gun,
Barney. Schreiber's youngster Henry
Ach closed a slight favorite over the
Cameron colt. An unavoidable circum
stance deprived the favorite- of all
chance of victory. Among the starters
was-Arisbe, a fast daughter of Brutus,
the entry of the Napa Stock Farm. She
ran green, and breaking away . head
and head with Henry. Ach carried the
favorite out almost from the time the
barrier was released.
' This gave Prince Brutus, with Bull
man up, clear sailing on the rail and
he won by himself. Arlsbe ran an ex
cellent race,- only losing the place .to
Peggy O'Neil ,by a length. Even when
straightened for the stand 'Ach did not
appear to possess the speed shown at
his debut, finishing a close fourth. The
winner stepped the distance : in :41%,
carrying 115 pounds, within a quarter
ol a second of the coast record. -

GRAND VIZIER OF PERSIA
TO VISIT SAX FRANCISCO
| Mrs. Mary E. Hart, famed as an ex
| plorer trf Alaskan wilds. â¢ collector of
! scientific specimens and writer of de
scriptions of the frozen north, arrived
I in this city on Jrfonday' evening, after
' an absence of three years spent In
| Alaska. Mrs. Hart has been appointed
as assistant to Governor Brady of Alas
ka to aid In arranging, an exhibition
at the St. Louis world's fair, and she
has also been appointed a special com
missioner of the Alaska Academy of
Sciences. Â¦ ' \ 'Â¦
Mrs. Hart thinks well of Alaska "and
even gx>es so far as' to say that It ii
the richest of all Uncle Sam's posses
sions. According:' to this woman ex
plorer, the northern country Is rich In
many minerals besides gold, and stock
raising and agriculture will soon be im
portant industries. -. Â¦ Â«. ., ..-Â¦:
i Mrs. Hart was â¢ appointed a special
I commissioner to the World's fair in
Chicago to take charge of the Alaskan
exhibit at that time, and her work won
for her praise from scientists, all over
the country. She says she expects to
accomplish even more at St. Louis this
year "and- hopes that . it . will be the
means of booming the many industries
of the north.
MOXJ3Y APPROPRIATED.
Though Governor Brady and Mrs.
Hart have never met. the former has
beard a great deal of her work, and this
Ted hfm' to,",'select, her toT'assist him at
the exposition. He had been in com
munication with her for some time and
i-a "few days -ago- wired her in this city
[ regarding her - appointment to . the jj po
sition of assistant to him in the work
j of collecting and arranging the exhibits
at the. fair. " â¢ . , . . ;
â¢Â¦I : feel hishly. flattered at theJmpor
tant charpe with' which * Governor
Brady b,as intrusted me," said Mrs.
Hart last night, "and I will .do all in
my power to make the exhibit of Alas
ka one of the most notable at the fair.
! It means a whole lot of work and there
â¢is not much time left, still if everything
goes all right the work can be accom
; pliehedl
j "I have already been appointed to
I represent the Alaska Academy of Sci-
I ences at the fair, but this is only an
: association of individuals and has noth
ing whatever to do with the Territorial
exhibit. Still, I will be able to com
j bine -the two exhibits in certain ways
j and one will be an aid to the other! in
this respect.
Â¦ "The Government has already appro
priated $65,000 for the Alaskan exhibit,
and I believe we; will Â¦ receive more.
Large sums have been collected from
prominent men in the north, so as far
as finances are to be considered we
are well off indeed and have plenty
of funds to carry out our project with.
SPLENDID COLLECTION.
"I have at the present time a splen
did collection of minerals, curios and
valuable Alaskan trinkets which I will
put on exhibition. Governor Brady is
also possessed .of a superb collection
and many others have volunteered
theirs, so we, are assured of plenty of
material. . ,
"I intended to stay here for a while
and then pay a. visit to my old home
in Los Angeles." but Governor Brady
states In his telegram that* he will ar
rive In this city on January 15, and is
desirous of meeting me and conferring
-wfith' me 'in regard to the comlng'work.
Whether he irjtenda for me to -return
to' Alaska or go direct to St. Louis I
do not know, though I will act" on' his
suggestions."
Mrs. Hart adds that the hardships
suffered by. the miners at Nome this
year . have been excessive and that
many of them were compelled to stay
there during the winter simply because
they did not have money enough with
which to' purchase tickets to 'get out.
No United States revenue cutters called
at Nome this year, as the Government
has been imposed upon by adventurers
so often that the services of the cut
ters have been denied the miners.
Mrs. Mary E. Hart Will
Represent Alaska
at St. Louis.

In July, 1902, suit was filed in the
Calaveras courts by J. H. Brothertt/n
against J. C. Kemp Van Ee, who has
been in control of the mine. Brother
ton likewise filed suit in London, where
considerable stock of the mine Is held.
Brotherton claimed to be an equal part
ner with Van Ee in the mine, and de
clared that the interest cf each was
one-quarter. The trial was to have
taken place in San Andreas on January
4. Both sires had been making elab
orate preparations for it and many â¢
long depositions had been taken.
The matter wajs settled out of court
on the eve of the trial. Brotberton was
represented by C. .H. Fairall. Asso
ciated with him was H. R. McNoble.
Van Ee had as counsel Jesse W. LI1
ienthal of San Francisco, F. J. Solinsky
and Frank Weheof San Andreas. For
Fairall the settlement is said to mean
& big fee and estimated to be in the
neighborhood of 550,000.
In 1S3S the Royal mine was sold- by
tbe then owners. Major J. D. Peter*,*
I. R. Wilbur and J. V. Castle for
$400,000. It was shortly after that the
disagreement between Brotherton and
Van Ee took place, and as a conse
quence the sellers of the mine only re
ceived a smal! portion of | the selling
price. They will now get the full
amount due them. The mine Is esti
mated to be worth in the neighborhood
of J4.000.000. The terms of settlement
have not been made public.
STOCKTON". Jan. 7.â While the Roy
al mine at Hodson has for the last
few weeks been in the throes of labor
troubles, it has also for the last year
and a half been in legal entanglements,
"which have now been adjusted by com
promise.
fxptclal Dispatch to The CÂ«ll
"The city needs the , revenue," said
the Mayor, "and while I admit that
there is a law against gambling I do
not . think that it can be effectlvely
enforced. nor do I think that it is ad
visable to try. Instead I have estab
lished a number of restrictions on the
gambling houses which minimize their
evil influence as far as, possible." â¢
The Prosecuting Attorney refused to
proceed against the gamblers and the
Chief of Police took the stand/that he
was acting entirely under the Mayor's
orders. ,The attitude of these Officials
left the people who/ wanted to close
gambling without any regular legal re
dress and they accordingly/resorted' to
the mandamus proceeding and asked
the court to order the officials to" close

PORTLAND, Jan. 7.â The attorney
representing Mayor Williams,' the Chief
of Police and, other city officials filed
to-day, a demurrer to the writ of man
damus which the Reform League re
cently applied for and. which, if grant
ed, will direct the city authorities to
close open gambling in Pprtland.-
Although there 1 are* many State and
municipal laws under which, public
gaming .could be suppressed the city
officials . have resolved to allow the
games. to. r.un upenly, on condition that
the gamblers pay, monthly fines, .which
aggregate nearly $3000 every thirty
days. The Mayor has publicly declared
that this was his policy and has firmly
rS?. used . A? change his._p fi lniqn of its
merits in deference to the many depu
tations and committees which have
waited upon him.' â¢ â¢ - y
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The board of , directors was given
power to prepare a set of by-laws and
to fix the ratio of representation, after
which the date for, the annual meeting
was fixed for the second Tuesday in
each year and the president was elect
ed the representative from the Califor
nia auxiliary to the National body.
A resolution was adopted that, any
organizer or officer or deputy any
association holding membership in the
auxiliary who shall run down any sis
ter organization for the purpose of
building up his own shall for the first
offense be rebuked and for a repetition
of the same be discharged from the
position he may hold.
Before the adjournment of the meet
ing a vote of thanks was given to Head
Consul Falkenburg for the . assist
ance and advice he had given and then
a, rising vote of appreciation was ten
dered to W. H. Barnes, who has been
an active fraternalist for forty-seven
years and who was the first vice presi
dent of the National Fraternal Con
gress, after which all present shook
hands with him and expressed pleasure
at meeting one who hRd done so much
for the advancement of fraternity and
who is known in every part of the
United States.
The board of directors was given
power to appoint an " editor who shall
obtain fraternal news ; from all' parts
of the State and furnish a synopsis of
the same to the newspapers.
Head Counsel Falkenburg gave an
account of the manner in which other
auxiliaries of the National Congress
had been organized and offered a num
ber of suggestions for the formation of
on*/in this State. He then said that
the" purpose of such auxiliaries was to
bring the representatives of the various
orders that hold membership in the Na
tional body into closer touch and with
the further idea or organizing, if oc
casion occurred, to prevent vicious leg
islation that would be detrimental to
the interest of the lodge system of pro
tection of the members. .He called
attention to a bill now before Congress
presented by a Senator from New Jer
sey, who is the head of a large insur
ance company, which has for its pur
pose the giving to the postal authori
ties the power to withhold all mail ad
dressed to or sent by any fraternal as*
sociation that has the lodge system of
protection for its members, a measure
which, if carried out, would stop the
business of all such lodges and deprive
the members of the protection which
has been vouchsafed to them.
FAIiKEXBURG THANKED.
â¢ A permanent organization was ef
fected by the election of the following
named officers for the first term: Dr.
F. W. Browning of the, A. O. U. W.,
president; Prescott L. , Archibald of
the Knights of Honor, vice president;
David Oliver Jr. of the .Woodmen of

ternal Brotherhood, J. W. Cuthbert of
the National Union, M. Scott of the

Union.
There are a number* of the fraterni
ties, such as- the Knights of the
Maccabees, Order of Pendo, Modern
Woodmen of America and kindred
organizations that were not repre
sented; for the reason, as was stated,
that the credentials authorizing repre
sentatives to attend the session had
not been received' from the head of
fices. There were a number of visitors
present, including F. A. Falkenburg,
head consul of the Woodmen of. the
World, who is the vice president of

dental Hotel and was called to order
by Dr. â¢ Fred "W. Browning, - grand

quest ol the National Fraternal.Con

tives of sixty-one fraternal beneficiary

gramme of Servian songs and mu
sic and an J elaborate banquet, at
which many of the national dishes

banquet hall covers were laid for
300 guests, and every seat was taken.
Some of those who attended the cele

In discussing the matter Mr. Dan
forth paid: "The couple informed me
that they came down hpre on the morn
ing' train to be married. He was an
elderly man, but well preserved. The
woman appeared to be under the in
fluence of liquor. I asked her if she
had been married and she declared that
she had been, .but was divorced in
Woodland. She was unable to tell me
whether a year had passed and I In
formed her that she would have to get
4 certified copy of the decree before 1
would issue a marriage license. The
eouDle declared they would get the
record and return for the license."
Klink is pretty well known in Sacra
mento as the claimant of an estate
worth $25,000. The case is in court.
'Cupid" Danforth declined yesterday
to issue a marriage license to Christian
Klink of Sacramento, aged 81, and
Mary Titjiens, Sacramento, aped 33
years, because the latter was under the
influence of liquor and had no proof
of having been divorced for more than

Among the liners passengers were
several newly wedded couples, whose
departure was made the occasion for
lavish floral display and the scattering
of much rice! The wharf was crowded
with friends of the people that thronged
the Siberia's decks and resembled an
animated flower bed when the big
steamship pulled away from her berth.
The passengers Included tourists, com
mercial travelers, missionaries and Asi
atics, and on the wharf their friends
made up a larger but equally varied
throng. *
The Siberia carried about 7000 tons
of freight, which Included a large ship
ment of lead and 700 tons of niter con
signed to Japan and possible elements
in the making of history should the
little brown man really tackle the bear.

Two Days at Hotel Del Monte.
I am perfectly satiEfiÂ°d that I ran now dredge
Â«he amount each month as called for under the
contract. The member* of the California dele
jrst'.cn in Congress have taken this matter up
?or me. There Is not the slightest word to be
*sid against the riant which I have built. I
fca\e invc5ted a very large fum of money to
carry out this contract and I feel sure that
the Government will ireat me fairly and grant
me ati extension of time.
I p'U in a serial plant at a cost of more
tr-.pn *15Â»Â».OOO. I had a new tiredgrr built and
x'rr. four big barges of large capacity. My
payroll has Kone on for nearly one year, and
we have dredged about 200.0C0 cubic yards of
cilt end dumped it. Of course 1 have not been
fb> to live tip to the exact terms of my con
tract as to the amount of work to be done.
That was due to *tortn*. the tli le required to
K't my plant built and the short time we could
work in dumping en the shore at low tide.
I have invested more than $200,000 In this
work and 1 am fully prepared to go on with it
K the Secretary of War will grant me an allow
ance of preparatory time.
CCRBENTS CAUSE TROUBLE.
Th*> tide* and currents have, however, flllrd
atp that uart of thÂ» bsy and I found only a.
ticnth of three t<> four fe?t of water at low
ti<>. That naturally rhortened our time of
oumpirg fiom the barges and we could not
work the big: dredger as long as I expected.
I an? now preparir.z my case to lay before
the Secretary of Wsr. The whole trouble In
thr rr?tter i* that I have been misled by the
Government charts of Sen I'ablo Bay. On the
Fou'.h fhore of the bay. where the dredged sand
and siit roust be, ciumprd. the charts showed
that there was a dÂ»pth cf cix feel of ivatcr
st low tide.
"The Government will probably call
for new bids." said Colonel Heuer, "'and
ihe surety companies who are on Ax
man's bond may be called upon to pay
the difference between the figures of
his contract and any excess that the
Government may be called upon to pay
on a new contract, recovering up to
the amount of the 530,000 bond."
Contractor Axman was asked yester
day as to what he purposed to do in
the matter and he made the following
statement:
Colonel Heuer said yesterday that he
ha<] no alternative in the matter and
that he was simply obeying the law in
recommending that the contract of Ax
man be canceled.
Contractor Rudolf Axman. who suc
Â« <*sstully destroyed Arch and Shag
rocks for the Government, is having a
;rÂ«?at deal of trouble with his latest en
terprise of deepening the channel of
San Pablo Bay and all on account of
Â» he shifting tides and currents.
Axman secured a contract from the
War Department more than one year
.-4go to dredge the channel of San
Pablo Bay. his bid being 11 45-100 cents
ppr xubic yard. The quantity of sand
and sxavel* to be dredped was estima
led at 2.721,000 cubic yards. The speci
fications of the contract called for a
â¢'hannel COO feet wide on the bottom,
with a length of 27.OCW feet and a depth
of SO feet at. mean low tide.
The excavated oarth was required to
be dumped on the south shore of the
hay behind bulkheads to be erected by
rhe contractor. The contract further
stipulated that not less than 100,000
â¢mbic yards r>*r month should be
dredged from the shoal and dumped at
thf specified points.
The shoal in San Pablo Bay is five
miles long and extends from Pinole
Point to Lone Tree Point and the
â¢ hannel was to be dredged through the
middle of the shoal.
PLANT A COSTLY ONE.
Contractor Axman, after securing the
contract, expended more than 5150,000
for the necessary plant. For the last
H^ven months Axman and his men
have worked hard, but they have not
satisfied the army engineers who have
supervision of the work and he was
â¢ >rdered to suspend operations the day
hefore Christmas.
Lieutenant Colonel W. H. Heuer of
i he engineer corps, in charge of the
liver and harbor works on this coast.
has notified the Secretary of "War that
Axman has failed to live up to his
<ontraÂ«t and has recommended that it
be canceled.
George E. Smith, aged 35 years, was
seriously injured. None of the passen
gers was badly burned.
The crowded passenger train
crashed into a train of empty ear?,
telescoping the rear car of the latter,
in which were the trainmen.
NEW YORK, Jan. 7.â Three train
men were kihed to-day by a collision
of two trains on the Brooklyn Ele
vated railroad. One of the victims
Â¦was hurled from the structure to the
street, and nearly every bone In his
body was broken, while another had
his head crushed between the. bumper
of^he engine, which, was rammed by
a motor train and the front car .of
the one drawn by steam power.
Simultaneously with the collision a
fire was started by the coals from the
locomotive, and this added ti> the
panic of the passengers, who fought
desperately to escape from the
wrecked cars. The dead, all of whom
were employed on the railroad, are:
GEORGE GILG, yardmaster.
JAMES O'BRIEN, car coupler.
WILLIAM H. FERGUSON, fore
man.

NEW TORK. Jan. 7.â To-day's stock market
reflected a mere sober view or the conditions
crewSr.* cat cf the war crisis In that Far East.
The result was a moderate recovery from the
fail- of yesterday. War cewg continued sorr.e
thSrg oTjl factor in all of the speculative mar-
Veti iind wheat rase and. cottca fell In response.
ILondoa had already scored some recovery from
its early decline before trading began here.
â¢The day's market In New Tort was sluggish
and listless. The Etar.a&rd stocks moved very
narrowly axd d!d not maintain the positions.
reflecting the shifting opinions of professional
.trtcer?, cteklug merely to follow prices. There
v.-ere wider movements In a collection of minor
EtockE. principally among the railroads, but
.embra.&jr.s seme of the low-priced Industrials
as < we!L Umttd States Steel preferred was
fcmÂ» throughout the day uztll the closing deal
ings. whtÂ» itÂ« gain, which had reached %
TSf !ted away In common with a reaction In the
whole .1st. The buj-lng of United States Steel
prcl erred was attributed to banking Â¦ Interests
assneiated with the corporation, and was be
lieved to be for purp'^es of support. News
of the day from the trade oITered r.o explana
tioo of the firmness of the stock, the leading
trade atnbcrity reporting a waiting attitude -on
the part cf buyers cf finished products in the
confidence thtt they could cover their require
ments with ease. Something -was rnÂ«de cf the
argument that the selling cf the Steel atotcts
haÂ» tlr.-a.tfy discounted the corÂ«lft.lon 4 of treat
est ciepreeslon and that economies from - wage
rttecti^na are to be felt from thjs time. Amal-
Ktmat-4 Copper showed temporary firmness tn
â¢ face of the heaviness of the general market
&nd then weakened -decidedly, presumably en
account of the reports of a Judicial holding on
a minor point in one of the company's nuraer
â¢ous lKlrations. The stock scored a loss on the
4*T ot V- Money continued to work declflcdly
ea*ier for all kinds of loans, time funds being
offered Jn abosdance at 4%.- except where large
â¢prcportiors in Industrial collateral were sought
ta be Included. Tfcls removed any obstruction
â¢ to the adv&nce In sterling exchange, while the
adranrr In dli-count rates In London helped to
1 lift sterling. The Bank cf England and Bank
of France exhibited the large repayments of
â¢ io&ns until the turn of, the year and the English
Institution pa'.-t-d in gold on the return from
domefctic char.nela. The Back of France, how.
e-vw, showed a loss of X2.000.000 In cold. One
cf the unsettling influences of an outbreak of
hostilities which has been most feared was
. l&nre withdrawals of French, capital now In
vested in London discounts to take care of
French holding* of Russians. The â¢ market
closed rather easy with reartlons.
Bine* were dull and irrerular. Total rales,

United States bonds were unchanged on call.

There was no change whatever In this mar
ket, whjch continued quiet, but Chicago broke
sharply, with the packers large sellers and
outside traders buying. Receipts of Hogs are
lante- and stocks are rapidly accumulating.
The. Chicago letter of Bolton. Ue Ruyter &
Co. says: "Market Is a little easier. Receipts
of HogB'are Iartre and prices' at the yards 10c
to 15c lower. There Is still a fair distributive
demand, but stocks are accumulating rapidly,
packers are marketing their product- freely,
and property is In the hands of scattered out
side buyers. It Is not a strong position after
so material an advance, and we are Inclined
to think the result will be lower prices."

CHICAGO, Jan. 7. â Wheat was nervous and
a disposition was manifested among traders
to play the market for a decline. Notwith
standing the fact that war news seemed about
as threatening as yesterday and that consols
were lower, opening prices showed lo*s?s, May
betag %c to %c lower at 87%Â©8Sc. There was
a'gdpd'deal of long wheat for rale and' May
was gradually forced down to 87%c. "a loss of

noon hour the sentiment suddenly changed on
an erroneous- cable dlapatch from Liverpool
alleging that hostilities between Russia and
Japan had "begun. Shorts became actiyp buy

May was advanced rapidly to 8S&C Denial of
the report resulted in as quick a reaction. May
again selling to 87Hc. .The close was weak at
almost the lowest figure of the day, with May
at S7HÂ«r*-%c
Corn was weak, partly because of the action
of wheat and partly because of lack of sup
port. May cU-sed %c lower at 47%Â©47*ic.
Oats revived 'a setback' early irt the'day, but
clowd unchanged at 30UÂ©30% c .

fairly large scale, especially in May pork, and
that product led the Un in seekmg- a low* r
level in crices. Late buying by commission
houses caused a steadier tone, but final figures
on May Dork were 35c lower. May lard was
down 12%c and ribs 12%c lower.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

When the- contents of the -stomach

were found, more than enough to kill
a: man. The police discovered that on

specifying the. quantity and purported
to be signed "McLaughlin; M.'D." '-' J.

On July ; 6 u Dr. Alfred ' Mclaughlin

The court also made an order direct
ing the executors to turn over to Ignatz
Steinhart forty-two shares of stock in
the Pacific Coast . Redwood Company
valued at $4200, claimed by Steinhart to
have been held in trust for the Navarro
Investment Company by the deceased.
Steinhart, through his attorney. Matt
Sullivan, agreed to furnish a bond for
the safekeeDing of the stock until the
validity of his claim was determined.
A motion to continue the hearing of
Andrew J. Clunle's j petition for, partial
distribution to him of- his Interest in
the estate .of ' his. -brother,', the late
Thomas J. Clunie, made by former
Judge Charles W/ Slack, the 'repre
sentative of Florence Clunie, widow, of
the decedent, raised a storm in the Pro
bate Court, where the motion was made
yesterdaSy. It aroused the' ire of An
drew Clunie' and 'caused- him to make
the announcement' that .he believed an
effort was being made to stipulate him
out of court andrto prevent" him from
taking part in the! management of the
estate that he, as one or\ the executors
of his brother's, will should take. He
protested vigorously ' against the con
tinuance, but- the court- saw fit to place
credence In Slack's statement that an
endeavor was being made' to effect a
compromise of >the contest waged by
the widow and set the matter, over un
til next Monday at . 4 , o'clock/
"At that time," said . Slack, "I' expect
to be enabled . to ,- announce v that the
present difficulties: will; be settled."
The wordy' war was -precipitated at
the very commencement of the hearing.
Slack asked for a continuance as soon
as the case was .called. 1 ""Efforts to
compromise this matter* .are, rbeing
made," he said, "and if the case is put
over a few days the compromise will, I
am sure, be effected.- In 'fact r know
to a certainty that .two of the execu
tors of- the. Clunie V.wiU' favor settling
the matter this way."
"I- object to any c#ntlnuance," said
Clunie. "I am an executorof ,the will
and I know nothing of any compromise.
This looks like an attempt of the other
two executors, Mr. White and Mr.
Brldgeford, to side with, the widow
against me." --
Former Supreme . Justice' Garoutte
and Attorney Charles J. Heggerty,
Clunie's legal representatives, also ob
jected to the continuance on the ground
that they knew nothing of any peace ;
negotiations, . but the court granted
Slack's request and set the'matter over.
Owing to the indisposition of Baron
ess von Horst she was unable to see
an interviewer last evening, and the
Baron supplied the details of the rob
bery. He stated that the Jewels, among
which were several Invaluable heir
looms, had been taken from the Baron
ess' trunk in their apartments. Ac
cording to the Baron, the Jewels were
kept in a jewel, case in the trunk, and
the key was secreted in a hiding place
known only to himself and wife. The
Baroness first became aware of her
loss upon discovering that her j purse
was missing and, suspecting that some
thing was wrong, opened the trunk to
find that the jewel case had been rifled
of its precious contents.
The thief was undoubtedly aware of
the hiding place of the key to the trunk,
as the lock was found intact. It is
the opinion of the Baron that the trunk
was opened, the booty secured and the
thief then locked It and replaced the
key in its hiding place. When asked
whether he suspected any one of the
crime. Baron von Horst stated that he
had the greatest cc-nfidence in the abil
ity of the American detectives and had
placed the matter entirely in their
hands. Baroness von Horst arrived in
this city from her London home on
Christmas and has been seen at many
society functions since her arrival.
The robbery is supposed to have tak
en place some time during Wednesday
night. The most valuable jewelry stol
en, according to the pcrlice report, is
a diamond and pearl pendant, a cres
cent brooch, lizard pin, gold marquise
ring, gold turquoise ring, diamond ring
and foreign coins valued at 5150.
A robbery of considerable magnitude
has been reported to the police by-
Baron von Horst, residing at the Colo
nial Hotel, corner of Pine and Jones
streets, and the detectives are endeav
oring: to find a clew to the perpetrators
and a trace of the stolen jewelry. Ac
cording to the Baron, his loss will
amount to 510,000, but the official re
port of Detectives Harper and Arm
strong fixes the valuation of the stolen
articles at $5S5.
