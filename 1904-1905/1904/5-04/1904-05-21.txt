Widow 1* Found Dead in Her Home.
. SAN DIEGO, May 20.âMrs. Frances
T. Brann, widow of Captain John
Brann, who was in the United States
revenue service on this coast, was
found dead in her residence at Olive
and Indiana streets this evening. She
had been riding her bicycle during the
earlier part of the day, and it was
then'that she was last seen alive.
The girl's tale Is a unique one, and
during- the four weeks she has been on
the road as a tramp she has covered
over 1300 miles. The fair prisoner de
clares she was driven from home by
the cruelty of her family, and, attired
in a suit of clothing^borrowed from a
boy friend, she crawled through a win
dow and escaped during the night. Sne
says she at once fell in with a lot of
tramps, among whom she found* her
present pal. She avows she will not
return home, preferring the company
of hobos, who, she says, treat her like
a queen -wheji she is with Grant.
5 Fearing . ttie> officers Miss Morrison
says she has traveled by night and
slept during the day, whenever pos
sible. Miss Morristti refused to change
her style of apparel, declaring that
she preferred her present attire, which
she says she will wear until she reaches
St. Louis. Judge Boyle fined her $20.
Grant was fined $200 for carrying con
cealed weapons. The Butte police will
hold both until the Oregon authorities
are heard from.
BUTTE, Mont.. May 20.â Pretty 16
year-old Jennie Morrison of Baker
City, Ore., and Edward Grant, believed
to be a fugitive from the Oregon peni
tentiary, were placed under arrest to
day by the Butte police as the two
were endeavoring to beat their way
out of the city an a Great Northern
train. Miss Morrison is a dashing
young woman, and her flowing tresses
of golden hair and rosy-hued cheeks
at once excited the suspicions of the
officers. "

The French Government does not in
tend to send a warship to Tangier or
otherwise intervene In connection with
the capturing of Perdicaris and Var
ley. The right of France to Intervene
would raise a direct issue with the
Sultan of Morocco concerning the ex

Government's advices are that Mo
hammed-el-Torres. the representative
of the Sultan at Tangier, will meet the
brigands* demand in order to secure
the prisoners' release. Unofficial ad
vices say that Mohammed-el-Torres
has already recalled the Moorish
troops, as the brigands demanded.
Consul Gummere informed the State
Department to-day by cable that the
bandits had carried the captives into
th% mountains. No terms of a ransom
have yet been received by their friends
or by the Moroccan authorities, who,
Gummere says, are assisting in every
way in attempts at rescue. Gummere
states, however, that the presence of

"WASHINGTON, May 20. â No gentle

he was before removing .there of suf

Early this morning there came to the
attention of Acting Secretary Loomis
at the State Department telegrams
from Representative Lanning, Senator
Kean and Senator Dryden. /
Lanning stated that Perdicaris was
born in New Jersey and had inherited
a large fortune made in gas stock
speculations from his father, who was
a Greek. He traveled extensively, is
an author of some repute, completing
and publishing several books. He is
also an artist and sculptor. In the
course of his globe trotting he visited
Tangier and it so captivated his
artistic tendencies that he decided to
take up his residence- there, purchas

DENVER, May 20.â A cloudburst at

After the death of a sister a year ago
her peculiarities became more marked.
With a sister she lived at 345 Beacon

A month ago Francis P. Greene, an

Mr. and Mrs. Babcock had risen and
ordered breakfast this morning and
were waiting, when Miss Greene went

Woman.
BUTTE, Mont., Mav 20.â In the un
earthing of a skeleton upon the Merl
lng ranch, near Stone Station, twenty
miles north of Phlllpsburg, the officers
believe another mysterious murder has
been revealed. The remains were dis
covered by James Conn while he was
plowing on a ranch formerly owned
by Mrs. Merling, a woman of notorious
record. The skeleton, which was
crushed, was turned from the earth by
the plow a short distance from the
house, once the home of the Merling
woman. Mrs. Merllng was accused
about' a vear ago of shooting John
Conn to death and then killing his
aged mother bv pounding her on the
head with' a hammer. Both were her
neighbors. After the tragedy Mrs.
Merling acted queerly and was sent to
the hospital, and during a delirium
the attendants swore the woman raved
wldlly and confessed the double mur
der. Mrs. Merling Is also said to have
shot her husband years ago. The
neighbors for years have believed Mrs.
Merling to be demented, and the
Conns, sympathizing with the woman,
attempted to care for her rather than
permit her to live as a recluse.

NEWARK,. N- J_, May 20. â The case
, of E. H, Harriraan and WInslow S.
Piorc* against the Northern Securities
'Company, being a petition for an "in
junction to prevent the carrying out
of the plan for the distribution of
railroad stock held by the securities
company, was called before United
States Judge Bradford to-day. This
suit is similar to one heretofore dis
missed by the United, States Circuit
Justices at SL PauL the Northern Pa
cific, however, having been made a co
dpfondant in the present action.
Neither Harriman nor President Hill
of the Northern Securities Company
veitt present when the case was called.
Attorney Thatcher was present, rep
resenting the Oregon Short Line bond
holders, to protest agnJnst the suit on
' the ground that the trustees of that
line, who had been named in the peti
tion, had no right to interfere with
' the plan for distribution of Northern
Securities assets, the bondholders In
sisting that the plan proposed was
perfectly just and equitable.
Argument was about to begin when
Attorney Thatcher petitioned the court
to be heard. He said he did not want
to ask to intervene at this stage of
the proceedings or to be placed on the
record as one of the litigants. His
client, he said, simply wanted the
COUrt to hear his views.
Lindabury held that the request
should not b<? granted unless the peti
tioner was willing to go on thÂ« rec
ords.
Judge Bradford said that while the
notion might be a little irregular, he
would prant the request, his object
being solely to get at all the facts In
the case.
Thatcher said it would take but
forty minutes to present his views, and
the court said he would be heard later. â¢
Francis V. Lindabury opened for j
the plaintiff. He argued that the i
Northern Securities Company was
never properly in possession of the
â¢Northern Pacific and Great Northern
stocks, because it obtained them in a |
manner which the courts had declared
to be illegal.
Lindabury said the Oregon Short I
Line had acquired J78.000.000 of the j
$153,000,000 of stock of the Northern
Pacific, or a majority of the whole.
â¢But of this stock only $37,000,000 was
common, while the full issue of com
mon stock was 5 SO, 000, 000. Under the
charter of the Northern Pacific, it was J
later learned, the common stockhold- j
ers in the meantime notified Harriman i
snd the Oregon Short Line Company
that they "proposed to retire the pre
ferred stock and issue common in its
place, but that no holder of the pre
ferred stock would be allowed to sub
scribe for the new issue of common
stock. At the same time Morgan and
Hill announced that they were about
to organize the Northern Securities
Company, and that Harriman and the
Oregon Short Line people could put
their stock of the Northern Pacific
Into the new corporation on the same
basis as Morgan and Hill were putting
theirs. Lindabury said that his clients
were thus forced into the combinat'on.
He dec-kired that they had nothing to
do with the organization of it and
they claimed that now they have a
right to their stock deposited.
HONOLULU, May 20.â Ex-Land
Commissioner E. S. Boyd and Chief
Clerk S. Mahaulu were arrested to-day
on charges of embezzlement.
Commissioner J. W. Pratt of the^ De
partment of Public Lands says that the
discoveries made by an examination of
the records indicate that the alleged
peculations of the accused extend back
for four or five years. The department
shortage is alleged by Commissioner
Pratt to be over $10,000. The arrests
have caused a great sensation. /

MIKADO'S SOLDIERS DISLODGED,
ST. PETERSBURG, May 20.â An
official. report has, been received to the
effect that General Rennenkampff's
Cossacks fell on the Japanese columns
advancing from Fengwangcheng on
Wednesday and that ' the . Japanese
were compelled to retreat for a dis
tance of twelve miles. The Russians
have evacuated Kaiping (or Kaichou,
about thirty-five miles south of New
chwahff) without a fight. "
.. Apprehension .of. ..Rennenkampff**
Cossacks hovering north, the authori
ties say, may explain the cautious ac
tion of General Kuroki in establishing
a strong base at Fengwangcheng and
halting the column which was march
ing on Haicheng. It may also be a
solution of the mystery of Newchwangr,
which at first was reported to have
been' evacuated and which is now said
to have been reoccupled by the Rus
sian's, for, if Kuroki has definitely
stopped his westward movement,
Kuropatkin could safely continue to
hold it without, danger of the occupy
ing force being cut off.
.The general staff took occasion to
day to deny the report of a battle
having been fought at Kaichou, in
which 200 Russians were killed. As a
matter of fact, the Russians quietly
withdrew from Kaichou, being unwill
ing to expose their force at that point
to the attack of a column marching
from the east that landed in South
ern Liaotung. The evacuation of Kai
chou also shows, it is said, that there
is no truth in the report that Kuropat
kin has sent 10,000 men to retake that
place. The report that Kuropatkin
has sent 70,000 men to relieve Port
Arthur is declared by the general staff
to be incredible. Such a move, they
eay, would only court disaster, for
Kuroki naturally would take advan
tage of the movement to throw his" en
tire army across the railroad and
strike from the rear, while the Jap
anese troops in Southern ' Liaotung
would attack In front.
No news has reached here of the en
gagement at Kinchou,' and the ab
sence of Information is explained by
the slowness of communication due to
the strength of the Japanese force as
sailing' the Russian positions around
Port Arthur. No surprise is expressed
at the fact that engagements occur as
the Russians fall fack on Port Arthur.
It Is reiterated that Lieutenant Gen
eral Stoessel's plan does not contem
plate imperiling the fortress by the
loss , of too many men outside. The
authorities rather believe their in*
formatlon that he had almost; entirely
withdrawn Inside the fortress defense
several days ago. That the Japanese
will strain every nerve to take Port
Arthur, in view of the disaster to their
fleet, is not questioned In naval circles,
and in spite of the danger of Russian
mines, Admiral Togo is expected to co
operate in the assault upon Port
Arthur. It is suggested that he may
land heavy guns, but this Is doubted by
the general staff, who 1 know that the
force which landed at Pltzewo debarked
siege guns, which can readily be
brought into position before j Port
Arthur so soon as the road is clear.
PUEBLO, Colo., May 20. â The
heaviest hailfctorm seen in this city for
many years started at 2 o'clock this
afternoon. Hail that weighed more
than three ounces fell to a depth of
aiif inch Considerable damage was
done and hundreds of windows were
broken.
The principal business houses in the
city having skylights and tile roofs
are all damaged and many merchants
suffered losses of stock through the
hail pouring through the broken sky
lights. The fruit trees in the vicinity
are stripped and early vegetables
pounded Into the ground, while every
hothouse within the storm radius is a
total wreck. Some of the hailstones
measured fourteen inches in circum
ference. In several instances the
largest stones punctured shingled roofs
and fell clear through to the floor.
Nearly 100 persons were injured by be
ing struck with big hail stones. Two
Mexican children living at Salt Creek
were repotted killed by the storm, but
the story cannot be confirmed. Tele
graph and telephone wires were con
siderably damaged.
A News special from Cheyenne, re
ceived by telephone, says that six per
sons are known to have been drowned,
namely two. Clayton children. Private
Hughes of the Artillery,
and two men, a woman and a child
whose names have not been learned.
The Union. Pacific tracks at Bufford,
twenty-six miles west of Cheyenne, are
washed out in many places. Two of
that company's bridges have gone out,
and its tracks have been weakened on
the line between Cheyenne and Greely,
Colo. In the city of Cheyenne the
lengthy embankment on which runs
the Union Pacific tracks has been
pierced In two" places. This embank
ment is holding the flood, and water
has accumulated to a depth of twenty
feet and extending over a space two
miles wide and several miles in length.
The opening in the embankment is not
large enough to carry off the water
and the pressure against the embank
ment Is liable to cause other breaks.
lower sections, flooding the dwellings
and business houses. Telegraph wires
between Denver and Cheyenne are dis
abled.
The Boerse Gazette remarks: "The
news of the enemy's losses will cheer
Russia. and make some amends for the
treacherous Japanese attack at the
outbreak of the war. It is now the
enemy's misfortune to experience the
deadly effect of submarine mines,
which have done us so much damage.
Great is Russia's God. The war has
entered on a new phase, nastening the
Russian victory."
The Listok observes: ".There, is no
intention to celebrate the Japanese
losses by a torchlight procession. It is
not our custom to make a national re
joicing over an enemy's misfortune.
Nonetheless, it is Impossible, to conceal
the fact that the nation is greatly im
pressed by the catastrophe to the Jap
anese fleet, which goes to show once
more how accidents may upset the best
laid plans."
The Gazette makes the most caustic
comment of any of the Russian papers.
It says: "It is just retribution for the
treacherous attack at Port Arthur
without declaring war, and the dast
ardly onslaught on the Variag and
Koreitz. The mines laid by our brave
sailors have done their work, and all
reproach for the Petropavlovsk disaster
is wiped out." Â«.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 20.â With
greater calm than has been felt since
the beginning of the war, Russia to
; day faces the situation in the Far EasU
: The disasters sustained by the Japa
! nese fleet have strengthened the na
tional spirit, and the officials carefully
point out that they restore in a meas
ure the prestige lost by the past untar
nished successes of the enemy. Should
the persistent reports of the Japanese
army having been driven back to Feng
wangcheng prove true, then the au
thorities and people will feel that Rus
sian progress has been vindicated and
that the two belligerents can recom
mence the war on a more even foot
ing. The first effect of the Russian
successes will, it is believed, be ap
parent In the behavior of the Chinese,
whose attitude has been decidedly hos
tile to the Russians, and to bring this
change about it Is expected that the
Russian agents In China will follow the
Japanese plan of fully Informing the
Celestial* of the losses inflicted on the
enemy. Although in St. Petersburg
there is individual enthusiasm over the
Japanese disasters near Port Arthur,
there will be no collective demonstra
tion. The wholesale rejoicing will come
with the announcement of an achieve
ment of a more thrilling character,
which will appeal to the volatile side
of the Russian people.
Everywhere to-day one hears praise
of the Russian torpedo-boats In stealing
out in the darkness, perhaps through
a line of small boats of the enemy, to
plant mines where the heavier of the
enemy's ships had cruised a few hours
before. But, after all, it Is pointed out
there remained a big element of chance
as to whether the enemy would return.
The authorities had almost come to the
conclusion that the catastrophe which
they had prepared would not come
about because of the cleverness of Vice
Admiral Togo in keeping away from
the dangerous waters, as if aware of
the Russian operations. The tone of
the comments of the press to-day is
sober, while at the same time recog
nizing the importance of the Russian
success, and is well expressed by the
Russ, which says:
"Japan's losses jeopardize her
mastery of the sea. It is a streak of
bad luck, like ours. The forces are
now about equal, without the Baltic
squadron. It is not for us to rejoice,
but it was not worth while to bring
the Kasuga from Genoa to sink the
Yoshino."
CHICAGO, May 20.â A special to the
Daily News from .Tokio says:. .. ; , \
Port Arthur is to be taken by storm
the moment proper -preparations- have
been completed. Siege, guns have yet
to be placed in position and the land
forces appointed for the assault have
to bo .strengthened. The, unexpected
loss of two ' "Japanese I vessels has . em
phasized the* Insecurity of sea power,
and the authorities-feel ihat. no chances
must be taken that would encourage
Russia, to. send ,-put.,the.- BpJtlc- fleet
counting on finding a harbor of. refuge
in Port Arthur. ' . Â¦'Â¦, . . : , Â¦ ;
It is realized that the. storming of
the fortress will inevitably cost 'many
lives,' but it is said the; waters where
the 'Japanese ships- are forced^ to
maneuver . are becoming so dangerous
because' of floating mines that ' heroic
measures are Imperative. Under these
circumstances -It 'Â¦ is thought : that life
will;' be economized by storming the
stronghold . and eliminating it and the
adjacent waters from the area of
actual conflict. . .
The casualties sustained by the op
posing forces have not yet . been an
nounced.
ST, PETERSBURG, May 20.âFollow
ing on the heels of the news of the dls
' asters to the Japanese fleet, the gen
eral staff to-day received official ad
vices of the defeat of the Japanese
fcrce which was marching' northward
from Fengwangcheng for the purpose
of executing a flank movement on
Mukden. Details of the dispatch will
not be made public until it has been
passed by the war commission, but
enough has been communicated 'to the
Associated Press to make it clfear that
in order to save themselves from de
struction the Japanese were compelled
to retreat toward : Fengwangcheng.
Since General Kurokl sent a column
northward to gain the road leading di
rectly west from Mukden, General Ku
rcpatkin has kept it under the closest
surveillance, awaiting the Â¦ moment
when it should be so distant from- the
main Japanese army, as to prevent its
easy reinforcement. In observing this
plan the Russians withdrew, and the
Japanese, not finding a strong force of
the enemy before them, continued to
advance. When the. . time, for, aqtion
came General Kuropatkin let General
Rennentampn* loose from leash. Gen
eral Rennenkampft* had under his com
mand only a few regiments, but they
were the flower of the Cossack cavalry.
On May IS he fell crn the enemy;
whose number has not' yet been re
vealed, with such, vijjor us to compel
the Japanese retirement twelve miles
toward the base, near enough/ it is
presumed, to have received reinforce
ments from General Kuroki, who must
immediately have been advised of .the
awkward pruJtBament. â¢ The opera
tions are described by the general staff
as such a move as it would be expect
ed General Kuropatkin would make
and for which General Rennenkampff
was fitted and chosen. The latter's ap
pearance on the stage was somewhat
late. It had been intended that he
6hould raid Korea at the beginning of
the war, but he arrived at the front
too late. The general staff believes
General Rennenkampff's attack must
have been in the nature of a thunder
bolt. He is a man to attack quickly
and hard, once given tne opportunity,
and his men, veterans of the Chinese
campaign, had been selected especially
because they knew what it was to be
under fire. }Â¦ V ':';

Arthur W. Ferguson went out to the
Philippines as secretary to the Taft
Civil Commission. The party of Fili
pinos referred to in the above dispatch
is in his charge. It is sent to the
United States at the expense of the
Philippine Government to study Amer
ican methods and institutions, so that
the members may impress their fellow
countrymen upon their return home
with the truth of American civiliza
tion. They will visit the principal cities
of the United States and will spend
some time at the national capital.
Bowling, late in the afternoon is
much pleasanter than at any other
time. The wind and sun have gone
down and the air and surroundings
are delightful. In Scotland, the home
of the game, all of the bowling is
done after sundown, the long twilight
there giving ample time to bowl sev
eral games.
As to-day Is the last day allowed for
the completion of the first round of
the doubles tournament some interest
ing games will be played. Three
matches remain, and, as the contest
ants are evenly matched, the games
should be close. J. P. Taylor and W.
H. Stewart will play A. Hay and A.
McNalr. The latter are stronger than
their opponents and are expected to
win. J. S. Webster and G. C. Patter
son, if they play up t<o form, are ex
pected to beat Joseph Gray and the
Rev. W. K. Guthrie. The match be r
tween Charles Adams and James Gray
and E. J. Clinton and A. A. McVicar
will be a close one, with the odds
slightly in favor of the latter team.
Dr. Hamilton and W. R. Eaton
caused quite a surprise by beating Y.
C. Lawson and Alex Craig. Mr. Law
son has always been considered one
of the cleverest bowlers in the club,
but has been out of form of late.
Hamilton and Eaton were accurate and
did some excellent bowling. Hamilton
is a new man at the game, but already
ranks with the cracks. Hamilton and
Eaton will get a default from Foreman
and Moffatt and thereby obtain a place
in the semi-finals. Moffatt and Fore
man were probably the strongest team
In the tournament and their with
drawal is a source of great disappoint

With the new green in Golden Gate

Forbid the borrowing and lending of money,

would cease and civilization recede. Luxuries
may well be made to bear burdens, but actual
necessities of life should be furnished at least

The association went in a body to

CREDIT IS A NECESSITY.
Had the framers of the constitution stopped
with the requirement as above they would
have builded wl.Â«er than they knew and their
work would have been a subject for con
gratulation; but poaspased by the idea com
mon to lawmakers that natural laws of busi
ness in force and operation from the beginning
of civilization can be controlled or set aside
by legislative enactment, they proceed to say
(article XIII. section 5):
"Every contract hereafter made "by which
a debtor is obligated to pay any tax or as
sessment on money loaned, or on any mort
gage, deed of trust or other lien, shall, as
to any Interest specified therein, and as to
such tax or assessment, be. null and void."
In theory and form this provision has been
respected; In fact and in practice tt has been
totally Ignored and disregarded.
There Is little or no attempt at disguise in
this matter: every Intelligent borrower un
derstands full well that, in form of Increased
interest, he pays the tax on his mortgage
plus a percentage to compensate for ths use
less expense and labor Imposed by the con
stitution and statutes upon the lender.
LAW IS DISREGARDED.
Thlj requirement was made In the fancied
Interest of the debtor. It being supposed that
It would transfer a part of his burden of
taxation to the creditor. >*
Two distinct as*ej=.Taents to cover one and
th<- same property, and the collection of taxes
thoreon nominally at least from two separate
parties. . Involves needless expense to counties,
municipalities and Individuals, but the waste
may be tolerated In view of the protection
afforded against the twlc e taxing of one and
the same value.
The constitution and statutes of this State
require that taxes on real estate subject to
mortgage shall be paid by two distinct parties
â the one the mortgagee, the other the mort
ragor.

VALLEJO, May 20.â An attempt was
made shortly before 12 o'clock last
night to assassinate either William
M. Stevens or his wife at their home
at 909 Ohio street. They retired to bed
at 11:30, and ten minutes later the
would-be assassin fired a shot through
the open window of their sleeping
apartment. The bullet struck Mrs.
Stevens, inflicting a painful wound. It
entered at the end of the spine and.
ranging upward six Inches, made its
exit. Dr. Bend, who is in attendance,
says that If Mrs. Stevens had not been
Ij'ln.sr in a doubled-up position the bul
let would have gone directly into her
body.
The would-be assassin evidently
knew the arrangement of the house
well and from what point he could fire
the most effective shot. Mrs. Stevens
was occupying the side of the bed near
est the window.
Traces of a vehicle that had been
driven up In front of the Stevens resi
dence were found, but James Perry,
a neighbor, who wÂ«nt to the scene of
the shooting soon after he heard the
shot, saw no one leaving the premises.
For the first time in weeks a watch

The true meaning of the law pro

decree aside "because they have be

NO PROOF OF .HERESY.
LOS ANGELES, May 2O.^When the
general conference adjourned at 6
o'clock this evening seven of the eight
Bishops to be elected had been chosen,
and the eleventh ballot, taken just be
fore adjournment, probably has result
ed in the election of the eighth. The
list of Bishops. thus far chosen is as
follows:
Dr. Joseph F. Berry of Chicago, Dr.
Henry F. Spellmeyer of Newark, N. J.;
Dr. William F. McDowell of New York:
Dr. James W. Bashford of Delaware,
Ohio; Dr. William Burt of Rome, Italy;
Dr. Luther B. Wilson of Baltimore and
Dr. Thomas B. Neely of Philadelphia.
' Dr. William Burt was elected on the
fifth ballot, taken last night, the "result
of which was announced in this morn
ing's Call. Dr. Wilson was chosen on
the sixth ballot, which was announced
before recess to-day. The seventh and
eighth ballots resulted in no election,
but on the ninth Dr. Neely was elect
ed by 486 votes out of the 700 cast, 467
being, necessary to. a choice. The tenth
ballot was taken just before adjourn
ment this evening and resulted in no
election. Dr. J. R. Day received the
highest number of ballots, 311 out of a
total , of, .706 cast, '47J. . being 'necessary to
a choice. This showed a Day loss of 39
votes, he having polled 350 in the ninth.
The election of th<j eighth Bishop is
now thought to lie between Dr. Day
and Dr. R. J. "Cooke of Chattanooga,
with the' chances favoring the latter.
The situation is so complicated to
night that no ' one would be greatly
surprised to see both candidates defeat
ed and some clergyman not yet named
chosen in their stead.
Dr. J. W. E. Bowen, the colored can
didate for episcopal honors, twice an
nounced . to-day his withdrawal from
the race, and on the tenth ballot his
strength had dropped to sixty votes. .
Bishop Luther B. Wilson Is a gradu
ate of Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa.,
and Is at present presiding elder at
Baltimore, Rid.. He is the youngest
man of the seven men elected to the
bishopric at this conference. His age
Is 42 years.
OLDEST OF THE MEN ELECTED.
Bishop Thomas B. Neely is the oldest
of the men elected and has been a can
didate for the office at several confer
ences. For the past four years he has
been editor of Sunday-school publica
tions at Philadelphia and secretary of
the Sabbath School Union and Tract
Society. He is a vigorous debater and
an authority on parliamentary law.
The episcopacy committee recom
mended in its special report to the con
ference this morning the election of
four Missionary Bishops, as follows:
One additional for Africa, two addi
tional for South Asia and one for Japan
and Korea, the latter a new episcopal
district. The election of these four, of
ficers will be begun immediately after
the electton of, the eighth general su
perintendent. Â¦Â¦'. Â¦ Â¦ .;- . 7
The Itinerancy committee appointed
Monday reported late this - afternoon
on the proposal to restore tjie four-year

and a minority report were submitted.

to force -it through to adoption without
debate.. -..Those rt avoring ;the minority
report succeeded In staving off the vote

Since the convention was called peo
ple in the Interior have taken a
great amount of pains to investigate
for themselves. The San Joaquin Coun
ty delegates made an inspection early
this week in company with Colonel
Heuer and M. A. Nurse, engineer for
the Board of Public Works, of the Sac
mmento River from its mouth to a
rcint near Rio Vista, and thence,
through Three Mile Slough, they went
over to the San Joaquin River.
The old question concerning the di
version of the waters of the Sacra
mento River to the San Joaquin River
was talked of to some extent. The
Stockton Independent says that Colonel
Heuer remarked that he would not
consent to turn the Sacramento
River into the San Joaquin at any
point without fuller data than he had.
The Independent also says that "the
San Joaquin delegates will stand for
any improvement that may be satis
factory to the Sacramento River peo
ple if they confine the river to their
own channels, but they will to a man
oppose any proposition to turn Sacra
mento water into the San Joaquin at
any point."
This is the only indication of a defi
nite plan on the part of any delega
tion that has yet developed. The sup
position is entertained in this city that
all matters that are of great import
ance will be referred to committees
with little prelimniary discussion. The
list of delegates to the river convention
had not been received in full by the
California Promotion Committee yes
terday, but may be completed to-day.'
Prominent men will be present. San
Joaquin County will be represented by
at least thirty delegates. A large dele
gation will come down from the Sacra
mento Valley. The delegation of the
California, Miners' Association will
number twenty. The San Joaquin party
that inspected the Sacramento River
at its mouth Included:
The delegates from the interior to the
river convention will be in th'ls . city
to-morrow in force. Boards of Trade,
Chambers of Commerce, the California
Miners' Association and many bodies
have appointed representatives to
speak and act for them. The Valletta,
a river steamboat, will bring in a large
body of visitors from the interior, prin
cipally from the Sacramento Valley.
Altogether there are about 700 persons
entitled to act as delegates. .The at
tendance will probably be large, as
river improvement is a live topic and
possesses much interest in view of the
recent floods.
Two important matters were dis
cussed and disposed of by the Board
of Park Commissioners yesterday
afternoon. The first was the selection
of a course by which automobiles
might enter the south drive of Golden
Gate Park without passing along the
section of Stanyan street, between Oak
and' Warier, and the" other was a de
termination to rid theÂ»cean beach of
venders' and peddlers' wagons. Mayor
Schrnitz attended the meeting and it
was at his request that the automobile
matter was settled.
. Commissioners DIngee, Lloyd, Alt
mann and Sullivan were present and
the first named presided In the absence
of President Spreckels. The question
of a route for the horseless machines
j was first taken up at the suggestion of
the Mayor,, who said that they had
become a menace to life and limb on
the thoroughfare he described.
Schmitz told of the thousands of peo
ple who alight and board cars at the
Haight and Hayes street entrances of
the park and of the dangers incurred
by the speed machines. It was finally
agreed that the automobiles must en
ter the park at jQak street and imme
diately cross over to the south drive
within the inclosure. For the protec
tion of pedestrians In the grounds a
rustic bridge will ' be constructed
which will afford them a crossing
other than that on the driveway. It
was suggested to grade an automobile
speedway in the district south of the
park for a distance of two miles. The
automobile clubs will be asked to bear
a portion of this expense.
Commissioner Lloyd called attention
to the disgraceful condition of the
beach. He stated that debris of all
description was cast about on the sand
and that pleasure for people who de
light in loitering about In the vicinity
of the waves was fast becoming im
possible. On a motion it was ordered
that venders and salesmen of all de
scriptions be ordered. to move from the
beach and that the police prevent
them from returning. After this de
cision it was moved that Superintend
ent McLaren, who will soon depart for
a trip to Scotland and European coun
tries, be voted the sum of $1000 with
which to defray his expenses in visit
ing and collecting data from other
parks in pursuance to an order of the
board.
Several valuable donations were
accepted, and, in compliance with the
request of the Memorial day commit
teee. Superintendent McLaren was em
powered to donate all the flowers he
could spare to be used in decorating
the graves of soldiers. Joseph Cleary
was appointed temporary superintend
ent while McLaren is away from the
city. Some discussion arose as to
whether his salary should be Increased
when he enters upon this temporary
duty, but the point was not settled.

ALUMNI OF CALIFORNIA
ELECTS NEW OFFICERS
Changes Are Made In the Board of
Trustees and in the Board of
Administrators.
The alumni of the University â¢ of
California met last night at the Mark
Hopkins Institute of Art for the pur
pose of electing officers. The recep
tion committee, consisting of many
graduates from as far back as 1886,
was on hand to receive former college
mates.
The election took place at 10 o'clock
in the Searles gallery and Alexander
G. Ealds'was elected president; War
ren Olney Jr., first vice president;
James P. Booth, second vice president;
Alfred S. Skaife, secretary, and James
K. Moffitt, treasurer. Alexander G.
Eald^s and Alfred S. Skaife were
elected trustees. W. T. Ritter, P. E.
Bowles, J. N. Le Conte, Charles E.
Green and Alexander G. Ealds (ex
offlcio) comprise the board of admin
istrators of the Le Conte memorial
fund.
The galleries were well filled with
ex-Berkeleyites and after the election
light refreshments were served. The
affair was conducted under the aus
pices of Frank Otis and W. E. Creed,
who have served their allotted two
years on the board of trustees and re
tired last night. â¢ â¢
NEW YORK, May â¢ 20.â Bradstreefs
to-morrow will say: Weather condi
tions are still the apparent drawback
in the trade and crop situation. Tem
peratures have been too cool to allow
of free distribution of spring and sum
mer goods at retail, and they likewise
retard germination and growth of
crops, though permitting good progress
in seeding in various, sections of the
country. In Jobbing circles the feeling
is that the spring trade Is past and
gone, and efforts are now concentrated
on fall business, reports as to which
are fairly good, though not equal to a
year ago. Some faint evidences of Im
provement ' are to be noted, particu
larly in the shoe and leather industry,
and in wool at Western primary mar
kets, but against this are to be cited
further weakness in Iron, rather more
quietness in lumber and talk of further
curtailment In common mill produc
tion.
The industrial situation is rather
quieter, but the most serious strike of
the year, that of the masters and pilots
of lake vessels, continues, with no pros
pect of settlement. This has practically
killed the transportation on the lakes,
and coal, ore," lilmber and grain trades
exhibit the effect of the almost total
stoppage of the activity. Railway earn
ings show recessions from last year.
At eastern markets wholesale trade in
dry goods is of moderate proportions,
though symptoms of improvement are
not entirely absent. Rather more Is
reported doing In hides this week and a
fractional advance is reported. Per
haps the most pronounced weakness
shown by any one product is that
noted in Iron. The other metals are all
rather weak, copper being lower both
at home and abroad, and lead being
dull and heavy at a slight decline.
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending May 19 number 215,
against 201 last week, 155 in the like
week in 1903, 152 in 1902, 192 in 1901 and
167 in 1900.
In Canada failures for the week num
ber 11, against 13 last week and 10 a
year ago.
R. O. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of
trade to-morrow will say:
Reports of increased trade are re
ceived from a few favored points, but
the nation as a whole has not improved
in commercial position during the past
week, in so far as current distribution
of merchandise ..pr .manufacturing ac
tivity is concerned. Prospects for the
future have improved somewhat, how
ever, on account of the progress in ag
riculture. Unless the crops suffer an
unusual setback hereafter it should
be a good year for the farmers and
all other industries will feel the stim
ulus. Leading branches of manufac
tures are extremely quiet, the re
cent slight gain in iron and steel hav
ing disappeared, and transporting in
terests are not equal to last year's rec
ords, railway earnings thus far avail
able for May showing a decrease of 6.6
per cent.
Hides of late continue in good de
mand, branded steers and cows show
ing the most strength. Larger receipts
of foreign dry hides have somewhat de
pressed the market.
Failures this week number 236 In the
United States, against 191 last year, and
19 in Canada, compared with 14 a year
ago.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
The claim of Mrs. Elizabeth Lloyd
Nix to a child's share of the estate
of the late Berkeley .capitalist, Charles
R. Lloyd, is denied by Thomas Addl
son and Arthur W. Goodfellow, execu
tors of the will. In an answer filed to
day the issue is squarely made for a
second contest over the wealth which
has been fought for by, one of his sons
and now by an alleged daughter. Mrs.
Nix claims to be the daughter of Lloyd
and Mary Skan, as the result of an
amour in. Bristol, England, in 1862. '
In her complaint Mrs. Nix says she
and her mother were . brought to this
country by Lloyd after an absence of
twenty years. He lived with them In
Oakland, but asked them not to divulge
their relationship, and. it is stated,
promised Mrs. Nix to leave her a
child's portion of his estate.
The property left by him is valued
at $544,644 30 and she asks for a two
fifteenth share of it. Lloyd left the
plaintiff $5000 and the mother, Mary
Skan Lloyd. $2000.
In their answer the executors claim
to have no knowledge of the facts and
deny the allegations. Mrs. Mary
Crossiey Lloyd, the surviving wife, eIbo
denies that she knew or the-relation
ship existing between "Lloyd and the
women prior to her marriage to him or
that she received them as such in her
home, as alleged in the complaint.-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. May 20.
This evening the Knights and ladies
enjoyed a banquet in the open air, at
which there was an attendance of 600
people. Owing to the fact that many
of the delegates, were, obliged to take
the train home the event was held
early In the evening. Former State
Senators. crSmith presided as toast
master, and toasts were responded to
by . Past Grand "Chancellor, Sargent,
Grand Chancellor Burns a,nd- Past
Grand Chief Maud B. Sheehan for the
Rathbones. The first named spoke on
the subject ''Pythfanism "as It Is."
whilf- Grand Chancellor Burns spoke of
"Pythianism as If Should Be.'" , â¢
Mrs. Sheehan .devoted her speech to
the ladies auxiliary of the Knights, and
expressed the hope that at '-the next
session' of the: Supreme 'Â¦Â¦: Lodge their
body will be officially' recognized and
may become known as the Pythian

Imprisonment has j broken down
Fred C. Dana, the Berkeley butcher,
convicted of embexxlement. and he is
acting so queerly In the County Jail
that it Is believed he is insane. He
was to have appeared before Justice
of the Peace Edgar at Berkeley to-day
for sentence, but was so bad that he
could not be taken from his cell and
his case was postponed for a few days.
He awoke this morning with the
idea that his friends in the Eagles'
and Foresters' lodges, to which he be
longs, were after him for his wrong
doing and in order to conceal his iden
tity from them gave Jailer White his
Eagle badge, as he believed this would
betray him to his fancied enemies.
He is a married man and has a wife,
who Is ill at their home In Berkeley.
He was in the employ of William
PfafT, a South Berkeley butcher, and
stole 5200. A charge of misdemeanor
embezzlement was preferred . against
him and he pleaded guilty. Confine
ment seemingly has broken down his
reason.

tory ordinance.

should cease work for the day.
"With the Dunch of thirty or more

will keep the courts busy for a while,"
suggested .the attorney.

the City Prison they were released on
bonds. Attorney J. H. Creely was sta
tioned there during the day to see
that his clients were promptly released

washed stnd fresh, are still .snow-covered in
Jhe higher reaches. And the thundering falls,
in full volume and rrandeur, are pourinjr over
their precipitous cliffs as at no other time.
Those who have learned the secret make
th'lr.pllsrimaee Â«arty. They enter the valley
a: the awakening time and are themselves
awakened Later they come back with ehlnlnj
.rye* filled with that Inspiration which nature
alcne can give.

Shipping Intelligence:
The American-Hawaiian Steamship
Company's big freighter Arizonan, Cap
tain Lyons, which was due here from
New York several days ago, came into
port early yesterday morning. She
made the trip in 61 days 17 hours, and
brought more than 11,000 tons of gen
eral cargo. Her freight included 4000
tons of blacksmith coal.
Heavy northerly gales encountered
after leaving Coronel and again off the
California coast Impeded the Ari
zonan's progress, and the run from the
coaling port occupied ttvo days longer
than usual.
The Arizonan made a splendid run
from New York to Coronel, going from
port to port in 36 days 2 hours and
making no stor>s on the way. She did
not anchor even in the straits of Ma
gellan, which is unusual.
Captain Lyons saw nothing of the
overdue steamer Conemaugh. which is
now out 83 days from Coronel for New
York. The Conemaugh, however, for
part of the way Is supposed to have
taken a different course from that fol
lowed by the Arizonan. The Arizonan
came through the straits of Magellan.
The Conemaugh was to have gone
around Cape Horn. The Arizonan
sighted a sailing vessel In the South
ern Pacific. The freighter did not run
close enough to make out the wind
jammer's name, but the Arizonan's
officers think it was the ship Hawaiian
Isles.

special code is intrusted to the per

embarking on a mission, who retain
possession of it, and. destroy it if their

1900 brought the code permanently to

The Court Kangaroo.
The Marouis de Fontenoy, authority
upon things courteous and of courts,
has this to say on the "court step":
"With regard to the expression of
â¢court step,' which Queen Alexandra
is reported to have used in requesting
a lady to abandon it in order to hurry
her gait, it is not generally known that
there is such a thing as a 'court step,'
the acquisition of which forms part of
the education of most of the princesses
of the blood in Europe, especially in
England. It is a slow and stately step
and yet not decided, but naive, falter
ing and hesitating. It was at one of
the court balls. In the reign of King
James I that thla peculiar step* had Its
origin in England. That monarch was
so pleased with what he described as
Manchurian Chun-Chus.
Count Eugene Zichy, the famous
Huhkarian explorer, known particu
larjyj for hU researches in Asia in
<jueet of the original home of the
Magyars, gives a graphic and detailed
account of the Chun-chus from his
personal experiences in Manchuria.
. Since the outbreak of hostilities be
tween Russia and Japan frequent
met tion has been made in v the preas
of Hie Chun-chns and. their exploits.
Most of the descriptions : given are
purely imaginary. The Chun-chus,
*-hoÂ»e name in Chinese signifies brig
ands, are an organized band of out
last, famed for their audacity. They
have long been the terror of Manchu
ria, and do not fear to attack the
Rueiian soldiers themselves. They %
; One of our worthy fellow citizens has been assessed
three hundred dollars in a duly constituted tribunal of
justice as damages for punching a friend in the face.
.What an illustration of the inequalities of life this seems
when we" reflect that -the public of San Francisco has
cheerfully paid ten thousand dollars time and again to
see one plug-ugly perform the same service -to another!
A' despondent man, unduly stimulated. bj r large quanti
ties of whisky, attempted a few nights ago to shoot him
self to death. He made such a general nuisance of him
self on a south sicjc thoroughfare that 'he was arrested
and convicted of the offense of disturbing the peace. Yet
even the most sympathetic will not venture the comment
that this is a descent from the sublime to the ridiculous.

misdeed.
THE MILITIA LAWâ N. G. C. City.
By the United States militia law of 1903
the militia of the United States is com
posed of every able-bodied man who is
a citizen or has declared his intention
to become one, who is bver eighteen
and under forty-five years. These form
part of the militia, one class organized
and known as the national guard and
the unorganized known as the reserve
militia. The President is enpowered to
call out the militia in case the United
States is invaded, or in danger of in
vasion from anv foreign nation, or of
rebellion against the authority of the
government of the United States or if
the . President is unable, with the
force at his command, to execute the
laws of the Union In "any part thereof,
to call forth for a period not exceeding
nine months such number of the militia
of the State or States or Territories or
the District of Columbia as he may
deem necessary to repel such Invasion,
suppress rebellion, or enable him to
execute the laws. When the militia
Is so called out, the officers and men
are subject to the laws and regulations
that govern the United States army,
and during such service they are to
be allowed the same pay and allow
ances as are provided for the regular
army. The militia when so called out
may be sent where duty calls. The
act went Into effect January 21, 1903.

DISH UP THE SPURS â Subscriber.
City. "To dish up the spurs" was a
custom of ancient time to give the
guests a hint that it was time to put
spurs to their horses and go. In "Bor
der Minstrelsy" there is a reference
to this custom, as follows: "When the
last bullock was .killed and devoured
it was the lady's custom to place on
the table a dish, which, on being un
covered, was foand to contain a pair of
clean spurs â a "hint to the riders that
they must shift for the next meal."

Nevermore will the Friday Fortnight

Recently Dr. Ragan was invited to
the residence of School Director Walsh
and told to extend the invitation to
Dr. Rottanzi. In some way Dr. Ragan
got the impression that It was a din

laid their plans accordingly.
They proceeded to a well known

the inevitable tuxedo, together with
the necessary accessories. They par
took c-f a very light breakfast and
gracefully sidestepped their usual
lunch, for Mrs. Walsh is Justly famous
for her dinners. They weighed In at
Corbett's at 6 o'clock and found they
were withlng the limit and proceeded
to their destination, where they ex
pected to sit down to dinner promptly
at 8 o'clock. But, sad to relate, the
odor of no tempting viands greeted
them. There was a delay of about an
hour and then another guest. Attor
ney Costello, arrived. He was asked
if he cared for any liquid refreshment
and he replied that he did not indulge
after dinner. The two medicos there
upon looked at each other blankly and,
summoning the attornety to the hall,
Inquired what they were up against.
They were advised that, as he under
stood it, the invitation contemplated
simply a card party to Introduce them
to the intricacies of that noiseless
game denominated "pit." It was near

served and the guests all wondered at

Rottanzi displayed.

CROWN PRINCE FREDEIUCK WIL
LIAM AND HIS NEW BADGE OF"
MANHOOD.
Like the Great George.
Lawrence Washington, a great-great
grandnephew of George Washington,
father of his country, has just been as
signed by the library of Congress to
take charge of the special exhibit made
by the institution at St. Louis.
Mr. Washington is the closest male
relative now surviving of the first Pres
ident, a fact of which he is undoubt
edly proud, but he greatly dislikes th*
notoriety that his presence provokes
wherever he goes.
It transpires, too. that Mr. Washing
ton is almost a fac-simlle of his Illus
trious granduncle and has nearly his
identical build. His cheekbones are
high and the arch of his brow give3
him a keen, piercing look.
Such a wonderful likeness to the first
President does not exist elsewhere in
the flesh. The story Is told of a certain
novelist who used to go to the library
regularly and sit quietly in the corner
watching his features. The sharp
glance of his eye and the dignity ex
pressed in his aquiline features are so
distinctly Washingtonian that every
body who sees him is struck by the fig
ure.
Such is the man whom the library of
Congress has appointed to take charse
of a special department at St. Louis,
in which collections of Washington
books and autographs are made, and
he will probably remain there during
the greater part of the fair.
What an honor to have the shadow of
such greatness resting upon one. But,
like all honors in this curious world,
it is not without its grievous annoy
ances to one who is not in the show
business.

THERE are few writers who undertake to make labor
troubles the th*eme of discussion who can treat of
both sides of the case 'fairly, 'impartially and crit- !
ically ,and at the same time offer a solution of the con
tending difficulties that will be satisfactory to everybody
concerned, chiefly because such, masterly ability requires
a wide knowledge not only of the immediate causes of
dispute between the parties at issue, but a wider knowl
edge of the many outside influences that are invariably
more far reaching and important.
As will be shown in the Sunday Call to-morrow, this
is. particularly true of transportation lines in general
which cannot be affected without crippling many other
and diversified industries, therefore one who would treat
of a railroad strike must know something more than the
mere science of moving trains and keeping them moving.
He must understand men, not merely human nature in
the aggregate, but the individual man, for in modern
railroading it is the individuality of the man that counts
for far more than the highest general training. It is a
peculiar fact that an old engineer is rarely seen on a fast
passenger run; even a young man can stand only a few
years of that kind of work. High speed on a locomotive
is a. question of nerve and endurance â to put it bluntly,
a question of flesh and blood, and such men are in conse
quence high strung and headstrong. In railroad life
there is always friction in some quarter; the railroad man
sleeps like the soldier, with an ear alert, for with waking
comes duty. Therefore the man who understands this
subject thoroughly has a firm grasp upon one of the
greatest problems in American national life.
Such an one is acknowledged to be Frank H. Spear
man, who is not only an authority upon the growth and
development of railroading in even the remotest quar
ters of America, but who has a keener insight into the
history and character of the men who h ve wrought the
wonderful labyrinth of rails across the continent than any
man in the world. Among many. other things he has, writ
ten "The Nerve of Foley" for the Sunday Call/fo-mor
row. And in "The Nerve of Foley" he haS/dealt in a
masterly, not to say thrilling, manner with the begin
ning, the development and the solution of the great rail
road strike. It is a story that is as instructive as it is
highly entertaining.
Moreover, it is this passion for authoritative utterance
that is leaving its mark upon the literature of the day.
Even in writing fiction it is not enough to be merely
imaginative and entertaining. The writer must have
more than a network of truth, therefore it is the novel
that gives a vivid picture of* any particular country or
locality, as well as of the character and aims of the peo
ple that is in most, demand. It is for that reason that
"By a Hair's Breadth," by Headon Hill, has attracted so
much attention since its publication was begun two weeks
ago in the Sunday Call. To-morrow the third installment
will be printed. "By a Hair's Breadth," which is far less
sensational than its name might imply, deals with the
Czar of Russia, the present Czar, and how remarkably
he* is safeguarded by the dreaded "Third Section" from
the maze of plot and counterplot in which he moves and
has his being.
Likewise the Philippine stories of Albert Sonnichsen
have become one of the most popular features of the
Sunday Call, because he knows thoroughly whereof he
writes, having experienced most of it at first hand. His
story of "Cub, the Story of a Cat," which will- be pub
lished to-morrow, is one ofthe strangest and most char
acteristic that has ever come from his pen.

From the Tarpelan Rock.
M. F. Tarpey, the Democratic politi
cian who made the Hearst fight at
Santa Cruz, has a strong personal fol
lowing in Alameda, his home town.
Some years ago at one of the various
campaign gatherings across the bay
Frank â¢ J. Sullivan, the attorney and
"spellbinder," was the orator of the
evening.
Tarpey was chairman of the assem
blage, and the announcement that he
would preside had brought forth many
of his friends. In the course of a ring-
Ing campaign speech that had stirred
the/audience to a splendid pitch of en
thusiasm Orator Sullivan declared:
"Yes, my friends, Democracy will tri
umph, and when it does we shall hurl
the enemies of the republic from the
Tarpelan rock, as did the ancients."
The orator stopped to catch his
breath, .when a stentorian voice 'from
the rear broke forth:
"Put him out! Put him out! He
can't abuse Mike Tarpey in thls
house." ' *
The intrusion surprised the speaker
as much as Tarpey himself, and it was
not until after the meeting had been
adjourned that the objector's reasons
have spies everywhere, at Mukden,
Klrin, Harbin, Port Arthur and Dal
ny, to Inform them whenever an op
portunity for a ffood stroke presents
Itself.
The origin of the Chun-chus only
dates back to the middle of the nine
teenth century. At that time the Pe
king Government began to turn its
attention toward the rich gold fields
of Northern Manchuria. This icy re
gion was still almost unknown even
to the Celestials themselves when
Manchuria traders brought nuggets
worth as much as $2000 apiece to
China. This aroused the Government,
whereupon travelers were questioned
and compelled to indicate the spot
where the gold was to be found in
such quantities'. The Chinese became
acquainted in this manner with the
existence of three gold regions in
Manchuria, one in the Sungari basin,
near the Russian frontier; the second
on the heights of Tchenbo-chan, and
the third on the shores of the Che
tonga, a tributary of the Anyir.
The Chinese Government deter
mined to monopolize the output from
these gold fields and threatened the
natives with the severest punishments
if they continued to gather gold for
their own use. Chinese miners were
then recruited in great numbers by
the Peking Government and forcibly
sent to Manchuria. The wording of
the mines* was very soon organized in
a remarkable manner by the manda
rine to whom the Government had in
trusted this duty. S
They set up. in the midst of the
gold fields, provision houses and
shops, spacious barracks, of which the
ruins still remain, made new roads
over the mountains and across for
ests to facilitate the conveying of pro
visions, but were unable, notwith
standing their efforts, to insure a reg
ular service for the transport of vict
uals. The laborers were decimated by
famines and by the arctic cold of this
region, where the temperature often
falls to 40 degrees below zero Centi
grade. Poorly paid and ill fed, many
of the wretches committed suicide.
Others fled to the neighboring forests
regardless of the fate â capital pun
ishment â meted out to the deserters if
they were caught or if hunger drove
them back to the camp. These de
serters were the first Chun-chus.
The existence led by the refugees in
the mountains was singularly hard.
Without food, clothing or shelter, they
were obliged to protect themselves
from the wild beasts abounding in
that region. Many of them became
the prey of wolves, bears, panthers
and especially of tigers. Nevertheless,
the number of Chun-chus increased
rapidly. The miners deserted the gold
fields by the hundreds, the mandarins
in charge being unable to track them
into the forests. To replace the fugi
tives the Chinese Government was
obliged to gather together beggars and
vagabonds and dispatch them to the
mines. But these outcasts soon re
joined the first Chun-chus in the
mountains and thus the ranks of the
brigand hordes, were increased by sev
eral thousand.
The Chun-chus eoon formed them
selves into' a well organized associa
tion. They had among their number
men belonging to . the highest classes
of Chinese society. . For years previous
the Chinese Government had deported
to Tsitsihar. in Northern Manchuria,
the mandarins who had Veen dis
graced for political 'reasons and those
affiliated with secret societies which
the court considered as dangerous to
the state. Many of these mandarins
had fled from Tsitsihar and taken ref
uge with the Chun-chus, who, aware
of the mandarins' intellectual super
iority, placed them at their head and
made them draw up the rules of the
association necessary to every China
man's existence.
Gradually this federation of outlaws
become more and more powerful as new
recruits joined the ranks. In time the
boldness of the Chun-chus increased;
they established posts on every high
way in Manchuria, from which they
waylaid caravans and pillaged govern
ment convoys. They robbed the inhab
itants of the small villages and levied
taxes on the most important towns of
the province. They ruled over the
country by the terror they Inspired in
the inhabitants. The merchant vessels
which ply on the Sungari were not
even safe from their attacks. These
boats, many of large dimensions, were
stopped daily and ransacked.
The daring of the Chun-chus was
such that they openly showed them
selves in the streets of Mukden. The
entire population knew. them, but no
one dared denounce them to the police,
so great was the terror they inspired.
Their increasing audacity finally re
sulted in their discomfiture. They kid
naped Chinese .generals who refused to
come to terms with them. The Peking
Government then resolved to make a
great effort to rid Manchuria, of the
Chun-chu hordes. An army was sent
to exterminate the brigands, but most
of them managed to escape by dividing
themselves into small groups and seek
ing refuge in the Inaccessible Tchanbo
chan Mountains.
Military posts were then established
by. the' Government throughout the
province. These posts have for the time
being prevented the Chun-chus from
renewing their more daring exploits.
"They have now retired to" the moun
tains of Northern . Manchuria, but
Count Zlchy states that further Rus
sian defeats will undoubtedly result In
a revival of brigandage by the Chun
chus throughout Manchuria.

made In 1900 on the left bank of the
Amur was. It will be remembered, the
pretext used by the Russians for the
occupation of Manchuria. â New York

THE first of the great congresses to be held during
the St. Louis Exposition was the World's Press
Parliament. In its membership were delegates
from* every country in which newspapers are printed-
Some of them came from nations where the press is
restricted within limits so narrow that a paper is little
more than a handbill,, advertising such matters as are
agreeable to the official censor and forbidden to express
opinions, except such as arc indorsed by the governing
authority. So, on through all stages of control and limi
tation, the press of the world met in the land where it
is the freest.
It is one of the wise sayings of the author of the Dec
laration of Independence that error is not dangerous,
provided truth is left free to combat it. In that was the
foundation of the liberty of the American press. This^
liberty is often abused. It frequently degenerates into^
license. The power of the press for publicity is used by
some to inflict individual oppression. But, in the final
result, a free press has in it healing for whatever wounds
its licentious use. may cause. ~ ...
The address of Secretary of State Hay., in opening the
parliament was a vindication of the policy. and purpose
of our Government, the source of free speech and a free
press. Mr. Hay is himself a practical journalist, and the
inner workings of the press are no mystery to him, for
he has held a desk oh a metropolitan journal and did his
daily share of the labor of putting the world's news, and
thoughts, 2nd vices and virtues in form for digestion by
the people who read. His plea for mutual forbearance,
cleanness and cheerful good humor in the press was
addressed to many who had sinned against the principles
he laid down. But it gained, strength and influence, by
his confession that. he, in his active career as a jour
nalist, had, like them, sometimes yielded to temptation
and had used the weapons of offense and defense some
times more in satisfaction of his temper than in vindica-
tion of hi5 good taste.
So it has been with us all. The . newspaper as we
know it in this country has undergone great transforma
tion from its original method and motive. Formerly
men who had a message and a motive sought to pro
mulgate both by founding a newspaper. That was
Franklin's purpose. He believed that certain principles
in domestic economy, certain rules of living and cer
tain views of government should be put before the
people. This was his mission and he fulfilled it by
founding a newspaper- It is said, and w.e believe truly,
that his maxims of thrift and industry impressed the
first half century of our national existence with, that
spirit of thrift which made us a nation of independent
and homekeeping people.
The great anti-slavery movement had its impulse and
continuance in newspapers founded by whole-hearted
abolitionists like I.ovejoy, Garrison and Greeley. They
had a message to deliver to an unbelieving and unwilling
people. Lovejoy went to martyrdom; Garrison under
went persecution, and Greeley survived the catastrophe
of slavery to witness the mighty effect upon the people
of journalism devoted to the teaching of an idea.
The Press Parliament at St. Louis was preceded by
the annual meeting of the National Editorial Associa
tion. Its chief interest was an address by Henry Wat
terson on "The EdifpriaLTage." - He contended that 'an
editorial leader should be an analysis of and comment
upon the leading feature of the day's news- This is in
the main correct, though the necessities of political jour
nalism, now as in the days of Lovejoy, Garrison and
Greeley, often require that the leader of the day shall
be an argument and statement to enforce the political
or economic idea for which the journal stands. This
may require an attack upon some personality selected
to represent the opposite of that idea, or the presenta
tion at its best of a personality identified with it. There
fore, such a loader is of necessity somewhat personal in
its scope. When this is the case Mr. Wattcrson's pre
scription should never be lost sight of, as he put it:
"Write of a man nothing you would not say to his face,
and might not say in the hearing of decent people."
We disagree with him about the editorial paragraph.
He said, "The pert paragraph should die a natural death.
No flowers." Now a paragraph is in the nature of an
epigram, and while we may differ on the adjective "pert,"
the soul of an epigram is in its pertness.
Shakespeare says': "Awake the pert and nimble spirit
of mirth." In that sense the pert paragraph has its
place in journalism and on the editorial page. Its ap
pearance in American journalism was in the paper now
edited by Mr. Watterson. then the Louisville Journal.
George D. Prentice, his predecessor in that editorial
chair, was a master paragrapher. His epigrammatic style,
beyond question pert, made the Journal the most noted
and quoted paper in thecountry.. Before his time the edi
torial leader was a long and ponderous essay. 'It was
dominated by the Addisonian style and had its inspira
tion in The Tattler and The Rambler. Whatever in the
modern leader is crisp, incisive and concise, it owes to
the reform wrought by, George D. Prentice.
Mr. Watterson has great and deserved fame as an edi
torial writer. But we venture to say that inspection of
his best leaders will show them capable of dissection into
the pert paragraphs which he decries. His process is
synthetical, and his leaders are merely a collection of
paragraphs putting in the form of epigram, the illustra
tions of his subject. Everybody remembers his often
quoted leader against Mr. Cleveland, opposing his re
nomination in 1892. But it is remembered for this very
quality. When he said that "Mr. Cleveland will lead Tiis
party through a slaughter-house into a graveyard," what
was it but a pert paragraph? - "Â¦ - ' Â«
left to competent committees appointed by the conven
tion:. . -,"Â¦ ' _ . .v
' Many ' prominent men' will be present- ' Among the

LEADING MAN OF NEIL.IÂ»-MOROS
CO COMPANY, WHICH OPENS AT
THE CALIFORNIA.
â¢ By the verdict of a jury of intelligent
business men in the United States Dis
trict Court yesterday George W. Rum
ble was branded as a fake raining op
erator, a dealer in gold-brickery and a
suave confidence man. The jurors did
not remain out more than an hour. The
indictment charged Rumble with hav
ing- made use of the United States post
offlce in furtherance of a scheme to de
fraud.
Next "Wednesday at 11 a. m. was
fixed as the time for passing sentence.
The extreme penalty is a fine of $500
and Imprisonment in the penitentiary
for eighteen months.-
W. H. H. Hart and Aylett R. Cotton,
attorneys for Rumble, Intend to take
the case before the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals, and will. make
their preliminary motions on Wednes
day.
After the announcement of the ver
dict Assistant United States Attorney
Ben L. McKlnley Informed the court
that the surety company which had
furnished the $3000 bonds for Rumble's
ball had become bankrupt, and he
moved that a new bond in the sum of
$10,000 should be required to Insure the
prisoner's appearance for sentence on
next Wednesday. Rumble was taken in
custody by United States Marshal John
H. Shine and shortly thereafter was
released on filing a bail bond for $10,000.
with the Aetna Indemnity Company of
Hartford as surety.
The evidence on behalf of the Govern
ment had been collected and prepared
by Postofflce Inspector James O'Con
nell. Mr. O'Connell performed his task
so thoroughly and with so much nice
discretion that not a loophole was left
for the defendant to squeeze out of.
The sleuth found that within the last
three years Rumble's net deposits in
bank in his own name and in the name
of his wife amounted to $265,068, real- ;
ized from the sale of stock in the Sun
set Mining Company and from the sale
of bullion produced by the Old Glory '
mine. All the bullion disposed of by
Rumble in the United States Mint and
at Selby's Smelting and Lead Works
amounted to $24,741. according to the
statements obtained by Inspector
O'Connell from the < officials of those In
stitutions.
Yesterday was Rumble's sixtieth
birthday. He was not at all thankful
for the gift handed him bythe jury. !

General Salomon concluded at 4:15
and then Judge Cook announced an
adjournment until Monday morning at
10 o'clock. District Attorney Bylng
ton said that he would probably re
quire several hours to close for the
prosecution and Judge Cook said that
his charge to the Jury might occupy
some time. Therefore, instead of a
night session, he determined to carry
the case over until Monday. His part
ing instruction to the Jury was more
lengthy than usual and included an
admonition against forming any opin
ion until they had heard p.11 counsel
and the Instructions of the court-
During the afternoon session a letter
was delivered to Detective Tom Gib
son, mailed at Winnemucca, Nev., and
signed by Theresa King, one of the
witnesses against Soeder. The letter
apologized for her non-appearance at
the present trial and stated that she
was afraid to return to San Francisco
because of "one man," whose name she
did not give.
"Because I believe he is a' persecuted
man," she said. Leaving the Hall of
Justice she went in the direction of
the, Barbary Coast.
Alexander Campbell Jr. opened the
argument for the defense and consum
ed the entire forenoon and half an
hour in the afternoon. Principally his
address was devoted to Catherine Flat
ley, whom he denounced as a "pro
fessional leg-puller," and whose testi
mony was given because Soeder had
severed his relations with her.
General Salomon followed in an ex
haustive resume of the testimony given
during the trial. At the conclusion of
his address to the jury he delivered a
particularly scathing denunciation of
John Cooper, the forger now in the
County Jail, who testified that Soeder
had confessed to him minutely how he
had murdered Blaise. Incidentally he
went into the methods of the police
in building up a case against his client.
Soeder listened to the arguments of
his counsel with evident satisfaction.
CASE IS CONTINUED.
When she left the court room on
adjournment she was asked her name
and she snapped back, "It's none of
your business."
"Why did you want to kiss Soeder,"
she was asked. 1
This woman was gowned in blue and
rather passe in appearance.. Her hat,
as well as her face, told this.. When
she first entered the court room she
surged up to the railing that acts as a
bar to those that are not officers of the
court. A Deputy Sheriff halted her and
asked what she wanted. ' She made
some indistinct answer and Bailiff
Martin Welch arose from his seat and
questioned her.
"I want to get in here so that I can
kiss Soeder," she said. The bailiff
blushlngly assured her that the prop
osition was entirely out of order and
referred her to Policeman Jack Ed
wards, who was guarding the door of
the court room.' She managed to get
a point of vantage in the west aisle of
the court room and made faces at the
Jury. During General Salomon's argu
ment she made voluble explanations
to the men standing about her and at
tracted the attention of everybody.
KEPT NAME SECRET.
The inevitable woman made her ap
pearance yesterday during the trial of
Leon Soeder, who is charged with .slit
ting the throat of Joseph Blaise, his
brother-in-law, on the night of Janu

on Russian hill.

After getting John McCaffrey ar

that he did not desire to prosecute.
Indeed, he seemed anxious to have the
case dismissed without any hearing at

les in his possession when arrested in
'â¢cqnnection with an assault case sev
eral days ago. The prosecution was
airacted by the attorney for the Citi
.zens' Alliance and it was at his request
<hat Judge Cabaniss taxed the defend
ant so lightly.

Al Kelly, a has-been in the baseball
â¢ *orld. m-as arraigned before Judge Ca
. baniss and charged with cutting the
face of Miss Gertie Neil of 211 Min
na street with a razor. He pleaded
not guilty and exhibited a gashed
lip to substantiate his story that Miss
Neal and another young woman were
battling with razors in a house on
Minna street when he interfered and
was wounded. The case frill be heard
; ne*xt Wednesday.
About two months ago Kelly was
defendant In the same court on a
charge of stealing towels from a
hoarding-house. He then stated that
-he was under engagement for this
season with the Leavenworth baseball
I team and with the complainant's con
sent the case was dismissed to enable
. the defendant to carry out his con-
â¢ . Police Officer OoSTs' inability to
prove that it was real whisky he
â¢ bouglit, paid for and drank. in a. Mnx
fcet^etreet home of gratuitous vaude
. viilo compelled Judge Mogan to take
; undor advisement the charge of Eell
. Ing .liquor without a license that
. stands agafnrt- George Kennedy, an at
tache of the establishment.
It was a simple Ftory the
ar.t told. In civilian attire he visited
the theater nnd assumed for the nonce
. the role of Ueuben in Quest of metro
politan delights. He was cordially
Â¦tvelcmv.etl by three ladies and their
introductory salutation was quickly
puppleraented with .-i request that he
buy something. Theirs was beer, but
â¢ as that beverage was hardly strong
enough to nrnkÂ»* his contemplated case
. adhere, he ordered whisky. The four
. firings were brought by Kennedy and
GofT paid SI for them. As soon as
the money was accepted the case was
â¢ Tirtualry completed and errest of the
X(M-ipient immediately followed, to the
"great surprise and indignation of the
Indies, who freely ventilated their
cyinion of "fly cops" and "sneak
. 'bulls."
In court yesterday it looked like
conviction until a special attorney for
â¢the defense took the complaining wit
ness in hand md asked him whether
jiÂ«? was positive it was whisky he
.bought from the defendant. Was he
sure it wasn't mellowed aquafortis, or
diluted vitriol, or deodorzed asa
. ietida. or liquid radium? Was he
ready to make oath â and, please, let
. bim not forget he was on oath â that
fhe beverage supplied him by the de
. fendant was not a decoction distilled
from something el?e than malt? As a
conscientious officer could he swear
*lv? was not served with extract of
boiled bootlegs instead of whisky?
â¢Would he be so good â and. pray, let
â¢ him be careful â as to describe for the
information of the court what the stuff
bought, paid for and drank tasted
."like? Did it appeal to his palate like
"â¢ any whisky he had ever before im
. bib^d?
No, the complainant could not swear
'" it was whisky, or that it had the flavor
-of whisky, but he was certain he or
dered tvhisky and was furnished with
a liquid that did duty as whisky in
that temple* of amusement. Yes. he
considered himself a pretty good judge
â¢ of whisky, although he disclaimed dis
tinction as an expert- Suppose his in
'. terrogator had ordered as he ordered
â¢â¢ and had been served as he was served,
â¢what would he think he had been
served with ?
"Not with whisky in that particular
place!" shouted the pleader.
Then the Judge opined that if the
liquor in question were subjected to
chemical analysis the character of its
constituent qualities might be re
vealed, and the defense approved the
suggestion with an eagerness that con
voyed misgiving to the prosecution. A
" decision is expected within a week.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Judge Fritz fairly gasped when a
Verdict of not guilty was returned by
ihe jury that heard the evidence
. against Edward Veatch, accused of
insulting ; 14 -year-old gld at the
pcean bsneh. His Honor glared dep
â¢recatingl.v at the "twelve good men \
â¢ and true" as they filed out of court.
â¢ I The testimony for the prosecution
certainly v.-as strong enough to war
â¢ rant a. conviction. Among the wU
. nesses was a- soldier, who saw the de
fendant': treatment of the child and
in/ormed an officer of it and the of
ficer swore that after he arrested
Veatch the latter broke away from
.him and ran quite a distance before
"he was recaptured.
â¢ â¢ Veatch ia employed in a can fac
tory and also serves as supernumerary
a: one of the theaters.
Â¦ Mary Hurley, the cook lady, whose
resistance to dismissal transformed the
tranquil "Vegetarian Home," 2526
Ocean boulevard, into a veritable
rough house, reappeared before his
Honor Mogan and volunteered a whole
lot of information anent that estab
lishment.
"Mrs. Drexler hired me," she said,
"and may be she won't be mad when
she hears I have been fired. She is in
Europe, and before she started she
bought the home and gate it to Mrs.
Russell. Is Mrs. Drexler rich? Well,
I wish I had â why, if she ain't worth
$8,000,000 she ain't worth a cent.
Where did she get it? Made It out of
her vegetarian homes, of course.
Why, there are eight women Inmates
out there now, and of them
brought in big money. I wasn't al
lowed to go near them, but I know
what I'm talking about."
The co\irt has not yet decided what
to do with Mrs. Hurley.
Victor Bjors, house carpenter, was
accused of having erected a shanty
over the left eye of George E. Davis,
a fellow workman, while the twain
were engaged in the construction of a
lofty dwelling at Sutter and Buchanan
streets. After hearing the story of
the assault and what provoked it.
Judge Cabanlss dismissed the defend
ant and advised him to exclude facial
alteration from his handicraft.
Alexander Wheatley is held in $3000
bonds to answer in the Superior Court
to the charge'of having held up a Chi
nese opium den and robbed its four in
mates. The preliminary hearing was
before Judge Mogan.
â¢ * *
"This face of mine shows that I was
handed something before any cutting
was done," Mr. Powers continued,
"and I hope you'll make a note of it."
"It is mentally photographed," his
Honor responded, "and when you
come up for trial next Wednesday it
will be indelibly stamped on my mind's
eye."
"I want you to see this face of mine
before the bruises leave it," said Ed
ward Powers, charged with having
stabbed Harry Brawn's arm during a
flght with that person.
Judge Mogan glanced at the counte
nance of Mr. Powers and remarked
that it certainly appeared to have
been roughly treated. Two black eyes
and a mutilated lip were the most
conspicuous signs of recent conflict.
There was nothing in Mrs. Speak
man's appearance to indicate tribula
tion over the serious charge against
her. She was neatly gowned and
hatted, and her countenance reflected
perfect placidity of mind. When the
Judge asked her for the name of the
woman with whom she had fought she
calmly said, "I do not know."
Mrs. Anna Speakman showed a ban
daged finger when she appeared in
Judge Morgan's court to answer the
charge of assaulting with intent to
murder Mrs. Clara Lefevre, with whom
she engaged in a knife and scissors
duel at the residence of Adolph Beth,
799 Cole street," The arrest was made
on complaint of Beth, who is the de
fendant's father, and for whom Mrs.
Lefevre was employed as housekeeper.
Mrs. Lefevre did not appear in court
and her absence was explained by a
certificate from Dr. Amlel to the effect
that the injuries inflicted upon her by
Mrs. Speakman were so serious as to
necessitate confinement to her home
for a few days. She has two deep
scalp wounds and some minor cuts on
her face. The arraignment was con
tinued till next Wednesday, the de
fendant's ball of 5100 being allowed to
stand.
Emily Mahoney sent word from the
Receiving Hospital to Judge Cabanlss
that she hoi>es to be mentally fit to
visit his court next Monday and plead
to a charge of vagrancy. On her first
appearance before him. last Tuesday,
the suddenly began to see specimens
of the zoo-logical kingdom that had no
existence in reality, and her frenzied
appeals for- protection from them ne
cessitated her removal to the hospital.
It was reported yesterday that her
menagerie has been reduced to one
scarlet monkey and a pink poll parrot.
Three witnesses swore that it was
Joseph Egan. alias "The Kid." a strik
ing stableman, wh'o dragged Joel W.
Fuller from a wagon he was driving
and then beat his head with a pitch
fork handle and bent back one of his
fingers until the tendon burst. Mr.
Fuller identified Egan as his assail
ant. The defense will be heard next
Monday by Judge Megan.
In one of Robert Scnaars pockets
was found an iron "knuckle-duster"
after he had been arrested for drunk
enness and Judge Cabanlss will hear
both charges against him to-day.
"Better find out who she i3," the
Judge suggested, "so we'll know who
we have to deal with when you next
bring her in." .
The defendant paid a $5 fine from
a wallet fairly bursting with cash.
Sarah Black, middle-aged and fajh
ionably attired, was described as a sort
of feminine Jekyll and Hyde by the
policeman who arrested her for drunk
enness last Thursday night in the red
light district.
"She lives in swell style out in the
Western Addition," said the ' officer,
"and about jonce a week she comes in
and does the tenderloin. Sarah Black
ain't her name, and I don't know
what it Is."
alL But instead of being grateful for
the magnanimity thus shown Mr.
McCaffrey laughed derisively and
blurted out. In court:
"Of course he doesn't want to tell
â¢what I punched him for."
"Maybe you want to tell?" ventured
the Judge.
"Sure. He went to my house while
I was absent and tried to make love
to my wife."
Subsequent inquiry developed the
Information that the fair object of Mr.
Morris' alleged surreptitious wooing
had never been formally wed to Mr.
McCaffrey. "We haven't been
churched." that gentleman explained,
"but 1 think just as much of her as
if she were my sure enough wife."
Case dismissed.

Champion stake. The . up-country
coursers have -t>een pitted against the
best available greyhounds in this dis
trict during the past eight weeks and
have caught the eyes of Judge P. J.

Although from the same kennel, the
greyhounds will run on their merits
to-day for the honors of the field,
their owner sinking all sentiment for
the moment.
Walter Burllngame and John J.
Deane fished the Truckee some days
since. They found the water Unusually
high and took but few fish. There will
be no fly fishing there for some time
to come, according to all reports.
J. L. Bass, writing of conditions on
the McCloud, says the water is two
feet higher than Is usual at this time.
Fly fishing is out of the question.
The first of the pilgrims for Biff
Meadows will leave to-morrow for that
grand trout stream. In the party will
be R. Haas, J. Pincus, Sam Wells and
Will Burlingame.
The striped bass fishermen had
marked nuccess last Sunday near San
Pablo. Frank Lacoste took eighteen
weighing 120 pounds. J. . S. Swan
caught a number, one of them scaling
fourteen pounds. J. B. Kennlff, W.
Barnes and A. J. Molle,r also caught
a fair share of fish.
Frank Dolliver and Al Banker landed
a number of bass at Rodeo, the largest
weighing seventeen pounds.
Jules Well fought thirty-five minutes
some days since with what he supposed
waa a striped bass. When his boatman
finally went to gaff the supposed fish
he found It was the top of a tree which
was floating down on a strong tide.
E. A. Mocker went to Soquel on
Wednesday for. an extended stay.
Doc Watt and Sam Wells found a
fresh run of fish on the Paper Mill be
tween Camp Taylor and Tocaloma last
Sunday and caught a good basket of
trout. They averaged from seven to
ten inches.
O. S. Berg is going to Covelo.'Mendo
clno County, for the fishing.
J. ' B. Halstead and W. Halstead
went to Boulder Creek on Wednesday
for a few days* .fishing.
The members of the San Francisco
Flycasting Club will commence the sec
ond half of their season's "contests at
Stow Lake, Golden Gate Park, this aft
ernoon. Next Tuesday night the regu"
lar meeting and banquet will be held
at the California Hotel.
The pater.on flies, which Include two vari
eties â the light and dark winded cadis â will
probably be out within the n?xt week. When
they appear It Is no trick- to kill 100 pounds
of trout a. day. The bugs which produce these
flies are fully matured, and I look for them to
develop into flies any day.
The fishing here Is first class and will con
tinue 50 until the last of September. The river
has been higher than at any time during: the
past forty year*. All the dams have been
washed out, thus affording the trout a Rood
opportunity to run up. All the nearby stream*
are full of fl>h. and thÂ» prospc-cts look Rood
for a great season. In four hours yesterday I
landM twenty n>h weighing thirty-eight
pounds. The largest wa* a four-pounder. All
my fishing has been done. within 200 yards of
the hotel.
Trout fishing conditions continue to
improve slowly but surely with the
coming of warm weather and with the
development of Insect life along the
streams. The favorite trout streams
near Santa Cruz, the Soquel, the San
Lorenzo, Boulder Creek and others are
all reported good at the present time.
The Carmel River, near Monterey, Is
also yielding good returns.
Al Cummlngs, the most widely
known trout fisherman on the coast, is
having royal sport at Klamath. He
writes:
The A'ameda eleven will be chosen
on the ground from the following: G.
H. Ward (captain), F. A. Stahl. F. J.
Croll. W. H. McNaughton, G. I. Baugh.
C. C. Y. Williamson, S. M. Foster, F. J.
Bennlon, W. G. Fortman, George Car
roll, W. McCulloch, W. E. R. Rooker
and J. U. Buchanan.
Harold B. Richardson, captain of the
San Francisco County Club, scored the
first century of the season last Sunday,
by an excellent display of batting and
defense. On a frround covered Â¦ with
good, smooth, level' turf his effort
would have netted him 140 to 150 runs.
While on his recent visit to Great Brit
ain Mr. Richardson piayed golf two or
three times and on one occasion drove
a ball the remarkable distance of 309
yards from the tee.
In lieu of the match between England
and all comers set down on the sched
ule of the California Cricket Associa
tion for to-morrow on the Alameda
ground, the Pacific eleven will meet the
Alameda team for the first time this
season. This is the match with which
the season was to have been opened
on the 1st inst., but it was postponed
on account of the death ef a well
known member of the Pacific Club.
The scarlet and black of the Pacific
Club will be worn by John Myers (cap
tain), Dr. O. N. Taylor, H. D. Bowly, W.
Petherick, H. C. Casidy, A. W. Wild-
Ing, E. H. M. Lannowe, Kenneth Read,

who captured the wickets of Kortlang
and Sloman last Sunday in the match
against the San Francisco County
team. Kenneth Read is anew member,
who has Just Joined tne Pacific Club
and is expected to prove a useful addi
tion to the team, as he has played for
the county eleven of Wiltshire, Eng
land. He Is unusually tall and should
have a long reach as a batsman and
fielder.

The second team match, twelve men

Club arfH the College City Gun Club
will be held to-morrow on the lat
ter's grounds at Berkeley. The Em
pire men won the first shoot.
The inanimate targets have almost
entirely superseded the live pigeons on
this coast, there being but one club,
the California, which uses the latter
at its meeting. 1 ?.
An unusual number of gunmen are
finding; recreation at the bluerock
traps this season. It is estimated fully
a quarter of a million of these inani
mate targets will be "trapped" on this
coaat during the season.
The clubs which promote this pas
time in and about this city are the
Golden Gate, Union, Empire, Mill
wood, College City, Blue Rock Club,
Alameda^nd the Escalle Gun Club.
There are also thriving clubs- at Sac
ramento, San Jose, . Giant, Martinez,
Vallejo, Los Angeles, 'Hollister and
other interior points.
Representatives of the majority of
these clubs are practicing for the first
big open tournament of the Pacific
Coast Trapshooting Association to be
held at Ingleside on the 29th and 30th
lusts. The six-man team shoot will
bring some clever shots together. The
Golden Gate Club will probably be
represented by Clarence Nauman, Otto
Feudner. Pete McRaÂ« Ed Schultz, E.
Klevesahl and Clarence Haight. The
Union Club men will be. M. J. Iverson,
George Sylvester, Fred Feudner, D.
Daniels, E. Gamble and Harry Hoyt.
The Empires will have a strong team
headed by A. J. Webb and J. B. Haiier.
The conditions for. the various
events favor the shooter of average
ability and a large entry is expected
from this division. Zd" Schultz, who
holds the coast championship record
for. straight breaks, with 111 to his
credit, is shooting In good, form this
year. E. Klevesahl and Pete McRae
are both reliable, while W. S. Wattles
is doing well for a beginner on blue
rocks. Clarence Haight is shooting In
wonderful form again.

Percy Murdock has not ; as yet
entered, and consequently the real
struggle narrows down to these three
players. MacGavin intends to practice
every day next week. He attributes his
poor form to his examinations at col
lege, which have taken all of his time
during the month. If MacGavin gets
into his best form he- should have no
trouble retaining his laurels, as ho
holds both Baker and Allen safe when
at his best.
â¢ If Frank Mitchell Is In form it would
not be surprising to see him beat either
Allen or Baker. Another man . who
should not be overlooked Is Dr. ilc-
Chesney. Dr. Hill, his part^Â£. is play
ing an excellent game and may sur
prise some of them.
The following players have entered:
The San Francisco championship, thÂ«
most important event outside of thÂ«
San Rafael tournament, will be played
on the California Club courts on the
29th and 30th inst. Only about a week
is left for practice and the cracks are
putting In every spare moment before
the nets. MacGavin and Allen played
in miserable form last Sunday, and
unless they improve before the tourna
ment the cup will go to a paid player.
George Baker played better than ever
last week, and at their best MacGavin
and Allen will have no easy time beat
ing him.
At Golden Gate Park to-morrow the
third and fourth classes will be played.
The first and second were finished last
Sunday. In the third class Robert
Drolla holds the cup and unless he is
taken into camp by Harold Gabriel, he
should again win the class.
In the fourth .class there is a close
and Interesting race for the cup. By
winning the last competition, Guerin
placed himself on an even footing with
Melville Long, who has twice won the
trophy. Hall also has a win to his
credit.- y> .Â«V.v'

The High School boys of the bay
counties will finish their annual cham
pionship tennis tournament on the
Calif ornia Club courts to-day. At 9:30
o'clock this morning representatives of
the ten schools who competed In the
singles last Saturday will meet in the
doubles.
Most of the matches last week were
rather one-sided, as players like
Schmidt, Long and Hotchkiaa out
classed the others and. except when
opposed to each other, had no difficulty
in winning. The match between Long
and Schmidt was the most interesting
and exciting ever seen in an academic
tournament. The final match was ex
tremely close, but this was due entirely
to the fact that Schmidt was exhausted
when it commenced.
The matches will not be nearly so
distressing to-day in the singles, as
skill will count for more than endur
ance.' The teams are evenly matched
and the games should prove Interest
ing. Schmidt, the singles champion,
will play with Clarence Cunha, a clever
player from Honolulu. Long will play
with his brother, Melville, and Hotch
kiss will play with Naylor. These
teams are the strongest three. It is
expected one of them will win.
The drawing resulted as follows:
The removal of Blossom Rock buoy,
which was one of the marks, has made
it necessary to select a new course.
The Goat Island' Shoal buoy will be
used as a mark instead of the Blos
som Rock buoy. The run will thus be
lengthened and the reach to South
ampton Shoal â¢ mark shortened and
rendered closer to the wind. The 20
footers will beat out to Presidio Shoal
buoy and run home to Meiggs wharf.
The 25-footers and yawls, after round
ing Presidio Shoal buoy, will round
the Goat Island buoy and the South
ampton Shoal mark and go back to
Powell-street wharf to finish. The
three larger classes will round Pre
eidio Shoal buoy a second time after
rounding the leeward stakeboat.
. The California Yacht Club fleet will
cruise to Benicia during the Decora
tion day holidays. The fleet of the
South Bay Yacht Club will cruise to
Kan Francisco, starting at' 1 a, m. on
Sunday, the 28th inst â¢
The 28th and 29th lnet. are open
on the programme of the Corinthian
Yacht Club and will be spent in tun
ing up the boats that will take part
in the annual regatta on Decpration
day. The regatta will be in charge of
the committee consisting of T. J.
Kavanaugh, J. K. Bulger and Douglas
Ertkine. The yachts will be divided
into six clases: yawls, 20-footers, 25
footers. 30-footers, 36-footers and 44
footers. The committee will follow
the races on the steamer Sunol or
Resolute.
During the Decoration day holidays
the San Francisco fleet will cruise to
Benicia, anchoring to the east of the
Bteamer landing on Saturday evening,
the 28th lnst. Next day the yachts will
cruise through Montezuma Slough and
.thence to Vallejo, whence the return,
trip to Sausalito will be made on
Decoration day. On this cruise the
two cups not awarded in the race on
May 8 will be contended for.
The Corti.thi?n ?>et sails up to Val
lejo and Mare lsi- <i *o-night, return-
Ing to-morrow. The '"..Ufornia Tacht
Club has a handicap tax e set down on
its schedule for to-morrov..
Next Saturday the sloop yacht Nellie,
owned by Dr. T. L. Hill and H. H.
Jenness, vice commodore of the" San
Francisco Yacht Club, will start from
Sausalito on a trip to the Santa
Barbara Channel. In addition to her
owners ex-Commodore R. S. Bridg
man, Arthur Inkersley and Julius E.
Back will be aboard. ' Back is owner
of the sloop Catherine, formerly of the
San Francisco Yacht Club but now of
the California fleet. The party will
cruise to San Pedro and may go as
far as San Diego. Catallna Island
will also be viFited.
This evening the fleet of the San
Francisco Yacht Clob -will make the
first cruise of the present season to
Paradise Cove. It is high water at
E:22 p. m. at Fort Point and low water
At 11 p. m., sp that boats which make
a. late start may have some difficulty
In reaching their destination if the
wind falls light.
Those yachtsmen who reach the
cove will hold a frankfurter pow
wow, with bonfire accompaniment" on
the beach to-night. Launches will
leave the clubhouse at Sausalito at
10 a. m. on Sunday to convey the late
comers to the cove and will return
to the clubhouse after the clam bake
for the accommodation of those who
do not sail on any of the yachts. Mem
bers who do not own yachts are re
quested particularly to attend this
event. Good care will be taken of
them.
To-morrow a regatta open to
power-boats of all classes will be held
in the cove, the start being at 11
o'clock in the morning so as to secure
as smooth water as possible. In
;.ieasuring the power-boats the rules
adopted by the American Power-Boat
Association will be followed. The
chief factors for determining the
classification of the power-boats are
the load water line, the horsepower
â¢and the midship section. The load
water line is measured when the boat
is floating, in racing trim, in smooth
water, with two persons aboard amid
ships. The horsepower of gasoline ex
plosive engines is determined by the
number and stroke of the cylinders
and the number of revolutions made
per minute. The owner's certificate,
nubject to verification by the measurer,
gives the number of revolutions per
minute.

That the majority of the Park Com
missioners are heartily in favor of the
plan to build a great public athletic
amphitheater in Golden Gate Park is
evidenced by the private subscriptions
to the cause as shown In Treasurer
Frank . O'Kane's first official list of
paid-up contributions to the fund. Not
only have the guardians of the 'public
pleasure ground appropriated $25,000
of the" park budget for the purpose,
but they have gone deep into their own
pockets and helped to swell the total,
which reaches nearly $10,000 in cash,
exclusive of almost $3000 more in
pledges as yet uncollected.

Jack Munroe, challenger for the
heavyweight boxing championship of
the world, arrived here yesterday direct
from Hot Springs. This sets at rest
all the wild rumors to the effect that
he would never appear here and that
'he merely signed articles for the match
for the advertising it would give him.
Munroe arrived on the- early morn
ing train and was met by Tim Mc-
Grath, who will have charge of his
training camp; Billy Roche, Manager
Coffroth of the Yosemlte Club and
others. He went at once to the Beach
Tavern and inspected me quarters in
which he will live and work for the
next month. In the afternoon he went
for a stroll down the boulevard.
He will not be able to box for some
days as a finger of his left hand Is in
splints. He injured it at Hot Springs
while playing baseball. He expects to
be able to use it early In next week.
, Muhroe, who looks lixe a fresh-laced,
vigorous boy, is quietly confident. He
is not boastful, but says: "I would
not be here If I did not think I had
a chance.' I met 'Jeffries once when I
did not know as much of the game as
I do now. He did not frighten me
then."
If the fates have it in store for Mun
roe to be at the head of the list it ia
He i stepped on the scales at Shee
han's and weighed 226 pounds. He Is
so active In his movements that he
does not appear to weigh 200 pounds.
He expects to weigh 220 pounds the
night of the fight.
"Kid McCoy will be here shortly to
help me train," he said in the course
of conversation. "I have the greatest
confidence In him as he has taught me
practically all I know of the fighting
game.. I had his services for three
weeks and my friends could see marked
improvement in my worK rrom day to
day. He did more than box with me.
He showed me certain blows and then
showed me how to guard myself. I
have boxed with Jack O'Brien and
others, but they do not try to Impart
any knowledge of the game."
Tim McGrath has Andy Gallagher,
Casejf and a number of heavyweights
ready to box with Munroe. . The In
tention is to have a wide range of
sparring partners so that he will have
to study a variety of styles, thus keep
ing him on the alert all the time. He
Is to face Jeffries on the 17th of
June.
easy to imagine him the most popular
champion since the days of Sullivan.
He is so ingenious that it would be
hard to spoil him, while his good na
ture would be a passport In any com
pany.
"Dolly" Gray has been in the habit of
puzzling all kinds of batsmen lately.
But yesterday his curves would not
bend right at Recreation Park. They
Â¦ all looked nice and soft to the Oakland
batsmen. Runs were easy to get, espe
cially in the eighth, when two arrived,
the result of a triple, a double and a
single. Score 5 to 2.
Gray started off wildly, but settled
down later. As usual, he got into a
deep hole in nearly every inning, but
his luck refused to desert him in his
hour of need, and consequently Oak
land did not get half as many runs as
it should have secured. Buchanan was
steady throughout and pitched master
ly ball in every inning. Los Angeles
was lucky to get two runs off the Texas
padagogue.
Jimmy Byrnes brought In one run
with a great two-bagger, which alight
ed in the place where the parlor of Mrs.
Blibbits' house was once, but which
has been transformed into center field.
Jimmy also winged 'em down to second
In Pete Lohman style, and was the
most popular man in the lot. Oakland
fielded perfectly. Flood made the only
error of the game, and that happened
on a hard chance. The score:

. Canole stock went up in the fifth
round. There was a deal of Infighting,
with Nelson getting all the worst of.
It. , .He missed with a dozen â¢
and Canole ' got: home with : his right
and left at 1 will. -The sixth was almost
a repetition I of the preceding round,'
Nelscm covering up j to escape ; the ..tor
rent! Matters brightened -up for Nel
sbn; in ; the seventh, for he sent ' Canole
back-tohis handlers quite as weary as
he/was himself. The eighth was some
what; tame. Â¦Â¦',. Â¦ .:^^^^BEB^BÂ£Hffi(jjpl
In the ninth Canole began playing
for I Nelson's ? wind ** and it ;â¢ looked ; blue
for the Chicago boy at stages. v Toward
the - endr. however, the', latter plumped
two "hard ones" on ;' Martin's jaw that
made himi break ffround.
.The was a great Â¦ round.
While â¢ dealing out^ a i consignment-? ot
left ;hahd- jabs* Canole grew careless
and Nelson dropped him with a right
to ; the â¢ Jaw. j He): arose . quickly and
both were fighting ; fiercely at the call;
Nelson ; lost 2 no ;. time .' in v the succeed-;
ing round.; ;He kept his right work^
ing overtime and had Canole guessing
from" the Jump.
Canole popped in a straight left. In
the thirteenth . that started - the blood
CAXOIiE IN ASCEXDAXT.
In the opening round Canole landed
first with his left and later on put.
Nelson down with the same glove. It
was Canole's round thro-ugnout and thÂ«
short enders received nu encourage
ment.
Nelson started in to mix things In
the â¢ round following, and reached
Canole's face with three hard punches.
Then he grew wild and Canole landed
on him repeatedly with heavy rlgtit
and left swings and jabs. Round three
was a spirited one, Nelson cutting 1 out
the pace. He kept his right wo-rkir.jr
and Canole clinched. Canole sent in
his regular supply of rights and lefts
in return and both were tired when
the gong sounded.
Nelson forced things again in the'
third, dropping in a hard right on
Canole's. nose that started the claret
to flowing. Canole came back with a
package of lefts that bewildered Nel
son and he looked worried at the call
of corners. Â¦' 1 . â¢
A few minutes later, or at 10:10,
Canole stepped into the ring followed
by his seconds, Eddie Smith, Jimmy
Carroll, Martin Murphy and Young
Jimmy Carroll. He was quickly fol
lowed by Nelson, who had behind him
Ted Murphy, Paddy Moran and Billy
McDonald. Referee Jack Welch gave
the boys their usual instructions, they
agreed to protect themselves in the
breakaways and the, gong soon found
them quickly at work.
Canole stood ; erect with his ever
ready left doing business at the same
old stand, his guard law. Nelson came
up slightly crouched, with a high
guard. The game had not progressed
far when it developed that the Chicago
fighter depended on a high right swin?
for general results.
NEL.SOX IS DOWN.
After the two preliminaries had been
disposed of Billy Jordan stepped into
the ring and introduced Jack Munroe,
the Butte miner now matched to fight
Jim Jeffries. Munroe was decorded an
ovation, and in answer to' calls for a
speech said: "I came here to fight
Jeffries and will not run away from
him."
Nelson is a wonder and no mistake.
He took his punishment without a
whimper, went to " his corner as the
gong sounded looklng'weary and dis
tressed, but responded again to the
gong call, looking aa cheerful as a boy
buying 5 cents' worth of candy.
Canole dented his physiognomy with
punches that looked hard enough to
stop a clock, but he might just as
well have been beating a hydrant with
a baseball bat.
Some day Nelson may get struck
with an automobile and take the count,
but in a collision with the boxing
glove he looks impregnable.
Canole on different and sundry oc
casions listened to the unpleasant
chirp of the official timer, and, though
the lad from the Windy City swayed
and rocked frequently, he found no use
for the carpet. "
JACK MUXROE PRESENTED.
Nelson was an unknown quantity out
this way, while Canole on a previous
visit when he went twenty-five rounds
with J. 'Edward Britt left a lasting im
pression behind. This, 6f course. Is
what made the Fall River boy such an
overwhelming favorite In the betting.
jj .Unfortunately^ for- Martin .Canole, thV
crack lightweight ofvFalf-Rlyer^. Mass.,'
the articles of agreement, for his kittle
fistic seance'wlth' Battling; Nelson of,
Chicago at Woodward'8 Pavilion last
evening did not permit of his carrying
a brick or a horseshoe in either glove,
or he might have won*. ' Canole climbed
through the ropes a 20 to 9 favorite fn
the betting. After springing, a! choice'
consignment of left hand Jabs, hooks/
right, hand swings and. now; and then
a butt, occasionally getting a hammer
lock on Nelson's -glove 'â¢? when things
looked blue, and not forgetting his fa
mous shift, he went down and out in
the eighteenth round from a right hand
punch that made perfect . connection
with the point of his jaw. â¢Â¦. V . ;
The contest was held under the. aus
pices of the San Francisco Athletic
Club, and Matchmaker Alec GreggainS
can point to this one with pride. The
attendance was only fair, but ring
goers saw one of the s best 'contests
that ever took place in the town.

MORRIS PARK. May 20.â When The
Claimant defeated Eschutcheon In the
second race to-day the bookmakers
. were caved from paying over a fortune ;
â¢ to the backers of David Gideon's colt.
â¢ At one time 30 to 1 could be seen on the
cards of the layers of odds, but when
.the youngsters went to the post 4 to 1
Â¦ was the ruling price. The longshot was
hard ridden for more than a quarter of
a mile, and while he was closing on
.The Claimant the latter won cleverly.
It was the first winner sent to the
post by John E. Madden at this meet
.ihgr. now nearly over. The Claimant,
funning in Thomas Hitchcock's name
t.'nd- colors, Is registered as the joint
property of Hitchcock and Madden
and is trained by the latter. In his own
colors- Madden's City Bank won the
second race of his career when he ran
away from Grazlallo, Andy Williams.

'the closing event of the day. When
.City Bank and Oarsman met a few
days ago it was nip and tuck between
them. Oarsman won. but the effort
â¢ must have left pome result, for Oars
riian, at practically the same weight,
â¢ ran several lengths below that form.
' Possibly City Bank ran away above his
former form. The latter is the more
reasonable supposition, for the time,
1:4C. is only half a second slower than
the track record. The race was '"over
the hill," and some of the beaten ones,
Varticularly any one with forelegs with
. a suspicion of unsoundness, will surely
jail to run well over this course. Sum

SUES OX BIO JUDGMENT.â Alfred NUIma
Ole Stengteld and Oliver Olsen yesterday filed
suit on Judgment against W. H. Soderberg
John Erlckson and A. F. Gulnan. The Judg
ment, which Is for $11.1.005. was obtained in
tee District Court of Alaska last March.
Gordon Bennett Cup Trials.
PARIS, May 20.â The Ardennes
motor trials for the James Gordon
Bennett international cup contest
went off without serious accident to
day. The first arrivals were Charley
Thery, Salleron and Rougier. The fin
al results await official t*-^-
from Nelson's nose. This did hot
bother the latter, for he drove In a
hard right and left on Canole In the
latter's corner that made him wince.
Canole came back in the Fourteenth
with a. left to the star chamber that
almost cut Nelson in two. Nelson did
poorly in this round and the long end
ers began feeling for their tickets.-
Nelson was a long way from home
and knew it, for in the fifteenth he be
gan by sending Canole staggering to
the ropes with a heavy right. Canole
stopped another and went to his knee,
taking the count. Nelson was hot on
the trail when the gong sounded, and
the house was In an uproar.
There was more hard luck in store
for Canole in the sixteenth. He poked
his Jaw against Nelson's right glove
agaln'and landed on his back. He got
up and fought back fiercely, with Nel
son forcing him around the ring, vainly
endeavoring to land a knock-out..
Furious fighting marked the seven
teenth. Nelson rushed, but was stag
gered with straight lefts, Canole was
bleeding copiously, from the nose, and
each boxer stopped enough blows to
stop^an ordinary scrapper. Just before
the gong struck, Canole nearjy went
down from a hard right.
Martin Canole's hopes of meeting Joe,
Gans for the lightweight championship
were blighted in the eighteenth. Both
came up fairly fresh, with Canole start
ing a tattoo on Nelson's face with his
left. Nelson rushed and caught Canole
a staggering blow with his right
In the latter's corner. Canole slipped
out of the predicament, but was grog
gy, and "when Nelson caught him an
other on the point he landed on his back
and took the full count near the north
end of the ring. He got up bewildered,
was the recipient of another one of the
Chicago lad's "haymakers" and struck
full on his back, half under the ropes.
Jimmy Carroll tossed a towel in â¢ the
ring as an acknowledgment of defeat,
but the fatal ten seconds had already
been tolled off. . * "

NELSOM KNOCKS OUT CANDLE.
The Golden Chariot mine near Sump
ter, Oregon, has been sold to Eastern
parties at a price reported to be $75,000,
so says the Po-"and Telegram.
The Yreka Journal says that quartz
mines that pay well have t>eeh located
and worked, more or less, in all the
hills along Greenhorn, Cherry, Dead
wood, Me Adams and. Indian creeks,
from Yreka to Fort Jones, and that
ledges exist in all the mountains in
that vicinity from the creek beds to
the summits of the mountains for a
distance of fifteen to twenty miles.
According to the Redding Free Press
the new smelter for the Afterthought
mine will be installed and ready for
use about September 1.
A mining claim owned by Frank Enzep
Â¦perger In the Rough and Ready mining dis
trict was also Involved. Mrs.* Enzepsperger
was on hand to Introduce evidence In support
of his claim and the matter waa also submit
ted to the department. It ts stated that In
most Instances the railroad company relin
quished claims to lands In which bona fide
mining claims existed.
When the Central Pacific Railroad was built
and connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
the Government, In order to encourage the
railroad company In its endeavors, donated to
it, among other things, every odd section of
land for twenty miles on each side of the
track. But it was expressly reserved In these
grants from, the Government to the railroad
that mineral lands should not be Included.
For thousands of these acres of lands the (all
road company has already obtained title, and
much of It has been disposed of by the com
pany to various settlers. The railroad In the
recent case at Sacramento applied for Its pat
ent to hold certain lands In and around Wash
ington In this county. On some of the land for
which the company applied are valuable min
ing claims. Under the terms of the grant to
the railroad company these mineral lands were
excluded, but It devolved on the owners of
mining claims to show the mineral character
of the lands, and that the lands were more
valuable for mineral than for agricultural pur
poses. In this endeavor the owners of claims
In and around Washington were situated on
land for which the railroad company desired
to obtain patent, for . witnesses went to Sac
ramento In order to prove the character o;
the lands Involved. The evidence was heard
during the past three days and the cases sub
mitted to the Register and Receivers, of the
Land Office for decision. Among the mining
claims Involved were the St. Patrick. San
Francisco and Paris ledge, owned by the Gas
ton Ridge Mine Company; the Grey Eagle
claim, now being operated under the superln
tendency of Henry Kaler; the Daylight group
of mines and a group of claims owned by W.
L. Williamson. Fred Searts of this city repre
sented most of the mineral claimants.
The land contest cases at Sacramento In
the United States Land Office in which the
Central Pacific Company Is applicant for
patents and various mining claim owners
are contestants have been concluded, and while
the decision of the land department was not
announced the owners of mining claims feel
confident that they will win their point.
The Grass Valley News, in a review
of the land coi test cases that have
recently been j heard at the United
States Land Office at Sacramento,
makes the following statements:
Since 1894, when operations were ac
tively begun in the Rossland mining
district in British .Columbia, the dis
trict has produced gold, silver and
copper to the estimated value of $26,
000,000, an average of about $16 a ton.
It is shown by the annual report of
the Under Secretary for Mines that In
Queensland the value of gold, copper,
tin and coal produced In 1903 was $17,
868,566 in total. This was a gain for a
year of 51,821,000. "
AFTER MIXERAIi LANDS.
A new mining district is reported to
be opening up in Inyo County, at Cac
tus Flats, fifteen miles southeast of
Olancha.
During the coming season nine prin
cipal parties will be engaged in geo
logical and topographical work in
Alaska for the Government and three
smaller parties will also be In the field.
The geology of Southwestern Alaska,
the placer mining methods of Alaska,
the oil and coal fields of Southwestern
Alaska, the topography of the Seward
peninsula, the coal deposits of Cape
Lisburne. and the tin deposits of the
York region and the topography from
Eagle to Rampart are among the top
ics to be considered by the scientists.
According to information received
from Randsburg the Pacific Coal Com
pany has purchased 640 acres of lands
In which coal has been found and will
proceed to develop the property for
coa^
The Buckeye mine on the Forest Hill
divide. Placer County, has been sold
for 540,000, as reported.
C. Hay is about to resume operation
on Randolph Flat, near Grass Valley.
Operations will be resumed- on the
Golden Harvest Mining Company's
property near Grovelanct, Tuolumne
County.
The Globe mine near Dedrlck, Trin
ity County, is about to resume work.
The snow has been fourteen feet deep
on the mine.
From the annual report of the Moun
tain Copper Company it appears that
the company produced 6616 tons of cop
per in 1903.
EXPLORATION OF ALASKA.
This Idea was looked upon with a great deal
of incredulity by the majority of the miners,
who thought that It would be Impossible to
use a dredger on frozen ground with any suc
cess; nevertheless, this dredger, with a crew
of ten men, five on each shift, handled more
ground than 400 men with a boiler could.
Until 1000 the steam boiler with attach
ments was considered the acme of modern
appliances for working the mine* In the Yu
kon, but In that year a Detroit firm decided
to place a modern dredger of 700 cubic yards
capacity per twenty hours on claim 42, below
Discovery, Bonanza Creek.
From 1898 to 1S9S no (round could be han
dled which contained less than CO cents to
41 per pan, 1. e., from $135 to $270 per cubic
yard, a pan containing on an average 0.10 of
a cubic foot, while in many Instances as high
aa $10 to $15 per pan were found, though this
of course was occasional.
To facilitate the thawing of the gravel
some miners then conceived the Idea of using
a steam boiler fitted wfth rubber tubes hav
ing steel nozzles attached. The steam Is sent
through these tubes and the nozzles driven
Into the ground to be worked, so that a con
siderable amount of the pay streak could be
thawed by one shift and excavated by the
next.
a dredger, has been placed on Foots
Creek, a tributary of the Rogue River,
between Grants Pass and Gold Hill.
Dredging for gold in Alaska may take
on large proportions in the future.
' E. B. Bolger, mining engineer, writes
to the Mining and Scientific Press con
concerning the possibilities in regard to
dredging for gold on the Yukon. While
the general subject of dredging is dis
cussed, some of the statements that
Mr. Bolger makefe'are interesting? The
old-time miner in the Yukon region, so
recalls Mr. Bolger, resorted to the
primitive method of lighting fires on
the ground to be worked, thus loosen
ing a foot or two of the auriferous
gravel at a time, which could then be
handled with a pick and shovel, a pro
cess that required the richest kind of
ground to pay the expense in time and
labor. Continuing he said:
Herbert opened up the mill by put
ting Rafael to the floor with a terrific
right to the Jaw. Throughout the
first round Rafael was all but . gone
and it seemed Herbert would win in a
canter. Herbert came up strongly in
the next round and from that time on
it was one great exchange of fierce
wallops.
Herbert began to get tired in the
fifth and sixth, but regained his
strength in the seventh and eighth and
tried hard to finish his man. Rafael's
experience told in the long run. When
they were coming together In the lat
ter half of ;the ninth Rafael landed a
stiff right to the Jaw, which put Her
bert away for nine seconds. The dose
was repeated when Herbert got* up
,nnd the bell saved him. His seconds
then threw up .the sponge. f
boxer, dislocated his rlght~shoulder in
the ninth round of his bout with Jim
Hayward, another copper skinned
fighter. The men were mixing it in
the curtain raiser and Xiewis had his
man badly buffaloed when he met
with the mishap in the ninth round.
The fight was a clinch de clinch af
fair from the tap of the gong. In the
fourth Lewis put his man down twice
for nine seconds, but did not have the
nerve to get in the final wallop. Lewis
was shifty and did most of the lead-
Ing, but outside the fourth" round his
blows lacked force. When Lewis hurt
himslf In the - ninth Referee Billy
Granfleld awarded the decision to
Hayward.
. Frank Rafael and George Herbert of
Port Costa appeared In the second
mlxup of the night, and their meeting
resulted In as gory and fierce a battle
as was ever Been. in the pavilion. Her
bert's seconds threw up the sponge at
the end of the ninth round after their
man had gone down twice from ter
rific rights and lefts to the Jaw.
The first use of dredgers to rescue
gold from deposits of sand was in New
Zealand. Since the process was begun
In California, as is well known, it has
proved so remunerative . that large
amounts of capital have been Invested
In dredging plants and in auriferous
lands to be dredged. Possibly there Is
not general appreciation of the extent
to which the gold dredging idea has
been entertained. Dredgers have
worked and are working in several por
tions of California, from Orovllle and
the country adjacent to the northern
mining counties of the State, and an
cient river channels have a chance to
be dredged in counties through which
runs California's mineralized mother
lode.
Dredgers have been operated on the
Snake River in Oregon having a capac
ity of something like 2000 yards of
gravel a day. A dredging plant has
been established on the John Day
River in Oregon. In Southern Oregon
In a few words, this sums up the
situation to date. A great amount of
matter has been published In interior
papers about gold dredging and the
attitude of the Anti-Debris Associa
tion toward gold dredging In the last
fortnight. Neither the California Min
ers' Association nor the Anti-
Debris Association has yet put itself
on record as a body in reference to this
question. Possibly a great amount of
heart burning and misunderstanding
may be averted by patiently waiting
until the conclusions of the investigat
ors in both associations that have
been mentioned shall have been pro
mulgated. It is not considered by cool
men that it is wise to discuss the prop
osition of dredger mining publicly ex
cept after due consideration of . all
the facts. These will soon be available.
SPREAD OF INDUSTRY.
Since the mining committee went to
Oroville to Investigate the Anti-Debris
Association has also appointed a com
mittee to visit the sections where the
gold dredging machines are actually
employed, and it is probable that this
committee will also frame a report. In
the committee that has been named for
the Anti-Debris Association in the
matter now under discussion are M. J.
Dlllman and R. T. Devlin of Sacra
mento, Supervisors John Burns, T. B.
Hull and L. P. Farmer of Sutter Coun
ty and Dr. D. P. Durst and David Mor
rison of Yuba County.
The mining committee having in
charge the Investigation that was made
In Oroville and vicinity includes C. M.
Belshaw, W. C. Ralston, Tirey L. Ford,
E. C. Voorheis, Edward H. Benjamin
and others. - Looking over the | names
of the committeeme'n In these two com
mlttey, the outlook would seem to be
very good for getting at the facts. The
parties at the head of the gold-dredg
ing industry in the places where it has
been principally pursued up to date
have organized a Dredge Miners' As
sociation, with John J. Hamlyn, ' su
perintendent of the Feather River Ex
ploration Company, as president and
F. H. Mayhew, who Is officially con
nected with several mining companies,
for secretary. .
A committee composed largely of the
officers of the California Miners' Asso
ciation recently visited Oroville and
there Inspected the prdgress of min
ing for gold by the dredger process
and provided for the preparation of a
report dealing principally with the is'
sue as to whether the dredgers have
injured or are liable to Injure the agri
cultural lands along 'the river banks;
also whether the streams beside which
dredger mining Is carried on are In
juriously affected by this form of min
ing. At this writing it is improbable
that the formal report to be prepared
for the California Miners' Association
will be made public for some time to
come. Possibly it will not come up for
public discussion until the next an
nual meeting of the California Miners'
Association, .which is several months
distant. In the absence of the formal
report about dredging, it is well known
that the miners that visited Oroville
take the view that the damage can
not Justly be charged up to the ac
count of the mining dredgers.

BARLEY â Business was much quieter, both
CASH WHEAT.
"The Modern Miller says that further Im
provement In winter Wheat is reported, and,
though the crop will be short xa the OWo Val
ley States and in Michigan, it will be better
than 'the earlier estimates. Elsewhere a largo
yield is promised.
"J. J. Hill says In an interview in a St.
Paul paper that the acreage into spring Wheat
wll! not be larger than last year and that the
United States will raise about two-thirds of an
average crop. He thinks that Jones of thÂ«
Commercial West is right when he says that
the yl-ld will be 60.000,000 bushels short of
la.Â«t year."
In this market futures were firm and cash
grain was steady and unchanged. .
WHEAT â A good deal of crop news cam*
across- the wires yesterday, the private reports
cf Mitchell. Mulcahy & Co. from Chicago
saying: "The Commercial West's crop bul
letin says, that aeedtn; in the Red River Val
ey Is backward and embraces only about 50
per cent of last year's area up to last Satur
day. This will probably amount to 65 per
cent or 70 per cent acreage of Wheat this
year. A considerable percentage of the Wheat
lard will be put into barley or flax or remain
fallow. Outside of the valley seeding is prac
tically completed. This week has been very
favorable for work, which may run the acre
age up to 75 per cent, possibly 80 per cent,
of lÂ»05.
Wheat and Other Grains.
The Potato market was very weak, with sup
plies of old Burbanka still far in excess of
the demand and receipts of new &mple for all
requirements. The top quotation for Oregon
Burbanks was obtained readily enough for
strictly fancy lots, but it was djfficult to ob
tain SI 50 for the general run of offerings. The
daily receipts of new red Onions are too heavy
for the market to readily ibsorb and prices
are steadily declining.
Trad* In miscellaneous vegetables was active
both for local use and shipping account, but
as supplies - w*re plentiful v rices showed but
glUht variation. Extra laacy Asparagus
brought a slight advance, but ordinary stock
wan unchanged, with the bulk of the receipts
going to the canners at 4^g3c per pound. Peas
were easy and the canners secured large Itnes
at or near the bottom quotation. Southern
vegetables were plentiful and generally weak.

Receipts of Cherries were a little l?ss than
20OO boxes, and. despite some shipping demand.
prices ranged lower and there was quite a
surplus unsold at the close. Bulk lots w;re
preferred to the packed stock and well-colored
lots cleaned up quickly at good figures. Apri
cots were rather scarce and nrm. while Goose
berries w-rÂ» easier under increased receipts,
rncst of which came In late. Receipts of Straw
berries continued excessive* Delng over i:Â«X)
chests, and prices cf chest goods stood as pre
viously quoted, with the canners purchasing
the large varieties at the minimum quotation.
Carrieil-over lots of Florin berries were offering
at about previous prices, but met with very
slow sale owing to the abundance and low
prices of better quality offerings fretn other
sections. Raspberries frcm the south sold at
15c pÂ»r small basket, and a drawer from across
the bay brought $2. Dewberries sold slowly
at 7fcl0c per small baak't.
The increasing competition of deciduous
fruits and the continued low prices of Straw
berries tended to lessen the demand for Or
anves and trading was quieter than previously,
both In the open market and in the auction
rooms. Prices in the open market were un
changed and small sixes of Navels were still
(Irmly held at high figure*. Business la the
auction rooms waÂ» not very brisk, as most Job

offerings did not grade very hlrh. Four cars

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO. May 20. â An advance of 2He
la the price of wheat was followed by & sharp
break of 4%c to-day. The erratic actions of
the . May option resulted from speculative
maneuvers attending the scarcity of. wheat
for present use. Closing figures on May was
unchanged from yesterday's final quotations.
July closed with a loss of H@Tic. Corn is
op WÂ©KC Oats are down %f$Vic, and pro
visions 2^c to 1214c
Under the Influence of congestion la the May
delivery tHe wheat market ooened firm, in the
face of excellent wheat conditions.
The umailest local receipts on record, flwe
cars, wtt^ little prospect of any increase in
arrivals, caused an active demand from shorts
for the May ortion. Initial sales of May
showed a rala of HÂ©2= a* 9*->Hce$l 01. July
opened \*c lower to Vic higher at S7$i887\c.
There was little May wheat on the market.
Shorts. In thsir anxiety to cover sales, bid the
price of May uj> to S1-01M within the first
thirty minutes. Naturally other options felt
the effect. July advanced to 0>Hia early in the
day. The market was extremely erratic the en
tire session, dominated by the fluctuations of
tha May delivery. During the latter part of the
day future deliveries I were subiected to con
siderable sailing pressure as a result of favor
ablÂ» croD reports. On the break shorts became
active bidders for May. forcing the price up
to 90c, where the market closed. The future
deliveries, however, fail'd to rally, July clos
ing at S6%Â®S6*ic. a net loss of %Â©%c for
the day.
As a rerun of a small movement and of
the strength of wheat the corn market was
strong early in the day. Later the selling be
came quite general and prices receded sharply.
The market closed firm on renewed covering
by s&ertK July oo'ned a shade to H^Uc
lever at â¢iSS'lS^c, advanced to 49i<ie, sold off
to 4Sc and closed at 4S%C.
The feature of trading tn oats was the
strength and subsequent weajyiess of the May
delivery. May ranged bÂ»tweÂ« 41?i@43c. clos
ing at 42c. - July opened a fnade to lower
at 3aH@:5S->ic, sold between 3SSsfl.3$t*c and
30c. closing at 3S44c

strength In grains. July pork closed with a
loss of I2^c at $11 C2*3. July lard was

WOODWARD ASSUMES OFFICE
OF THE jCITY ENGINEER
' The Grand Jury met yesterday and
adopted a resolution requesting the
Board of Supervisors to allow at least
5100,000 -of the $165,000 of unpro
tested special taxes in the city treas
ury to be expended by the Board of
Education for making sanitary repairs
to school buildings. The Grand Jury
committee made a -thorough examina
tion of all the schools and found, the
sanitary conditions' bad\ln many
schools, especially those in the outly
ing districts.
The outside schoolrooms in rented
residences were found inadequate and
the ventilation therein poor. "The
Grand Jury recommends, that build
ings be erected on school lots. The
discipline was found good in all the
schools and the fire j drills were well
done. Fire escapes j are required on
some of the larger schools." \
â¢ The Grand Jury also urged upon the
Supervisors the necessity of immediate
action regarding^-the defective .electric
wiring in the Almshouse. . The', De
partment of Electricity claims it has
no funds for the purpose,: but>. the
money : should, be provided by â¢ the j Su
pervisors, in" the- opinion of the'Grand
Jury; Â¦â¢ The ,- Grand -'? Jury, also highly
commends the establishment 'ââ¢'; and
workings of the Juvenile Court. â¢

â¢ Political events in the last week have given
certain candidates undue prominence and this
is taken advantage of by the "Newa Letter

pooned and cartooned everybody of promi

tables are turned upon him . and his ridiculous
pretensions with his own weapons the entire
country is on the broad grin. The News Letter

XGUEJf LUN ON' HIS DEFENSE.â The de
fense in the case of Xpuen Lun, charged with
the murder of Tom Tick of the Chinese Educa
tional Society in Rosa alley on May IS. iM,
was commenced before a Jury In Judge' Law
lor's court yesterday. Several policemen testi
fied that tiÂ»>y saw no one running out of the
alley after the shooting. This contradicted one
of the witnesses for the prosecution. Chew
Pins Yuen, a Chinese, also testified.
G. E. Booker, chief clerk of the
Spring Valley Water Company, and M.
B. Kellogg, its attorney, appeared be
fore-the Finance Committee for the
purpose, of discussing the advisability
of a change of the water pipe running
along Pine street, between Stockton
street and Van Ness avenue.
Acting Chief " Dougherty of the Fire
Department presented a letter to the
committee in which he stated that the
water main now in Pine street is but a
six-inch pipe, and as that particular
street is lined with high wooden board
ing-houses and residences the danger
of a conflagration is imminent, and
that should a fire break out the depart
ment would have small chance of stop
ping Its headway before it reached the
water front. Dougherty asked that the
main be taken up and replaced by a
slxteen-inch main. The matter was re
ferred to a committee that will visit
the officers of the Spring Valley Com
pany to-day or Monday.
The afternoon session was taken .up
by the heads of committees of depart
ments, who discussed the applications
for money.
Braunhart urgently asked that an
appropriation be put aside or a vote
cast' for.'. the roofing of the City Hall.
He said: "This building is one of the
finest structures In the .whole world,
but the condition of its roof is a dis
grace. There is enough structural Iron
in the upper part to make an extra
floor on the hall. We should have this
done right away."
After hearing a few remarks from the
different Supervisors the meeting ad
journed until Monday morning, when a
public hearing will be called. ; ;/ '
Fire Commissioner John S. Parry
and acting Chief Dougherty yesterday
submitted to the Finance Committee
elaborate plans for the distribution of
water throughout the city. The sugges
tion -was made after considerable de
liberation on the part of the Board of
Commissio.ners and was finally adopted
unanimously.
The plan suggested by Parry is to
erect a reservoir on the summit of one
of the Twin Peaks, at an elevation of
750 feet. For this Parry asks that an
appropriation of $193,000 be made. The
work would include a pipe line system
from the ocean beach along H street to
Stanyan and down Stanyan to the res
ervoir. The object of the system is
primarily for fire protection, but, as
explained by Parry, it might be used for
flushing and for the sprinkling of
streets. The suggestion was approved
by Brandanstein, but opposed by d'An
cona. D'Ancona maintained that the
former plan of Engineer Grunsky,
which advocated a reservoir and fresh
water; system was the better and less
expensive of the two.
Brahdenstein, however, said that with j
air of the salt water that surrounds ;
this city there Is no reason why some
of It might not be used profitably.
I was chairman of the Health and Police
Commlttw of the Board of Supervifora In 1893
snd 1M>4 and I wared war against the filthy
conditions obtaining in the dairlex. The dairy
men, however, were orBanized and thfir lnflu
Â«-m.-Â» was >uch ar to prevent unfavorable legis
lation'by'the board. The conditions were de
jilorable and exactly as you have reported
thejn. The rows were fed on brewery rwlll
and were -knee deep in muck and filth. Xrey
vj. your good work and the mothrrs and bablri
will rise up and call you blessed.
A preliminary inspection of several
dairies was made last evening by
subordinate health officials, who noted
the bad conditions prevailing therein.
Ragan received a letter yesterday
from ex-Superviyor P. J. Kennedy,
commencing him for his determina
tion to secure a pure milk supply for
San Francisco. Kennedy writes:
Health Officer Ragan will tem
porarily withdraw two milk and two
food inspectors to aid the two dairy
inspectors in supervising the milking
of cows and to make observations of
conditions to be incorporated in their
reports. The chief food inspector will
be temporarily commissioned as chief
dairy inspector.
Every dairy in the city will be
covered by the inspectors, together
Â¦with head health officials. It is pro
posed that the inspectors be present
in the early morning during the actual
time of milking the cows. The largest
dairie* will be the first objective point
fcr official scrutiny.
The Health Board committee, con
sisting of Drs. Harvey. Poheim and
Hughes, having in charge the pro
posed crusade against unclean and un
sanitary dairies, will provide for a
rigid inspection of the same in order
to better the conditions surrounding
the marketing of milk for human con
sumption.
A map accompanies the letter and at
tention is called to the delineated ex
tension of Market street thereon, thus
showing a Juncture at the point of com
mencement of the easterly and west
erly new boulevard of Ocean avenue,
Market street, the Dewey boulevard
and Corbett avenue.
The company states that in its opin
ion the expense to the city with the
hew route described will not be any
more than the proposed Nineteenth
avenue extension, as the grading ex
penses cm the former route will be re
duced to a 'minimum and the" company
will be at the expense of erecting. the
fence; . . /
The Spring Valley Water Company
sent a proposition to the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday to grant an ease
ment for a highway from the junction
of . Ocean and Corbett avenues, near
Ingleside. along the easterly boundary
of the Lake Merced .rancho, forty-five
feet In width, to the point where Cor
bett avenue intersects the easterly line
of the Lake Merced rancho, thus mak
ing Corbett avenue one hundred feet
wide instead of sixty, and also a like
easement across Lake Merced rancho
one hundred feet in width," which may
be added to the proposed Market street
extension through Twin Peaks and
form a continuous boulevard to the
Great Highway.
The conditions are that the proposed
extension of Nineteenth avenue be
abandoned, and that Ocean . avenue,
from Corbett avenue to ' the Great
Highway, be abandoned in such
a way^that the title thereto shall re
x-ert to and be vested in- the Spring
Valley Company.
It is claimed that permits have been
refused in 'the past for no reason at
all. The purport of the ordinance is to
have the Police Commission shorn of
its autocratic power in that regard.
"I am introducing this ordinance at
the request of the California Liquor
Dealers' Association," said Hocks.
"The attorneys who have it
hold that it'is a valid measure under
the charter provision vesting the legis
lative power of the-city in the Board
of Supervisors. If, however, the ordin
ance should fall to stand the legal test
after its passage, the desired relief can
be obtained by a charter amendment,
which will be submitted , to the people.
"ThcXiiquor Dealers' Association in
dorsed sixteen ' Supervisors at the last
election, .fourteen of whom were elect
ed. It believes that the Supervisors will
show their reciprocal friendship after it
is shown to them that the ordinance is
designed to give all applicants for
liquor licenses a fair deal." '1
..At present If the Police Commission
refuses to grant such : permit or pro
poses to revoke any permit, that" has
been granted the person 'that vis re
fused such permit or whose permit it
is proposed to revoke shall be entitled
to be heard before the commission, in
person or' through counsel. :'. : ..
The ordinance to be Introduced f" by
Hocks provides th.at the applicant that
is refused a permit to sell Â¦ liquor by
the Police Commission shall have the
right to apply for a permit to the Board
of Supervisors on a proper showing
that the refusal was not based on good
grounds.
Supervisor Oscar Hocks will at next
Monday's meeting of the Board of Su
pervisors 'introduce an ordinance pro
viding for the taking of an appeal to
the Board of Supervisors from the Po
lice Commissioners in cases where the
last named body can assign no sufficient
cause for refusing licenses to sell
liquors to worthy applicants.
The ordinance is designed to. curtail
the arbitrary power granted to the Po
lice Commission by the charter to is
sue liquor permits. It will, in .' fact,
make the Board of Supervisors a court
of appeal when a license to , sell 1 liquor
Is refused by the Police Commission. â¢

â¢ Mr. Collins, "during 'all of" this time, knew
of. the Â¦ existence I of., the- bank's mortgage and
of Its consequent interest nrlverse to the. claim
of Chnrlea H. Robinson. Mr. Colllnn,' however,
d(d not notify the bank of any of the'proceed
ings Â¦ that â¢ were being- taken -Dy^hlnr to estab
lish such claim, nor did- he advise Mr. Â¦ Pur
rlneton. the administrator,-' either " before or
after "the service of summons upon- hlnv as to
h!s duty, r as Â¦ trustee.* to Â¦ protect the estate,
against 'the claim ot Mr. Robinson. :=- ..â¢>
After obtaining â¢ the by : default
Mr, Cotllnn, as the attorney for Mr. Purrlngton.
the administrator, f filed , a . petition for leave i to
sell ; the Interest of the estate In one | of. the
pieces of; property for. the "purpose of paying
the Judgment 'and^obtained .an' order* granting
such leave. The bank then, for the first time,
was .'informed' of" what had taken place 'and
COLONS KNEW.
Under these circumstances Mr. Collins, on
January 20, 1902, in the action brought by Mr.,
Robinson, suggested to the court the appoint
ment of Mr. Purrlngton as administrator In lieu
of the former administrator, who had been re
moved, and secured the substitution of Mr.
Purrington as defendant. Mr. Collins, as at
torney for the. plaintiff, then filed a supple
mental complaint 'Â¦ against Mr. Purrlngton as
defendant in his capacity of administrator and
had summons issued and, served upon him.
Mr. Purrlnirton upon receiving the summon* and
complaint 1 handed them over to Mr. Robinson,
the plaintiff In the action, and did nothing
whatever about the mattec. Upon the expira
tion of the time to answer. Mr. Purrington not
appearing. Mr. Collins, on March 11, 1903, had
his default entered and obtained Judgment
thereon' ngalnst him.
During all of these proceedings the only
property owned or claimed by the estate of
Caroline A. Robinson were three certain pieces
of real property In this city. Before her death
Caroline A. Robinson had given the Hibernia
Savings and Loan Society a mortgage on these
properties, and after her death the bank had
released this mortgage and had taken In lieu
thereof a new mortgage for her helm merely.
Including the plaintiff. . Charles; H. Robinson,
himself. The bank, therefore, to the extent of
this mortgage was the successor in Interest
of the heirs of Caroline A. Robinson and oc
cuni-d the same position as they toward the
administrator of the estate. This position the
hank ' occupied during all 'the ''time which
Mr. Â¦ Collins was taking the > proceedings
heretofore related. During this time the bank
foreclosed the "mortgage and itself- bought In
the i property, which; failed to bring more than
the amount of the mortgage. I ' !
IN THE PURRIXGTON CASE.
These statements and the recital In the
affidavit that Agnes M. Newman was Mr. Col
lins f wife were false. Agnes Ms -Newman
was not at the time of her. death, .and never
had! been the wife of Mr. Collins. On thÂ«
contrary, Mr. Collins had on May . 15. 1S89,
married Chgrlotta E. Newman, the..' sister of
Agnes M." Kewman,- and said Charlotta E.
Newman wSs at the time the foregoing state
ments and affidavits were made by Mr. Collins
living and undlvorced.
Thirdâ Mr. Collins was on October S^ 1901.
the attorney for Charles H. Robinson as the
plaintiff in an action brought by him against
the administrator of the entate of his mother,
Caroline A. Robinson. The action was upon
a claim that had been previously , presented
to the administrator and by him rejected.
The claim was based upon a document signed
by Caroline A/ Roblncon and reading as fol
lows: "March 17, 1890. For value received
I promise to pay to my son. C. H7 Roblneon,
fifteen hundred dollars over Â¦ and . above his
share of my personal estate. (Signed) c. A.
Robinson."
It is apparent at once from reading the note
that there Is at least a serious question as
to whether the document was not merely of a
testamentary character and wholly Invalid as
a claim against Mrs. Robinson's estate. .
On the day mentioned. October 8, 1901. one
Charles W. Purrlngton was appointed the ad
ministrator of the estate of Caroline A. Rob
inson In lieu of the former administrator, who
had been removed. Mr. Collins appeared as
the attorney for Mr. Purrlngton In the mat
ter of his appointment as administrator, and
continued thereafter to represent him in the
matter of said estate. Mr. Purrlngton em
ployed no other attorney regarding the mat
ter f of the estate than Mr. Collins. Mr.'Pur
rlngton furthermore wan appointed at the ln
etance of ' Charles H. Robinson, the plaintiff
In the action mentioned, and for the admitted
purpose- of furthering ithls action. To this
purpose Mr. Collins was a party.
' The charges so made . by Mr. Collins against
Judge Kerrigan were false and untrue and were
made 'by him without- any; ground; therefor. â¢
'Â¦The charges were made by- Mr.' Collins ma
liciously and for the purpose of injuring Judge
Kerrigan personally and not for any purpose of
serving, the administration of Justice 1 or ; the
public :goodr * . .-.'.*Â¦ â¢ r ;,|." Â¦ ---! 'â¢
At the time thÂ«~charges. were made Mr. Col
lins was the attorney -for the defendant in; an
action then pending before Judge Kerrigan,
wherein the- latter. had tha .day,' before 'refused
to make findings as desired b" Mr. Collins and
stated . that he would sign certain: other .find-
Ings. These latter reflected to some extent on
Mr. Collins- himself. Judge' Kerrigan - an
nounced, his decision In regard to: the' findings
on Saturday forenoon.' On Sunday Mr. Collins
: volunteered to the Â¦ newspaper reporters 'men
tioned'the charges against the Judge and they
-were published Monday morning. -t While Judge
Kerrigan had. announced what his action would
be, he had not yet actually signed the findings,
and the matter of what findings he would sign
was pending at the time Mr. Collins made his
charges. This Mr. Collins knew. Â¦" ! â¢
Second-r-On the 23d day of May, 1901, ! Mr.
Collins presented to "the Hibernia. Savings and
Loan Society a passbook tn the name of Agnes
M. Newman, together with a purported .assign
ment-of i. the; same to himself, and requested
the payment Of the amount due, some f 1255 16.
-t The' of fleers of the bank required; as. a "con
dition "of the payment of . the money, a state
ment from Mr. CollinÂ« as to the genuineness
of : the assignment and . the ' circumstance* un
der which, it was made. >. Thereupon" Mr...Col
lins stated to", the officer* of the bank, : among
other things, that* Agnes 'M.- Newman.- the de
positor, was dead;^thatÂ«he was his wife, and
that -the moneys on deposit' were community
property - and . he was therefore entitled to
them in any case. The officers of the bank re
quested Mr. Collins 'to put his statement In the
form of. an affidavit. 'and in accordance with
this request he 'presented to the officers of
the" bank an affidavit by himself -wherein It
was recited that^Agnes- M. â¢ Newman,- the de
positor, was his wife, . and ' that Agnes M.
Newman was her maiden name. , - In reliance
upon these statements â¢ and this affidavit the
. bank paid \ Mr. . Collins the â¢ amount . due on
the passbook. ' *- "^**
SAY S1ATEMENTS ARE FA1.SE.
Firstâ On the â¢ 27th day â¢ of March, 1904,
through the medium of Interviews vwrtth a re
porter of the Chronicle and with a reporter of
the Examiner, Mr. Collins- made public charges
of Â¦â¢Jncompetency > and malfeasance in office
against Hon. Frank H. Kerrigan, Judge of the
Superior Court of this city and county. :Â¦ The
accounts of these Interviews published in the
Chronicle and Examiner of March 23, 1 1904," are
accurate, and copies .of the. same are attached
hereto. ' . . : , ; â¢. . â¢ .- ,:â¢".-- ;
The- following is the report 'of the
grievance committee, -which" was
adopted with but ( threat dissenting
votes: . " .
To the President and Members of the Bar As
sociation of San Francisco â The committee on
grievances respectfully reports as follows: - ; .
That charges were preferred before your com
mittee by the nrm. of Tobin& Tobin. against
Mr. George JD. Collins, an attorney â¢ practicing
in this city, and were investigated by your
committee. That as the result of such investi
gation your committee finds as follows:' . :Â¦ .
git took the sixty members of the or
ganization three hours and a half to
reach a conclusion regarding the re
port submitted by the grievance com
mittee. | The committee recommended
that disbarment proceedings .be insti
tuted against Collins, and the matter
was argued pro and con. , Â¦
S Collins was present" and stated his
own defense. He is not a member of
the Bar Association, but as his liveli
hood and reputation were both in Jeo
pardy he was present as a matter of
self-protection.
Evidence was submitted in behalf 'of
the Hibernia " Bank to show that he
had drawn cl^aih money of which he
had ;no legaWright; \testimonw was
quote'd as to his reflections upon Judge
Kerrigan, and evidence given as to
the attempt to collect a certain-prom
issory note given by C. A. Robinson. /
In each instance^ Collins - was pre
pared to contest the t charges and the
testimony taken in executive session
will, be submitted to the Supreme
Court, along with the findings . of the
Bar Association.
-, CHARGES PRESENTED.
- The San Francisco Bar Association
has recommended that George D.
Collins be disbarred 'from* practice as
an attorney in California. A commit
tee of three will be -appointed by W.
S; Ooddfellow, president of the Bar
Association, to present the case to the
Supreme Court. - ' ~
Ten members of the grievance committee
of the Bar Association passed on the case
without hearing- my side. Most. of that com
mlttee are' lawyers with whom ' I have had
bitter contests, and I appeared' and objected
to their trying Â¦ my case. - I demanded a hear
ing at' a general meeting, as' provided by their
own by-Jaws.
By a vote of seventeen to sixteen the thirty
three members that attended the special meet
ing to-day .declined- to pass Charles L. Patton'a
motion to give .me a fair hearing at a stated
or general meeting: They also voted down a
similar proposition- introduced by. Charles J.
Hegerty, who wanted to. have a .thorough hear
ing. Yesterday's special . meeting had no
Jurisdiction, over the case, for .the constitution
of the Bar Association. provides .that all trials
of this character shall â¢ be at. a. general meet
ing. The next general ! meeting is in July. I
could clear myself . before that. body. . I do
not fear results. When the. case reaches the
Supreme Court I shall be able- to clear myself
of every" charge. - I 1 have bÂ«en. condemned by
a prejudiced committee on an exparte hearing.
Let me say that -the. Bar Association is a
coterie of 147 , out of 3000 members of the bar.
in this city, and Â¦ the leaders of the bar, the
biggest men, are not members. Â¦ The association
ia not one of any standing -in law. It la
merely a voluntary assembly. â¢Â¦ I do not -fear,
it. nor am I In doubt Â¦ of 'the: result. On a
fair hearing I will be acquitted of all charges.
COL2JXS' STATEMENT.
AttorneyT5eorgeÂ»D. Collins says the
special committee that condemned
him yesterday was prejudiced, being
composed of his personal enemies.
Failing, to get a-fair hearing, he says,
he declined to submit evidence. He
gave out the following statement' last
night:
By reason of the foregoing matters the com
mittee on grievances recommends to the asso
ciation. that it institute proceedings before the
Supreme . Court for the dlsDarment of Mr.
Collins .for his conduct in the particulars speci
fied, and. that the president of the association
be authorized and directed to appoint a com
mittee of three to conduct such . proceedings in
the name of the association. Respectfully sub
mitted. . â¢
