not two ' hours before, on the steps of

who had recognized his fellow- visitor

Volborth laughed gayly.
sclous of a merited Innuendo. This
scarcely perceptible emphasis was one
of those baits which he habitually
threw out In the course of his wily fish
ing; but, keenly as he wa toned, he
could "'detect no sign either that the
American or the Princess rose to It.
Not by the quiver of an eyelid did they
show that they possessed the knowledge
which Volborth disclaimed, much less
that they suspected him of implying
that they had It. â¢ *
Olga Palitzin was toying with a Jew
eled paper-knife, and with It she
stabbed playfully at Volborth.
"Of course you know nothing of such
things, Paul," she laughed. "How
should you, when Colonel Delaval is
probably right, and there Is nothing to
Know? But come, let us discuss some
thing more interesting than vulgar fry
like Nihilists and police agents. "What
fun'you will have on the journey, Paul!

for them both v to be of the suite? No

v Volborth raised his eyebrows and re
garded her with a significant smile.
No social rumors escaped him. and well
he knew that the, fair lima VassJH had
.found her. cause of Jealousy already
"in the beautiful woman who spoke
thus lightly of her betrothal to the
Tsar's handsome aide-de-camp. The
Imminent breach between the two
affianced members of the royal house
hold, owing to Dubrowski's sudden in
fatuation for Olga' Palitzin, was on
every' lip. Volborth had already taken
steps to test the depth of that infatu
ation by ascertaining that the captain
informed curiosity about the topic of
the hour, and the Princess chiming in
,with light persiflage, t
v She was a striking personalityâ the
Princess Olga Palitzin, daughter of one
of Russia's noblest ' houses. Though
she must have been fully, twenty-seven
years of age, she had kept a rare, al
most childlike, freshness of complex
ion. Her features were fine and clear
ly cut, and her face knew how to vary
Its expression according: to the feelings
she wanted to show. She had soft, full
lips, nnd steel, blue eyes that gazed in
tently and yet gave no sign of how
much they could comprehend. . . . -
All her movements were graceful, and
she had a singularly even voice, that
produced a strange, Impression. It was
exceedingly soft and melodious, but at
the same time. so- quiet and indifferent
that ,it seemed as if Its /owner could
never love or hate.'j or- indeed feel any
intense emotion^ The Princess, being
to the manner born, moved in the, very
highest of Petersburg isociety, and she
was equally at home in Paris and
Vienna^ffl^BB -
"You" will >have to behave yourself,
you haughty - Paul," said she . in â¢ her
Parisian manner, but still speaking in
Russian. '.'They . tell me that the tour
will be little better than a progress of
policemen, .with our august sovereigns
as a.- centerpiece. The name of the
Third Section man in charge has been
kept .very, dark, but a little bird whis
pers me that it is Restofski who goes
in command of the army of spies."
i Volborth ; nodded a careless assent. ,
. "I : know ' it Â¦ to my. cost already," he
said,- with* a grimace of amused disgust.

friendly familiarity to the new-comer.
held bis ground. He did not Intend to
be hampered with a companion on leav
ing the room.
The young officer's usually bright and
handsome face waa clouded as he
grasped the hand of his hostess.
"I am desolate, my dear Princess," he
began. "I have only ten minutes at
your disposal, and, alas! I must use
them for saying farewell!"
"What! you do not dine with me to
night?" exclaimed Olga, and for once
Volborth thought* he could catch a
metallic snap In her generally even
tones.
"Unfortunately, no," replied Duhrow
skl ruefully. "His Majesty has com
manded the attendance of an extra
ald-de-camp this evening, and I am
next for duty. I cannot help myself In
such a case, as you know. I can only
obey â and hate my luck."
Polite usage offered only one course
to Volborth. He rose and took leave of
the Princess, with a cheery Au revolr
to Dubrowskl, who was, however, far
too perturbed to care about or under
stand his meaning. Olga's adieus were
abundantly civil, but they were spoken
with a rapidity that scarcely veiled the
satisfaction she felt at his departure.'
"I must take advantage of this
change of plans," Volborth said to him
self as he closed the door behind him.
'"Whatever object she had In asking
him to dinner to-night she will en
deavor to gc.n nowâ in the next few
minutes."
He cast a quick glance up and down
the corridor, and after taking half a
dozen steps toward the hÂ»ad of * the
staircase, quietly went back on the
tips of his patent leather shoes to the
door. It was veiled with a heavy por
tiere, and, , gliding behind the velvet
folds, he applied his ear to the panel.
down a corridor hung with priceless art
gems to a curtained door which the
senior servant' flung wide, at the' same
time announcing the visitor. ''
,: "Ah,. Monsieur Volborth, truant and
man of bad faith. So at last, after
many days,* you . deign to visit .poor
roe?*: was the playful greeting accorded
him by a lady " who- carhe forward with

"Only five days, Princess," said Vol
borth, raising the hand to his lips with
easy gallantry. "But you are right-â to
me, at any rate, the days have seemed
as years." Here-he became conscious
that the room had another occupantâ a
man standing at one of the windows
gazing down the street. Volborth had
the knack of seeing without looking,
and -â¢. he ?: added quite . naturally, and
,wlthout ; allowing his hostess to per
ceive that the sight of that silent flg r
ure was the cause of the addition, "I
Aave^.beencvery busy,- and I am only
here now* because I am come to make
my adieus.'.'
"You are leaving Petersburg, then?
Ah! gaj- one/for Paris, without doubt?"
said the Princess with no. more sem

."For Paris later; but to-morrow for

due to. what was,' as It stood, an Inter

into; a -ripple of merry, laughter.

"To ascertain that, my. Tarasch, was
the object of 'my Invitation" to him,"
said Volborth to himself. ; He trusted
this man implicitly, but it was charac
teristic of him that not'tili an hour be
fore he started would he confide the
fact of his own approaching departure.
He placed a sprls: of gardenia'ln his
button-hole, flfeked a' speck of 'dust
from the silken lapel of his /rock coat,
and, taking his hat and *. cane from
Tanisch, descended; into the street.' No
one would have. dreamed that the well
groirmed Russian. "gentleman of the
modern ]" type'^, was Â¦' -'the
most trusted agent of the eec'reV police,
starting on the fltst- stage of the most
terrible ever confided to
man. In age, perhaps, nearlng -forty,

trained mustache, and, with a face
showing, to a marked j degree, when, in
repose, the impassive coldness of his
race, he would never have been credited
with his most deadly . attributes-f-an
alertness that never slumbered, a swift
ness that struck sure, and an, Inexor
able, disregard for feeling- that never
spared. Â¦
In a word, Paul Volborth's success
had hitherto been due to "a devotion to
duties for which, by temperament. and
choice, he was pre-eminently fitted.
Had he loved his work less, he would
still have done his work well from
sheer ability; wedded to.it as he was,
he became the most potent factor in .the
councils of the Nihilists, ; who had, to
make allowance in all their schemes for
an unknown forcethat seemed ever In
their midstâ penetrating ',thelr .." secret

, To such'a man the sensation of being
"all at sea," and that at such a crisis
as the present, with? the Emperor's life
depending on his- knowing the set of
every undercurrent, came as a' bracing
nerve-tonic. "While dressing, . he had
rapidly surveyed the
combinations in the capital, and he had
decided not to fritter/ away his few

explored. Rather would he act on the

' ] CHAPTER L
THE EVE OF DEPARTURE/
â rVEXERAL GRAXOVITCH. the
I / chief of the Russian secret police
; Wj âthe dreaded "Third Section"â
' \u^ 6at writing in the private room
â¢ of his bureau on the Nevski Prospect.
A busy man always, he was busier than
, ever that day. On the morrow his im
perial master was to commence the
tour which for months had been the
talk of Europe, and on Ivan Grano
vHch's shoulders Ia7 the responsibility
. fcr the safety of the young Tsar and
his stately bride.
' Presently the general laid .down his
pen and touched a hand-bell on the
desk.
"Has Volborth come yet?" he In
quired of the official who answered the
summons.
"Monsieur Volborth Is in the wait
ing-room. Excellency," was the reply.
"Send him in."
*. The man who entered the chiefs
J room a minute later was apparently a
peasant â a typical Russian moujik, un
kempt and ill-clad. A mass of tangled
â¢ hair framed and nearly concealed his
fare, and he carried a greasy elieep
skiji cap in his hand. But as he
I crossed the room to stand before the
desk his step was confident and lissom
â by no means the cringing: jjait that
Â¦ might have bepn expected from his cos
â¢ tyme. Moreover, he did not smell of
Vtfki.
The chief leaned back in his chair
. and smiled approvingly.
"Really, my dear Volborth. I must
â¢compliment you on your perfect pro
tean-facility for disguise," he said.
"VVhy,.you must have spent hours on
â¢â¢ that make-up."
"It is the penalty I pay for having to
. do most of my real work in my own
personality. / General," was the reply.
. spoken in cultivated accents. "My
value to the section would be largely
i; discounted if I were recognized cross
ing this threshold."
"I know that," said Granovitcb, "and
it is a credit to your Ingenuity that to
the wc-rld at large â above all, to that
smaller world with which we are con
cernedâyou are still Paul Volborth,
iiterary trifler and favorite of society.
-But to business. I should like to be
favored with your final view of the
situation."
"I find no Indications which Â¦would
â¢"warrant the canceling or postponement
of- the imperial journey," replied Vol
borth. "There Is a total absence of
movement end excitement in suspected
circles, and outwardly everything
points to a quite abnormal state of
calm. If I were to say to his Majesty,
'Don't go!' I could put my finger on no
tangible reason for the warning, and
yetâ I am very, very anxious, General.
. 2t .is this deadly stillness among the
gentry of the knife and bomb.- It Is
unnatural."
Granovitch stroked his Iron-gray
beard thoughtfully.
"There was movement and exdte
Â¦ ment enough two months backâ in
June," he said, after a pause. "And
â¢ nothing apparently to account for It.
<Jan it tave been that plans were made
.and schemes laid then which are to
bear fruit now? It has before crossed
. my mind that that may have been a
bogus agitation, designed to furnish a
reason for the disappearance of dan
gerous characters whose work Is only
Â¦: cow to begin â outside our jurisdiction."
, "That view necessarily presents it
| self; but as you know, diligent search
by our agents abroad has failed to find
these persons," replied Wolborth. VWel
etskl, Serjov, KraEnovitch, and Anna
Tchlgorin have, to all seeming:, van
ished from the face of the earth. And
Dlinitri Petrof, the arch-plotter, and
formerly most active of those still in
St. Petersburg, is as quiet as a sucking
dove. He is perfectly open In his com
ings and eoings. The closest watching
has failed to trace him to suspicious
company, ot to saddle him with the
dispatch or receipt of treasonable, let
'ters. In this connection. General, an
idea occurs."
"And that is?"
"That they have appointed a new
executive head â some Individual
.against whom no breath of suspicion
has ever blown, even from this office,"
said Vclborth earnestly. "If they were
contemplating a grand coup, it would
have been quite worth their while to
. reorganize specially for the purpose of
biffing us. It would account for Pet
rof s present quietude. In order to let
the blow come from an entirely unex
pected quarter, be may have surren
dered his authority to unseen hands,
possibly even remaining In ignorance
â¢ of details, cf subordinates, of every
thing."
"That Is a startling theoryâthat of a
new gang of the utterly unsuspected,"
exclaimed Vie chief, rising and pacing
the room uneasily. "Unceasing vigi
lance over their Majesties* persons
'could alone save them tronv such peo
ple. And I have not only to protect
their lives, I must epare them the hor
ror of an attempt. How can we coun
teract such a danger. Volborth, pre
suming it to exist?*'
"I have already endeavored to coun
teract it," was the reply. "That is to
Fay, for a month past I have made a
point of suspecting every oneâ entirely,
I repeat, without result." â¢
For over a minute there was silence
In tha room, and then Granovitch, halt-
Ins euddenly, faced about and ' con
fronted Volborth, who was still stand
lnar by the desk.
"My friend." he said, "there is no one
. CpHIS is the first Install
ment of "By a Hair's
I Breadth," a novel of rare
interest just at the present

-world are focused on St. Pet

the Czar in constant jeopardy
. and. how marvelously he is
safeguarded by the dreaded
. "Third Section."
Setter fitted for this task than your
self. You must accompany his Majesty
as the chief agent of the section,
though not openly as such. Existing
arrangements will stand. Restofski
will act as the visible head of the po
lice who are to travel en suite, but hÂ«
Â¦will be at your orders. He is absolute
ly to be depended on, and lias done
good work under you before. You BhaJl
go In the character of official historian
of the tour. That will be in keeping
with your avowed occupations." .'â¢Â¦
"I am at the disposal of the section,"
said Volborth ' calmly. "I should wish
to stipulate that my real capacity is
known to as few erf the suite as possi
ble â say, *o Prince Lobanof and the
chief aide-de-camp."
"A wise precaution, and It shall be
attended to," said Granovitch. "I will
send for Restofski at once and explain
the situation to him. For yourself, it
might be well if you took a last look
round."
"I Bhall be busy between now and the
hour of departure, to-morrow," an
swered Volborth significantly. "I shall
see you before we leave? Good!. Then,
for the present, farewell. General."
The moment he was over the thres
hold of the private room his gait
changed to a shambling slouch,, in
keeping with his dress. Passing
through the antechambers and hall,
he bowed crlnglngly to several officials;,
who were well aware of hts high posi
tion in the section, but who treated
him to the stony stare, and in one or
two instances to the curse, they would
have accorded to the genuine moujik.
It was not likely, but it was possible,
that even within the precincts of the
bureau there might be sharp eyes pry-
ing on those whose one duty it was to
pry. r_..*v .
Volborth passed through the swing'
doors on to the broad flight of steps
that leads to tfiestreet level, and half
way down he met- a man who was as
cending with the evident intention of
entering the building. The one glance
that Volborth shot from under his
shaggy, false eyebrows told him that,
the visitor to the section bureau was
neither a Frenchman nor a Russian,
his somewhat "loud" tailoring: being
more suggestive of a British or Ameri
can tourist His complexion' was florid
almost to redness, and his clean-shaven
face was Ijroad and good-natured,
though, as he stopped and accosted Vol
borth, the latter, Was conscious of a
curious dilatation of the smiling eyes.
"Sa, can you inform me if this is the
American consulate?" he inquired,, in a
language and accent that left no doubt
as to his nationality. â¢ : .
But Volborth, who, Jspea king six lan
guages like a native/, understood' him
thoroughly, merely shejok-hls head, And,
grunting inarticulately, proceeded on
his way. With a shrug of his shoulders
the stranger entered the > 'swinging
doors and was lost to view. '.
"There is either a" very guileless or a
very deep specimen of the traveling
Yankee,", muttered Volborth/. as he
loitered a '.little .way. off . to x see ; what
would happen.' \"A moujik, especially
one of my forlorn' appearance; would
hardly be expected by a pane person to
speak English. . I wonder how soon he
will discover his mistakeâ If mistake It
was. Ah! he has been .already enlight
enedâand shown the door."
For the American had reappeared on
the top of the .steps in the company of
an official, who by his gestures was evi
dently pointing out the desired direc
tion. Having apparently thanked his
informant, the seeker for the^Consulate
came leisurely down, the steps and be
came merged in the, throng of foot
passengers on the pavement.
"Let me see." said Volb'orth to him
self, "old Bratski is on duty in the hall
of the bureau. He may be trusted to
do the right thing and verify that
'error.' Ah! that is .well; there goes
the shadow." 'j: J ~ â¢'* '--.
A pondescript individual had come
out of the buUdins and had followed
in the direction taken by the Ameri
can. Having satisfied himself that the
spy of the section had picked up the
trail, Volborth shambled on, and, pass
ing Into the poorer quarter of the city,
dived at length down a. dark alley,
where he entered a wretched house that
was little better than a hovel.
He remained but a short time within,
for the house was only one. of several
lairs he kept in different parts of the
city for the purpcÂ«e of changing his
disguises when on his way to : or from
the bureau. When he came out It was
by a back exit leading Hto another
alley behind, and now it was in the
garb of a petty shopkeeper that he re
traced his way to more aristocratic re
gions. So much store did he set on
preserving the secret of his. connection
with officialdom that he always took
the precaution of a double change be
fore approaching the bureau.
His own residence, where he lived
openly the life at Paul Volborthâ man
of birth, man of fashion and man of
lettersâ was on the Michael Strasse,
and even here he went through the
pantomime of ringing the bell and par
leying with the confidential servant-â
himself an agent of policeâ who opened
to him. Had watchful eyes been on the
master of the house they would have
seen nothing but a shabby tradesman
applying for admission that was tar
dily granted.: :/
Once inside, Volborth hastened to his
dressing-room and set about metamor
phosing himself into his own proper
person preparatory to- the "last 'look
round" suggested by the i chief of the
Third Section.' While donning: the
clothes of a -Russian gentleman, he
busied his brain with mapping out the
few hours at his disposal.
"Yes," he: thought, as he surveyed
himself in the glass, "the fair Palitzin
must have a visit. If some seemingly
more Important ones are left unpaid.
â¢I am due to offer her. my respects so
cially, even were there no other reason.
Bah! it isn't a reason,' and yetâ I don't

abruptly quitted the salon. .
The effect of his abrupt departure
was that Volborth and lima were left
confronting each other, the mald-of
honor looking-ttlightly flushed and tri
umphant, the police agent bland and
smiling. Volborth was at a loss to ac
count for.-her demeanor, but he had no
intention j of remaining so. Neither of

suspected that the little scene just en
acted was the commencement of a

Like a pike at a gudgeon. Dubrowski
snapped at the proposal, and promising
to keep the Prim-ess informed of his
movements past and future â especially
future â lie drifted Into the common
places of a wild flirtation. Volborth
kept his 5tction behind the portiere till
sounds of final farewell warned him
that it was time to go.
- "It all fits in." he said to himself as
he descended the broad staircase to the
street. "If I am right in my views, she
is using him as a tool â as an innocent
reporter of the imperial movements. I
should be justified in making a repre

went on, with increasing earnestness.
"This Is even more important. Where

"How delightful! It will add a xest

with enthusiasm.
"Oh! but that will be splendid!"
cried Dubrowski, Jumping at the pro

"Listen, then," Olga proceeded, and
her tone was unusually Impressive.
'â¢"You must write me a full account of

CHAPTER IL
THE EEG INNING OF THE PERIL.
It was the morning after the Tsar's
arrival in Vienna, and the rain splashed
down in torrents on the excited citizens
who thronged the broad Ringstrasse
and surged right up to the gates of the
Hofburg. According to the programme
of festivities the Russian monarch was
id be present at a grand review on the
Schmelz parade ground, and the
drenched sightseers never dreamed that
the potentate of the icy north would be
prevented by "a little weather" from
attending the function.
Inside the palace, however, a rumor
already prevailed that a postponement
Â¦was under discussion by. imperial host
and guest. The ladies and. gentlemen
of the Russian suite, a brilliant bevy
in Parisian millinery and gala uniform,
had gathered to await the summons to
the carriages in the grand salon of
the wing In which they were accommo
dated, and they were discussing, the
situation as one in which they had a
very personal Interest.
"I am sure I hope that this delay
does mean postponement," remarked a
lady of Imposing appearance but rather
silly expression, who sat on a divan
fanning herself vigorously. "I would
willingly lay down my life for their
dear Majesties, but I cannot afford to
ruin my clothesâ and yours, my childâ
for them. That Worth toilette which
you are wearing cost twelve hundred
rubles, lima, and It will be a long
good-by to it if the review takes place
to-day."
The little feminine grumble was ad
dressed to a tall girl in a magnificent
costume of dove-colored silk who was
standing at an adjacent window, gaz
ing down into the rain-splashed court
yard. The speaker was the Countess
Vassill, one of the three ladles-ln-wait-
Ing who had accompanied the Tsarina.
The younger was her daughter lima,
the Junior of the same number of
maids-of -honor.
The girl to her mother with
a little laugh, and there was a note of
.'nervous tension in her voice as she re
â¢ plied:
"What is a dress more or less if one
can get a few hours' excitement? We
have been cooped up for days In the
Train, and now it seems that we are to
spend our stay in Vienna shut up to
gether like animals in a traveling
menagerie â Russian bears, for in
stance. I am sure I feel like one."
"For heaven's sake, child, do'not let
any one hear you talk In that fashion,"
said the horrified old lady, looking
round in trepidation. "It almost
amounts to treason. Besides," she
added with a giggle Intended to be sig
nificant, "you have an antidote to en
nui alu-ays at hand." And she prodded
a stubby forefinger toward a group
where Boris Dubrowski was chatting
with his brother aide-de-camp..
"One is not a housemaidâ to be al
ways hp.nd-squeezing with one's be
trothed." replied lima coldly, as she
turned azuln to the window with an
impatient shrug. She was not an un
dutifu! daughter, but she did not look
to her frivolous mother for sympathy â
"May I request, then," Volborth pro
ceeded, "that you alter the duty-roster
and assign him to close personal , at
tendance on his Majesty? .., The affair
Is urgent." ' -
The chief of the staff made an im
passive motion of assent. It is part of
the iron system of police domination
that demands made by the section, no
matter how apparently irrelevant, shall
be executed by all departments without
demur or cavlL' This one, however,
wa| so out of the common, as affecting
the private entourage of the. Emperor,
that Prince Lobanof, secure, in' his high
station, could not repress his surprise.
"Eh 7 What is this. Monsieur "Vol
borth?" he exclaimed. "There Is
nothing wrong with the staff, I trust?
Surely j&\ our fellow-travelers are
above suspicion?"
"This la rather a measure of precau
tion than of suspicion," Volborth ' re
plied evasively. "I have no, cause to
doubt the loyal Intentions of any mem
ber of the suite, but I must rely on my
privilege not to go further into my rea
sons for this stepâ oven with your Ex
cellency."
Prince Lobanof indulged In the shrug
which Russia has imported from Paris.
and his shrewd features assumed a
whimsical expression.
"You gentlemen of the section must
be paramount on an occasion of this
kind." he said. "As I have to meet the
Austrian Foreign Minister In half an
hour, I shall be glad to go to my room
instead of congratulating the ladies on
the reprieve of their millinery. Do it
in your own wayâ at : -ur own time."
The three men bowed as the holder of
the most Important portfolio In the
world 'passed on to his apartments, and
Volborth' turned instantly to the chief
of the staff.
"General'," he said hurriedly, "I. shall
be obliged if you will announce the
postponement of the review to our col
leagues. Present yourself In five min
utes, and, if I may suggest a hint,' en
ter hastily, as though fresh from hav
ing audience of their Majesties. At the
"Tljat is so," replied De Boisdeffre.
"That must be it," said lima gayly.
"M. Volborth Is shamming a devotion
to^duty. I shall tell him so at the first
opportunity."
Within the limits of his knowledge â
for none but the Tsar. Prince Lobanof
and General de bolsdeffre. the chief of
the staff, was aware of Volborth's real
functionsâ the court chamberlain was
right. At that moment the chief agent
of the Third Section was- very much
imbued with "the cares of office," nor
was there any need for him to diksem
ble a devotion to duty. He was in the
act of leaving the presence of 'his
sovereign and of the Emperor of Aus
tria, and with him were Prince Lo
banof. General de Bolsdeffre and Res
tofskl.
"Thank God for that," said the For
eign Minister, as he closed. the door of
the imperial sanctum, after "backing"
into the corridor. "And thank God for
the weather which furnished the ex
cuse. He would never have taken
heed of our vague alarms If it had not
been for the rain. I will convey to. the
suite the probably welcome intelligence
that tlie review has been countermand
ed till to-morrow, and that the fine
plumage of the ladies is safe."
The veteran diplomatist, hale and
vigorous as a man of forty, started at
his best pace for the part of the palace
apportioned to the guests, but in a
few steps VolbortH overtook him.
"Pardon me, your Excellency; but
there is a slight arrangement which I
should wish. to make before the suite
are Informed of the change," said Vol
borth. "General," he added, as the
chief of the staff and the ostensible
head agent of the Third Section joined
them, "I believe that in the' ordinary
course Captain Dubrowski would be
free for the rest of '. the ' day, now that
there Is no public function?"
heavily upon him."
"Olga Palitzin is Â¦welcome to him.
She has bewitched him, and she can
have him," lima said to herself a hun
dred times a day.
Some such thought was in her mind
now as she stood waiting, but it was
interrupted by a" burst of well-bred
laughter from the group of officers.
"Come, gentlemen. It is not fair on
such a dull day to keep a Joke to your
selves," the- Cc-untess Vassili called
over -to them. "Pray let us share the
cause of your merriment."
"We were counting heads to see If
we were* all here " said one of the aides
de-camp. "With the exception, of
course, of the grandees now in solemn
conciave assembled, ; and the ubiquit
ous Restofski. we find that Paul Vol
borth Is the only absentee. Some one
suggests that he has been sent for to
try and re-arrange matters with the
weather."
"Ah, very good â very good, indeed,"
laughed the Countess. iTou are mak
ing sly hits at the dear Paul's persua
sive powers, but you would not do it
to his face. He- would turn the Jest
against you." " .
"I think M. Volborth has gone off
rather, lately." said lima, joining in
this as in every conversation from a*
desire not to attract attention to her
private troubles. "It is sometimes diffi
cult to recognize in the grave, preoc
cupied historian the socisfble dilettante
of our Petersburg drawing-room. I
have been studying him and puzzling
over him ever since we left home."
"The cares of office, mademoiselle,"
said gray-haired Count Woronzoft, th*
court chamberlain. "As soon as a man
receives a government appointment a
little abstraction is pardonable. If he
have it not he may even feign it â to
make believe that his duties weigh
eimply because Â«ne knew, that she
would not get it All through the close
association of the long railroad Journey
from Petersburg, it would have been
patent to any ordinary maternal in
stinct that a widening breach existed
between lima and Dubrowski â that the
erstwhile fond lovers were drifting
hopelessly apart. Yet the Countess
Vassili was too busy chattering court
gossip and prattling of "their dear
Majesties" to notice that Boris held
himself, when possible, sulkily aloof,
and that Ilma's proud heart was up in
arms against such treatment.
Since her mother could not, or would
not see what was happening before her
eyes, it was not possible to one of
Ilma's self-contained character to en
lighten her. That would come too near
whining to harmonize with the boiling
Indignation that consumed her, and
the felt that it would be quite time
enough to confide the situation to her
mother when the breach became an
open one. For the present she was de
voting all the effort of a naturally
strong will to control herself, and so
avoid the contretemps c-f /breaking her
engagement to Boris during the Impe
rial tonr. Yet she was fully deter
mined to give him his freedom when
ever he asked for itâ and without wait
ing for him to do so, as soon as they
were back at Petersburg.

hilist plot, or some other abomination."
Inwardly anathematizing the old lady
for thus frivolously connecting , : him
with a subject which he had studiously
striven to. keep .altogether out nof the
mouths and ; minds .of . the suite, -VoH
borth was, nevertheless, grateful to , her
for the information' that a change In his
manner had -been noticed. He \ deter
mined to. put . a little stronger .check
on his anxieties in future, and his fa
cial muscles were under perfect control
aa he answered lightly, with a humor
ous affectation of terror: I
"My dear Countess, 1 pray do not make
such frightful accusations . when our
friend Restofskl is about. It is well he
is not here now, or. I should be dogged
by spies for the remainder of the. tour;
and that would not be pleasant in
Paris, where I hope to '. enjoy myself.
If you must invent an occupation for
me, why not choose ;the other side of
the blanket, and tax.me with belonging
to the section? That would be so much
kinderâ because saferâ to -th'e object of
your solicitude."- # .. Â¦ Â£
This speech, characteristic enough of
the man as he was known to his hear
ers, was a straw thrown out to feel^the
direction of the wind, and its reception
reassured him that no serious discus-
Â¦ame time notify Dubrowski that he Is
for immediate personal . duty. It is
necessary that I myself should be in
the calon where the suite Is assembled
when these instructions are given, and,
of course, we must not, go in together.
Restofskl, your work - is j cut out for
youâ a ceaseless hunt for La Tchlgorln
under the auspices of the chief of the
Vienna police, who, by now. Is await
ing you at the office." |
For it was to the known presence In
the city of Anna Tchlgorin that the
postponement of the. day's function was
really due. Restofski had caught a
fleeting glimpse of the notorious fe
male Nihilist in the crowd at the sta
tion during the reception on the previ
ous day, and now for half an hour, the
Tsar's advisers had been striving to in
duce him to consent to seize upon the
rain as an excuse fora change of pro
gramme. Their hard- won victory over
imperial scruples was a relief, to Vol
bcrth, for the knowledge that the hand
some fiend. â¢ who had shot already a
Russian chief of police, was In Vienna,
convinced him that some, sinister plot
was afoot, and he felt that in his ig
norance of the enemy's plans he would
best baffle them by changing their own
as often as possible. Besides/ he
wanted to try an experimenL
"Unless a neglected woman's watch
ful eyes have discovered something
that has escaped mine, and that Is at
least possible," he reflected. "If that
Is so, her action may have a more se
rious meaning. She may have wished
not only to save Dubrowski, but to pre
vent some design in which she believes
him to be implicated."
Twist It as he would, he could come
to no definite conclusion, and, putting
the matter from him for the moment,
he went out, and taking a fiacre, drove
to the police office, where he sat till
late in the afternoon receiving the re
ports of the Austrian and Russian de
tectives who were searching the city
for Anna TchigorJn. Kla lieutenant
Restofskl, was the last to appear, with
news of complete failure.
"The one conclusion is that we have
got through the day without an
'event," " he said. "The agents who
have been in personal attendance at
Lain* have noticed nothing suspicious.
His Majesty has Just returned to the
Hofburg, and he should be safe there.'*
"H'm. You forget the Russian chorus
this evening;." replied Volborth
thoughtfully. '"I wish that Franz Jo
sefs international courtesy could have
spared ua that anxiety."
"Do not make yourself uneasy," said
Restofski. "I contrived to get a sight
of the names of our fellow-country
women who have been rehearsing, and
I have since seen them all personally.
They are perfectly satisfactory."
There was to be a concert in the
evening In the private theater of the
Hofburg palace, and the allusion was
to a feature in the programme about
which there had been some misgivings
in the minds of those responsible for the
Tsar's safety. The performance .was
to commence with the singing of the
Russian national hymn by Russian
ladles resident in Vienna.
It being time to don evening dress,
the two colleagues returned separately
to the Hofburg, Restofskl to snatch a
hasty meal preparatory to marshaling
his agents for the court function, and
Volnorth to attend the dinner of. the
Austrian and Russian suites which pre
ceded it. At the table he perceived that
lima was, or affected to be, in excep
tionally high spirits. Her fair face
locked radiant. She rallied Boris on
his unexpected turn of duty, as If there
were no cloud between them: she chat
tered of her experiences In the art gal
leries; and she even addressed Vol
borth in a breezy vein which sug
gested that the incident of the morning
was forgiven or forgotten.
Yet in all this gayety there was a
feverish note which, taken In conjunc
tion with one other point, puzzled Vol
borth not a little. He noticed that
long after they were seated, whenever
a servant entered the room she cast
furtive glances at the door as though
she were watching for some one who
never came: and this was the mar*
strange becaruse. with one exceptionâ
not to include the higher officers ef
state dining with the imperial party
all the members of the suite were pres
ent. The one exception was Restofski.
"What can the beautiful enigma
want with my worthy colleague?**
mused Volborth, as for the twentieth
time her eyes sought the opening door,
to droop suddenly when only a servant
entered.
At the close of dinner thÂ« Russian
guests, together with the Austrian
suite, were ushered by the court cham
berlain to' the concert hall of the pal
ace. The stage at the trpper end was
as yet veiled by the Venus and
Adonis act-drop; but as the brilliant
throng trooped In, the electric lights
were turned up, showing the walls
gayly decorated with flags, and the
floor converted Into a fairy-land of ex
otic plants and flowers. .The front row
of chairs nearest the footlights, â re
served fc-r the imperial party, was va
cant. The other seats were quickly
filled by the expectant courtiers.
Suddenlyâ sign that Franz Josef and
his visitors were about to enterâ the or
chestra glided into the sweet strains of
the Austrian national anthem, and the
curtain rose slowly, disclosing the la
dles who were to sing the Russian
chorus. They were ranged In two rows
"You are a clever woman, Made
moiselle lima." said Volborth to him
self, as he looked after her. "But,
though I do not as yet see what you
are playing for, I had the best of that
encounter. There was no mistaking the
genuine ring in that indignation, and
It told me at least that Jealousy of the-
Palltzin was not the cause of your
eagerness to take that tfelesram from
him. I must think this out. my dear
young lady. I imagine that you are
about to become a potent factor In our
complications."
He left the salonâ already half de
serted by the members of the suite â and
sought his own room, where he pulled
a chair to the window, and lighting a
cigarette sat and gazed at the now
dispersing crowds in the Ringstrasse.
Not till seven Brown stumps lay In the
ash-tray at his elbow did he arrive at-a
solution that at ail satisfied him.
"That must be it." he muttered, as he
rose and paced the floor. "She loves
him. despite his treatment of her, and,
suspecting that I am of the section.
she must have been sharp enough to
attribute the changed duty-roster to
my machinations. In that case, her
anxiety was not to get the telegram
for her own purposes, but to prevent
me from gettlns It for mine."
But then, in partial refutation of this
theory, the thought occurred that, even
if lima knew for certain that he was a
police agent, she would not have cred
ited him with a special Interest In
Boris Dubrov.-skl unless she had reason
to believe that her faithless lover de
eerved such Interest. It seemed In
credible that she should have found
such reason.
the telegram that It waÂ» not Impor
tant, I am spared an unnecessary trip
to the Borsenplatz. True, it may hava
been of more Importance to the- In
tended recipient, but to oblige her I am
not concerned."
A deft pass â with feminine Jealousy
for the blade â and it struck home.
"Her!" exclaimed Ilina. "Youâ you
saw the address, then?"
"Yes, I caught the name. It was the
Princess Palltzin at Petersburg."
lima bit her ripe red lips till thÂ«
blood came, but Volborth had no scru
ples about giving pain when It suited
his purpose, and, noting her discom
fiture, he pursued his advantage. .--Â¦* 7
"Possibly," he added, "that fact cre
ated the dilemma from which Captain
Dubrowski extricated himself so clum
sily Just now."
His end was gained. He had mads
her angry.
"I do not understand you, monsieur,"
retorted lima hotly. "It you Insinuate
that I offered to take the telegram be
cause I desired to embarrass Captain
Dubrowski, you simply insult me. I
had a very different reason." "With

Volborth, beaming a genial assent,
stretched out his hand for the paper;
but before . he grasped it, though his
greedy eyes had noticed the address
and the. words, "Review postponed till
to-morrow," in the. body of the tele
gram, lima yassili glided between
them. Â¦ t . ' '
"Why-Ttrouble Monsieur Volborth,
Boris?" -said the girl quietly. "I am
going out- at once' to visit the Art Gal
lery, and shall be pleased to do this
business for'youl*'.
â¢Politely bowing, .Volborth stood aside
with the air of being agreeable to
either ourse, as In truth he was, for
he had successfully applied his test and
had ascertained by it that Dubrowski
was keeping his promise to communi
cate changes of programme to Olga
Palltzin. But for Dubrowski himself
the situation was a difficult one. and he
colored to the roots of his hair. It
would be churlish to refuse the service
offered by lima, who was still his affl-

3sion is necessary, and it would be Im
possible by telegram to put Granovltch
sufficiently In touch with the undercur
rents to make his advice of full value."
"Go on," said the Prince. "Place me
In a position to Judge, and I will say
how I should act if I held your office.
I can do no more."
So Volborth gave, in what, If taken
down, would have formed an excellent
precis, the dry bones of his discoveries,
of his proofs that Boris was being used
by Princess Olga as an Intermediary,
of the anonymous warning which could
only be the handiwork of lima, and of
the latter's probable penetration of his
own proper functions. He contended
that, though as yet he had no direct
evidence' connecting Olga Palitzln with
known bad characters, after that
night's affair they were no longer
groping In the darkâ that the presenta
tion of the letter. Introducing Anna
Tchigorin by Dubrowski, in conjunction
with the latter's infatuation for the
Princess, confirmed his theory.
Here Lobanof interrupted. "I am
with you in that," said the Prince, "but
it passes my comprehension how you
first came to pay attention to the Prin
cess Palitzinâ with the fortunate re
sult of finding her with that suspicious
American, and of overhearing the ar
rangement with Dubrowakl."
Volborth smiled slightly at the Min
ister's grip of details. He knew well
that Lobanof had laid his -finger on
what, if it had not been for the event
of the evening, would : have been, the
weak spot in the fabric which he was

here, Volborth," he added more briskly
after a pause, "why not give the young
man a chanceâ for the sake of the girl?
Tell himâ I will do it, If you approveâ
what have already been the conse
quences of his Infatuation for the Pal
itzln, and warn him that he is in dan
ger of losing his liberty and his life.
He would be likely to turn round and
hate her, and crave Ilma's pardon, if
the Imbecile knew that he was simply
being .used as a tool."
"That is quite true, your Excellency,"
replied Volborth coldly, "but I â¢ want
him for a tool myselfâ to lead me to the
others." V "j < J*VÂ«
"To his own undoing, poor devilâ and
the breaking of that true heart," com
mented Lobanof with a deprecatory
shrug. ' '
"The Third Section is not concerned
with such matters," Volborth returned.
"And there is the question of publicity.
â¢In his present frame of mind Boris Du
browski'is in the nature of a high ex
plosive, and . to tackle him openly In
that way might lead to a revelation of
the Tchigorin | attempt, which It : Is Im
perative to spare the Tsarina. He
would never believe that the Princess
was incriminated without proof,, and
we could scarcely furnish him 'with
that without throwing the fat in the
fire."
"That consideration outweighs the
others," Lobanof reluctantly assented.
ments Volborth made his â¢ way to the
wing occupied by the suite and en
tered the grand salon. In view of the
mjlitary spectacle to be held in the,
piorning, and of the commencement of
the long railway journey to Kieff, he
expected to find that most of his fel
low-travelers had retired to their
fooms, and in this he was right. There
were only two persons in the salon. Not
by the quiver of an eyelid did he show
any emotic/n, but they were just the
two people in all the world whom at
that moment he would have least ex
pected, and most wished, to find to
gether and alone. Facing one another
from either aide of one of the huge fire
places stood Boris DubrowEkl and lima
VassilJ.
Volborth always half cynically' de
spised' himself when he had to prac
tice the epy'a most degrading . duty-r
that of .eavesdroppingâ and he was,
therefore, not sorry that both saw him
before he had taken two steps from the
door. But in that brief interval he had
been quick to note- that their attitudes
and' expressions were the reverse of
lover-like, and he shrewdly suspected
that he had interrupted a "quarrel. Di
rectly Boris 'saw who the ; newcomer
was he burst into a fit of laughter more
jeering than mirthful, and Volborth at
once, conceived the idea that he himself
was the cause, j or at least the subject,
of their bickering. /
"See! here comes this terrible schem
er," cried Boris boisterously. "Come in,
Paul, and face the accusation that
mademoiselle repeats against .you.
Know then that she insists that you
are a police spy, and that you have
evil designs upon.myselfâ aye,, that you
maneuvered me into duty to-day as
to 'have the handling of .that .telegram-
Refute the charge, monsieur, or prepare
to. meet me at the' point of the sword."
.Volborth affected '.-, unrestrained
before a third person, and that person
the very man against whom she was
setting him on his guard, she was ytt.
for the sake of not exposing her hand,
willing to retract her words. He knew
. well what a sacrifice that meant to one
of her nature. But though he could ad
mire, he would not spare. The quarrel
must be fostered at all hazards.
"My dear mademoiselle, pray do not
take me Beriously," he laughed, â¢"or,
for the matter of that, our dear Boris
either. I never dreamed but that you
were making fun of meâ both of you.
I am well aware that the nature of my
scribe's duties makes me fair game for
all you courtiers and soldiers. But
talking of police agents. I Just now
heard a good thing about Restofski at
the concert. .It was told me in confi
dence, so If I regale you with It, It
must not go further."
lima hafl shown signs of leaving the
salon, but at this she leaned again
against the fireplace, scanning Vol
borth'3 face with eyes that strove hard
not to be startled.
"Let us have it, Paul," said Boris,
with a carelessness that was unmis
takably genuine. "We shall not com
promise you by making it public."
**You are neither of you likely to."
chuckled Volborth inwardly, as, with
all the aid of imparting a Joke at the
expense of one absent, he proceededâ
"A few moments before the overture
commenced, Restofski, who as usual
was hovering here, there and every
where, was In the concert-hall, when a
footman brought him a letter which had
only Just been delivered at the palace.

to whom the Countsss Vassill. already
seated with lima at a distant table, waa
beckoning frantically.
Another day had passed, and the long
Â¦hadows from the Wavel hill were
merging Into the darkness of the night
as the imperial train, preceded by its
fiery herald, the pilot engine, thun
dered past the Kosciusko monument
Into the ancient capital of Poland. No
sooner had the long line of coaches
come to a standstill In the station
than there began a general exoclu3 on
to- the platform, for opposite the word
Cracow in the carefully prepared Itin
erary was the magic legend, "Stop for
dinner."
Though the station was surrounded
by a cordon of Austrian cuirassiers.
Restofski and his subordinates at once
encircled the great green and gold so
loon In the center of the train, for thÂ»
Tsarina being fatigued by the Vienna
festivities, the Imperial couple had de
cided to have dinner served la tha
train. Volborth. however, was com
pelled by his undefined position to ac
company the hungry crowd of his fel
low-passengers who trooped Into the
waiting-rooms, where covers had been
laid for the suite. Had he been free
to choose his course it would still have
been the same. His usefulness at pres
ent was to be measured by his propin
quity to the Junior aide-de-camp, and
Intrigue had not yet damaged that stal
wart young soldier's handlness with
knife and fork. â¢
The remainder of the Vienna visit
had passed off without further alarms
or discoveries. The postponed review
had taken place that morning on the
Schmelz* parade ground, the Austrian
cannon had thundered, and the squad
rons had galloped past, the sovereigns
had driven to their final parting at the
terminus, and nothing had occurred to
mar the completion of the programme.
Not th*it tfTe"ab3ence of visible danger
brought any relief to Vclborth's anxie
ties. With the capture of Anna Tchi
gorin he believed that the peril was
scotched for the moment, since It was
not probable thcU more than one at
tempt had been prepared for Vienna,
but in his mind 'was ths conviction that
it was only the first of a series In
which each* scheme would be more
subtle than the last.
THE WALK IN THE WOODS
CHAPTER IV.
"Captain -Dubrowskl takes Jest for
earnest," she said. "He is
after attending his Majesty, aild he Is
In ill-humor through not having met
with good sport. I was but playing
with him when I bade him beware of
trusting you with hi3 correspondence."
Volborth could, not help paying a si
lent tribute to her nerve and clever
ness. Vilely as her betrothed had Just
treated her In laughing at her warning
amusement at his m.ockr heroics, and.
adapting his tone to the young: aide-de
camp's mood, exclaimed:
"What!, would you challenge a mem
ber of the Third Sectlori who is on your
track fc-r the most mysterious. crimes.
That would indeed be a novel manner
of dealing with the section." Then
turning to lima. In whose proud face
disdain and faar were struggling for
the mastery, he said with theatrical
solemnity, "If you have made this
charge, mademoiselle, I shall have to
meet him. Politeness would not per
mit me to refute anything you had said,
however I might wince under it."
Intuitively he grasped the situation,
lima had been warning Boris against
him, and. the warning having been
first scornfully rejected, was now being
ridiculed before her face. This suited
the line .upon which he meant to work,
which was to divide the two that Ilma's
influence upon his future dealings with
Boris would be reduced to a dead letter.
Whether the girl guessed his Intention
or not; she made a gallant effort to
frustrate It.
"Follow, thÂ«>n." said Frickhaus
"The performers who have arrived are
in their dressing-rooms. I think that
I can manage as you wish." And he led
them swiftly :x-ur.d to a spot whence
they had a back view of Anna Tchi
gorin through tho alley formed by the
two wings. At the same moment the
last note of th*> Austrian hymn died
away, and by the sudden darkening of
the stai'c- they know that the curtain
had fallen.
"Now, If we. are skillful we <*n haXe
'her out without the others knowing."
whispered Volborth. "No ecu filing, if
it. can bo helped." And gliding be
tween the wings U? the back of the
woman, he clapped his hands ovrr her
mouth while Restofskl threw his pow
erful arms round her waist and lifted
" her bodily off the stage. 'With quick
intuition, opening the door of a va
cant dressing-room. Kerr Frickhaun
signed to them to enter, and the cap
ture was complete without a soul but
those engaged in it bring the wiser.
"Up with the curtain, and let the
chorus begin at once." said Volborth.
And in his anxiety that no apparent
hitch should occur in the performance,
It was not till the director's 'departure
was followed almost immediately by
the Bdemn cadence of the Russian
hymn that he turned to the scowling
woman in Restofski's arms. The cur
tain had not been down twenty sec
ondf.
"Well, Anna! Is it pistol or bomb?"
he asked quietly.
The woman, to whom he was hitherto
unknown as a police agent, preserved
a swllen silence; but her bare bosom
'heaved, and the paint with which she
had encased her Bwarthy features was
all raddled Into streaks by the cold
Â«weat that had broken out. The ter
ror of death or of that weary road to
Siberia was upon her.
Restofski, after a deft pass or two
pver her clothing v.ith his left hand,
produced the required information and
the weapon Itself â a small but ser
" viceable revolver loaded in every cham
ber.
"Bo that was to have been the
method," said Volborth calmly. "You
had better remain with her here, Res
tofskl, till the close of the concert. I
must get back to my place before my
J absence oxcites remark .and afterward
I will return and investigate. By the
way, I will take that letter. It was an
anonymo-us warning, eh*"
"Yes," replied the other, proffering
the letter. "It exonerates me from
laxity, for It appears that this she
.devil was added at the last moment."
Volborlh nodded and went out, stop
ping, however, under the nearest lamp
to read the letter, which was as fol
io- we:
"For God's sake beware of the extra
singer who to-day was allotted a place
In the Russian chorus."
The envelope was addressed to Res
toftki at the Hofburg, and had been
posted in Vienna the same afternoon.
No direct indication of the sender
could be gathered from the writing.
' which was printed In capitals, but Vol
borth smiled 'grimly as he noted the
evident Intention of the disguise.
"Ah', these clever amateurs," he mur
mured. "The deduction Is. of course,
that the writer'3 real hand is not that
of a stranger." Hastening on toward
the "front" of the hall, he met Herr
Frickhaus, and in passing urged once
more the necessity of absolute silence
till they should have conferred together
the moment the concert came to an
end.
AMONG THE UNDERCURRENTS.
Volbcrth's action was prompt and
fure. Risking the disclosure of his real
position â though, fortunately, most of
the audience were too intent upon the
high personages to notice himâ he
slipped from his place and made for a
.side door which obviously led behind
the scenes. During the instant that his
gaze had been directed at the stasre
Restofski had disappeared from the
auditorium, but on pushing open the
door he found his lieutenant In earnest
colloquy with the court musical direc
tor. As soon as he saw his chief. Res
tofski's brow cleared.' and he came for
Â¦'ward to meet him. proffering the dls
lurbin- letter. Volborth waved it
aside.
"I can guess the contents of that."
he said, and turning to the musical di
rector, he added, '"Is it arranged to
drop the curtain at the end of the over
ture, Herr Frickhaus? No? Well, see
at" once that it is dropped, please.
Those are the last bars, I think, and it
is of vital importance. There is a
dangerous i haracter upon tho. stago,
whom I must remove â without noise or
publicity, you understandâ before the
Russian chorus is sung."
The direct tt happened* to possess
presence of mind. Beckoning to sn
assistant, he pave the required order.
and turned again to Volborth. who in
etantly proceeded:
"Conduct us to the wings at the rear
"cf the right hand row of singers as
you loc-k from the audience. I wish to
attract no attention if it Is possible."
CHAPTER III
At that moment the audience rose in
their idarcs and turned in respectful
homage to the central lane up which
the tall figure of the Austrian Em
peror ivzs seen advancing with the
queenly Tsarina on his arm. and the
j;ale young Tsar escorting the Empress
behind. Volborth'fl glance swept from
them to the stage.
There, at ihe far end of the right
hand n.-w of gtasenC in such a position
that when they wheeled inward she
would be in the center of the line im
mediately opposite to. and not ten feet
from the Tsar, stood a handsome
woman, at the sight of whom in that
place even Volborth's Iron nerve
quailed. Like the others of the chorus
this singer was in evening dress, and,
holding the rhusic score before her, she
kept her eyes demurely downcast â ex
cept for one brief flash, as the Imperial
personages nearod their seats.
Elaborately disguised as she was with
blonde wig and false complexion, it was
only by the eyes that Volborth recog
nized her â the fierce eyes of Anr.a
Tchigorin, the Nihilist.
facing- each other on either side of the
stage, and It was known that at a
Riven signal they would wheel toward
the footlights till they formed or.e line
facing the eudienee.
At ths moment of the raising of the
curtain, Volborth frc-ni a chair at the
extreme end 0/ a row was watching
Rcstoftki, who, leaning against enc of
the columns at the side of the hall,
was In the act of taking a letter from
a footman. Turning his eyes to the
supeiior attractions cf the stage, Vol
â¢borth's gaze was Intercepted and
brought back to his subordinate by the
right of lima, who, sitting two rows in

horror at Rcstofskl. The latter's ex

foundation of all. As â¢ was he felt his
foundations secure. ' ' *
"Chiefly instinct, your Excellency."
he resiled. "But there was one little
matter â five years ago â tnat set me
thinking, perhaps. Her. portrait' was
found among the belongings of a sus
pectâquite a humble personâwho was
afterward condemned^ and transported
to Siberia. I was ncverable to estab
lish that the Princess had any acquaint-'
ance with this map and it would have
been easy for him to have purchased
the portrait. Cut there was the chance
that a # great lady might have had a
secret lover of low birth."
â¢"And you do not throw away
chances," said the Prince. "Well, what
Is your proposition about Dubrowski?
He deserves Siberia at leastâif only for
hiB behavior to "sweet lima 1 ." ,
"I doubt not that SIbarra wiil be his
portion In the end, but, briefly, my in
clination is to let him rui> loose for the
present," replied Volbortli. "1 know
that this courss has its dangers, but
to arrest him. even to let him see that
he Is distrusted, would have greater
ones. 'We 'know "now wnere to lay our
hand on the connecting link between
the directors and tha active agents of
the plot. With - Dubrowski out of the
way we should be fighting the air. and
doubtless .they would soon find another
medium for gaining information."
"You- d_esire ihen to give him rope

ersâPoor lima! Cunctur-tlne VassilJ
"I could echo your Excellency's wish,
for I fear that there will be none too
much bed for me during the next two
months," Volborth replied. "I, bring
serious news. Anna Tchigorin, armed
with a six-chambered revolver, was
taken on the stage of the concert-hall
to-nightâ in the nick of time." And he
went on to narrate the circumstances
of the capture, and the steps he had
"Well, stormy petrel!" he cried,
throwing down his pen. "What does
this fere-bode? As a man you are wel
come, but If you are come in an official
capacHy. I would much prefer that you
went to bed."
The old statesman was writing at
the table, with a plethoric dispatch
box open before him. A dreaded mar
tinet in his own department, and un
bending in his relations with foreign
chancelleries, he was all suave urban
ity to those not under his actual con
trol. There were not wanting some â
and they were those who knew him
best â who believed that his genial man
ner was not all superficial, and .who
credited him with a kind' heart. : *
"I can understand that he would do
to," said Volborth. "The other occu
pants of th,e box wers listening to
your remarks, eh? An elderly gentle
man, who was Count Woronzoff. our
court chamberlain, and two ladies, one
massive and approaching sixty, "the
other young and very beautiful, shared
a box v.ith Dubrowdcl last night. I
think. Well, you havp greatly en
lightened liie. Heir, and I do not know
that I need trouble you further beyond
asking you to send to the chief of
your police, requesting him to come to
*the palace without delay."'
It transpired that the director had al
ready taken^this precaution, end that
Colonel Eckerstorf was waiting with
impatient curiosity to learn the causv
of the summons, the discreet Frick
haus having been true 10 his promise
to preserve absolute silence. At the
brieX conference that ensued between
Volborth and the Austrian chief of po
lice, it was arranged! that Anna Tchi
gorin should be conveyed at once, se
cretly, to the central prison, and be
there detained till the Tsar should have
returned to Petersburg, when her ulti
mate disposal could be decided between
the two governments.
Leaving the removal of the prisoner
to Colonel Eckerstorf and Restofski.
Volborth went out and despatched a
cipher telegram to the chief of the
section at Petersburg, reporting the
capture of Anna Tchigorin, and re
questing that a watch should' be set
upon every movement Of Princess Olga
Palitzin. He added that he had rea
son to believe that the Princess was
pulling the strings of a conspiracy in
which there were many members, and
that, as it was desirable to detect and
capture the others, he did not recom
mend her arrest at present.
It was ten o'clock when he returned
to the Hofburg, but late as was the
hour for the transaction of business, he
sent in his name to Prince Lobanof
with an urgent request for an inter
view. The Rus8ian Foreign Minister,
for the convenience of frequent consul
tations with the two Emperors, was not
lodged with the inferior members of the
suite, but had his apartments close to
those of Ihe Tsar In ihe private wing.
Volborth was able, therefore, to ap
proach them without exciting the curi
osity of his compatriots, and he gained
Instant admission.
"Yes. I thought It only courteous? to
Captain Dubroweki to inform him cf
ihe nature of the miEslv?," replied the
director. "He did not appear sur
prised or interested. In Tact, he cut
rhort rr.y explanations some v, hat curt
ly"
"Quite soâ very naturally," said Vol
borth dryly. "I expect to find, however,
that the introduction was a forgery.
May 1 ask if you alluded to the con
tents of the letter before leaving the
box?"
"That Is really the only point ou
which I need trouble you, Herr," re
plied Volborth.
"It was like this." Frickhaus pro.
ceeded. "Last night, as you are aware,
there was a srala performance at the
new or>era-house. where I also hive
oiT.cial duties. Between the first and
second acts an attendant brought me
word that an effieer 1 of the Russian
suite wished to see me on business, and
I went ud to the box indicated. When
I presented myself, a young officer, who
gave his name, if I remember aright, as
Captain Dubrowski. handed me a letter
of whose contents he professed enthn
Ignorance, but which he had been
asked by a friend In Petersburg to de
liver in person. On opening it then and
there I found that It contained a re
quest from the Impresario of oiÂ»era In
your capital to engage a Madame Gre
goHvIcfl to sing in the Russian chorus
before theii Majesties. Her address
was not stated, but the letter informed
me that she would call upon me the
next morning, which she did. Being
short c-f the requisite number of voices,
I engaged her, thinking that the intro
duction was above suspicion. Mure
over, I considered that, being delivere.d
by one of your Emperor's staff, it
reached me through a. channel which
practically vouched for Iier."
He resumed his seat In the audito
rium just as the choir of Russian
ladies was singing the last line of their
nauVnal hymn. The occupant of the
neM seat chancing to be an Austrian
officer, much too etarchlly polite to
show interest In his temporary ab
sence, he was free to pursue his work,
which just then consisted of a close
study of lima VasslH. Still deathly
pale, and slightly leaning forward, she
kept her eyes fixed on the stage, but
as soon as the last of the curtseying
performers had retired she sank back
in her chair and her shoulders heaved
visibly. A minute later she was chat
ting gayly to her neighbor. â¢
"That sigh of relief was eloquent,"
thought Volborth. "Her feverish ex
citement and anxiety about Rcstcf
skl at dinner â above 'all her recent ter
rorâpoint pretty plainly to the author
ship of that letter. If I am not in er
ror, we shall find our Boris at the bot
tom of te-nlght's episode."
The attempt on which, for that oc
casion, the devices of the <?:iemy had
been concentrated having failed, he sat
but the remainder of the concert in the
full assurance that there would be no
further danger that night. In the
knowledge that Anna Tchigorin was
safe in Restofski's charge he even
managed to enjoy every Item of th2
splendid programme, and joined freely
in the well-merited applause that
greeted the efforts of the artists. But
as soon as tho Imperial parly had re
tired, having firt.t accompanied the
members of the suite from the hÂ»'.l. Ij2
slipped back and found Heir Frlek
haus welting for him.
"Your first question v. ill be how I
came to engage that woman?" said the
musical director ss he led Volborth In
to hi3 private room abutting on the
stage.
Volborth went out, well pleased with
the result of the interview, for he had
carried his point in the face of greater
opposition than he had expected. There
is no doubt that he honestly valued the
sage old Minister's advice, but it is
open to conjecture whether he would
have sought It if he, had not desired to
safeguard himself by Imparting his
confidence to some one high in 'author
ity who would be able to testify to
his good intentions In the'^ event of. his
policy of "letting Dubrowski run
loose" bringing about the very catas
trophe which he was straining every
nerve to prevent. That there was a
risk of this" he was aware, but it
seemed a lesser one than" losing touch
of the conspirators, and he never for
gpt that he was charged not only to
preserve the lives of the Tsar and Tsar
ina, but to save them the horror of
knowing that they were dogged by
desperate criminals.
On leaving Prince Lobanof 's apart-
"You are a ruthless player,* Voibprth.
but it is the right game, I grant, to
sacrifice the pawns to save the Queen.
Yes, in your, place I should do the
same; though I imagine that I should
pity the' pawns' a little more than you
do, my friend. Have It your own way â
and good-night."
And gnawing his gray mustache, the
Frince took up his pen anil resumed his
work, little thinking that in allowing
his devotion to the Empress to van
quish his private sympathies he had
sealed his own fate.
"Yc"j have done we!!." he said. "The
delicate' condition of her Majesty's
health makes it of paramount impor
tance-' that she should be safeguarded
from alarm. It would be terrible if an
hejr to the throne were born under the
influence of fear. But tell me. Vol
borth, is this only the beginning of
tnuble? Is this sword to hang over us
at Breslau, at Copenhagen, at Balmoral
and Paris? Have you reason to suspect
an organized plot? By heaven!" added
Ihe Prince, with growing excitement,
"you don't mean to say that your
maneuver with the aide-de-camp this
morning had a bearing on Tchigorin's
attempt*- Surely the betrothed of my
c-!d comrade Constant Ine Vassili's
daughter is not mixed up in treason ?"
"That i/ why I ventured to consult

fashion of raconteurs, looked from one

but none with the rlsht ring in it was
forthcoming. lima, it is true, laughed
perfunctorily, but Dubrowski'a goad

almost a direct accusation. Then, per
ceiving that. his wrath was calculated
to disclose his personal interest in the
matter to Volborth, he muttered * sul
len "Good-night" and stalked out of the
saton.
From their reception of his narrative
of the supposed hoax Volborth gath
ered several points: First, that Boris
had not noticed the disappearance of
Anna Tchigorin from the stage, and.
therefore, presumably did not himself
know her; secondly, that lima was till
then quite in the dark as to her warn
ing having been attended with any re
eults; and thirdly, that her look of
horrsr on seeing Restofski open the
warning sprang from the fear that It
waa being delivered too late to be rf
service. It all tended to confirm hla
theory that she had sent the warning
immediately after the Incident of the
telegram, her quick wit having supplied
In the introduction of the new singer,
of which she chanced to know, a possi
ble cause for the police surveillance un
der which she believed Boris to be.
And now for the second time that day
the police agent and the mald-of-honor
were left confronting each other with a
sense of war between them. Volborth
thought that he had gained hia end.
and that by exploiting his revised ver
sion of the event of the evening 1 lie had
widened the breach between the former
lovers.' It waa not his cue to affect to

It Ilma's entirely to Ignore it.
"Boris has really had a trying day:
he does not seem quite him3e!f to

own apartments.
Volborth sprang to open the door.
"Do you think so?" he said. "It
struck me that he seemed exceedingly
full of youthfulâ what shall we call
them?â high spirits."
lima made no reply: and there wa3 no
sound In the great chamber but the
swish of her court train as Volborth
preceded her to the door and flung it
open, bowing low as she passed him.
Then suddenly she turned, and. looking
him squarely In the eyes, seemed to be
searching his nether soul.
"You are a clever man. Monsieur Vol.
"borth, but I believe that I understand
you," she said. 4
"And you, mademoiselle, are a clever

"Bessie Bell," a little child's story,
from the pen of Martha Young, Is as
sweet a 'tale for little tots, as "Cap'n
January" or "The Birds' Christmas
Carol." It has to. recount how a little
girl was caught in the fever grip down
South somewhere and how In the rigors
of quarantine and isolation she became
separated from her mother and was re
moved to the kind haven of a sisters'
hospital. There, when she had recov
ered and found herself in the company
of other little boys and girls, she had
to learn all over again a great many
things she had known before the fever
came; but she did not learn that she
had a mamma until the last, and that
was the best of all knowledge. The
story Is written with admirable con
formity to the measure of a child's
understanding and is prettily illus
trated by Ida Dougherty.

IN "The Admirable Tinker" Edgar
Jepson, the English writer, .has
drawn a picture of the twentieth
century "enfant terrible" which is in
parts exceptionally diverting, and for
the rest somewhat tiresome. The story
is a strange mixture of the real and
the extravagant In its concept At one
minute the remarkable boy whom Jep
son has chosen for his hero will be in
dulging himself in the perfectly normal
exercise of playing the matador, to the
discomfiture of Squire Alloway's goat:
at another he will be flying across the
English Channel by night in an air
ship. This wonderful child, with the
head of a man, is a nice, companion
able little fellow as long as he keeps
within the bounds of his twelve sum
mers, but once he begins to talk about
pounds sterling as If they were coppers
or to 'propound his theories upon the
married state in its possible beneficial
effect upon his sire, the admirable
Tinker becomes a most impossible brat
and one not at all acceptable, even
upon his own standards.
Jepson's story has its inception with
Sir Tancred Beauleifh's discovery 'of
his Infant son in a baby farm of un
savory atmosphere, where he had been
placed at birth by the discreet step
mother of the youthful and irrespon
sible Sir Tancred. The young blood
takes his starved and brow-beaten

It happens that King Sylvaln; whose

free life. So he takes his good Queen
Aimee and together they fly the palace,
garbed as peasants, arid follow the for
est paths Into the very deeps of, the
woods where all chance of capture is
defeated. There In this new and beau

OU1NTUS OAKES, the detective
extraordinary and sleuth incom
parable, is the veriest tyro ct
his trade judging by the lights accord
ed him by his indulgent creator,
Charles Ross Jackson. For when Quin
tus Oakes sets himself to the solution
of a mystery where he is combated ac
every turn by foes that are possessed
of a full quota of knavish tricks and
where secrecy must be the all-essen
tial prerequisite of success, what does
he do? Why, first he takes with him
on his still hunt two greenhorns, a
lawyer and a doctor, whp feel the need
of a vacation and who are consumed
with a desire to see how the wonderful
Quintus Oakes, premier of crime de
tectors, works. Then, when he has ar
rived at the scene of the shrouded ter
ror, he takes into his confidence the
local constable, surely a man well cal
culated to assist in the unraveling of
mystery. Before long he makes him
self known to a negro and another in
consequential Individual who runs the
local news sheet. Then, with "five rank
outsiders acquainted with his plans,
more or less, and endeavoring, each In
his amateurish way. to be of assist
ance, the king of ferrets gets down to
business. All this is very enlightening
to one not conversant with the "way.?
that are dark" employed by police
spies.
The mystery that has to be brought
to light in this "Quintus Oakes" of
Jackson's has much to do with secret
passageways, double walls and trap
doors. A cloaked figure, with a mask,
who wears, so Oakes deduces, nothing
above the waist save a linen mesh un
dershirt when on murder bent, has
much to do with certain unaccounta
ble happenings. An elaborate system
of night flashes with a dark laptern
keeps the quarry and his confederates
in touch with one another. Oakes is
so rapid of movement that he can light
a cigar and have it half smoked before
a stuttering man could say "Jack Rob
inson." AH these wonders and many
others are to be found In this wonder
fully fantastic book.

A SLEUTH
of F^are* Stupidity.
NOTHING brings so poignant a
feeling of unrest and regret that
there should be such thing as
years and seasons that carry you on
and on as the reading of a book such
as "Stony Lonesome." by Arthur J.
Russell". Mr. Russell is not the first to
write about the day when the boy Its
king; from Tom Sawyer and Huck'
Finn right on down to the recent re
freshing stories about "You" in one of
the monthlies the halcyon, heroic age
of youth has livedvin song and story.
This latest is as full of charm as all
the others. Crown-ups never tire of
being carried back to the time when
they were called "Daring Dick" or
"Rob Roy." and lived in a dismal cave
between meal times.
Stony Lonesome is a sleepy New Eng
land village, inhabited by a "gang" of
boys, with here and there a parent or
an "Uncle Ellery" to give a background
to their pranks and plottlngs. The
picture which Mr. Russell draws of this
town, with its quaint characters. Is
unique In literature. Nothing as graph
ic In Its character drawing, as sponta
neous in its humor, as vivid in its dia
logue has been written of a New Eng
land town. The story is unstudied and
absolutely devoid of pedantry. It is
bubbling over with good nature, with
the laughter of real boys and the irre
sponsible spirit of youth.

Charles Keener, the Berkeley poet and
lover of the beautiful, has come forth
as an advocate of the esthetic In home
building in hjs little book, "The Simple
Home." What he has to say on ths
subject of home, its housing and Its
environments, is in line with the grow
ing revolt against unsightly archi
tectural lines in house construction and
the steadily increasing sentiment
against all these turrets and shoddy
rococo work in our residences. In his
book Mr. Keeler points out the move
ment toward a simpler and truer art
expression in architecture now being
made manifest throughout California.
He urges a break from the convention
alized house which too often covers a
conventionalized home life; little things
in a home's environment which may
add mightily to Its charm he mentions.
Suggestions on the value of clinker
brick, shingles and plaster for exteriors
and wood and plaster for Interior deco
ration give his book a practical value.
It is good reading, because it carries
an appeal to every person who has an
eye for the finer things.

SWEET IDYL

SCRIBXER'S MAGAZINE for May

will surely attract wide_ atten
tion. "The Soldiers of the Valley." hy
Xelson Lloyd, is a tale of a oÂ«iau
tlful valley in a romantic region. Rare
ly is there euch a combination^ humor
and Dathos offered in a modern story.
The quaint characters with their wlae
saying and their amusing views of
life are mingled with the real depth of
feeling and abounding romance of the
young heroâ the one soldier of the
Spanish-American war In that region.
The tale opens with his reception on
his return to the valley. Each Install
ment will be fully illustrated by A. B.
Frost. The outdoor quality of the tale
and the rural characters who abound
in it. furnish Mr. Frost with the very
best opportunity for his genius.

John BassettMoore's second paper on
American diplomacy Is the most im
portant article in Harper's Magazine
for May. It deals with "Our System
of Neutrality." An Interesting fact is
brought to light by Mr. Moore relative
to the Alabama affair in 1862. It seems
that certain evidence against the vessel
was given to tha British Foreign Office
by, the American Legation in London.
The Foreign Office duly turned over the
papers to the 'senior law officer of the
crown. Sir John Dorney Harding. Just
at 'that time Sir- John was suffering
from mental trouble, news of which his
wife had carefully concealed. 1 Â»-Â»"eving
that it would not last. With "peace
arid*war and the fate of nations" de
pending upon the decision on these pa
pers, they were laid asidt by Lady
Harding in her wifely anxiety to keep
her husband's condition secret. The
Foreign Office became alarmed at the
delay and took away the papers; but
it was too late. During the night the
Alabama had sailed.
Norman Duncan contributes another
capital article on the seafaring folk of
Labrador to the May number. Mr.
Duncan is the coming sea story writer
of whose work Frank Bullen said: "I
am absolutely certain that, with the
exception of Mr. Joseph Conrad and
Mr. Rudyard Kipling, no writing about
the sea has ever probed so deeply and
so faithfully Into Its mysteries as this."

the Booklovers' Magazine will find
much that he expects to find, as a
matter of course, in this magazine. He
will also find several pleasurable sur
prises. ;

JOHN T. McCUTCHEOX. the car
toonist, can do with a pencil
what Georg? Ade, the master of
slang, does with a pen. In his '"Chron
icle of Social Happenings at Bird
Center," recently published, the popu
lar Chicago artist has produced a sc
ries of fables as trenchant, as oddly
humorous as anything his confrere in
fun ever wrote. Where Ade catcher
human foibles by a trick of the tongue,
McCutcheon pins them to paper w ith a
quirk of the pencil. His single drawing
contains a story that could not be put
under 1000 words In Ade's argot. The
fun" in his work is even fresher, more
spontaneous than that of the fable
tellerâ perhaps because it has not been
ridden to death.
In his "Chronicle" McCutcheori di
vides the laugh between the cartoons
and the text. Each drawing 13 eluci

themselves, in whose praises 'Â¦-â¢â¢ are
couched. When one has visited with
these homely folk the Bohemian jinks

There is no doubt of General Charles
King's ability to write a story of ab
sorbing interest, even though he may
not employ the finest literary style in
the world. Remarkable, too, how he can
obtain so many stories out of the same
old "props"â boy in blue somewhere
where there is fighting, sweet young
girl of a susceptible nature, and the
heavy-handed villain. In "A Knight of
Columbia," h.. last book. General King
has departed somewhat from his usual
"Western atmosphere and has placed hfs
plot in N-w York and on the battle
fields of the Rebellion. Intrigue, mys
tery, the shuffling of destinies and final
happy adjustmentsâ these are the fea
tures of the novel generously applied
with the somewhat coarse-haired brush
of the literary general.
Though the title of the book would
seem to indicate a story of Columbia
College, that Institution does not figure
In the tale beyond the first chapter,
and it must be thought that both the
title and the brilliantly illuminated
badge of a national college fraternity
which the publishers have put on the
cover represent an inspiration coming:
from the hope of increased sales.

These two officers very freely stated
that they themselves had opened
valves in the ensrine and -fire rooms
with the object of sinking their
vessel. The fire aft, which had
been caused by the bursting of
a large shell among some boats and
hammocks, continued to spread among
the. woodwork of the decks, cabin, etc,
in the sections of the hull abaft the
mainmast, burning fiercely until the
vessel finally rolled over on her port
side and sank at 6:01 p. m. During
all this time there were frequent ex
plosions as the fire reached the ammu
nition that had been left on deck for
the guns, and just before sinking there
were two explosions of gun cotton or
other nitro powder, as I Judged from
the bright orange colored flashes. As
near as I could learn the Variag's
loss was 41 killed and 80 wounded, the
bodies of the former not being taken
off but went down with the vessel.
4. The Koreitz was not hit at all,
so far as I could learn. She held a po
sition between the Vicksburg and the
Zaflro; until 1:20 p. m. (during which
Intervals she never attempted to lower
a boat or make an effort to go to the
assistance of her consort), when she
anchored inshore of us. At about 3:45
p.. m./ she was abandoned by. her offi
cers and men in their own boats, and
went on board the Pascal, and at 3:57
p. m. the Koreitz was blown up. There
were two distinct explosions, both very
heavy, following each other In quick
succession, the shock so strong as to
lift the heel of the . Vlcksburr quite
' perceptibly. The Impression I had at
first was that our forward magazine
had blown up. Immediately following
this the crew of the Chinese Eastern
Railway Company's" mail steamer (that
had been used by the Russians as a
transport), which was scheduled to sail
this morning for Port Arthur, Dalny,
etc., set her on fire and then abandoned
her, going ' on board the Pascal.

Korea, Feb. 9.
â¢ Commander in Chief United States
Forces on Asiatic Station.
Sir: 1. Yesterday afternoon shortly
after 4 o'clock the Russian gunboat
Koreitz got under v.ay for Port Ar

Dolmi Island a lacge squadron of Jap
anese vessels was seen bound in. The
Â¦ Koreitz at once turned back and
anchored between this vessel and the
Variag. both Russian vessels going to
quarters. Part of the Japanese fleet,
consisting of four cruisers, six tor
pedo-boats and destroyers, convoying
three transports, came to anchor here
' shortly before 5 o'clock, the cruisers
outside the Russian vessels, with the
torpedo-boats bunched together Just
rihead of us, while a torpedo-boat
patrol was kept up all night between
the outer and inner divisions of the
squadron. Disembarkation of soldiers
â¢was at once begun and toy midnight
3000 men had been landed, 1500 tak
ing possession of Chemulpo and the
others going to Seoul. The move
ments of the latter force had been
arranged so as to arrive at the capital
with another force of 2500 men. which
â¢r^ad been landed on Sunday at Mas
ampho and marched overland. While
L have not been able to get any word
to-day from our force stationed in
fc'eoul, I am told by a newspaper cor
respondent, who managed to get
.through from Seoul this afternoon,
that the city is In complete possession
â¢of the Japanese, who, with double
posts of sentries at every corner and
with large patrols, are maintaining ex
cellent order. The same is the case
here in Chemulpo.
Â£12.' This morning at 7 o'clock I re
ceived the following communication
'from Rear Admiral Uriu. commanding
the Japanese squadron in these waters:
"His Imperial Japanese Majesty's Ship

of February, 1904.
"Sirâ I have the honor to notify you
that, as hostilities exist between the

Russian senior naval officer present at
Chemulpo to my demand to leave the

the 9th of February, 1904, and I re
spectfully recuest you to keep away
from m the scene of action in the port bo
that no danger from the action would

The above mentioned attack will not
take place before 4 o'clock p. m, on the
9th of February, 1804, to give time to
put into practice the above mentioned
request.

o'clock the Talbot's steam launch left
port, standing out In the direction of
the Japanese squadron. On the return
of the steam launch, after the engage

from the Talbot to the Elba was read
by our signalman: "Our letter of pro
test was delivered on board the Japan

first shot was fired."
6. At half neap tide a small part of
the wreck of the Variag Is just seen;
at high water the smoke band of the

but not tiring, as we foreign men of

when they gave up the chase and re
joined . their squadron outside. At
12:60 r- m. the Variag anchored about
200 yards to the northward and west

about 300 yards to the southward of

had. quite a number of wounded on
board I sent our medical officer and
a boat's crew on board to render as

Pascal (French).^, little later on, on
its being reported that the Variag was
in a sinking condition, two of our

and besides being official makes up
'. one of the most interesting accounts
of a modern battle viewed from j the
calm, cool, unexaggerating standpoint
â¢ of .one who is himself versed in the
' . science of the game.
â¢ â¢ In his simple way he gives a vivid
. description of the incidents preceding
â¢ the battle and the damage that was
â¢wrought by the Japanese fire, and la
. ter by the Russians themselves, and
how the men from the foreign fleet
Â¦ went to the rescue of the Variag's
"crew after they were abandoned by
the Koreitz.
. .This exceptionally valuable ac
count, which is a copy of the original
â¢ report, was secured exclusively, for
.The Sunday Call, together with the
" interesting pictures illustrating this
page, by Hiram W. 'Reynolds, an
Oakland youth, who is one of the
youngest gunners in the United
â¢iStates navy- Although he has served
two years he is not yet of age. He
witnessed the battle from the deck of
â¢ the Vicksburg, although, as he wrote
his father, mother and sister, who re
side in Oakland, he had never ex
pected to sec a' naval fight in all his
life.
When Captain Rotxdncff of the
Variag found that the Japanese ad
miral, Uriu, had bottled him trp be
yond the possibility of escape he ac
cepted the gage of battle before the
time fixed by the enemy, and with
band playing steamed out of Chemul
po harbor shortly before noon on
February 9 to engage the whole Jap
anese fleet. When he was eight miles
out, and long before the Variag's
6-inch guns were within effective
range, the two Japanese battleships
began to pound away with their 12
inch guns. In a' few minutes two
shells from Admiral Urines flagship
disabled two boilers, smashed the
bridge and gave the Variag such a
heavy list that her port batteries were
useless.
Ten large projectiles, besides a rain
of shrapnel, disabled the cruiser,
crippled the engines and set the ship
afire, besides killing and wounding:
in officers and men out of a comple
ment of 540. In this condition she
crept back into port and was later
blown up, and the photograph here
with shows how one of the finest
warships ever built, and which had
seen only eighteen months of ser
vice, now looks.
IT was one. of the most notable
battles in the history of naval
warfare that was fought by the
American-built, protected cruiser
Variag, of 6500 tons, and the slow
gunboat Koreitz, of only 1200 ton*.
The Japanese odds were two battle
ships mounting 12-inch guns* six
cruisers and twelve torpedo craft.
Against these were the Varia**Â»
twelve 6-inch guns and the almost
useless one 6-inch and two S-ineb. gans
of the Koreitz.

children coming up the street,' and
th"en the discussion of campaign plans
'would be momentarily interrupted by
the. general finding himself earried off
into the approaching crowd of Juve
"tiiles.
When General Lawton was recalled
to .Manila and Young continued the
advance, it was found Inadvisable to
'.taJsTe Billy back to the coast for two
reasons. First, the general must re
"turn 'by railway, and there were no
.boxcars in which to carry Billy, and
th.en Billy's period of active field work
was nearly at an end. Already well on
In- years, the vigorous campaign
through tropical swamps and Jungles
had taken the remaining elasticity out
of his- old limbs. So it was decided to
Jet him go on with Young's Third Cav
' airy as a sort of camp follower.
Lawton bade old Billy a sorrowful
good-by at the. railroad station: "Take
good care of him, sergeant," \vere his
last words. - '
Thus Billy ambled along in the wake
of the advancing army, nibbling here
and there by the wayside, dropping be
hind often, but always showing up
morning and evening when barley ra
tions were served out. In this way he
reached Vigan, where Young estab
lished his permanent headquarters as
military Governor of the northern
provinces.
Some months after this came ths
news of Lawton's death at San Mat<\>.
For days the fiagu were half-masted,
and some of the insurgent leaders even
sent In notes of sympathy. There was
genuine mourning all over the land.
In Vigan especially the sorrow was
deep, for the men there had fought
under Lawton. Their thoughts turned
toward old Billy, w^io had can led their
dead leader through the worst cam
paign of the war. They untied him
from the picket lines and led him out
into the plaza, and there gave him an
honorable discharge from active Â«er
vice, to come and go as he might please
about the town, on Government, pen
eion. Billy looked a bit bewildered at
first, but presently started off to ex
plore the streets, and as he passed the
men took off their well-worn campaign
hats.
After that you could see him wan
dering In a day dream. along the nar
row streets of Vigan or in the adjacent
fields, sometimes stopping to browse in
an abstracted sort of way; coming and
going when and where he chose, like
the sacred oxen of Benares.
At first Billy retained his simple,
modest bearing:. He rubbed noses with
his old comrades in the ranks and vis
ited the picket lines daily. He still
greeted all comers in his old spirit of
democratic good fellowship, from the
general down to the latest recruit in
the rear ranks.
But there came- a change. Gradually
it dawned on Billy's ponderous lptellect
that he had become pretty much of a
\>\% gun, that he wasn't/an, ordinary
plug to be met with any day, and he
decided to stand up for his social rank.
He began by refusing to mess with
the other horses. In this he gained
his point. The men made the .mistake
of submitting at once, and thus irre
vocably bound themselves down- to the
rulings of his tyrant will. They gave
him a separate feed stall
. Then he insisted on green grass,
mixed with oats, twice a day, and again
the boys bowed to his Will; Thence
forth a detail of men had to hustle
feed for Billy daily. Thus he had them
in" his grip. After that they badrto
humor, his every . whim. -' â¢ Â« -Â¦Â¦,Â«â¢â¢;
It was not long before Billy made
himself obnoxious to Americans and
natives alike. One morning he stalked
into Company E's mess quarters just
at mess tall. The bovs tried to per
suade him that he had sot Into the
wrong place, but Billy obstinately re
fused to take that point of view. In
fact; he got cjuite indignant, especially
when he ncse. about the big cal
dron of hot soup, which he upset, and
thereby split half the flimsy boards of
the floor. lie ended up by flopping
down. on u couiile of cots, which
splintered beneath his weight like
matchboxes. When he finally depart
ed, 'much 'disgusted, he left behind
him a week's /ob of repairing.
The natives made their firdt mistake
in offering Billy bits of brown sugir
und tufts of 'choice turnip leaves.
Finally he axew to consider ' thes?
dainties as his just due*, and when
they were not forthcoming at the mo
ment he wauled them he did not hesi
tate to walk into the stores and help
himself, not only to sugar and turnips,
but to any othÂ«r stock on'h.md that
pleased his fancy. . . . .
If you kept u store built of light
bamboo you v.-oulJ not like a big
cavalry horse to com? In and v/alk
about the place, sampling ypur goods.
The native shopkeepers objected, but
Billy never considered their feelings.
Ho did as he pleated, and if the door
was too femall he didn't mind widen
ing it a bit with his big shoulders. It
was no rare sight to aee Billy's huge
hindquarters protruding out of some
shack, his body corking up the door,
his head and shoulders lost In the in
terior, and his tail switching about
contentedly as he. helped himself In
side. You would know by the row
within that the owner was objecting,
but that made no difference.
This sort of thing soon became so
bad that whenever Billy was seen ap
proaching there would be a "general
scramble among the storekeepers to
barricade their doors and business
would be suspended until he had safe
ly passed.
Â¦ Only the. children regarded . Billy at
all favorably. Sometimes you could see
the old. chap stretched out under the
shade of a spreading mango tree, with
a dozen or more little .: brown tots
scrambling over his scraggy flank. Oc
casionally he would raise his head as
though in protest. /- > . '. ;
* "Look here, you scamps," you might
fancy him saying, "don't be too rough
or I'll roll over ' on you. Hey, , there,
you little black Imp; leave ray tall
alone; It wasn't built for you to pull.
Here,' get away from my mane. I want
to sleep, and how can Z with you walk-
Ing all over me?", :, *.>
â¢Whereupon he wouldt snort fiercely,
as ' though contemplating Bangui nary
vengeance, but It always ended in his
sinking hack with a .helpless blink cf
his eyes.' -..
â¢ Thus Billy passed the time In Vigan,
tyrannizing all -wilt whom he came In
contact; until one day there occurred
the crowning event* of his life.* Some
are inclined, from -a political point; of
view, to regard it as a lasting stain
upon his honor. They contend that
as an American born, as a pro-tege of
the Government, Billy should have con
fined his most intimate friendships
among his own people. At least, he
should not have ' formed the attach
ment cf his life with one of the people
at war with his country. But Billy
was too broad rninded to allow wars
to interfere vvitlr. his friendships. At
any rate, he began by striking up an
acquaintance with Perico de la [Crui
the ten-.year-old eon of a lieutenant in
active service in the enemy's ranks.
Perico's mother lived alone in a
small nlpa hut .in the outskirts of the
town. Her hut was constantly .'under
the surveillance of Government spies,
it being suspected that the insurgent
officer was haying; too frequent com
munication/with His wife. Innocent
of these dark suspicions that hung
over his home, Perk-o played in the
adjacent fields of zacate. Now Billy
was especially fond of zacat'c, and he
soon learned that the besl of its kind
grew about Perico's house, so he paid
the place frequent visits. Thus he first
met Perico. Evidently the two found
each other congenial spirits, for after
that they got to be seen together more
and more, not only in the fields of
zacate, but about the streets. As I
have said, dark mutteringa of disap
proval, perhaps, not untainted by a
spirit of Jealousy, arose among the
less liberal Americans, jt dldn't;lobk
well, .they said. - But Billy, was In the
height of his power, so he could afford
to disregard these protests.
This chance 'acquaintance .soon
ripened ihtodeep friendship. -The* two
become inseparable companions.' When
you saw Perico turn a street corner,
you' expected Billy, and sure enough
he would follow, not far behind. , Qr,
if you saw Billy's head .protruding
over, a fdn.ee you , knew, where to'.flnd
Perlcol When Perico ate his meals on
the /steps of his ; mother's;- hut, .Billy
was "there, munching zacate. '/Tliey
went' but for long trarhps together*,'? the
puny brown boy usually seated on. the
veteran's broad shoulders and (holding
his mane. No, one since. Lawton; had
dared to do that. The two did pretty
much as they ; pleased- -^7 Walked
through: people's fences, over, people's
vegetable patches, stampeded Â¦ people's
poultry, and' even sauntered over .the
lawn in . front i'of --the .'general's Â¦ head
quarters in spite of that great man's
somewhat feeble protests.
'"â¢â¢' The . colonel was j the only one who
ever*,' rose ; in active rebellion, but he
was 'ignobly* squelched. He was hold-
Ing a solemn review of his troops one
evening oh : the parade' grounds. All
was quiet, and it would have been ' a
most â¢' impressive ; review >if old Billy,
with Perico on.his back, hadn't stalk
ed along Just then, passing between
the colonel and the line of men at
company front.
1 It Is recorded that the colonel swore
a great oath.' That may have : attracted
Billy's attention, "'for he 'seemed to
ieeognlze the" colonel as an old ; friend.
He^went' iip 4 " to ,.him, r arid,. the cqlonel,
v ttr "save his â¢dlgnityj'' had to retreat to
the band stand. Â¦ ;'â¢Â¦ 'Â¦' ''.' : 'Â¦Â¦'.- /-.
Protest. was of no avail. If you spoke
to them Verico simply Shrugged his
shoulders and eald "No sabe," \ ahd
Hilly twirled an ear or winked an eye.
Them was little satisfaction in . that.
Then you felt that they chuckled to
pelher after you were gone.
Â¦ But tyranta are only mortal. These
two. were no exceptions. ' Â« Â¦â¢
One Jay a yellow flag appeared be
fore the house in Vigan in which Peri
co lived. It was the beginning of the
fearful epidemic, of smallpox, when
half of the families of the town and
province were affected; when the saf
fron tsls hung in listless folds before
many a hut and house. They said
that the insurgent officer had brought
the disease in from his camp, where it
sraged unchecked, on one of his secret
visit?/
The boy Perico tossed deliriously
on a bamboo cot while his sad-faced
mother arid a. sad-faced aunt nursed
hin>. A sentry was stationed to warn
people away from the quarantined
family. Billy calmly ignore'd him,
and walked to the open window, but
it was too high for him to look in.
How Billy felt. Just how much he
missed his little comrade, we never
knew, for Billy's long face wore an
expression of sorrow habitually, any
how. But there was an atmosphere
of painful abstraction about him when
he munched his evening allowance of
oats.
After a few days he ceased to haunt
the little hut on the, outskirts of the
town, and then we thought he had
forgotten. He even took up more with
other children i In i a general sort of
way, but not with any one in particu
lar. - : Â¦' .."'Â¦Â¦ -ih.Si-,
. For a whole week Perico had been
gone. . Even the American soldiers
missed the tiny "figure, and when it
was' reported that Lieutenant de la
Cruz had been seen coming into town
one . evening nobody troubled to re
port th'e matter to headquarters. '
It; was the eighth day of Perico'a
illness. ; The sentry in front of the
hut paced sleepily to and fro, or
thoughtfully contemplated the shade
of the near-by mango trees. ' Sudden
ly he .was by; a scream inside
the house, and the next moment the
form of a child shot by him down the
street.' :,:Â¦-, * '. . . â¢
: '-'Stop him! Stop him! /Stop him!
Senof Americano ;Â» â¢.wailed/ the dis
tracted mother, t ronv the* door, of, the
hut. 'But it was too" late. "With frantic
screams â¢ and wild ; gesticulations the
delirious I Perico ran ) down ,> the road,
naked'as he had come Into the world,
down into the Calle de Santa Ignacla,
into* the" Escolta, the .Â» main . street,
and.'> turned -. up, toward the- plaza.
Women screamed from windows and
the sidewalks, men shouted," but none
dared to seize the afflicted boy.
Suddeni y there \ was a commotion
farther down the Escolta. The crowd
scattered, and through' its center, old
Billy came pelting, *i answering, the
boy's .wild shouts, with a succession
of hoarse I whinnies. C At the; corner
of the: Calle" del. Oblspo .Perico â¢ turned
down toward the market, where the
streeferids, â¢ with Billy., pounding along,
not fifty yards behind. Into the mar
ket gates the boy disappeared, causing
The sergeant or Squadron A wta de
tailed to put him out of his misery.
The soldier's bare, brawny arm qulvw
ered a trifle before hÂ© fired.
AH that afternoon the dead -veteran
Jay In the market square while all
Viganâ soldiers, merchants, officers and
privates, women and childrenâ passed
by to take a last look at his familiar
figure. That night the full moon's
beams straggled through tha broken
tiles of the roof and flecked the old
market place. Only the dark, vagua
heap in the center remained in shadow,
and about it stood a circle of children
quiet, motionless, furtively clasping
each other's hands.
Those who have been In tha Philip
pines will never forget tha chant I of
the sorrowful. The singer improvises
a line, which he half speaks, half sings,
beginning low and rising until tha last
word Is lost In a long drawn out wall.
Then comes a pause of almost half
a minute, and tha next Una begins.
Thus did Billy's former playmates
chant a dlrga for him. A boy of 18
composed the lines and tha rest Joined
in the wall. The lines ha improvised
in the native Ilocano dialect, when
translated, went something like this:
"Good-byJ Billee, oh, good-by, oh.

the * wildest . confusion imonj the
throng of buyers and sellers. The
market is a square. 'walled In by stone,
with a door on each side of the quad
rangle. The crazed child shot Into
one sate and out- of another, and fell
in a fit in the street beyond.
Billy burst Into the crowded market
too late to see where his little com
panion had gone. For a moment he
stood in Its center under the tiled
roof, among the baskets and tables
loaded with wares, while the people,
American soldiers and FillDino men
and 'women alike, poured out of the
four' gates. Â¦ . *
Just what passed through Billy's
equine intellect at that moment will
never be known,, but evidently "he
hastily concluded that they were hid
ing Perico from him behind some of
the baskets or stalls. He began a
systematic search, overturning and
crushing earthenware Jars, baskets of
eggs and fruits, bamboo Joints- of milk
and racks of dry goods. The venders
had sense enough to get out and leave
their possessions to fate. Billy had
the entire market to himself; frantic
ally he pounded around and flound
ered about among the obstacles.
'Suddenly he paused. Above the roar
of the crowd outside he heard the de
lirious cries of the child he loved. He
stood still, his ears pricked up, his
nostrils dilated, quivering. Then he
made a swift turn toward the eastern
gate, whence came the cries. In doing
so he upset and burst a large earthen
ware jar of cocoanut oil, which spread
over the brick pavement. Billy's hoofs
slid, he slipped, fought desperately to
recover his footing, but fell,- rolling
heavily against a big stone pillar. With
frantic screams he tried to rise, but
again he fell helplessly back.
There remains little more to be told.

â¢j* Jf ANT men, most men in fact,
(\/\ stop Just short of being their
\Y I best, .selves. That Is" the
X.. pathos of human life. We
have in every community a fair sup
ply ,'of ainlable. Intelligent, Interest-
Ing, respectable men and women. There
is a vast deal of kindness and of good
ness in the world, filtering constantly
from one life to another. But along
with it we find life after life which Just
falls of attaining Its largest develop
ment and usefulness. One of the most
painful things I ever heard said about
a. human : being : was the remark of a
keen critic concerning an attractive
and 'versatile young woman: "She Just
misses being an -extremely nice girl."
He meant that with all her brilliancy
and virtue there was the absence of a
certain,", perhaps indefinable, but -real
trait . that would â¢ have made her a
charming and altogether lovable crea
ture. .â¢â¢*jÂ§BH2iKpffii
The cause of such arrested moral and
spiritual development is not far to seek.
Often the secret of it Is the compara
tively low and sordid ends tot which
a man is devoting' God-given talent
and strength. In commenting upon a
prominent American .who died not long
ago, one, of our comic papers, noted for
Its! frequent flashes of wisdom as well
as of wit, said saplently: "He. was a
.first-class - man with a , second-class
career.". It meant barring a brief
but extremely creditable period of pub
lic service, he had given himself to the
amassing of wealth and to the selfish
enjbyment'of It when it was in him to
do large and chivalrous service for his
fellow-men, to lead some great re
form movement in politics, to apply
his undoubted intellectual ability and
his. rare capacity for influence over
others to the solution of some of our
pressing national problems. But he
preferred the pleasure arising from
the manipulation of great business in
terests and the Joys o'f society and of
his clubs.. He was not quite ready for
the moral struggle and sacrifice essen
tial to becoming his best possible self.
On the other hand It is reassuring
to see how many men both in public
and private life instead of deteriorating
morally as they age actually grow bet
ter.. A prominent minister who at
tended a while ago the twenty-fifth re
union of his college class told me that
the thing that impressed him dost
was the fact that almost every one
of bis classmates seemed to have im
proved In the quarter of a century
since graduation. The same process
may occasionally be observed In the
political realm. The death of a re
nowned party leader has recently called
attention to tbe way In which It is
possible for a man to outgrow suspi
cions and hostilities, through giving a
larger outlet year by year to that which
was best In' him. It was not in vain
that he. passed through the furnace of
public criticism, of family Borrows, of
personal bereavement, for during all
this distressing experience he was
growing morally himself, and gaining
the confidence . and the affection of the
common people, so that to-day ques
tionable methods of earlier years recede
into the background of his career and
the nation mourns the loss of a true
and patriotic leader.
No one becomes his best, self unless
he feels upon his life the push of some
great ennobling force from without. In
the case Just cited it was a great and
growing sympathy with the rightful de
mands of the wage-earning class that
made the man cherishing it grow con
stantly nobler to his dying day. To
others some wrong to be redressed or
some worthy propaganda Is the motive
force, In the spiritual advance. And to
still othersâ and there is a multitude of
theseâ It is the imperatives, the . re
straints and the Inspirations of religion
that furnish the Impulse to the real
izing of that which is best in them.
The man you might be is not so very
far away from you to-day. It needs
only a little more continuous, stren
uous endeavor to mount up to him. Oh.
to have a vision this day of the man
we might be, the man we ought to be,
the man we can be. THE PARSON.
MAN YOU MIGHT BE.
which they fall in a handsome. flounce.
One of the decided novelties; of the
season was a- veil of.net, Into which
tiny steel ornaments Â¦ were fastened.
This waa worn .with a collar of black
satin, studded with steel buttons that
looked like nail heads. The belt was to
match. It was wide and folded like a
girdle, and there were groups of these
nail-heads of steel studding it here and
there. The buckle was made of .steel.
f And there is another novelty, this
one. in gilt, which .caters to the fancy
for something that will glisten. It con
sists *of a dotted veil with gold figures
in Japanese design.' The . dots are
worked in gold silk. This veil Is worn
with a 1 gold belt,; cut on the military
style, with a >ourid military buckle,
while the stock is cut on the military
'order and trimmed with two bands "of
"braid. For those who canV wear, this
severe order of things it 'is very be
coming. * '<?; " ;
A veil which had the accent: of nov
elty; and which was 'perhaps the" only
one of its kind, as it was designed for
a ' trousseau, was made of very â¢ fine
.mesh. It could be worn over, the
face, as it had only the tiniest figures.
Bordering it was a bias band of black
taffeta*/ in bright shades of red/-" . This â¢
band , was . put on,' not" more . than half
an inch in width, and was stitched in
tailored fashion on both' edges. A
similar band* bordered the'. top of the
veil, , which" was "worn over., a- large
brimmed hat. ;
. There is the veil for general wear
and . which is thrown- over. . ' the *â¢- hat
. and lifted with 'studied -carelessness.
It Is .fastened here and there upon' the
brlni" with fancy pins, which can be
taken out If the, veil be. lowered. An
other = veil of this- description - is . put
around the hat in regular fashion and
then raised in regular folds, which are .
pinnecT to . the hat brim. ,
A Little .Word. About Parasols.
The new parasols, are: the next de
cided novelties of the season. Th,ey
com* alMaid in, tucks, with the tucks
in graduated sizes. Again. they airs,
laid in groups, of threes or four. And
there are parasols with a wide group
of tucks around the small part. v
and so through the range of colors.
But the, prettiest idea of all. both
from a veil standpoint and from a fash
ion standpoint. Is the shirt-waist suit
that is garlanded with flowers. Beau
tiful wreaths of flowers, Email and
Joined together in rope fashion, are
carried around the gown. The entire
costume is made up of this flowered
material. . The veil matches It and Is
embroidered "with little ' flowers. The
and the orettiest of these veils are in
white with large circles in golden
brown velvet applied to the veil with
mucilage.
The plain chiffon veils trimmed only
with lozenges, circles or ovals of vel
vet are easy to make. Any woman
with a little ingenuity will buy the
chiffons, cut out the velvet and apply
the disks to the veil. This is all there
is to the making of the veil, and the
result is excellent. Such a veil should
be draped around the hat and looped
off the face, for the spots are far too
heavy to be worn over the* eyes.
The calling veils carry one away frum
the realm of the practical and the Inex
pensive into the domain of the beauti
ful and the costly. In calling and re
ception veils the patterns come very
high and one can pay one's own prjee.
Â¦ Lovely veils in all-over-lace, with fine
mesh and small eilk dots, can be ob
tained with a wide border of real lace.
This bc-rder sets " the veil and gives
it the dressy look which all veils must
have this eeason. One variety of this
veil shows a netting of golden brown
with a border of white. 'Still another
veil is in white net with a border* cf
black. , I
,The shaded or Iridescent veils are
lovely, but they muet be worn by a"
woman with . a great deal of taste at
her disposal. - Thl3 in rose pink, which
shades from , a very pale shade to', a
very deep shade, are Jthe best. . They
come in - very long pieces and can be
draped around a hat and fastened in
the back to form long streamers/ . Or
the ends can be brought around to the
front again.
The veil jr'-.i takes great prominence
in this season of veils. And one of the
prettiest of veil pins Is the long buckle
which is fastened at the back of the
veil. This has a pin underneath, so
that the buckle is only a bluff, but the
effect is very good indeed.
Great pins, round and as big as door
plates, are worn on the lacks c-f veils,
and in many instances these are so
heavy that they are pinned fast to the
hair or to the hat Or the veil is fas
tened with several short hat pins,
which are stuck in the back of the
veil in suchy a manner as to display
them nicely. They' should, of course,,
match the Jewelry of the gown.
It is the very ultra'lhlng to wear a
dotted net veil '.with a gown of dotted
net. The two, the veil and the gown,
seem off one piece and must be
trimmed in the same manner, with
lace, with embroidery or with an ap
plique of animals and flowers. '
Turbans, which are to be the favorite
hats for early wear, will be draped
with veils of fine mesh, trimmed with
velvet dots or with all lace veilings,
and the . prevailing style will be the
looped veil, lifted in the front and let
fall at the back of the turban..
The old-: fashioned shirred veils are : In
style. The veil, which is fastened upon
a Bhir string, is carried around the
brim of the hat and the string is fas
tened at the back.
The curtain veils that fall at the back
only are laid in side plaits and are
sewed to the back of the hat, from
IN t?ite cf the fact that hat* are
gorgeously and extravagantly
trimmed, veils are worn. It Is to
be a veil summer, and the veiled
lady will travel abroad through the
land.
â¢ Not in the plain complexion veil alone
Tv-ill the fashionable woman be draped,
but she will be stvathed in a great
length of beautifully embroidered mesh
vhirh would bÂ« a work of art to behold
even were it not made more lovely by
being drared around the head of

* chirred affair, to be put on for driving
and automobiliny. The lady thus veiled
v ill Le a feature of the summer.
But there are veils and veils, as every
one who has observed the tendencies
of tbe summer will have noticed," and
one of the prettiest is the veil which
falft ovtr the face and which may be
'lifted or r.yt. as oae may choose. This
'veil is elaborately trimmed as to bor
der, though plain in the mesh, and it is
lowered to the chin and below.
. The little nose veil is no longer worn.
This trifling affair, whicn came down
* under the hut and' held the eyelashes
er.d th- nose in close t confinement, is
banished. It was not pretty and the
border coaxing just across the mouth
-was exceedingly ugly. Neither is the
tight fitting veil to be seen. This is the
veil which was put on under the hat
The hat was pinned en over It and the
veil "was fastened at the back.
All veils now are put on over the
hat and a rrcat many of them com
pletely enveloji the hat, the face, the
n*>cl: ar.d the clock and are pinned at
"the back in tome ornate way.
The large veil is the veil' of the sum
mer and. though it may be a little thick
f-Â»r suir.mer wear, and, though ft may
be heavily trimmed and almost cum
bersome, there is na doubt that it will
h* the style.
The most popular of all veils" Is the
veil that is worn on the hat. It need
not extend around the crown, but it
. must be fastened to the back of the
hat ir. some way. Veil ends, beauti
fully trimmed with lace, or made en
tirely of lace, fall down over the neck.
This makes at once a trimming for the
back uf the hat and also a trimming
fat the hair and the neck.
Old hats, the hats of last summer,
can be rejuvenated by the proper use
of the' la co veil. If draped around the
Ijrim and fastened at the back so as to
Tall in long tabs, each tab finished with
a. wide strip of lace, the hat will be
cj-uite up to date.
Â¦The curtain veil is another variety.
â¢This is the veil which is fastened to
the back of tSy hat brim in euch a
manner as to. form a curtain around
. each eide and the back. The front has
no curtain. The style, while it looks
* pii at first, has the merit of growing
upon one. It looks quite pretty after
one gets used to its odd curtained ap
pearance. 'Â¦'.'''Â¦.. â¢.'-Â¦ Â¦ *
â¢ The very wide and very round hats
are treated in ways peculiar to them
selves. The piazza vci' is very thin and
.."is trimmed with large velvet orna
â¢ meats. Velvet blackberries are put on
In groups of two or three, here and
â¢Â¦'there all over the veil. These black
berries are then worked in silk in spots
to give them a reddish hue. The result
is a veil that is very attractive and be
coming.
Oculists may object to the figured
.veil, but there is no-- record that they
object to the plain veil and, particu
larly, to the plain veil that is lifted in
the front, and most of the veils are
made to be lifted from the face. Just
â¢what may be the mission of the veil
that -is not lowered 'over the face can
not be stated. Particularly as the hat
which it conceals Is" one of the love
liect.
Â¦Women of economical tendencies are
taking advantage of the veil fad and
are wearing a veil over a hat to cover
the shabbiness thereof, thus making an
old hat laet a few days longer. Others
are boldly taking the hat of last sum
mer and fitting it with a new and hand
some veil in such a manner that the
bat Is not seen at "all.
Veils have names this season, and
pr.i veil is called the coachman's veil.
Jt resembles the veil worn 'by automo
biliEts. It is shirred at the top and is
clipped over the hat. A ring is slipped
inside the shirring to keep it in place.
The whole is then drawn over the hat
and the veil ends are crossed in the
back, to be brought forward to the
front, looped under the chin and let
fall in long floating ends down , the
front of the gown.
The good-by veil Is quite different
from this. It is made of chiffon, with
one end very much trimmed with but
terflies or with birds on the wing. It
is a very long veil, seven yards in
â¢length and it is hemmed, but is not
otherwise made up. Thl? good-by veil
is thrown over tbe hat, is looped away
'from the face and is caught upon the
bodice with fancy pins.
The shoppers' veil Is another varia
tion of the veil of the season. It is
made of fine mesh or chiffon and it is
a shade of cream or white. Its trim
suing" consists of large lozenges of
'black velvet, which are pinned to the
veil at frecuent intervals. These lo
zenges are in black or white, blue or
red, according to the color of the gown,

Don't, if you are getting up your
spring supply of pretty things, forget
the small things. Upon the veil, the

Here are a few skirt rules which
can be applied to all the 1830 skirts.
Don't have the skirt touch in any
place. Don't have it too short. Don't
have it scanty, but let it swing clear
from the street and hang full all the
way round.
Don't try to trim the skirt elabo
rately if you are still clinging to the
1830 styles. Set ruffles around the
foot, but be content with ruffles. You
do not need a great deal of embroidery
or applique.
Don't try to wear a shirred skirt
unless you are very slender. Don't
try to have your skirts full on the
hips. Let the fullness be gathered
into shirrlngs and made as Cat as pos
sible.. Let it be laid in the side tucks,
let It be managed in any way Just so
the hips are not made any fuller.
The Eugene skirt differs from this
in that it Is very long all the way
round. It is the typical piazza skirt
and is allowed to drag on the ground.
Its only looping is right In the middle
of the front.
There are fringes worked around me
dallions, and there are fringes which
have curious little ornaments entwined
In them. Fringes also come with pearl
beads strung through the fringe and

dallions surrounded by silk.

a most bewitching, shimmer without

DECORATING THE DEN (Young
Wife). â Novelties in pillows for cozy
corners, window seats and especially
for dens, are shown in art burlaps col
ored in' rich shades of brown, green,
red and the loveliest shades of soft old
blue, and the unique part of it all is
, thai the; design is worked in raffia.
Barbaric effects are usually sought
and the fibrous material is used in' one
or ,"in .several colors as best expresses
the national colors to be represented or
the forms of design. The'
stitches . employed are rather j long and Â¦
simple, hence the work. is quite quickly
executed. The stamped pillow covers
and raffia can be obtained at any large
department, store, or you may buy the
completed pillows if you don't mind the
expense. If not perfectly familiar with
the method of taking the stitches, I
would suggest that you purchase one
finished pillow and use it as a guide.
The coloring of raffia Is by no means
perfect, although It has been much
improved and has lost much of the
crudeness of the first put on ' the ] mar
ket. T Many ingenious women who de
light, in raffia-work obtain it . in the
natural color and dye It themselves.
After.'a little practice charming shades
of ; color . be obtained to harmonize
with all sorts of decorations, which is a
vast help to artistic effects; for too few
colors, 1 , even : if Â¦ good, lend, to monotony,
when frequently used. The edges of
these pillows are usually finished with
a cord of plaited raffia in mixed or self
colors I to harmonize with the burlap.
The corners may be tucked^in and held
by invisible, stitches or a newer Idea Is
to' fold over the corner and secure with
a. large button of raffia. .Table covers

dainty and fetching., especially when
it is finished with a wee ruffle of the
thin material and decorated with the
initial of the owner. Â¦
A more sensible one is made of pale
blue or a delicate pink lawn, and it is
far less expensive, which is quite an
item when they are being turned out
wholesale and retail. Occasionally a
delightfully fresh looking piece of fig
ured lawn may be discovered tucked
away among the remnants, and it not
only lends itself beautifully to the
cause, but never fails to create a good
impression.
Pads for handkerchiefs, neckwear and
gloves are nothing new and they are
fashioned almost identically the same.
In some cases, in fact, they are exactly
the same, the only difference being
that two are made instead of one.
Three strips of narrow ribbon are
Eewed on both and the two are con
nected by means of small bows.
Nightgown sachets are rather novel
to the majority of people and, it must
be confessed, are not a positive neces
sity, as the drawer pads should perme

Nevertheless, they are a smart toilet
adjunct, especially so when fashioned
from a Dresden ribbon with an allover
lacy pattern. <
Of corset bags there is an endless
variety. Perhaps the most popular- is
the plain ribbon bow, with two loops
turning each way. The ribbon is over

fastened to the corset, but, of course,
the other must be pinned or tucked

decided point in their, favor is the ease
with which they may be cleaned, for
the lawn may be emptied, tubbed and
be quite as good as new. This same

A good way to overcome this diffi

CONCERNING MOURNING COS
TUMES (Widow) prefer
ence largely governs the period of
mourning for a widow, although there
Is an established etiquette concerning
it. For the first month she is expected
to live In strict seclusion, seeing only
members of her family. She must not
enter social life for two years, but may
call upon her most intimate friends In
formally after the first year. The third
year she may entertain her friends and
go to places of amusement. As to her
attire, a veil and small bonnet is worn
for the first six months, usually one
year. After one and a half or two
years she may lighten her mourning by
wearing black and white or pure white.
Narrow turnover collar and cuffs of
plain hemstitched white linen may be
worn v after the first year. All mourn
ing garments must be very simply
made and colors are not considered
permissible under three years, and then
shades of gray and violet are the first
worn. During the first year a widow
should not wear Jewelry of any kind
except her wedding ring, nor is Jewelry
allowable the second year unless she
lightens her mourning, although many
do wear. Jet and enamel Jewelry during
the entire period and even diamond
rings. Earrings and brooches must
never be worn. While a widow should
adhere to certain recognized customs,
she may properly refuse to be a slave
to the numerous idiosyncrasies which
fashion imposes, without fear of serera
criticism. Many sensible people Justly
claim that customs are absurdly over
done. Needless seclusion and depress
ing attire only Intensify the bereave
ment; the living owe it to themselves,
their families and the world at large
to be as cheerful as circumstances will
permit. Do not misunderstand me, for

CARE OF CHILDREN'S THETH
(Mother). â The mistaken idea that a
child's first, or milk teeth, need not be
cared for entails no end of misery on
the child and inspires a feeling of re
pulsion in all sensitive beholders.
Scrupulous care of the teeth should be
begun from the day of their develop
ment In full, and the child taught aa
early as possible to care for them It
self under the supervision of nurse or
of mother. Get a small and not too stiff
brush, use a good prepared <*>Â»11t or
myrrh and camphor and have tha
teeth brushed morning and night. A
spool of silk dental floss Is also essen
tial and should be cut In six inch
lengths as most convenient to use; this
should be drawn between the teeth to
remove any particles which the brush
cannot dislodge; then rinse the mouth
thoroughly with tepid water in which
a pinch of bicarbonate of soda has
been dissolved. Or, Usterine may be
used in the proportion of fifteen drops
to a half glass of water. This- will
purify the breath and neutralise the
effects of the acids of the stomach on
the teeth. Have all the cavities filled
as soon as discovered. Never rely 090a

The unique progress of Japan and
the remarkable efficiency of Its peopla
In everything they undertake suggest
some Interesting questions as to the In

on national welfare. The British
Medical Journal says that the Japan
ese themselves attribute their .high
average of physical strength to a plain
and frugal diet, and the system of
gymnastics called Jiu-Jltro, which In
cludes a knowledge of anatomy and of
the external and internal uses of wa
ter. Although during the period of
their ascendency the Samurai kept the
secret that their great physical su
periority was due in a great measure
to the Internal and external use of
water, the belief that if used liberally
and intelligently water is an infallible
weapon against disease la now gener
ally held. By those who go in for Jiu
jitsu an average of one gallon a day
is drunk. It Is noteworthy that rheu
matism is. almost unknown In Japan;
it Is probable that the absence of
meat from the diet, combined with
the use of plenty of water, acoeunts
for this Immunity.

Who shall " be served first is a much

the hostess justly claims ! that j honor,

case it is correct to serve the guest first,
then the; hostess and the other ladles
of the family and lastly the gentlemen.
-It .would-be exceedingly ' bblsh to
serve ' a gentleman before the ladles
simply because he enjoyed the dis

embarrassed by such treatment. Al

band's dignity by a calm gracious de
meanor toward your guests. To apolo

you know your guest is accustomed

DRY :, CLEANING OF THE HAIR
(Mary)!!-â A .;. delicate person highly
susceptible - to .' colds should never
shampoo the hair and then go out
into. the air as soon as" the hair seems
dry. ) Such a plan is all very well at
thÂ« seashore in the summer and ill ef
fects, are not likely, to result, but win
ter winds are. quite and likely
to bring, colds and neuralgia. When
the ;weather. is very cold it is wise to
forego shampooing arid resort to the
process "of dry cleaning until a more
favorable, season. To dry clean the
hair effectively several clean brushes
are 'essential and an old silk handker
chief, and some, bay rum. Part the
hair through the middle and again
across, behind the ears. Brush gently
in . long; even strokes, but firm enough
to reach the scalp and remove all dust
and' dandruff; then separate the hair
in small strands, shaking each well to
dislodge any. remaining particles of
dust.' Brush again, using another
clean brush, and finish by wiping each
strand with a clean, soft handkerchief
and. you will be delighted to see how
bright the hair is. Apply bay rum to
the scalp with a small sponge and rub
.it in. well with the finger tlps v This
is a valuable tonic as well as an aid
in keeping the hair soft and dry. A
better preparation even than bay rum
is the prepared i rum and quinine,
which any druggist can put up.
HAND' TRIMMING. GARMENTS
(Eloise).'â Scarcely a new garment is
seen without a touch of -hand work on
it.'. The fad. for embroidery amounts to
such a craze that purses, " slippers,
cloaks and/even' hats have wonderful
bits of needlework as their principal
embelllshment.-while dresses, and espe
cially the separate waists, are a mass
of exquisite stitches. The labor of
making new garments has increased
. accordingly and the fashionable dress
maker has .! seized upon the fad and
rushed prices up very high on the plea
of extra time. However, the clever wo
man, nothing daunted, and determined
to dress, well on a moderate purse, and
.still have some of the* smartest* things
of the season, has her gowns and
waists cut and fitted by a good dress
maker, and, by doing, the needlework
herself, is able to have a stunning
Trock at. small outlay Cor the embel
lishments. Yokes; -panels,' cuffs, etc._,
are, of course, shaped over a reliable
pattern of. correct size. ' Indeed, the wo
man who can do really, fine needlework
can utilize all bits of choice silk and
scraps of lace in constructing unique
trimmings, giving her wardrobe an in
dividuality by her own industry that
would require considerable money to
buy. S Another point. "When she is in
the shops she keeps a sharp eye out for
garments of good quality and perfect
style, such as underwear, shirt waists,
dressing sacques, etc., which can be se
cured for' a reasonable sum; then, by
home skill she converts these garments
into elaborate things of beauty at: a
trifling cost. â¢ * Smocking, fagoting and
lace stitches still obtain, with plenty of
dainty patterns in stem and satin
stitches. The finest of renaissance
braids joined with silk stitches are
among the choicest materials for yokes,
etc.. '4>^":t;
craft are, many, taste and Judgment

Just at present it is quite the proper '

handkerchiefs to be initialed, and a
pretty, useful fad it Is, tob, especially
when there are 'two or three men in
the same household. The shifts, which
are more frequently lisle mesh than
anything else, have the three initials
on the collar band, and the hose are
plainly embroidered with a single let

easy to wear the first and last initial
and display a. little individuality. For

pair of hoseâ one initialed J. and the
other B. As both are the same color
and match exactly, with the exception
of the letter. It Is the simplest thing
in the world-to switch them and to wear

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY. CALL.
CORRECT DRESS FOR
GENTLEMAN
12WITH absolutely no special
preparation whatever, but In
the regular course of his
every-day business, A. II.
Piepenburg of Santa Barbara has just
.broken the record with his own White
.Fteain touring car for continuous long
distance autoniobilinfr.
He has made the trip from San
â¢ Diegq to Han Francisco by way of Los
â¢Angeles hi five and a half days.
. That is exactly six hundred miles
by. rail. By wagon road, as an auto
mobile has to travel, it is between
fifty and one hundred miles more.
The best previous record' for the
vumf distance in California and over
almost eractly the same route was
? ipht days.
â¢Thus Mr. Pieyenburg reduced the
record by almost one-third.
That is it veritable triumph, indeed,
in up-to-date automobiling, more
especially when the conditions of
travel at this time of the year over a
muddy, storm swept country are
taken into account, with the further
fact that Air. Piepenburg traveled the
whole distance with a machine laden
to almost it3 full capacity.
His feat is a left of speed and en
durance Ihcj has not been equaled
anywhere i;i America, not even at the
great International endurance contest
held between Xew York and Pittsburg.
by way of Cleveland and return, last
year, when :he record of 800 miles in
eight days uas established.
And not the least interesting feature
of this surprising run was the fact
that Mr. Piepenburg had not set out
with any intention of breaking a rec
ord. In fact, he did not know that
he hud broken the record at all and
t : et uu a new standard of speed and
endurance until those who had been
watching his flying trip with extreme
and minute interest told him what he
had accomplished. Then it was that
realized that he could have shaved
considerable off this score had he
UK'd particularly hard to do so.
As it is his feat is the talk of the
Coast in automobile circles, for more
ihan one enthusiast has made an effort
.t<Â» -reduce the 'ime between here and
San Diego, which Is a very popular
run. ard failed.
Dr. A. Brown, the well knc-w.i den
tist of Portland, who also owns a
White steam car. carried a party of five
over the route lest month in what was
a notable trip. Ham G. Buckbee, of the
firm of thainwaid & Duckbee, is anoth :
er who has found this run fascinating,
while John Spring c-f Frultvale, who is
a prominent member of the Automobile
dub of California, is planning to re
duce the record still further, if pos
sible, with a White steam touring car
of the same pattern as that which Mr.
Piepenburg drove with such splendid
results. ,
To make this record ail the more re
markable it It doubly interesting to
state that the young automobilist had
just completed o-;e round trip between
San Francisco and Los Angeles by way
of Santa Barbara, when the roads were
in the worst possible condition frcm
the storms during t: o latter part of
March and the first days of April, and
bad enough to have put any machine
up for extensive repairs, but Mr. Piep
enburg simply had his automobile
washed to make it presentable, its
water and fuel tanks replenished, and
was c-ff again, after only a few hours'
delay, this time with Jhree youths from
the Thatcher School at Nordhoff as
passengers.
Leaving Santa Barbara at 9:20 in the
morning they covered the distance of
over or.* hundred and twelve miles to

to San Francisco im five ar&di a - JKalf
days, tHus clipping' two and & lialf
days from the best record and setting
new standard in speed and endurance
the axle'itself. And just imagine try
ing to make \ r-sd over such a rosjd as;
that, even when lha automobile weighs,
only 1600 pounds. This pLrt of the jour
ney will furnish an interesting prob
lem for the members of the Camlno
Heal in its popular agitatlc-ji for good
roads. -But the young man accomplish-..
cd it in splendid time, ii* a manner at
ones unique' and exciting as will b2
seen fjom ;the account of the return
journey with which this article Is more
particularly concerned. ,
After spending some time at Corona
do-on pleasure bent the return trip was
begun at A o'clock on' Saturday after
noon ard Kscondldo was reached by
nightfall. But almost immediately af-
arriving here at 8 o'clock in the even
ing, with a machine that was buried
deep under such a heavy coating vZ
mud that it was hard to tell vrhat its
original color or structure was.
And thus was the record-breaking
run from San Diego to San Francisco
made in five and a half days. As was
said before the official distance record
ed in the railroad guides 13 601 miles.
Mr. Plepenburg's odometer showed that
he had actually traveled 750 miles sine*
leaving San Dfego. but apparently.. ha
In the only one who does not see any
thing remarkable in his performance,
for less than two days after hi3 arrival
here he and his newly polished White
steamer were taking Jheir blitheful
way back to Santa Barbara for tha
third round-trip within a month.
That is indeed subjecting an automo
bile to terrifically hard usage, covering
hundreds upon hundreds of miles wlth
c-ut repairs of any sort and doing It
all at a cost of only a cent or two a
mile for fuel. Indeed, when one may
travel at such speed and in such lordly
style it is small wonder that automo
billng has grown to such -tartling pop
ularity in California, nor that there is
such a widespread demand fot good
roads.
And in view of the- new standard set
by : -. Piepenburg It Is interesting to
note that It was a car of the same
pattern, owned and operated by H. D.
Ryus of L03 Angeles, that won the
most valuable cup ever offered for au
tomobile races at the bis meet In Los
Angeles last November.
This was the 51000 Huntlngton Chal
lenge cup presented by H. E. Hunting
ton, the street car magnate, to the
Automobile Club of Southern Califor
nia for the best record In the five mile
race at the fall u:aet. Mr. Ryus cov
ered the distance in six minutes and
six seconds and won -the cup, but al
most immediately afterward, on the
same day, he lowered his own time to
five minutes and forty seconds with the
same machine, which travels so noise
lessly and with such an utter absence
of the rattling vibration.s so common
to ordinary motor cars that It seems
to be ui--ojd of machinery of any sort,
while it glides along with the speed
and ' silence of some huge mysterious
monster.
It will be both. edifying and instruc
tive to see what Mr. Piepenburg's next
trip with his White car brings forth
as against the numerous other vehicles
that are going after his record this
summer. On his next trip he will make
a minute report on the condjtlcra ci tljÂ«
Los Angeles by 6 o'clock In the even
ing, and departed immediately for San
Diego the following morning at half
past eight. The route they were obliged
to take via El Toro, Capistrano and
1 ;condido is the worst imaginable. In
many places it is little better than a
waste of quicksand. In which the ma
chine plunges almost to the depth of
ter leaving Escor.dldo the next morning
at 7 o'clock the trouble began, not with
the touring car, but. with the road,
notwithstanding that they had cut in
toward the mountains by way of Mis
sion del liev, expressly to avoid the
heavy shifting sand, thua lengthening
the round trip between Los Angeles
and San Diego to much over three hun
dred miles, while by rail it is only 252
miles.
"When fhe car made its fird plunge
Into the sand we were brought to such
a sudden stop that for a moment I
thought we would all be thrown out
head foremost." said Mr. Piepenburg,
in telling of the exciting incidents of.
his remarkable trip. "And when we
saw how deep the wheels sank with
every turn it was the general opinion
that we would never make it: that in
deed, we would have to return the way
we had come.
"Ahead of, us stretched over half a
mile of this soft sand and the only
way to' reach the solid road beyond
was to cross it. There was no road by

with which city contractors, move a

when, we did finally feel solid earth

fairly hum until we reached Los An

The next morning promptly at half
past nine the northward, journey by
way of Santa Barbara was resumed,
the distance over the mountain road
which th*y took for the beauty of the
scenery being fully one hundred and
twenty miles. ',-, '
And right here is where the car
proved Its .' reliability not only to climb
hilis, and olimb them continuously,
with a full load on only ten gallons of
fuel and fifteen gallons of water, with
out replenishing either for the full dis
tance of the 100-mile journey, but to do
it all so noiselessly, so quietly, with Jta
unique, odorless generator, which not
only muffles all sound of the exhaust,
but converts the steam back Into water
again and pumps it into the water tank
to be used over and over.
Qn one of the steepest grades they
found the road â¢ blockaded by R. T.
Crane, the multi-millionaire of Chicago,
and his party. Their automobile was
stuqk fast and could not proceed any
farther with the heavy' load imposed
upon it, for Mr. Crane's party consisted
of Mrs. Crane, her maid, Prentiss Crane
and the chauffeur, Mr. Boyd, while the
tonncau itself was heavily laden with
over 200 pounds of baggage.
| In this Hire extremity the millionaire
found 'Mr. P.I^ehburjr's arrival most
providential, for on learning that both
parties were bound for the same des
tination' the young man exchanged
loads without a moment's hesitation,
and giving the, .stalled machine a lift
over. the rough places landed the whole
party in Santa Barbara by 7 o'clock in
the evening,' thus "covering the 120 miles
under very adverse conditions in only
ten and a Half hours.
Mr. Crane was so Pleased that he de
cided to abandon his own machine, or
at best let It follow along with the bag
gage, and continue with all his party in
Mr. Plepenburg's car,' more .especially
as the young men from Nordhoff were
remaining over In Santa Barbara.
Accordingly the start was made at
9:30 o'clock in the morning, and the
route taken was over the San Marco3
Pass by way of Santa Ynez, which, by
the way, is prohibited to automobillsts
by law.
"But I did not know that at the
tin.o," said ATr. Pierenburg in speaking
of this spectacular feature of the
record-breaking journey, "because I
had never been over this road before.
It is a narrow road, with hair-raising
grades, frightfully steep and danger
ously rough. I don't wonder that there
is a law against auloinoblle3 being run
over it. as much for the protection of
Ihe automobllists against themselves
as because of the extreme danger to
any team that might be encountered on
the way. But once started we ellmbed
it in splendid style, and made the de
scent In such good time that we passed
through Santa Ynez early in the after
noon and reached Santa Maria shortly
after 5 o'clock."
On the following day good time north
ward was made, leaving Santa Maria
at 9:30, passing through San Lute
Oblspb at noon and reaching Paso
Robles at 5:30 in the afternoon, but on
tho next day a record-breaking run
was made over mountains of the heav
iest sort.
At 7:30 the party left Paso Robic3
and raced all the way to San Miguel,
where they branched off through In
dian Valley and thence took the steep
ascent over the mountains to Peach
Tiee, a climb that is nothing short of
stupendous, because . the storms have
cut the road Into ribbons, only to be
confronted with a new and Insur
mountable difficulty on reaching Kings
City.
At this point they were stopped by
the Salinas River, which, besides beius
high, was nothing but a bed of quick
sand at the only place where it might
bÂ« forded. There was nothing to bs
done but to retrace their course over
the main road and then by' another
route to. Salinas, which they passed at
9 o'clock in the evening, and because
of the extra thirty-five miles thus add
ed to the great distance thay had to
travel in any event did not reach Del
Monte. , the objective of the Cranes,
until 10:30. The whole distance they
had covered since leaving Paso Robka
was one hundred and fifty miles, a
truly remarkable performance in slushy
weather for one day's run.
At Del Monte Mr. Piepenburg left
his party and journeyed on alone to
this city in a heavy rainstorm, leaving
there at 8 o'clock in the morning and

concerned there was little in Roman
jurisprudence which was worth Imitat
ing, and though the Abyssinians trace
their criminal as well as their civil law
to Justinian, as a matter of fact the
Mosaic code still exercises the more
potent Influence.
The Influence of the Old Testament
Is also felt in the manner of procedure
In criminal cases.. As among the an
cient Hebrews, criminal trials in Abys
sinia are exceedingly simple. Witnesses
are summoned and cross-questioned be
fore the assembled natives, after which
the Judge pronounces sentence, inspir
ing himself from the "Fatha Negust,"
the code supposed to be derived from
Justinian. The sentence is carried out
Immediately, the penalties consisting of
mutilation, whipping or death. There
are no prisons. Progressive as is the
reigning monarch, he still scorns r the
idea of building prisons and employing
honest men to wait upon criminals. Be
eides, the sight of culprits here and
there minus hand or foot is supposed
to exercise a great deterrent influence
on those evilly disposed. The penalty
for a thief's first offense is whipping; a
second offense is punished by amputa
tion of the guilty hand, while for a
third offense the thief atones by the
loss of the foot which ran to carry him
away from condign punishment.
The death penalty is inflicted on
homicides, traitors and persons guilty
of sacrilege, though executions for the
latter offense are now of very rare oc
currence. In accordance with Hebraic
traditions, even accidental homicide is
capitally punishable. But, contrary to
Scriptural injunction, a ransom is often
accepted by the family of the victim
in lieu of blood revenge. The "price of
blood" is a sum equal to about $250.
In cases of homicide after sentence
is pronounced the relatives of the per
son slain claim the perpetrator, who In
default of a ransom is executed sum
marily, often with the utmost cruelty.
According to the Abyssinian code, the
culprit must be dispatched by the same
blow as was struck his . victimâ e. g.,
if the victim was killed by a club, the
murderer must be clubbed to death by
the victim's relatives; If he was killed

f f the people of Abyssinia, like the

X their descent from Abraham,

sion to Abyssinia occurs in the ancient
. Hebrew book of Kings (lx:l-13). the
"Queen of Sheba" being generally re
garded as a ruler of Shoa, formerly an
Independent kingdom in the southern
'.part* of Abyssinia, The Abyssinians
themselves have no doubt that it was
their queen who traveled so far to test
Solomon's wisdom with "hard ques
tions." They also believe that a son
was born of this visit, and that the
great â¢ Solomon was the father of the
first Menellk, from whom the dynasty
now reigning over Abyssinia is de
scended. To this visit to the court of
Solomon Is likewise attributed the In

many of the better features of the Ro

The recognition : of ..Japan as an
independent nation, which the treaty
of alliance "betwen the -two countries
necessarily < implied, had -been 'strenu"-"
ously opposed by Li Hung Chang from
the first. Like many . other , Chinese'

downright 'impudence." In his opinion
the Government of China had made a

suzerain and .that by so doing
China nad not only' relinquished her
claim' to Japanese fealty, but had
thereby encouraged them in their
pampered self-inportance.
The angry astonishment and indig

Japanese .envoy, demanding: a heavy
indemnity from China for the Formb-

The Idea of fortifying Port Arthur had
its inception in a diplomatic episode
commonly known' at the lime as the
"Formosan difficulty." The incident has
long since passed out of memory, but
at the time of its occurrence was gen
erally regarded as an important land
mark in Oriental history, as, indeed, it
has since proven to be.
Late in 1872 a Japanese trading vessel
was cast ashore on the island of For
mosa and the entire crew murdered and
some- of them eaten . by the savage
aborigines of the island. Very properly,
the Government of the Mikado demand
ed instant and condign punishment of
the responsible native chiefs of the isl

with that proverbial insincerity so fatal
to Chinese diplomacy, refused^cOmpIf
ance with the demand on the ground
that China was not responsible for the
acts of savages, whom she could neith
er restrain nor control. With astonish
ing promptness the Japanese Govern
ment dispatched an armed expedition
to Formosa, and in a few months prac
tically reduced the whole island to sub
jection.
The incident was exceedingly un
fortunate, happening as it did at the
very outset of friendly treaty rela
tions betwen the two Asiatic empires.
Only a few months previously a

hands.
It has always been the policy of the
United States Government in the
Orient to encourage, as far as pos
sible, the closest political relations be
tw^een China and Japan. In further
ance of this policy and in order to af
ford a neutral but entirely/ friendly
meeting ground for the discus
sion of their differences, the
American Consulate at Tientsin
was placed at the disposal of
the Japanese envoy as his temporary
official ubode pending the . negotiations.
It was due to this circumstance that
the writer was able to witness the re
markable interview which followed and
â¢which now figures so prominently in all
the biographies of Li Hung Chang.
Scarcely had the distinguished
guest from the Land* of the Rising Sun
been conducted to the conventional
"seat of honor" when the Viceroy, in
a | rude and boisterous voice, began
upbraiding the Japanese with bad
faith and with base ingratitude to
ward China. After listening: quietly to
this blustering tirade against his coun
try, the Japanese envoy, with true
Oriental courtesy and politeness, In
quired blandly after the Viceroy's
heali.il, about which he really appear
ed quite solicitous. The Viceroy, how
ever, was not to be turned aside so
easily from his purpose and kept on
with his angry lecture about the "law

fcislory has approached In world-wide
interest the desperate struggle now go
ing on in the Orient for the possession
of the maritime stronghold of thÂ«
China Seas.
Whatever differences of opinion may
have existed heretofore regarding thÂ«
â¢strength of Port Arthur, there is now
no longer the slightest doubt as to the
Immense importance of the harbor as
a naval stronghold, or that it is abso
lutely impregnable to a direct assault
by sea; provided, of course, its defend
ers possess puns of sufficient range and
caliber, a:;d the necessary genius to
avail themselves of the superior ad
vantapes which its natural situation
and surroundings afford. It is safe to
â¢ say, therefore, that the Liaotung Pen
insula and Port Arthur, which forms
Us marine base, are destined to play
â¢ a most conspicuous, if not a decisive
.part, in every great naval war of tha
future in the Far Hast.
Â» Considering its recognized impor
tance politically, as well as its great
importance from a military standpoint,
it is rather surprising that bo little Is
â¢ known, or has heretofore been written
concerning the sudden rise of Port Ar
thur from an obscure Chinese fishing
. village -to that of a great naval and
. military fortress. If for no other rea
son, the story of Port Arthur will al
ways possess a strange and singular
l^crest because of its intimate asso
ciation with the name of the Chinese
statesman who founded it â the most
remarkable character, probably, that
ever crossed the stage of Oriental his
tory.
Â¦ * Everybody knows in a general way
Jhat Port Arthur was first selected by
TA Huns Chang as the extreme north
ern outpost in the chain of maritime
defenses of Peking, and that after its
fortification it was designated by him
as ihe principal rendezvous of the Chi
nese navy. It is not so well remem
bered perhaps that the importance of
the harbor was first made known to
the world by Captain Arthur of the
British navy, who surveyed its waters
' ia 1S5S. and who gave it his name. As
a result of Captain Arthur's survey
the port and Talienwan Bay were oc-j
ciipied as a general rendezvous for the
British contingent of the allied fleets
during the campaign of 1860.
It has always been taken for granted
that the fortification of Port Arthur
by' L.i was due to his fear that Eng
land or some other European power
might seize the port and hold it; but
such was not the fact. Strange as it
may seem, it was the Viceroy's fear
'of Japan. anJ not of any European
power, which prompted him to fortify
Port Arthur in the first instance.
.It is a singular fact that until the
d,ay of -his death, or very nearly so, LI
Hung Chang was haunted with the
idea that Japan, rather than Russia
or any other European power, was the
foe with which China would have ulti
mately to grapple. He never ceased
to regard the Japanese v.ith distrust
"and suspicion and to inveigh against
them as political enemies of China and
rneral "renegades" and traitors to the
ancient faiths and the most venerated
traditicms of Asia.
7t seems the very irony of fate that
Li's distrust and fear of Japan should
have led him at last Into the camp of
China's arch-enemv. Russia; but it is
nevertheless true. Like Achilles' wrath
toward ancient Greece, the uncompro
mising distrust and hatred of China's
.-greatest Boldier and statesman toward
Japan became at last the "direful
spring of woes unnumbered" _f or his
own country. Dearly has China paid
already for his mistake; more dearly
still she may yet suffer for It In future.
Beyond all question, LI Hung Chang's
unreasoning fear and distrust of Japan
Â¦was the crowning mistake of his public
life, and whatever fate may finally be-
another." To *tve emphasis to nw
rude remarks. n-> finally handed the
envoy a piece of yellow paper upon
which was written a famous epigram
on the subject, from the Chinese clas
8lC To those who knew the Viceroy In
timately his rudenesg of speech was
not wholly unexpected under the cir
cumstances, but the completeness with
which he lost his temper and his ut
ter lack of* ttctfulness and courtesy
toward an official guest was a com
plete surprise to every one. Without
the least display of Irritation or even
of surprise at Li's rudeness, the en
voy quietly replied that he had only
availed himself of the present oppor
tunity to present his respects to the
Viceroy and to make his distinguished
acquaintance. He then added that he
had been accredited by the Mikado
to the court of Peking and entrusted
with an important mission affecting
the peace and dignity of both coun
tries; but that until after first present-
Ing his credentials to the Emperor at
Peking it would be exceedingly indel
icate for him to discuss International
questions with any subordinate Chi
nese official.
It was perhaps the first time in his
official career that the Bismarck of
China had ever received a genuine
diplomatic snub, and he felt it ac
cordingly. . For a man of Li's Impe
rious temper- such a stinging rebuke
was no trifling affair. It Is safe to
say that he never forgot it or forgave
the giver of It. The humiliation which
It caused him was all the more morti
fying to his official pride seeing that
it came from a despised Japanese. The
interview was then abruptly ended.
and the envoy soon after took leave of
the Viceroy and proceeded to Peking,
where, soon afterward, he succeeded
in obtaining a satisfactory indemnity
and the most honorable and advanta
geous settlement for his country of
the Formosan difficulty.
Before the ink was fairly dry on the
Peking convention, however, Li was
actively engaged in warlike prepara
tions, fully determined that sooner or
later he would get even with the Jap
anese, whom he now felt doubly cer
tain were China's most deadly and
dangerous foes.
The first intimation to the outer
world of Li's continued hostility toward
Japan was given in a memorial which
appeared soon after in the Peking Ga
zette, setting forth that "as the Jap
anese had lately engaged in a warlike
enterprise against the aborigines of
Formosa, It is necessary to provide in
all directions for coast defenses." This
was followed shortly afterward with
an imperial mandate, directing the
metropolitan Viceroy to strengthen to
the utmost the naval defenses of the
China seas, and Li lost no time in se
lecting Port Arthur as its principal
naval stronghold. For a period of fif
teen years the Viceroy devoted the
best energies of his life toward the
completion of the work. It was his pet
hobby, and when at last the harbor
and its fortifications were completed he
crossed the China Sea, accompanied by
his entire fleet, to" inspect in person the
great garrison which he had come to
look upon as the imperishable monu
ment of his fame. He was received at
Port Arthur in magnificent state by
Admiral Tlr~. As his flagship entered
the harbor wie Viceroy was saluted
with a salvo of 100 guns from the sur
rounding forts. The maneuvers of ths
fleet, the booming of the great Krupp
guns and the brilliant illuminations of
the harbor at night all gratified the
Viceroy immensely. Delighted with the
spectacle, he returned to Peking and
presented the Empress Dowager a me
morial asking for the promotion of tha
pfflcers who had ministered to his
gratification. His gratulatloa was
short lived. In less than three years
his splendid fleet was destroyed or
sunk. Admiral Ting was no more, and
Port Arthur, the idol of his heart, had
fallen Into the hands of the â¢neinyâ
the enemy, alas I which his own mis
trust and mistaken statecraft had
fatally conjured up.

To a systematic, tidy housekeeper
nothing is more vexatious, nothing

may be suggestive.
The well-bred person will nof sit too

home life is so important in
1 the graining of childrenâ Its ln-
I "fluences are eo strong in forming
JL. their habits and mannersâ that
'.especial attention should be gi\ r en to
â¢ the. cultivation of the social graces
within its precincts. What Is done by
children in their homes will be done
elsewhere by them. The practices per
mitted in the freedom of family life
'are rarely changed in mature years.
Hence there should be the greatest care
that gentle manners and a due regard
â¢for ; ceremony should prevail. Good
breeding thu3 becomes a part of the
â¢nature of each; they in their turn be
come Influential for good in their asso
ciation with others. Thus a beautiful
family life, where gentleness and po
liteness are the rule, extends its gra
â¢ciousness in an ever widening circle.
Children should early learn that the
_ rules governing the behavior of the
" members of the family to each other
.are "based upon mutual duties. The
p parents have certain obligations to
â¢ their children. The children have -to
ward their parents certain duties based
â¢ on gratitude, on love, on filial respect.
â¢Brothers and sisters have mutual du
ties based on their relationship and
"natural affection for each other, on a
common interest in the family welfare
"and on proper family pride, which
'even "the poorest should feeL

The sister. In her turn, should be
taught to treat her brother with an af
fectionate courtesy. She should never
fail to acknowledge his kindnesses. She
should do for him anything in her pow
er which he may need done.
Train your children to be courteous
to servants and you will probably not
be .deprived of their services when
most needed. ' .
If you permit them to 'run to the door
when some callers come, you need not
be surprised if they show curiosity at
times when you will be greatly morti
fied. It Is surprising how often parents
permit children to monopolize the con
versation. Let them early learn to be

are frequent. The wheels of the do
mestic machinery will move more eas
ily if politeness constantly lubricates
It.
Children should never fail to show
their mother and sisters the same cour
tesy they would show to any other
ladles. A boy should early be taught
to lift his hat to them in meeting them
on the street or in parting company
with them. He should rise when they
enter the room and see that they are
comfortably seated. He should always
allow them to precede him. He should
assist them in and put of cars; he
should carry their parcels, and escort
them when they wish it. In short, he
should be chivalrous In. his home life.
No boy who is rude to his nearest rela
tives, or neglectful of them, who is not
solicitous for their comfort and pleas
ure, has a right to be called a gentle
man.
forming habits. The habit* of the
parents 7 are already firmly fixed.
Children in every part of the world
quickly learn to eat whatever they
have to. It makes but little difference
whether that be oil, blubber, fruit, ber
ries, meat or something of all these.
Why, then, should we hesitate to train
them to eat what Is best for them?
' Is it not true, that the most of us
have. never given much thought to the
Importance of training a child's appe
tite? Yet does not the health of each
largely depend upon the eating of what
is best.
It is far better that each child should
learn to eat whatever wholesome food
has been prepared for the rest of -the
family. The exceptions to this rule
would only need to be made at a time
when the delicate health of the child
made such exception advisable.
Parents should guard carefully
against giving a child anything to eat
a short. time before the regular meals.
If they do" so it is only, natural to ex
pect that. the child will not be hungry
when he should eat and will want to
eat when he should not eat.
The time at the table should be spent
not only for supplying food to the body
but] also for the higher enjoyments
which come from intellectual and mor
al improvement. Those who consider
it merely a 'place to 'get something to
eat meet upon the same level' as the
lower animals.
Let us-agree, then, that the table is
not merely a feeding place for the fam
ily. . Neither is it a place to review' all
the unpleasantness which has arisen
or. laugh with food In his mouth. He
knows that obedience to these rules
will save ' disagreeable exhibitions of
choking and will prevent dyspepsia.
He will eat leisurely, that the meal
may be a more healthful one for his
interior organs,, and, that samples of
food may not remain on his exterior,
or on the table linen, as reminders of
his awkwardness./
,He will chew his food with his lips
closed, for he knows that mastication
is the first step in digestion' and that
the sight of the process' should be
concealed.
Those, who are well bred uncon
sciously teach the right way by their
example and the will; learn from
them what to do in case of doubt;
while" the faults of an ill bred, untidy,
hasty eater are' of ten an" effective les
eon.in good breeding, owing to the
disgust they inspire in one desirous of
behaving properly.
Children can - and . should l> e taught
to eat whatever is best for them. Any
child ; may easily be trained to eat, not
only any wholesome food,- ,but any
injurious food as well. In this, as ; in
so . many ' other matters, parents must
bear : the responsibility of training in
right habits. .
A great many parents hesitate about
Insisting .upon their children eating
those things which they know are best
for them. They, naturally think that
it is ' as ; hard , for â¢ the ' children . to 'eat
what is not' desired as'it would be for
the pare n ta. Such: is not the case. ', The
parents prefer those things. which- they
have learned to like. The children are
Except wfcer* the habit has become
fixed to the contrary, Â¦ the time for
coming to the table Is a greater period
of freedom from worry than any other
during the day. At this time,- those
things of particular Interest to each
are laid aside and those matters of
general Interest to all are more likely
to be considered. For this reason there
Is likely to be greater relaxation from
other matters and the time is oppor
tune for the discussion of things
which should be of interest to all.
If a* systematic attempt Is made to
impart useful knowledge it is wonder
ful how much can be accomplished dur
ing the time which would otherwise be
spent in unpleasant bickerings or worse
than useless, gossip.
At this time all should feel perfectly
free to ask any kind; of questions, so
long as the answer does not Involve
any unpleasantness for any one. In
this way can the instruction be made
stimulating and beneficial. Only in this
way can the table be made the moral.
Intellectual and physical center of the
home, as it should be.
Table talk should be such as to be
of Interest to as rm-ny as possible. Too
many parents are disposed to do all the
talking for their owu benefit and to

however, is that for all round wonc
you will never Improve upon the plain
white and pink. It is less liable to
get out of order and is easiest at all
times to renew. For the figure, the
professor recommends something lithe
and supple. Five foot four is a good
height, but that is a point that should
be discussed first with the dressmaker.
For trains five foot six Is perhaps pref
erable. But for the sporting girl who
has to wear short frocks five foot six
would, of course, be impossible. The
bust and the waist are also points on
which the dressmaker should be con
sulted. Nothing should be done in a

Why any lady should still persist in

of course, if you cling to gray hair
there is no more to be said. But to

think merely of the price. But that is
not the way to look at it. What is it

Cheekbones are being worn low this

Bquare-cut jaw? Maybe the square

more suitable for the married woman.
It goes well enough with the baby and

PRETTY women are going to have

;the future there are goins to be no
pretty jrirlsâ for the slrcple reason that
. there -nil! be no plain {rirls against
which to contrast them. Of late I have
done some systematic reading of
ladies' papers. The plain girl submits
to a course of "treatment." In eighteen
months she bursts upon society an
acknowledged beauty. And it is all
done by kindness. One girl writes:
"Only a little while ago I used to look
at myself in the glass and cry. Now I
look at myself and laugh." The letter
is accompanied by . two photographs
â¢of the young lady. I should have cried
myself had I seen her as she was at
first. She was a stumpy, flat-headed,
squat-nosed, cross-eyefe thing. She did
not even look good. One virtue she
â¢appeared to have had, however; it was
/aith. She believed what the label
"said and the did exactly what the label
told her. She- is now a tall, ravishing
young person, her only trouble being,
1 should say, to know what to do with
her hair; it reaches to her knees and
must be a nuisance to her. She would
do 'better to give some of it away. Tak

that the girl .who declines to be a

ehe prefers.
Will ehe be a Juno, a Venus, or a

or one tip-tilted like the petal of a

"first. The professor has an Idea It Is
"going to be fashionable. If afterward
ehe does not like it, then will be time
'.to' try the Grecian. It is difficult to
decide these points without experiment.

but there was not an angel about the
place that I could see. Perhaps I have
also been deceived as regards their

are one or two points about which I
'should like to consult her.

found out your mistake. One stout lady
I knew worked at herself for eighteen
month!" and got stouter every day. This
discouraged her so much that she gave
up trying. No doubt she had made
â¢ a muddle and had sent for the wrong
bottle; but she would not listen to fur
ther advice. She said she was tired of
the whole thing. In future years there
will be no need for a young 'man to
look about him for a wife; he will take
the nearest girl, tell her his ideal, and
if she really cares for him she will- go
to the shop and have herself fixed up
to pattern. In certain Eastern coun
tries, I believe, something of this kind
is done. A gentleman desirous of add
"/ing to his family sends round ths
neighborhood the weight and size of
his favorite wife, hinting that If an
other can be found o'f the same propor
tions , there Is room for her. Fathers
walk round among their daughters,
choose the most likely specimen and
have 'her fattened up. That is their
brutal Eastern way of doing it. Out
West we shall be more dDlicate. Match
making mothers will probably revive
the old confession book. Eligible bach
elors will be invited to fill In a page,
"Your favorite height In women";
"your favorite measurement round the
waist"; "do you like brunettes or
blondes?" and so on.
The choice will be left to the girls.
"I think Henry Arthur is Just too
sweet for words," the eldest girl will
murmur to herself after the ball, "so
tender, so likely to be true. Ah! she
will be a happy woman who gets him,
whoever she may be." Gently, coyly,
with her quick woman's tact she will
draw from him his ideal of what a
woman should be. In from six months
to a year she will burst upon him. the
perfect She: height, complexion, weight
right to a T. He will clasp her in hia
arms. "At last," he will cry, "I have
found her, the woman of my dreams."
And If he does not change his mind,
and the bottles do not begin to lose
their effect, there will be every chance
that they will be happy ever afterward.
Might not science go even still farther?
Why rest satisfied with malting a world
of merely beautiful women? Cannot
science, while she is about It. make
them all good and clever? Hang the
expense! Speaking as a family man
myself, I am willing to put my hand
in my pocket and bear my share of the
cost. I feel sure that., if the case
were put clearly, fathers and husbands
and brothers would respond without a
murmur. I do not apologize for the
suggestion. I used to think all women
beautiful and good; it did not occur to
me that they would be improved upon
in either respect. It is their own
papers that have disillusioned me.

Lolita Armour Jlay Soon WaJ'c.
VIENNA, May 7.â Lollta Armour of
Chicago was recently examined by Pro
fessor Lorenz, who said her condition
was thoroughly satisfactory and that
she had made fine progress toward're
covery.
The professor said he had no doubt
that after a short course of massage
and manipulation of the injured Joint
the little girl would be able U walk
perfectly.
have to r* far In any American city
to find one more attractive to the eye.
But signs proclaim to all and sundry
ily. And It is a significant fact that
it is not in the Piccadilly windows of
the shop, but In those facing Bond
street, that the royal warrants are
displayed. Piccadilly is by far the
finer and more imposing street of the
two, -but Piccadilly has never been
taken specially under royal protection.
Two doors from the t lucky baker's
is a quaint little old fashioned shop, in
the windows of which are shown
cheese, butter, eggs, bacon and., poul
try. In any of the small streets of the
big cities of America if such a shop
were seen one would wonder how it
came to be overlooked . in ; the . march
of improvement and , escaped demoli
tion. But this insignificant shop has
no reason to apologize -for, its pres
ence. It has a big pull with the royal
family. Signs announce that the: pro-
prletore are not only "cheesemon
gers by ' appointment to / his Majesty
the King," but "buttermen" to the
Duke of Connaught, "poulterers" to
the Duke of Edinburgh, and purvey
ors to the King of Sweden and. 'the
House of Commons. The Duke of Ed
inburgh,' who became the Prince, of
Saxe-Coburg Gotha, has been dead
some years, but the memory of his
patronage still counts for something.
CIGAR STANDS -WITH POLLS.
Sandwiched in between: the "cheese
mongers" and the baker's , is a cigar
shop on which , Is . emblazoned the
royal coat of arms. A document
framed and hung in the window, gives
the authority for displaying the. proud
heraldic device. It r reads: "You; are
hereby ; appointed cigar merchant to
his Majesty the King.V Given under my
hand . and ." seal at Buckingham Palace
this 23d day of -July, }90l| in the first
year of his Majesty's reign."; Then fol-
ARMOR BEARINGS FOR "ADS."
But If these grim old warrior mon
archs who used to display them proud
ly when they led their armies to battle
could come back to earth and see them
employed as advertisements for tailors,
dressmakers, haberdashers, cheese deal
ers, bakers, hairdressers and shoemak
ers. ; : what a Bhindy they would raise
with their inglorious descendants who
authorize such use of them. ,
American girls are among the last
customers of Bond street. They may
turn up their pretty noses when they
first see it and declare truthfully
that there isn't a third-rate town
in .the United States that can't
show : a more imposing street and
finer looking shops, but the royal bait
held- out proves too . much for them.
"What is good enough for a Queen or a
Princess is none too good for them,
and as for the expense â well, a Bond
street label is supposed to be the in
disputable hall mark of Fashionâ with
a;blg "F." ....
Â¦; In Its ancient days many of the no
.blllty^ and gentry;; lived in little Old
Bond street. As the ':'â¢ favorite prom
enade of swelldom It was natural that
Beau Brummel when in the height of
his fame "as the arbiter of masculine
fashion should there frequently display
the; elegances and eccentricities of hia
attire." All' the gay old bucks used to
strut up and down the ; street 1 every
pleasant afternoon. .
At 41 Old Bond street Laurence Sterne
died on March 18;. 1768, within' a month
after the, publication of his '.'Senti

the* house is now a* shop for the sale of,
Turkish, cigarettes.; "I never, heard ( of
him"," said the proprietor when I asked
concerning the' 1 ' famous -author.. "He
wasn't in my line of business, was ho?"
Boswell at one time had lodgings in
Old Bond street, and there on one oc
casion entertained at dinner. Johnson,
Garrick and Goldsmith. *
HOME OF CELEBRITIES.
After the battle of Cape St. Vincent
and the expedition against Teneriffe,
in which he lost his arm, Nelson in 1737
laid up for repairs for three months at
No. 150 New Bond street. At that time
his friendship with Lady'Hamllton had
not, according to his biographers,
ripened, and It was his wife who
nursed him and personally dressed his
wounds. A comparatively modern
building now occupies the site.
Lady Hamilton, whose beauty still
survives in twenty-four portraits of har
by Romney, took up her residence at
150 New' Bond street In 1811. That was
ten years after Nelson's death, and It
13 hardly consistent with what is
known of â¢ her character ; to suppose
that her choice of abode was influenced
by. its .proximity to the house where
her. heroic lover, had suffered.
"The house, a very plain one, is now
occupied' by a haughty fish dealer with
the royal coat of arms over his door.
"I ain't never 'eard tell of Lady 'Amil
ton." said the fish dealer's clerk who
responded to the visitor's inquiries.
"Lived in this 'ere 'ouse once, you say?
Well," he added with a laugh at his
own jest. 'I've -'eard tell that In them

"keeper of. his Majesty's privy ' purse."
It is a royal warrant and to a British
tradesman counts for more as an ad
vertisement than does a standing page
In a Sunday newspaper on the 'other

As one continues his course through
Bond street It Is seen that these royal
warrants have been lavishly bestowed
there. . Twoi; other cigar dealers proud

LONDON. May T.â Some of the ab
Â«ordltlea of London's archaic leasehold
./system have been strikingly illustrated
by tb* discovery that although the city
corporation owns the larger portion of
New Bond street, which, as the ultra
fasklonable shopping street, rank*
the most valuable property in
Xjoadon. the rental which the
dry obtains from the shops there aver
ages only about $25 a year. And Lon
don is now mourning its lost millions.
There are two Bond streetsâ old Bond
etreet. which runs northward a short
block from Piccadilly, and New Bond
street, which continues it a much
longer distance to Oxford street Since
it is all one street why the distinction
in the names should be maintained is
. one of the many mysteries of London's
street nomenclature.
Old Bond street has been in exlstonoe
.118 years. New Bond street got ita
start in life 1S3 years ago. Soon after
it was opened in 1721 a local rhymster
inquired in amazement:
Whftt'e r.'t destiojÂ»Â«l by Time's devouring
hand?
Vheres Trer. and wbere'8 the ManwÂ»le la thÂ«
. P?es, cebbases and ternlpc onoÂ« grew wherÂ»
>Tow rtanda New Bond street and a newer
frach piles and buildings now rise np and down.
Lcnflon Itself eeÂ«aas rrowtnr om o f town.
But the City E&thers thought appar
ently that London had almost reached
the limits of its inroads on cabbage
r.&tches and turnip fields. "With a. short -
Eigfcted policy in striking contrast to
that pursued by the ancestors of the
Dukes of Westminster and Bedford,
who are now rolling In wealth from
their ground rents, they granted per
-. petual leases on their building lots at
annual rentals often as low as $20 a
' year and never exceeding $35. A queer
clause was Inserted in these leases by
which, even* fourteen years, the hold
ers of them have to pay a "fine"
amounting: to seven times the annual
rental. By a subsequent arrangement,
however, it was provided that these
- Keven-yÂ»ff~'"*Tln<'3"**inlgiit be commuted
by. the payment of a lump sum. Fur
thermore, if a leaseholder through any
mischance neglected to pay his rent
and thus forfeited the lease, the cor
poration, in another burst of generosity,
â¢ bound itself, as a special act of grace,
.to grant a renewal of the lease on the
Fame terms for eighty years, at the ex
'piration of which time the property re
â¢ verts to the city.
LUCKY LEASEHOLDERS.
What is legally done in England re
mains done for all time, and thus the
city obtains annually only a few hun
dred pounds from this property,
.which ought to bring in hundreds of
thousands. And it is not the shop
keepers themselves who profit by the
folly of these long dead and buried
civic rulers. Few of them are aware
that the city owns the ground in
which their shops stand. They pay
big rentals to the smart folk who first
got hold of the leases.
Bond street â the old and the
"new" combinedâ ris and has been
tor haJf a century the favored shop
ping district of royalty, wealth and
â¢aristocracy. It Is the Mecca of fash
ion's pilgrims from all over the earth,
end particularly from all over the
United States. And it is as dingy and
prtmy and little and shabby outside as
Â¦Its fhops are gorgeous inside. Few
buildings in the street are more than
three stories high.
Bond street senior is of decent
width â for a London street â but Bond
street Junior is a degenerate offspring
of the older and shorter street. It
goes only a few yards on its own
hook, when it contracts its roadway
and narrows its sidewalks to a few
. feet, and wobbles a bit here and there
â¢ as though in its Infancy it bad been
uncertain as to thÂ« course it should
follow through the cabbage patches
and turnip fields.
- Externally most of the shops are
not much to look at. Few of them go
in for window display; they never
hold bargain sales; they make no
appeals to the crowd; they scorn to
have recourse to any of the ordinary
methods of attracting custom. By
their very avoidance of all show and
glitter they proclaim- the wide gulf
of excluEiveness which separate them
from the garish shops of Regent
Etreet. Oxford street and Piccadilly.
before which gaping crowds may al
ways be found. They consider them
selves "the real thing": and as long
-is their wealthy and aristocratic cus
tomers take them at their own esti
mate and are content to pay for their
*vare much more than they would
have to pay elsewhere, they will con
tinue the recognized arbiters of Lon
dpn fashions, both masculine and
f^minin^.
MYSTERY OF BOND STREET.
* Why Bond street, narrow and un
sightly as it is, should be thus favor
ed by the social elect is at first a mys
tery to the casual observer. But it is
. a. mystery that is soon solved. Royal
patronage and flunkyism have made
Bond street and relieved it of the ne
cessity of hustling for trade. Royalty
has put the seal of its approval on
Bond street, and where royalty points
the way wealth obsequiously follows.
When you enter Bond street from
Piccadilly the first shop encountered on
the left-hand side is a baker's. Oc
cupying a corner site, It has a front
age both on Piccadilly and . Bond
street. In appearance it is a very or
dinary eort of shop. One would not
that royal warrants and knead ers of
dough within have been appointed
bakers to her Majesty the Queen, his
royal Highness the Prince of Wales
and other members of the royal f am-
LONDON, May 7.â It is not true that
Queen Alexandra set the fashion of
motoring among English society wo
menâthis distinction belongs to Mrs.
Bradley-Martin. Although Mrs. Brad
ley-Martin generally is one of the most
obedient followers of her Majesty in all
matters of fashion, the craze of motor
ing caught her so severely that she
could not wait till the sport had re-
celved the imprimatur of the Queen. It
Is, however, understood that Lady Cra
ven, Mrs. Bradley-Martin's daughter,
egged her mother on in this matter â a
disposition to get there first being one
of the Countess of Craven's chief char
acteristics. Lady Craven for some
time has been known to be impatient
with regard to waiting for people in
high places to set the fashion, and she
is commencing to show that she has
ldeaa of her own and means to put
them Into practice whether people Ilka
it or not.
Now that her Majesty has taken to
motoring all English society women
will follow suit. It is, however, the
first time that Queen Alexandra has
had to play second fiddle in the domain
of setting fashion. Lady Craven
caught the motoring fever about
twelve months ago, but it is only with
in the last month or so that she has
been bold enough to assume the role of
driver. She engaged an expert French
chauffeur, who not only taught her
how to drive, but educated her in me
chanical intricacies. She learned the
major part of the details in Paris,
where she knew she would be practi
cally.free from the observation of her
society friends. She afterward took
lessons from a mechanical expert in
London, and after a few spins on some
of the English roads between London
and Brighton, accompanied by her
chauffeur, she summed up sufficient
courage to assume full control of her
own vehicle. After having satisfied
herself that she was fully qualified to
manipulate the machinery she became
her mother's teacher, and It was no
small surprise when Mrs. Bradley-
Martin was found engineering a gor
geously equipped motor around Hyde
Park a few weeks ago. The matter, for
the moment, created a little sensation
in society because motoring had been
somewhat looked upon as an exhibition
of vulgar wealth because the best peo
ple in London had not yet abandoned
the "spanking" horse for the latest cre
ations of the motor manufacturer.
CURZON A MARTTNT2T.
Those in immediate attendance on
Lady Curzon welcome her appearance
in London and particularly the chance
of her being for a time free from the
personal observation of his lordship,
the Viceroy. Lord Curzon is described
as a veritable taskmaster, and, I am
told, he does not consider it undigni
fied to remonstrate when he thinks it
necessary with the most subordinate
menial In the household. He even
formulates ingenious schemes to catch
erring and unwary servants. If. for
instance, he suspects one of lying in
bed until 8 o'clock while he - or she
should be on duty at 7, the delinquent
is bound to be caught by his lordship.
A valet employed by Lord Curzon
before he went to India was, It seems,
not overzealous In erettlnsr out of bed
in . the morning. Lord Curzon's cus
tom was to receive his letters and
newspapers in his room every morning
at 8 o'clock, and as the valet was late
a few mornings, his lordship ' con
cluded that he was sleeping beyond his
usual time. One night, on coming
home late from the House* of Com
mons he determined to catch the valet
napping â literally â and in order to
carry out his object he slipped a note
In his boots inviting the unsuspecting
servant to call him at 7 o'clock next
morning. The trap was successful; the
valet had his usual extra half hour
and had no alternative but to plead
guilty. His punishment was to pack
his things and go.
Before Lord Curzon went to India
his household was frequently under
staffed because his lordship's reputa
tion with regard to his treatment of
servants was not calculated to Im
press them favorably. There were al
most daily calls on the registry offices
and In the end it became nearly im
possible to get anything like a re
sponsible servant to accept a situation
in the Curzon household. In money
matters, too, the Viceroy is, I am told,
exacting to a farthing. Servant*'
traveling and other incidental ex
penses are examined with painful
scrutiny and such items as tips given
by domestics to railway officials or
others would never be allowed.
In striking contrast to her husband
is Lady Curzon. She is generous to a
fault and the servants love her. His
lordship's persistency in calling her
by her Christian name, Mary, in the
presence of the servants, however,
caused the latter to adopt the same
familiarity â not in her presence, of
course â but on every other occasion
when there was any necessity to re
fer to her ladyship. The regularity
with which his lordship used to inter
fere with the servants did not. of
course, help matters to run always
smoothly between husband and wife.
It was, however, considered by some
of the more charitable of the servants
that Lord Curzon's bark was not as
bad as his bite and that he was more
a victim to disciplinary mania than a
man who desired to make people un
comfortable.

The man did not know.
â¢ "He doesn't know," Max passed \m
to me. "he only works here."

"A case of being too good," I began.
"ToVgood or~not good enough, it's all

settled It, a fat forefinger in the air
for emphasis.
And there you have it. Sir garret

good enough, nor to wander In far fields

where the sunlight quivers into an or
chid. Stay downstairs with the rest of
the folk. Give 'em what they want â
not what they needâ so shall ybur re
ward be great in the kingdom of
shekels!
So far as it goes the Rogers brothers'
artistic honesty is absolute. They give
full weight of what they have to give.
If it says "110 people"" on the bills of
their show you will get the 110 people.
If it sayg the "New York production in

It was a matter of a button.
Gus, apropos of productions, asked
me if I had noted the costers' buttons
In the coster chorus.
"We sent to Europe for those," he in
formed me. He put up two fingers and
continued naively: "Two dollars apiece
they cost us. They're silver. Now, we
could have saved $300 on that chorus
alone if we'd had bone buttons. But we
didn't. For why? Because we wanted
it as perfect as money could make It.
And it is."
"The people seemed to think pretty
well of it last night," I contributed.
"San Francisco's all right," both
Rogers brothers declared.
"We were tickled to death with our
reception last night," Max confessed.
"It's the nearest thing to New York
there Is. We don't bar nowhere â Bos

there is. You got on to our points as
fast as we made 'em. . Didn't miss a

"That double 'entender* "âGus likes
it that wayâ "about the automobile and
the girl. You hitched right on. In some
places they just thought the poor man"
â nodding at Max â "had made a real
mistake. Never laughed. That sort of
surprises you unpleasantly, you know."
"We've had a good education In your
kind of thing here," I offered In expla
nation of our phenomenal intelligence.
"Do yqu think we don't know it?"
Mat laughed. "Why, we were more
nervous about opening here than on our
first night in Buffalo. We heard all
along the line that there wasn't any
room for us after Cobbs and Pills â "
"Kolb and Dill," I corrected.
"And Weber and Fields were before
us, and our own shows down at the
Grand Opera^ouse. Then the Orpheum
has had seme of our songs, and so on.
It's hard to be last."

"But every girl in the show," Gus
contributed, "Just made up her mind to

we all did. But we were pretty well
scared." â¢
"You see, we were bound to be com
pared with every one that had gone be
fore, and people get prejudices," the
other brother took it up.
"But you see we get it from the crit
ics for what we're not, 'not for what
we are," Max astutely put it. "Are we
more Dutch than so and so, orâ one of
them actually said we were not as good
as E. H. Sothern in 'Hamlet!' Give
you my word."
â¢'That's the worst," Gus decided. "A
critic don't like our style of show. He's
going to blame us whatever he gets for
our not being something else. Yet he'd
think a man a fool for soaking a cat
for not being a camel. But that'-s
what he does. When he comes in "
"We lose before the curtain goes up,"
Max finished it. "If he comes in to
roast he's going to roast. And he won't
mention the good things. He won't
speak of the Maypole dance, fay â and
ain't it pretty?" he appealed to me.
"Charming." I heartily assented. And
indeed there has been nothing prettier
in stage pictures here than the girls
and gowns and rose garlands and
twinkling feet of the aforesaid dance.
"That cost us about $4000," Gus said.
"Rehearsed every night for three weeks
steady for hours on it. But along comes
a little man with a pencil, and puff!
all your trouble goes for nothing."
"There's a critic in New York," Max
said and smiled as one with memories,
"who does nothing but roast. He got a
reputation that wayâ got talked about,
that Is. Doesn't count at all now.
Folks know that everything can't be
bad. But every little burg of 50C0 peo
ple between here and N' York has one
of him. He's cute, too. His kind pick
out the good shows to roast particu
larly. They know that they can't get
a reputation on roasting a dinky little
road show. They take, say, Mansfield.
And people say"â the eyes of Gus
opened In respectful wonder along
with his mouth. " 'What do you think!
My sakes! This man has the nerve to
roast Mansfield. He must know a
lot.' "
"But we don't blame him," Gus has
tily interposed. He had been watching
my more or less amused countenance.
"Oh, don't mind me," I laughed out
right. If the actor may not sometimes
criticize the critic where's the justice of
things? Besides, it is interesting to
know what you are supposed to be
doing when you fancy yourself to be
doing something quite different.
Gus evidently thought the attendant
scribe needed further soothing by his
next: "Well, the critic's working for
a name like we all are â the best way
he knows how. But," he added acute
ly* "it's a good way not to copy an
other chap's way if you're looking for
one. What your paper wants, what
your readers want, is you, you, your
way of seeing things, your way of say
ing things. Just as we choose actors."
"At any rate you chose Joseph Coyne
that way," I decided, and some talk of
that elaborately gifted co-median fol
lowed. I hope my warmly expressed
admiration helped him with hlg pro
prietary stars. Mr. Coyne Is the neat
est thing of his kind we have had here.
He is that unusual quantityâ a per
sonality. Perhaps the good breeding
and good humor of his Englishmanâ
the "silly ass" kindâare its salient and
most delightful points, but the part
stands out as a new thing in racial
naivete, a character in the midst of
the vaudeville puppets.
The brothers told me then of their
play-monger, John RIcNally, once city
editor of the Boston Herald.
"McNally says," Gus informed me,
"that those who laugh about how easy

How many of us know, or appreciate,
the strain of many well-intentioned
mothers who stake their all on the
launching of their daughters on the
matrimonial sea. Here is a Brooklyn
woman who makes a clean breast of
the whole thing in court, frankly stat
ing that she was compelled to mortgage
her home, her outside properties, even
her summer cottage, to present her two
daughters to society with the style she
deemed proper. She even went further
âto the extent of drawing checks on
banks that were rude and crude enouch
to return the same marked "No funds"
âa most embarrassing thing for a bank
to do to a lady, and a descendant of one
of the Mayflower flock, too.
Perhaps, had the wretch of a banker
known that the lady who wrote the
checks was an indisputable Mayflower
descendant, he would not have returned
the checks.
But herein is a moral. Are the re
quirements of society so rigorous and
exacting as to cripple the finances of
the fairly well-to-do? If so, is not the
standard wrong? Is not too much
stress laid upon dress, upon elaborate
ness of entertainment, upon all ex
ternals of living rather than upon the
essentials of character and culture?
This small matter seems to be rather
close to a few of us San Franciscans.
That is a false standard, provocative
only of heartaches and failures â and
the end unworthy the means.

could we growl at? It's a perfectly safe

prognostications, the third rail came

Hermann Oelrichs. Mr. Oelrichs has a
home in Ross, and he objects to the
third rail. He has communicated with
the Marin County Supervisors, sayingâ

dollars. They say that the pampered
Dane has a house which borders on the

â¢well-known contractor of SanÂ» Rafael.

fore yesterday (Friday). It was the
second line of the Russian defense, and
a stiff fight was expected.
\ General Kuroki pressed forward and
attacked before the Russians had re
covered from the demoralization and
confusion Into which they had been
thrown by their previous defeat on
the Yalu River.
ST. PETERSBURG. May 8 (2:13
I a.- m.).â When the War Commission
adjourned this morning it failed to give
out any official dispatches regarding
the situation on the Liaotung Penin
sula or at Fengwangcheng. Neverthe-
I less there is no doubt that the Jap
| anese troops are in touch with the Rus-
I sian forces, at Fengwangcheng. and
i the report that the latter had evacu
ated that place is generally credited.
Surprise is caused by the withdrawal
of General Kuropatkin toward his base
at Liaoyang. as It was said that im
i mediately after he learned of General
Zassulitch's losses he had sent re
! inforcements to him, to enable him to
retain his position.
KUKOPATKIN IS SUPREME.
The officials here . frankly confess,
: however,' that they are not fully in
formed of Kuropatkin's plan. He is
i in sole charge of the operations in
Manchuria. The Emperor decided
[ when General Kuropatkin started cut
! that' he should have complete, lnde
' pendenee, so that there could "be no
'Â¦ grounds for complaint that he was
: hampered by instructions or advice
\ from officers in St. Petersburg, who
I could not possibly, know all the condl
l tions which the troops In the field
| would meets* Kuropatkin, therefore,
i has made his own dispositions and
: formulated his own plan. What little
[ is known here shows that he intends
t to observe the same. caution that has
distinguished the operations of the
Japanese. Finding that he could not
j offer battle at Fengwangcheng with an
even chance of success, he has decided
to fall back, it is believed, to the Mao
tin Pass. Back of this pass there Is
another pass, near which is a tem
porary railway connection with Liao
yang.
NO CHANGE IN TACTICS.
The Japanese have followed up to
now practically in all respects their
plans in the Chino-Japanese war. They
have crossed the Yalu at the same place
arid landed upon the Liaotung Penin
sula at the same points, and It is be
lieved they will continue their tactics,
as their dispositions foreshadow the
movements made in 1S94.
: It is not at all unlikely that another
i Japanese army will be landed upon the
I peninsula, which will move northward
along the railway line. During the
I Chino-Japanese war the Japanese cap
j tured Port Arthur two weeks after
their disembarkation upon the penin
sula.- The Russians say that the Japa
nese, will not find it so easy a task to
reduce Port Arthur as they did before.
; The Japanese army marching north
ward along the railroad once past Kal
ping can compel the Russians to evacu
ate Newchwang or else undergo a ba\
tle or a state of siege. If the march Is
prosecuted as far as Haichenjj where
the Japanese defeated the i Chinese
army, G fteral Kuropatkin will have to
abandon â¢ Maotien Pass as a conse
quence of the strategic weakness of the '.
position.- The possession of Fengwang
cheng is of the highest importance, as
it places under the control of the Japa
nese a large strip of Manchurian.terri-
! The security of the Japanese position
on the. neck of the peninsula is beyond
reasonable doubt. It is not thought that
Port Arthur can spare a force to at
tack the. invaders, nor .that Kuropatkin
will* venture to- march down the pen
insula from Liaoyang to Newchwang.
I Such a movement on the part of the
Russian commander in chief would ex
pose his flank Â¦ and rear to attack by
the numerous Japanese - divisions now
on the sea, to say nothing of the dan
gcrs\that.threaten Jilm from Kuroki's
advancing- columns on the southeast.
No course is considered open to the
Russians except to retire gradually
until the campaign can be conducted
beyond the menace that constantly
hovers over Kuropatkin's troops from
the sea.
The occupation of Dalny . and
Talienwan Bay 'is expected shortly.
Pitzewo offers almost no harbor ad
vantages, whereas Talienwan Bay will
admit "whatever heavy guns and stores
the troops of the second army may de
sire to land. â¢ ' ,
TOKIO, May 7.â Heartfelt joy is
written on the faces of the Japanese
oflicials, who usually, mask all emotion
behind an aliable smile, because at
last the Mikado's flag is flying and the
Mikado's troops are massing on Rus
sian soil.
When General ' Kuroki crossed the
Yalu and planted his colors on Chi
nese territory and when the marines
of Admiral Hosoya's squadron hoisted
their banner on the heights of Pitzewo,
they signalized the occupation by the
Japanese, of Russia's concession in
Liaotung Peninsula..
The Japanese strategy in connection
with Port Arthur, which is now. iso
lated, is. problematical. The most
prominent oflicials here are dumb on
this point, and it is doubtful if at this
moment it has been decided. It Â¦ un
doubtedly. was the original purpose of
the leaders to invest the fortress, and
await developments so far as -it was
concerned; but this plan was the re
sult of conditions that may change.
SHANGHAI. May 7. â It is reported
that the Japanese captured-Talienwan
yesterday. Talienwan, which the Rus
sians call Dalny, is on the eastern
shore of, the Liaotung Peninsula, just
above Port Arthur. Â« .
The ambition of the Russians has
been to make it a great commercial
center. To that end they spent more
than $20,000,000 in building docks and
warehouses there. The bay is deep and
well protected from storms.

"The detachments then returned to
their base, and since the morning of
May 4 they have been engaged in other
operations." '
"The third detachment. Rear Ad

The first detachment, under Vice Ad

the purpose of protecting the destroyer

remained until 4 o'clock on Tuesday
afternoon, but their search was fruit
less. The day was foggy and it was
impossible to observe the condition of
the enemy.
"This undertaking, when compared to

SHANHAIKWAN, China, May 7.â
An officer of a torpedo-boat, who ar
rived here from Yinkow to-day, after
confirming the announcement of the
landing of ; Japanese troops on the
Liaotung Peninsula, says the Japanese
rapidly entrenched themselves and
mounted rapid-fire guns.
These signals were repeated until 2
o'clock in the morning, but they fail
ed to reach the vessels of the expedi
tion, which were swept apart by the
tempestuous seas and proceeded sep
arately for the mouth of the harbor.
Upon arriving there the Mikawa
Maru, one of the merchantmen, saw
that the enemy was firing upon the
fourteenth torpedo-boat flotilla. The
men on board the Mikawa Maru
thought the other steamers had reach
ed the harbor's mouth, and they steam
ed boldly in. She was followed closely
by another of the merchantmen, be
lieved to have been the Sakura 'Maru.
The Russians had fires burning at the
mouth of the harbor, and they used
also many powerful searchlights on
the invading Japanese vessels. They
poured an incessant fire into the chan
nel. â¢
Lieutenant Sosa, who was in com
mand of the Mikawa Maru. unhesitat
ingly forced his ship Into the channel,
rammed his way through the bombs
and reached . the center of the inner
entrance. Here he anchored his ves
sel and then blew her up. . She sank.
Another steamship, supposed to be
the Sakura Maru, then came to anchor
near a projecting rock at the mouth
of the harbor and sank.
Following the Sakura Maru came the
Tomi Maru, the Yedo Maru, the Otru
Maru. the Sagami Maru, the Alkoku
Maru and the Asagawo Maru.' These
steamships advanced to the mouth of

gagement off Port Arthur, which was
received here to-day, shows that the
Japanese have blocked the entrance to
the harbor.
On Tuesday morning, after the
blocking flotilla had been scattered by?
a gale and the commander of the,flo
tilla had signaled in 'vain that the at
tempt be abandoned pending the
moderation of the storm, the crews of
the separated ships, undaunted by the
storm which isolated them from their
companions, proceeded to the work on
their own desperate initiative. They
forced their way in the face of the
Russian fire, which was more deadly
than ever before as a result of the im
proved Russian defenses, over the
field of mines. Many of . these Â¦ ex

This attack exceeded all its predeces

displayed by the volunteer crews was
equal to that shown in any event in
the war history of the world.
Although Vice Admiral Togo again
avoided damage to a single one of hia

Captain Haan found a schooner's
boom with sails attached and other
wreckage, which he says belonged to
the schooner Triumph. These, with the
finding of the Triumph's name board

upward of forty white men and thirty
Indians have perished with the two

While Russians themselves have been
acting in this way, it is not surprising
that Finns have shown still more re
luctance to go to the Far East to fight
Russia's battles. Finnish regiments
stationed at Viborg and Sveaborg re
ceived orders to proceed to Manchuria,
whereupon the men protested with
great vigor, declaring that nothing
would Induce them to go. Threats of
punishment were of no avail and flu
ally Russian regiments had to be
brought from other garrison towns to
drive the stubborn Finns to *the rail
way station by force. The Finnish
troops were deprived of their arms and
conveyed . through the streets under
strong escort, while several military
bands played lively Russian airs in or
der to drown the noise of the Finns
protests, shouted at the tops of their
voices, agalnat ' the treatment meted
out to them. On arrival at the sta
tions, the Finns had literally to be
thrown into the cars by main force and
riotous scenes naturally ensued.
Remarkable revelations of corrup
tion and mismanagement have been
made in' regard to the war supplies of
all kinds for the use of the army at
the front. The War Office ordered
1000' sacks of wheat from a Russian
gTain dealer at Odessa for the use of
the troops and chance led to the dis
covery that one of the sacks contained
an impure mixture. A detailed inves
tigation followed and it was proved
that out of 1000 sacks no less than
950 contained small quantities of real
wheat mixed with larger quantities of
injurious adulterations of various
kindi. . Further investigations led to
the discovery that a number of other
grain dealers had perpetrated a sim
ilar swindle. Thousands of boots sup
plied for the troops turn out to have
i been made of brown paper, and huge
quantities of tinned foods have been
found unfit for consumption." Some of
them.were so poisonous that the reg
iments eating them would have been
decimated long before they had a'
chance of getting face to face wth the
enemy In the field.
TROOPS ARE HALF-STARVED.
Along the route of the Trans-Sibe
rian Railway, which carries all .the
reinforcements to the scene of hostil
ities, the arrangements for feeding the
outgoing troops have completely brok
en down in places, so that the unfor
tunate soldiers are often reduced to
the verge of, starvation during the
long journey of several weeks. As a
result /of the short rations .received
the men arrive in Manchuria In a
physical condition unfavorable to suc
cessful operations in trying circum
stances. At ' the towns where the
transport trains ' traveling eastward
1 stop the 'soldiers rush out of the cars
and plunder the 'shops where eatables
can be obtained. 'The officers found it
impossible to check these excesses,
and after a few futile attempts they
contented themselves with telegraph
ing a warning. In advance that all
with their wives and families, when the
Russian guards perceived them and.
being too much in the rear to overtake
them, fired Indiscriminately Into the
group. Ten men, twelve women and six
children were killed on the spot, and
the remainder surrendered to escape
the same fate.
Much trouble has been caused by the
refusal of the adherents of many re
ligious sects in different parts of Rus
sia to perform the military service
which the law of Russia requires of
them. These sectarians accept the doc
trine of non-resistance as interpreted
by Tolstoi i\nd they will not bear arms,
even "though they should be shot for
high treason. The Russian authorities
Imprison them, knout them and pun
ish them in a variety of other ways,
but the Tolstoyists, who number many
thousands, remain true to their con
victions and are lost to the Russian
army. Other Tolstoyists, who have not
sufficient courage to defy the military
authorities !n this open way, don uni
form and go to the front, but they are
a source of danger to their own side,
because they deliberately shoot In such
a manner that their bullets cannot pos
sibly kill or wound any â¢ of the hos
tile army. Thus they satisfy their own
conscience without facing the unpleas
ant consequences of openly defying the
authorities.
FINNS DRIVEN TO THE FRONT.
Many instances of the extraordinary
patriotism of the Japanese became
known here and caused intelligent Rus
sians, from the Czar downward, to re
flect upon the reason for the marked
difference between Japan and Russia in
this respect. The young Russians who
desired to evade military service prac
ticed all sorts of cunning - devices to
achieve, their object. After the out
break of the war the Russian author
ities refused all applications from Rus
sian men for passes permitting them to
leave the country, so that the fugitives
from military service had to cross the
frontier under various disguises and
with false passports.
Large numbers who had not the
means to adopt these methods attempt
ed to walk across the boundaries to
Pressia and Austria under the cover of
darkness, trusting to luck to evade the
vigilance of the Russian frontier
guards. German newspapers Issued In
the eastern provinces of Prussia and
Austria have published accounts of at
least three dozen encounters between
fugitives and Russian frontier guards,
and in most cases the Russian troops
simply shot down those who were try
ing to reach German or Austrian ter
ritory. In one case a large party of
fugitives from military service were on
the point of crossing the Russo-German
frontier near Wilhelmsbrueck, together
ST. PETERSBURG, May 7.â It is
an open secret here that the situation
in the Par East has inspired the Czar,
the Imperial family and the members
of the Government with grave fears
for the future of the Russian empire.
Neither the Czar nor his advisers ex
pected that Japan would push matters
to extremes and the events since the
rupture of diplomatic relations have
developed their first alarm into panic,
pure and simple. There have been
blunders, big and small, in all the de
partments of army and navy, and
there have been manifestations of op
position to the war among the Rus
sian people themselves, which . must
fill the hearts of the powers that be
with dismay. â¢
The violently unpatriotic attitude of
considerable sections of the Russian
nation has been the severest blow to
the Czar, who has been plunged Into
despair by the discovery that bo many
of his subjects detest him and his
Government. No sooner was war de
clared than there was a rush of young
men liable to compulsory military
service at the front to escape from the
country and thus evade their obliga
tions to the fatherland.
The Czar felt this all the more
keenly because it offered such a strik
ing contrast to the patriotism shown
in Japan. In one case where a young
Japanese 'soldier was exempted from
active service at . the front on the
ground that he was the sole support
of his widowed mother the mother
committed suicide in order that her
boy might be free to take the field
against the nation's enemy and with
her last breath handed him the dag
ger with which she had stabbed her
self to the heart, commanding him. to
plunge it into as many Russian bodies
as possible.
Wealthy Japanese who were not "re
quired to perform active military ser
vice sacrificed brilliant professional and
commercial careers to enlist as com
mon soldiers and young Japanese who
.were not allowed to go to the front on
account of physical unfltness commit
ted suicide because they were ashamed
to be thus debarred from risking their
lives for the sake of the fatherland.

In the six day bicycle races the pace
tells terribly at. the. end. Man after
man falls out exhausted. The victor
wabbles wearily over the Use. In the
business race it's the same. Man after
man drops out exhausted. The success-
ful man is often a dyspeptic, unable to
enjoy success. When the stomach is
diseased there is not enough nutrition
assimilated to sustain the body and re-
pair the daily waste of tissues. The
result is weakness, tending to collapse.
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
cores diseases of the stomach and other
organs of digestion and nutrition. It
enables the perfect assimilation of food
by which the body is . built up with
sound, healthy flesh.

PARIS, May 7. â The critical situa
tion of Russia's land- and sea forces
excites feverish interest, the Russian
reverses causing: almost as much de
pression here as in St. Petersburg. The
organization called- Les Femmes de
France turned over to the Russian
embassy to-day two complete field
hospitals of 100 beds each. * This or
ganization is composed of women in
large cities throughout France, includ
ing members of many noble families.
Two more hospital outfits will be as
sembled shortly. The embassy-sends
this hosnital to the front under the
direction of the Empress, who if? per
sonally superintending the efforts of
French women in behalf of the Rus
sian wounded. â¢
The official view is that Russia has
suffered a serious blow. The Foreign
Office had not received to-night offi
cial confirmation that Port Arthur was
completely invested by land and sea,
but a leading official said:
"We accept the investment as an acÂ«.
complished fact, for even if the har
bor is not completely blocked an in
vestment exists for all practical pur
poses. The landing- is considered
merely preliminary to 'a supreme
struggle, which will occur soon near
Mukden. Upon this will largely de
pend the outcome of the Avar."
Diplomatic negotiations during the
week took a definite form to restrain
China from joining Japan or otherwise
breaking neutrality. The French Min
ister at* Peking and; it is understood,
the Ministers of all the powers, Includ
ing the United -States, joined in the
representation. The result has .been
satisfactory." the imperial 'government
giving a positive, promise to not vary
from a rigid observance of 'neutrality.
Officials -.are somewhat "doubtful or
Chinese promises, as they recall that
after a former , declaration of neu
trality , China ' permitted the Black
Flags to assail French interests. How
ever, China's positive ; declaration,
backed by the identical positiou of the
powers/: is "considered as reducing
China's participation to a minimum.
S The readiness w'ith which the Rus
sian loan wa"s placed in Paris is fur
ther, evidence of French sympathy, and
a* belief -in -the certainty of Russia's
eventual- success. Although the^out
side'amount Russia desired was $160;
000,000,; â¢ a single .'group of French
bankers was v ready to underwrite a
$200,000,000 loan. .. ,
Russia's Ally Feds Keenly the De

FRANCE IS DEPRESSED.
LONDON, May 7.â Quiet confidence
continues to prevail here that the Japa
nese in their own good time will carry
out all their carefully arranged plan of
compaign on the Liaotung Peninsula,
which is now generally regarded as be
ing practically in Japanese hands.
In diplomatic quarters no events are
expected, either in the shape of a Chi
nese breach of neutrality or the media
tion of .some power which would inter
fere with the normal course of the war.
Foreign Secretary Lansdowne has re
ceived explicit information which leads
him to the belief that there is no dan
ger of the Chinese failing to maintain
strict neutrality. The Chinese Minister
called at the Foreign Office here this
week and so assured Lord Lans
downe. An attempt -at mediation, ac
cording to the general opinion in of
iicial and diplomatic circles, must for
the present at any rate be postponed..
At the Japanese legatitm it is be
lieved that Russia does not intend to
make a very determined resistance at
Port Arthur. . In support of this idea
it is pointed out that Russia already
ha3 largely depleted her garrison, at
Port Arthur and that Viceroy Alexleff's
departure from there hardly seems a
step that would be adopted by a com
mander who desired to risk everything

SAN JOSE, May 7. â At -the annual

To crown everything, too many cooks
are spoiling the broth here in SL
Petersburg.. The War Office is nom
inally in charge of the army, and the
Ministry of Marine of the navy. The
committee .appointed to advise the
Czar on Far Eastern questions has a
voice in th? control of operations, and
the committee appointed to advise the
Czar on the war has another share in
the management of affairs. Tha Grand
Duke Vladimir, commander. in chief of
tho troops in and around St. Peters
burg, very much desired to go to the
front as commander in chief in place of
Kuropatkin, but his. nephew, the Czar,
would not consent to this arrange
ment. -The Grand - Duke Vladimir
being compelled to stay at home, now
feels that he ought, at least, to have
the supreme direction of military af
fairs in St. Petersburg and does his
utmost to "boss" Kuropatkin over; the
telegraph wrres. On the other hand,
the Grand Duke- Alexis Alexandro
vitch,, another uncle of the Czar, is
commander in chief yo* the Russian
navy, and he feels that in virtue of his
office he is entitled to have supreme
control o'f all naval operations in the
Far East.
Lastly comes the Czar, who is neither
soldier nor sailor, who is bewildered by
the ,. conflicting advice showered on
him by his various committees of ad
vice arid elderly relatives of mediocre
abilities. The prevailing confusion'; is
well; Illustrated by the way news^from
the seat of war is handled.. Telegrams

SOLDIERS DIE OF EXPOSURE.
The news of the death of over 1009
soldiers from exposure and cold near
Lake Baikal, which was recorded some
weeks ago and then officially denied,
turns out to be correct. These unfor
tunate men were sent on their journey
of 5000 miles by rail in cars which were
only partially closed and altogether un
heated. The temperature being 40 or
50 degrees below zero, their sufferings
were intense and more than 100 suc
cumbed. Since that disaster better ar
rangements have been made for heat
ing the transport cars, but there are
still many shortcomings to be remedied.
The Trans-Siberian Railway is ful
filling the expectations of those who
prophesied that it would break down
as soon as it was required to achieve
an unusual^task. All along the line the
rails are too light for the burdens which
they haye to bear and many derail
ments have taken place. The accidents
have been comparatively harmless, ow
ing to the slow speed at which the
trains travel, but serious delays have
been caused. Most of the transport
trains goins eastward are taking six
or seven v/eek3 to reach Manchuria,
instead of the scheduled time of three
weeks. Admiral Alexieff, the Viceroy of
the j Far East, has expressed his ex
treme displeasure at the defective
v.-orking of the Manchurian end of the
Trans-Siberian, and some of the prin
cipal railway officials at Mukden and
Taschitschao have been dismissed for
gross neglect of official duties. The
Official Gazette here recorded these dis
missals and , added that Alexieff had
threatened other railway men with dire
penalties if there were not a marked
improvement, in the punctual transport
of troops and military supplies.

thc-]iirÂ£t bombardment of Vladivostok
tÂ»x- the Japanese fleet the Russian offi
orah^ dispatches mentioned the surpris
ing fact that the Russian batteries
'nlade no attempt to return the fire of
ih<i Japanese Khipe. the alleged reason
b^ing that the guns on the Japanese
worships carried farther than the guns
in the chore batteries, which were
therefore unable to return th^ enemy's
frre. The real reason, however, was
t!*at the shells sent to Vladivostok for
the 'U8C of the artillerv in the forts
were several millimeters too big for
the muzzles of the guns for which they
were intended, so that the entire artil
lery of tho fortress was rendered help
less until a fresh supply of ammunition
of the right size was rushed out in hot
haste from Moscow and St. Petersburg.
Sc-on after the beginning of the war
it was found that a considerable quan
tity of artillery which had been ordered
a year previously for the army was, not
ready for service, but the Inspector
general of artillery, General Altvater,
informed the Czar thaf"it would be
available for use within a few weelcs.
The few weeks having elapsed the
Czar made inquiries about the artillery
and ascertained that it could not pos
sibly be ready within the next twelve
i months. In his wrath at this blunder,
admirals giving' accounts of operations
are addressed to the Czar, who receives
them first and passes them on to his
relatives of the irrfperial family for
perusal. N.ext they are shown to the
committee- of advice on the war and
then to the committee of advice on
Far Eastern affairs. Finally, after a
delay of three or four hours, copies of
the dispatches reach the Ministries of
War and Marine, which are thus kept
in ignorance of events or vital import
ance hours after the news has reached
St. Petersburg. Many other cases of
amazing muddling at headquarters
could be cited. If the generals on land
and the admirals at sea cannot emanci
pate themselves from the control of the
court camarilla in St.- Petersburg, their
prospects of Success will indeed be
small.

LOS ANGELES. May 7.â The Metho
dist General Conference to-day paid
eloquent tribute to the, memory of the
late President Willara,. McKinley. A
resolution presented by the Rev. J. W.
E. Bowen, colored candidate for Bishop
of Chattanooga, Tenn., struck a re
sponsive chord, and -the conference
adopted it by a standing vote, and re
ferred it to the committee on episco
pacy, with instructions to prepare a
memorial giving appropriate expression
of honor and respect. â¢
The session of the General Confer
ence was presided over to-day by
Bishop Willar F. Mallalieu, and a
large number of resolutions from the
various annual conferences were re
ceived, discussed and referred to the
proper committees. Debate on several
of these resolutions brought out ex
pressions of opinion from many of the
leading ministers and laymen. A reso
lution by the Rev. C. B. Perkins of
San Francisco gave promise for a brief
period of an interesting forensic con
test, but a motion by the Rev. Dr.
James M. Buckley to lay on the table
cut the matter short. The resolution
was to the effect that the episcopacy
committee, which will consider the
question of retiring, increasing or di
minishing the number of Bishops to be
elected,. be instructed to hold open ses
sions, as the ; rule adopted to hold exec
utive sessions "aroused suspicion in
the minds of many brethren that un
complimentary things;may be said of
some of our honored Bishops." A score
of delegates were on their feet in an
instant, clamoring . for recognition by
the chair. Bishop. Mallalieu recognized
Dr.. Buckley, however, and' upon his
motion the matter was tabled.
Another resolution which also was
promptly tabled, and which doubtless
would have brought out some interest
ing debate- if allowed to be discussed,
was by the Rev. Dr. Clippinger of In
diana, who wished the conference to
adopt a rule forbidding- church publica
tions from printing â¢ ajl .adveritsements
relating to the sale of individual "com
munion cups.
The conference adjourned at noon
to . meet next Monday morning at 9
o'clock.; ***'* .
J Regarding the. question; of restoring
the time limit in the tenure of pastors,
which up to^four years ago- was a
rule characteristic of .the Methodist
denomination; sentiment -seems : to be

Jesse Bowmarn Young of j Cincinnati,
one of the, best postÂ«d delegates. in the
present, conference, said to-day v
"It does not seem at this early 1 ' stage
of the session that the: conference is
ready to restore a time limit to tne
pastorate after only four years of ex-'
periment with the present method.
There are now before the committee on
itinerancy petitions and memorials
from various lay and. clerical confer
ences pro and con, some. asking- and
others' protesting against any change.'
These will be^caref ully, considered and
strenuously debated next, week* before
any action is repqrted-to the General

HELENA, Mont., May. 7. â It is be-'
lieved-by many that- "Kid" Curry, the
$40,000 Great Northern train robber, and
outlaw who made a daring escape from
the Knoxville. Term., jail, Is again
hiding in the monntain fastnesses of
Choteau County. The belief that the
desperado has returned to his old
stamping grounds . is inspired by the
known presence of three Plnkerton de
tectives, who have been in this vicinity
for the past week, together with a
number of others scattered throughout
the" mountain ranches and stock camps.
The detectives are making their way
toward Landusky,- where, according to
reports which reached here to-night, a
cowboy supposed to be the notorious
outlaw Is in full flight.
A rancher near Landusky had a horse
stolen from its stall several nights ago,
but upon entering the barn yesterday
morning: he was surprised to find the
lost animal standing j in the manger
with the saddle still on. The animal
was breathing heavily and was covered
with foam and dirt, indicating a hard
and long drive. Going- quickly to the
door of thÂ« stable, the rancher dis
covered a man in the garb of a cowboy,
carrying a rifle, disappearing in the
brush. Around the fugitive's waist
were strapped two revolvers.
The returning of the stolen horse in
such a manner is a favorite trick of
Curry, the outlaw having acted sim
ilarly in this section on two other oc
casions.

The bad economic condition of the
Russian peasantry may ie shown, by
the statistics of farm animals. The
Russian novelist, Uspenskij once wrote
a story of peasant life, which he called
"A Quarter of a Horse." and which was
intended to set .forth; in the guise *ot
fiction, the social and economic status
of an agricultural population that had
only one horse to every rour families.
Statistics compiled by the zemstvos of
the central provinces show that, even
before the agricultural crisis became
as acute as it Is now, 20 to SO per cent
of the peasant farmers in the formerly
rich provinces of ChernJgor, Voronezh,
Poltava. Saratof, Kursk and Tambof
did not have even a single horse, while
nearly one-third of the entire popu
lation of Voronezh had neither horse
nor cow. In the province of Hiazan
22,000 peasant proprietors out of 80,000
had no horse, and 21,000 had neither
horse nor cow. â Exchange.

. Some interesting particulars . have
been published In the Aurore of Paris
concerning the curious turn taken by
Russian official anti-Semitism in the
war preparations. The Minister of the
Interior. De Plehve. personally super

cludes most of the Jewish doctors of
St. Petersburg, for out of the ISO med
ical men dispatched to Manchuria in
early March. 110 were Jews. This is
one way De Plehve is getting rid of
Jewish savants whom he suspects in
general of holding too liberal views.
Another motive is the Jealousy of
Christian doctors, who want to get the
large practice that now goes to the
Jews. Moreover, the Jewish doctors
are discriminated against. They re
ceive only 5450 for traveling expenses,
whereas the Christians received $625. â

ST. LOUIS; May 7. â On complaint
of Inspector Dunne of the United
States Department of Commerce and
Labor Mrs. Sophie Wenzell was to-day
arraigned before a United States com
missioner on a charge of importing
gh-ls-to St. Louis from Europe, espe
cially from Germany; for improper
and; unlawful purposes.
The arrest followed the arrival here
a week ago of ten girls fronvGermany.
It is alleged by' Dunne that they came
to' St. Â« Louis In answer to advertise
ments in foreign papers^offering posi
tions, with good salary; at light house
keeping in St. Louis. It'was these ad
vertisenfentsrit- is alleged;' which first
attracted the attention of the Depart
ment of Labor.
â¢ Inspector .Dunne states that the "girls
were taken to Mrs. Wenzeil's home
and that proposals .were made to them
that they engage in improper, and un
lawful pursuits. Mrs. Wenzeil was

PORT ARTHUR, Friday, May 6
(delayed In transmission). â Six of the
enemy's cruisers are continually In
sight off Port Arthur.
A parade of the garrison here was
held. to-day in honor of the Empress*
nameday. Lieutenant General Stoes
sel In a speech to tha troops alluded to
the latest phase of the war, by which
Port Arthur is threatened on the land
side, and expressed his firm confidence
in the endurance of the defenders of
the peninsula. The general's address
was received with cheers by the as
sembled soldiers and sailors.
Lieutenant General Stoessel has is
sued an order to the troops of his
command as follows:
"On April 30 and May 1. the enemy
crossed the Talu River in great force
and our troops fell back to positions
which had been previously selected.
Yesterday the enemy effected an . im
portant landing on the Llaotung
Peninsula, south of Pitzewo, and In the
vlcity of Kinchow Bay. Now our work
is beginning. Naturally, the enemy
will destroy railway communication
and endeavor to drive our troops back
to Port Arthur and besiege this fort
ress, Russia's bulwark in the Far Bast.
We will, defend it until the arrival of
the troops which are coming to re
lieve us.
"I consider It my duty to call upon
you to display unceasing vigilance and
caution and you must be ready at all
times to demean yourself toward your
general with the dignity and order be
seeming the glorious troops of Russia.
No matter what happens, you must
not lose your heads, but remember
that everything is possible in war, and
that we shall be able, with God's help,
to cope with the arduous task Im
posed upon us."

!The Russian retreat from Fengwang;
;-cheng is confirmed. Tlie Japanese
pressed the retreating: troops, though
ttltb few losses to either side. The
. Japanese destroyed the railway at
Pori 'Adams, blowing uj> the bridges.
.. The Russian capital has now been
without news from Port Arthur for
Â¦ mt>re than Uventy-four hours. The
Â¦ fast Telegram received was filed at C
o'clock last night. It is believed that
the spot where the Japanese cut the
railroad and telegraph lines is near
Port Adams, opposite Pitzwo.
â¢ No news of other landings on the
â¢ iJao-tung Peninsula, has reached the
'general ttarf. .
â¢ A telegram received this morning
from General Kuropatkin said Gen
"cral Kuroki's army was advancing
upon the Russian position in two di
visions. The enemy, with artillery, he
reported had reached Kaolimeun,
called the "Gate of Korea," which is
ten miles of Fengwangcheng.

CONFIDENCE IN* STOESSEL. i
â¢. -The calmness with which the Rus
*p;ans accept the isolation of what al
â¢ Â¦* a^-ts has been regarded as the Rus
.Hian Gibraltar in the Far East is re
markable. In military circles it had
'lUeha considered inevitable from the
first. No attempt is made to belittle
.tnÂ«* energy shown by the enemy, but
â¢from the "strategic point of view the
investment of the fortress is regarded
â¢As relieves the military situation on
Che -mainland, which had been much
.embarrassed by the necessity for'
: maintaining the seagirt stronghold at
â¢the extremity of the Liaotung Penin
sula. Besides, the utmost confidence
;s expressed in the ability of the fort
â¢ ness to withstand a siege. The whole
of the lower end of the peninsula
south from Kt nohow, which is thirty
â¢ miles above Port Arthur, is an en
! trenched camp, commanded by a
.Vhain of formidable fortifications.
,â¢ which surmount the crest 6T every
â¢ -hill. Millions of rubles and years of
"work have been devoted to rendering
the place impregnable by land or sea.
| The railroad circling within this camp
win permit of the easy transportation
"of the defending troops.
According to the Russian view, the
Japanese have a herculean task before
\hejn ln the event of their attempting
the reduction of the fortress. Succes
vive lines' of defenses must be carried.
â¢ and the Japanese operations cannot be
; prtn at the advanced position of Kln
t:hou until their siege guns are landed.
'" . General Stoessel. who will have su
Â¦" f rfme command rif the defense of Port
'Arthur,- is considered to be able and
resourceful and to have an indomitable
Â¦will. His orders of the day have
trratljed a spirit oj unyielding de
liajice. Ont- of them declared that the
: las;t man must die in the defense of
:Pbrt Arthur. j
Â¦ . POUT ARTHUR'S GARRISON". I
In addition to the 10.000 sailors on
.board the ships at Port Arthur and the
regular fortress artillery, probably
numbering "000 men. the defending
Jorce consists of a division of riflemen
and three batteries of field artillery â a
total of about 22.000 men.
._ ln anticipation of the severance of
communication, all of the valuable pub
lic documents had been removed to
Mukden and the work of supplying the
â¢fortress with provisions and.ammuni
tTpti' had been progressing for weeks.
The authorities apparently are satis
"fied that practically no non-combatants
'remain tjiere. The Inhabitants of Port
'Dalny. were sent away some time ago.
' Â¦ The newspapers accept the news
Ftoically, adjuring the people not to be
'discouraged, since the cutting off of
Port Arthur was a foregone conclusion
Irom the first. The Xovoe Vremyasays:
"The fortress and its defenders must
"now ghlft for themselves until our
army in sufficient strength can come
down from the north and rescue them.
Tn the meantime the people must ac
*c.ystom themselves to be without direct
news from Port Arthur."

deposits, also an unusually large reduc
tion In sumlus reserves. Loans were
expanded $21,393,200, reflecting, as In
previous .weeks, extensive corporation
and syndicate borrowing. The cash
holdings of these banks was reduced
Â¦by $6,0&3,S00. which reduction closely
corresponds with the average losses re
sulting from the movement of gold to
Europe during the fortnight, less the
average of the amount of the Japanese
gold which was transferred hither from
San Francisco last week. Deposits were
Increased by $17,345,000, which amount
is $2,035,600 greater than the sum of
Increase in loans, less the decrease in
cash; consequently the statement does
not balance. The required reserve was
augmented through the Increase In de
posits by $4,336,250. which sum added
to the loss of cash makes $10,420,050 as
the decrease in surplus reserve to $22.
724,200. Computed upon the basis, of de
posits, less those of $56,097,400 " public
funds, the surplus is 536.74S.550. . The
statement was made on declining aver
ages for cash, the withdrawal of $4,500,
000 gold for shipment to Paris Â¦ on Sat=
urday counted in the return for only
one-sixth of the amount. - Â¦

'The feature of the financial markets
this week has been the abundance and
cheapness of money and the neglect",
verging sn stagnation, of the market
for securities. The effect has been so
discouraging to operators that even
the. professional traders have almost
abandoned their efforts.
The extreme ease which has develop
ed in the world's money markets since
the Panama payment first came up
for consideration has prevented any
disturbance. The placing of the' New
Ynrk City bond Issue, the largest single
block ever offered by the city, was
equally without disturbing effect on
the market. The issue price of these
bonds was low compared with the
older issues, but the advance in the
price over the preceding issue was re
garded as indicating a turn for the
better in the outlook for investment
demand. The placing of half of tht
$50,000,000 Japanese loan in New YorK
Is taken as evidence in the same di
rection, and the details of the Russian
loan in Taris define -another of the
uncertainties before the financial
world. Receipts of Japanese gold con
tinue to relieve the drain on gold ex
ports to Paris, and currency from the
Interior continues to accumulate in
New York banks. This evidence*of de
clining business activity is an im
portant factor in causing the halt lr
1 the securities market. Dissatisfaction
I with the iron and steel trade outlooli
! is an important influence on the preva
lence of dullness and hesitation of spec
ulations. Railroad earnings, both gross
and net. reflect the falling off In traf
fic from last year's level and the hlgfc
level at which operating expenses re
main. The strike of machinists on thÂ«
Atchlson system had some slight ef
fect. The formal statement by E. H,
Harriman of his hopeful views of thÂ«
business and industrial outlook In thâ¬
"West and Southwest had a sustaining
result in the market. . , â¢ >. .
The tone of the bond market has been
rather better than stocks. United
States 3s registered have declined }*,
the 3s coupon, the 2s and the old 4s M
and the new 4s % per cent, on call
during the week.

which prevailed before the' Northern
Securities decision was handed down
and that had been unequaled for many

The big grand stand was crowded

"We are too apt to look beyond our
local community and we lack in local
public spirit. If we take on the same
public spirit as Chicago, or nearer
home, Los Angeles, we would develop
a greater amount of local enthusiasm
and might even rival Chicago herself.
"We have the talent, and some good
buildings to show for it, and I doubt
not that the suggestions which we
offer Mr. Bumham in the future will,
with his wise direction, lead to the
same results as the World's Fair in
Chicago, where, as Mr. Bumham says,
he had to have captains and lieuten
ants to carry out the general schemes
laid in conference by the ac

comment with that of any other town
in the world.
Henry. A- Schulze took up the sub
ject as follow:
, "Mr. President, gentlemenâ I know
It is a pleasure to you all to have
listened to the words of Mr. Burn
ham of Chicago. Mr. Bumham in his
discourse at the dinner Wednesday
evening spoke about the-work done at
the World's Fair and suggested that
this scheme could 'and should be car
ried on in the same manner, and he
suggested that he would like to meet
the architects of this .city. and discuss
the matter with them. We are among
ourselves and can speak freely with
out being: misunderstood. We remem
ber, in the past,. when several schemes
have been advocated by the chapter
for the Improvement of the town. . One
in particular advocated by a member,
who I am sorry to say is not present
this morning, was for the parking of
certain portions of Market street
around the City Hall, new Postofflce.
etc.. a continuation of the panhandle
to Market street and several minor
features. Other schemes involved the
beautifying of the foot of Market
street: other schemes taking ""advan
tage of our natural hilltops:, all pos
sibly before the right , time. . At ..the
recent , dinner there was a remark
made by a person," .whofshalhbe name
lesF, arraigning: the local profession
and calling the attention to our archi
tecture. It is true it is no better than
it shouldbe. but the, same -may be said
of every city in the United States. We
nre no greater- sinners than our pro
feSElonal'brethren In other portlon3 ? of
the world. The beauties of some of
the older edifices in the town and in
the Latin quarter will stand favorable
MR. SCHUIiZE RESPONDS.
"There is much in . our problem that
is obscure and vague, and any plans
which we make must adjust themselves
to conditions. But the people will re
ceive a great deal of pleasure from
them twenty-five or thirty years from
now. No man must work for personal
gain, but subserve himself to the good
of the whole. ..â¢ . t
"Small parks ought to be taken Into
consideration. Chicago has recently
bought sites for seventeen public parks,
varying in size from twenty to thirty
acres to three or four. Municipal play
grounds for the young should be con
sidered, and some of these have swim
ming tanks, part of these covered and
part open to the air.
"A community is like a clientâ unless
we possess his confidence we can ac
complish no results. Immediate details
will come after. The man who under
takes this work must be sincere, self
abdicating and earnest.
"The lakes back of the water works
taken in hand can afford many rest
spots. With seat?, walks and shrub
bery they will form an important addi
tion to your â¢ city parkage. I do not
believe the idea of beauty will ever die
away fostered under -these conditions.
In no place on earth save here can be re
peated with; such success the French
and Italian love for beautiful gardens.
I have been generalizing, but I know I
have been talking with sympathetic
people. It is well occasionally to pro
claim your creed. I take it that every
one will help to push along this move
ment"
CONDITIONS MUST GUIDE.
"These fragile plans, which I have
outlined in the most brief manner, are
but the inspiration of a moment and
subject, after consideration and advice
with the local members of the profes
sion, to great and serious changes. No
plan which may be devised but will
meet with oppositionâ and serious and
thinking opposition. These Ideas will
be worked out long alter we are all
gone." â¢
to and fro, thus rendering a new and
novel pleasure resort for the people
in addition to the sylvan glades already
projected. Sophocles' greatest pleasure
was going down to the port of Athens
nnd watching the white wings that

nations. Here, on a like boulevard,,

MUea of wooden "houses built as cheap

I; -t-h'in^ against San Francisco to say
that it is very ugly. This is the condi
tion- even in Europe. You can frame
j?o ordinance of the city or State to
uar away there houses as long as they
belong to individuals. Unless we have
a commune some day they can but re
main.
. ' BEAUTIFY STRUCTCRES.
"Syiipose ihe owners of these houses :
v. ere willingâ t'aat they had the means ;
"then fomeihing might be accom*
j-Jishfd: but they have not the money
' to do it with. But, of course, large
property owners can afford to do so.
â¢ Gradually, of course. It win be done, j
In pent tiili ration to commerce, it will j
â¢ be done. Houses more beautiful and j
'better will be erected. -> !
"TherÂ« is not much hope of altering!
the downtown portion of the city, but t
Â£ in' your own locality you do what j
?ou tan you may afterward
Co something in the old parts of the
town. So I should say. urge the study
of b"eauty of environment upon the
c^en. and improve rather than ruthless-'
ly destroy the houses. Plant shrubs,
ijowers. etc.
*""I would pugtjest covering the mean
â¢ fences and concealing the ugly outlines ,
of the Iioufpf. and very delightful ap- |
<-earar.ces will result. I think almost '
'<Â¦ very individual has a love for the!
â¢j^eaut.ifMl. If any cne of the architects !
here planted a block and put any sug-
Sf-sUons of beauty even on a narrow
fetreet people would go out of tbÂ«;ir way
to turn in on that block. These mat
t<rs are. cf course, slight and changt
. ;;b1e. I do not know that you can
change your architecture, not until the
present peojile have passed away or
vnutil fire comes. It is worthy your
, br*t and careful consideration, and you
rr.ust have your boulevards and means
<>f travel so that you can car.ry people
cheaply around the city. Mr. Me
â¢ 1-aren has shown what can be done.
He har made over woods and dales
'rom a sand heap. Your park is a
w onder.
- USE BROAD PLAN'S.
"Any Fcheme that you have set will
Lave to be a broad one. Things must
fiVst be studied in the mass and no at
tention paid to detail. This will come
la<er. One beautiful route would be
starting around the bay and having a
boulevard to the Presidio. The great
'.est improvement that I saw at the Pre
. f ! .<i!o was the forest planted by Gen
eral Brooke, which covered the hills
â¢ like a carpet of moss, with all the
varied colors of the palette. This boule
vard need net be at the same height,
â¢ hut like that at the port of Washing
- ton. which covers the low parts with
..â¢â¢rches of concrete, the lower portion
used as warehouses, thus eub-
Ferrir.g two endsâ utility and beauty.
A great rliarm therefrom will be the
watching of the shipping as it passes

M. M. Kemp, formerly proprietor of
a lodging-house at 216 Post street,
whose default in a suit to foreclose a
mortgage on his furniture was re
cently entered, thereby .causing him
to lose the suit, applied yesterday to
have the default set aside. He claims
that his default Was entered by Ray
G. . Hudson, attorney for J. E. Sills,
who held the mortgage" on his furni-;
ture and that he only<recently learned*
that Hudson had violated, his promise
to , have it set aside and give him a
chance to defend the suit.
The first central station for incan
descent lighting was built by the Edi
son company on Hoiborn' viaduct, Lon
don, In 1882. .
Loss Sustained by Hop Wo Benevolent
Association Throuch Lcavine a
Lamp Near Curtains.
Fire was discovered yesterday morn
ing shortly after 10 o'clock issuing
from a large window in the josshouse
of the Hop Wo Benevolent Association
at 751 Clay- street. When the firemen
reached the scene they found the front
door locked and had to force an en
trance through the roof. They soon
had the fire under control.
The members of the association had
been holding their annual festival in
the josshouse and left about half an
hour before the flre was discovered.
It is supposed that a burning lamp,
which had been -hanging near the cur
tains of the large window,' had set fire
to the curtains. The Idol In. the Joss^
house was untouched, but many of the
ornaments surrounding it were de
stroyed by the fire. The contents were
Insured for $1000, which will cover
the loss. . < r

Yafa-Jerusalem railway, although' it is
owned by Frenchmen.

Clubmen at Luncheon.
The University of California Club
held its regular monthly luncheon at
the California Hotel yesterday. About
thirty-five members of the organiza
tion attended the affair, at which
President A. J. Cloud presided. Dur
ing the progress of the luncheon
President Cloud addressed those pres
ent on matters pertaining to tire club
and particularly to the new rooms,
which It has Just opened at the south
east corner of Powell and Geary
streets. He stated that the club was
making great progress and was rapid
ly increasing its membership. On
Tuesday evening next the annual elec
tion of officers will take place in the
new clubrooms.-
Shoe Firm Seeks Damages.
Denies lilslop's Charges.
. The Eastern Shoe Manufacturing
Company filed a suit yesterday for
$100,000 damages against Esther
Flelsher, widow of Wolf Fleisher and
administratrix of his estate. The com
plaint alleges that the plaintiff was
damaged to the extent of the sum
Fued for by an atachment of its busi
ness maliciously placed upon it by
Mrs. Fleisher.
Henry A. Brown, paying teller of
Wells, Fargo & Co.'s Bank, filed an
answer yesterday to the suit for
$50,000 damages for alienation of af
fections brought against him by
Gecrge W. Hlslop. Brown specifically
denies every charge made by Hislop
and emphatically states that he never
at any time did anything that would
tend to disrupt the Hlslop household.
A change has been made in the Na
tional Guard of California in relation to
the small arms firing. All small arms
firing regulations of whatever nature
that were formerly standard for the
citizen soldiery of the State have been
revoked and the regulations approved
by the Secretary of War for the gov
ernment of small arms firing for the
use of the National Guard of the differ
ent States have been adoDtedin this
State and will hereafter be the guide
for target practice.
An . order has been issued that no
range in this State shall be used for
the firing of the 30-callber United
States magazine or carbine (Krag-Jor
gensen) recently issued to the guard of
this. State at target practice until ex
amined and reported upon as to its
safety by an officer designated by in
struction from the office of the adju
tant general.
Commanding officers that are able to
pxocure proper and safe ranges will be
required to make requisition on the
chief of ordnance for 2000 ball cartridges
for preliminary practice. The issue of
such ammunition for such practice will
continue only so long as the supply and
appropriation will permit, the money
available being inadequate to carry on
a proper system of target practice in
view of the. present increased cost of
ammunition.
CHAMPIONSHIP COT OUT. !
Owing to the fact that the Springfield
rifles, with which the record practice
of 1903 was made, have been returned
to the United States Government, and
that there is no available range upon
which to fire the new arm and, the
most important fact of all, that the in
creased attendance has made the an
nual championship rifle and revolver
contest so expensive as to be out of all'
proportion to all benefits derived, there
will be no championship contest for the
current year. But in view of the fact
that the United States War Depart
ment is taking a deep interest in the
target practice of the National Guard,
it is expected that in a year or two a
scries of championship contests will be
arranged through the assistance of the
department at Washington, not only
for the State, but for the United States
aa well, which will provide. foV full par
ticipation of the National Guard.
Adjutant General Lauck in a recent
order from headquarters at Sacramen
to rakes negligent officers over the
coals for neglect to transmit reports
within the time prescribed. He says:
"When the condition is such that a
stated report cannot be prepared and
forwarded so- as to reach the adjutant
general's office inside of three months
it is certainly a disgrace to the Na
tional Guard of the State and a woeful
commentary on the efficiency of a large
number of the officers of the guard and
the naval militia."
The time for completion of the in
spection and muster of the National
Guard by a State inspector has been
extended until May 15, for the reason
that no officers of the division staff
are available for detail to complete the
inspection within the time heretofore
prescribed. Thus far the inspections
have been conducted in part by Colonel
Koster, Major Schmitt and Captain
Kelly.
CO>DIISSIONS ISSUED.
Commissions have been issued as fol
lows: To Norris King Davis, to be ma
jor and aid-de-camr> on the division
staff: James Hanford Cambell, to be
major and brigade Inspector of the
First Brigade, vice Thomas, commis
sioned major and Inspector of rifle
practice; Shad worth Oldham Peasley.
to be second lieutenant and inspector of
rifle practice. First Battalion of Artil
lery, vice Emmel, promoted.
The adjutant general's office has is
sued in book form the- general and spe
cial orders that were promulgated In
1903. It has also issued a compilation
of the laws relating to the militia, Na
tional Guard and Naval Militia of Cali
fornia. Both books are useful for the
use of the guard.
An election will be held in the First
Infantry May 24 for two majors, vice
Filmer and McCreagh, terms expired.
Colonel Wilhelm has examined the
range at San Jose for target practice,
but finds that It is not desirable for the
purpose.
Company B, Fifth Infantry, Captain
Holtorn, located at San Jose, Is having
its armory renovated and many Im
provements will be made. New lockers
are to be built eo as to accommodate
everything that belongs to each man
that. he requires in the service. The
company at its last meeting was visited
by Colonel T., R. Scott, a retired army
officer, who addressed it at some length
and gave interesting reminiscences of
the Civil War. The company has ap
pointed a committee to arrange for a
smoker and banquet in the near future.
During the latter part of the month
the company wll have its first shoot at
Schuetzen Park.

with Joy when Evangelist George

man, and his wife assured Judge Mo
gan that they would attempt her con
version to better living if she were al
lowed X.a accompany them.
"Take her along," said his Honor,
"and If you succeed in leading her to
the light there will be no further ques
tion as to the efficacy of your reforma
tory system. She has been before this
court for drunkenness and vagrancy
more times than I care to enumerate
and.lo.ng ago I gave her up as hopeless.
However. It will be" Interesting to watch
the development of the test case In
your hands. Take her away, and may
good luck attend your endeavor."
But he could not positively identify the
men as his assailants, because the at
tack was made in darkness.
On the evidence thus adduced Judge
Mogan felt justified in sending the case
to the higher court.
Fred Lawrence, Fred Goodman and
Fred Duckhard must answer In the Su
perior Court the charge of robbery with
violence, and their ball Is fixed at $3000
apiece.
L. Kessler was robbed of $18 .cash,
a hat and a revolver by three men who
fc-llowed him from a saloon to his room
at 321 Pacific street. They beat him to
Insensibility and kept his face covered
with a pillow while they plundered
him. Then they locked him In the
apartment and not until four hours
later did the other lodpers in the house
learn of what had happened. .^
Meantime the three defendants above
named were .overhauled by Patrolmen
McGrayln* and Wren, who- saw them
acting In a suspicious 'manner at Pa
cific and Sansome streets. In their pos
session the 'officers found i Kessler's
money, hat and pistol, all of which
were subsequently identified by him.
reminder that his â¢ next arrest will be
followed by punishment.
Once upon a time a colored gentle
man was arraigned on the charge of
plundering a poultry yard, and when
the c!erk of the court had read the
formal accusation and asked, "Are you
guilty or not guilty of stealing chick
ens?" the defendant promptly replied,
"Net suilty, yo* Honah." The evidence
was insufficient to convict, and after
the case was dismissed the lately ac
cused whispered to his attorney, "It
am a good* thing dat dc clerk didn't
say ducks instead of chickens, kase
I'se slch a conscientious man he'd a
had me, .siuih."
The story was recalled by the neat
way in which Judge, Mogan trapped
James' Edwards, arrested for accosting
women on Montgomery street and de
manding money, into a confession that
he was an ex-convict. Edwards plead
ed that he had never before been ar
rested for drunkenness or begging, and
the eyes of the Judge scanned him
sharply before the inquiry was put If
he had not once been convicted of bur
glary.
"Well, I did my three years for it,"
sullenly answered James Edwards.
"Six months In the County Jail,"
said the Judge.
"It was a guess," his Honor after
ward admitted. "I had never seen the
fellow before, but 'criminal' was so
plainly depicted upon his face and be
trayed by his manner that 1 made the
venture â and won. If I had said any-,
thing else than burglary, however, he
would have had me nonplused, sure."
Then ' the shrewd magistrate took
upon himself the role of arbitrator, and
with neatness and dispatch effected a
settlement of the dispute that had led
to the separation of Mr. and Mrs. B. K.
Leach and j the husband's arrest for
failing to provide for the couple's two
young children. Mrs. Leach, a pretty
little matron, did not seem eager t6
prosecute anyway, and Mr. Leach, who
gave his occupation as clerk, did not
look like a man .that would willfully
neglect ' his offspring. These indica
tions were quickly noted by the Judge,
for he said: . Â¦
"You people would better sit down to
gether on that bench there and talk
over the situation before, we go . any
further with the case;Â£*Sv Â¦ - '-'Â¦Â¦Â¦ ' '
; The suggestion ywas ill adopted, and

and whispered .that a-truce had been

George Gogadus and his wife, Orey,
will be sentenced to-morrow for having
deserted and willfully neglected their
five-year-old son until starvation
threatened him. In the case of the
woman no lenience is likely to be shown
by Judge Mogan, 'as the testimony
heard yesterday depicted her as a most
unnatural mother, addicted to, drink
and utterly careless of what might be
come ol her helpless child. The hus
band, however, may be punished less
severely, because he proved rather con
clusively that the boy's starving con
dition was unknown to him, as he was
absent frc-m the city and because wit
nesses gave him a good reputation for
sobriety and industry. t Meantime the
little one has been sent to the Youths'
Directory, where Its future will be look
ed after by the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children.
One c-f the neighbors of the defend
ants, a Mrs. Beattie, pathetically told
the court of how the little chap had
entered her house last Sunday evening,
after he had been without food or care
for three days, and asked her for some
thing to eat. He was so weak he could
hardly stand and his general condition
was pitiable. As she fed him she learn
ed of how he had been all alone in the
house at 1063 Howard street since Fri
day morning, when his mother had left
him without any provision' for his sus
tenance. He had sobbed and starved
until he could no longer bear the hun
ger pangs, and then he went begging,
z Mrs. Gogadus tried to mitigate her
awful conduct by calling to testify In
her behalf a Mrs. Martin, at whose
house on Sixth street she alleged she
had been working during the period of
her absence from home, but Mrs. Mar
tin was so far gone in inebriety that
she could nelth r t, speak Intelligently

was caught In the act of stealing them
from Justin Caroul's lodging-house, at

Mr. Aiken, one of the lodgers, testi
fied that he it was who first met the
defendant as he was trying to escape
with a pillow under each arm. "Where
did you get 'em?" inquired Mr. Alken.
"Just bought 'em from the landlady,"
replied Mr. McCabe. "Let's see about
that," Mr. Aiken suggested.- Then. Mr.
McCabe threw down the' pillows and
ran four blocks ere Mr. Aiken overtook
and grabbed him. "Say, sport," then
quoth Mr. Â«McCabe, "what are you but

quest was spurned, and Mr. Aiken
clung to Mr. McCabe until the arrival
of a policeman rendered further cling

THERE is a disquieting rumor that a concession is

alley in Yosemitc Valley. Of recent years there
has been too much disposition to impair the primitive
beauty of that valley. People who go there in the right
purpose arc attracted solely by the matchless natural
grandeur of the place. It is the one peculiar spot that
has no rivalon the planet. It is the last place on earth
that should be given over to catch-penny business and
midway plaisancc attractions. Yet a tawdry village, offi
cial in its origin, has been created there, and the nobility
of. nature is sacrificed to the' profit of souvenir fakers
and all sorts'of people whose presence and business are
unnecessary to the sane enjoyment of the wonders na
ture wrought.
Proper and comfortable hotel and camp accommoda

occasion.. Fire companies, ..military organizations and
many civic societies regularly enroll themselves among

M. W. Marsden of Philadelphia* and
Joseph Wile of Kentucky, who several
months since had a lot of cotton stalks
shipped to Philadelphia to have them
analyzed, to find If there a-sls some
thing valuable in them, returned to
Gonzales recently with samples of what
was found in them and exhibited the
same to a meeting of citizens. The
stalks were found to contain 5 $2 to $4
worth of sugar to the ton, to make fine
samples of paper superior to wood pulp,
two pieces of material' resembling cel
luloid, smokeless powder composition,
alcohol and a valuable fertilizer. Mr.
Marsden thought that an acre of aver
age stalks would amount to about
three tons, and that in the South 70,
000,000 of stalks were going to waste
that were capable of producing that
many hundred million dollars. These
gentlemen show their faith In their in
vestigations by offering to erect a plant
at Gonzales for the conversion of the
stalks into the various articles shown
at a cost of $75,000, with a possible in
crease to $250,000, if the citizens would
take $25,000 preferred stock. There â¢ is

The artistic world has lately noticed
an inclination on the part of the King
to grant more sittings to portrait
painters than at any previous time in

Some distance to the northward is a
lake which disappears for weeks at a
time. This sheet of water, -known as
the Lake of ZIrknitz, is about four
miles long and from two to three miles
broad. Villages, chapels and castles
are reflected In its waters. Frequently
in July, although not every year, the
waters begin to disappear, and in
August the bed, fifty feet below the
surface at some points, at times grad
ually appears.
From twenty to twenty-five days are
required for the entire lake to be dis
charged. When the bed is revealed the
peasants plant crops of barley where
only a short time before they were
drawing their nets. The bed remains
uncovered sometimes for many weeks.
The peasants gather their barley and
hay from the bottom In the meantime.
Then with a rush the waters return,
the basin being refilled sometimes in a
period of twenty- four hours. â¢
The limestone which forms the bed Is
perforated with a vast number of cav
erns and fissures. Nearly, thirty of
these are visible. They are funnel
shaped, and some of them are fifty
feet deep. The peasants give them
names, such as the kettle, the sieve,
etc. There are twenty-eight openings
which draw water off, only twelve of
which both* draw off and discharge

the hope of recovering: from what ailed

succeeding in getting well. But with
returning health he made the sad dis
covery that one of the supreme joys
of his life had been destroyed. For
years he had t-Â«en accustomed to an
occasional "nip" or two at various
hours oi the day, delighting in the re

aration that adjusted >.is being nicely

soul from melancholy. The only draw
back to the health resortj indeed, was
the absence of Colorado tanglefoot, and
his returning health was doubly wel

alas! on entering the first thirst em

for $23,000 damages, and the .ease is on.

During th$ past few days there has bcen-held in the
Mechanics' Pavilion a pure food exposition under the
auspices of the Retail Grocers' Association. Visitors
who have attended the display have been offered the
opportunity to see for themselves what a good, pure food
product was and to make comparison between that and
many of the articles that have long held place on their
pantry shelves unworthily. A general campaign against
food adulterations, official or otherwise, is at all times
in order. It can never be effective until all consumers
awake to the dangers that, are constantly threatening
them and unite through common- knowledge of the frauds
to bring about their speedy termination.
NOT long ago a professor in the agricultural de
partment of the University of Nebraska analyzed
every known brand of tomato catsup, with the re
sult that in 90 per cent of them he discovered the basis
of the condiment to be good old yellow pumpkin, colored
and flavored to fool the consumer. Again in another
State of the East an investigator made the discovery
that in the low grades, of coffee there were three' beans
made of. dough to every one of nature's own product â
a discovery by the way which had its precursor in our
own city several years ago. Thus the tale runs of glu
cose honey, spices made of wood dust, and fruit pre
serves thatMiave nothing fruity about them save the
coloring.
Our pure food experts recognize two classes of food
frauds: the one that substitutes for the ostensible
article another which is cheaper but not necessarily de
leterious to the health of the consumer? and the one
that makes use of poisonous substances deliberately for
the purposes of preserving or giving color to the food
compound foisted upon the market. In the first instance
the adulteration is very often performed with foodstuffs
every whit as nourishing as the real article â beef fat,
glucose and pumpkin have their high percentages of
nutriment; no harm is thus done the consumer save that
of simple fraud. But in the case of adulterants poisonous
in their nature the public is being daily endangered by
"prescrvalines" and the like, which are nothing more or
less than formaline, a poisonous chemical compound.
Mineral coloring fluids containing arsenic and lead salts
arc not uncommon a'dulterants; unhealthy yeast ferments
and mineral "quick-rising" powders add their quota to
the danger.' -'.
OfTcoursc our officials of the Department of Agri
culture at Washington and the scientists of the agricul
tural experiment stations in every State are unceasing in
their endeavors to root out the evils of fraudulent foods.
State laws obtain nearly everywhere making it a crime
to sell adulterated foods under false labels, and boards of
health in all our large cities concern themselves with the
same problem. But the same old food frauds continue in
the most ingenious guises. If the company flooding the
market with adulterations does comply with the law in
the matter of placing on the package of the prepared
food offered for Sale an analysis of its chemical contents,
it will cover this statement with a filigree work of design
or hide it under the smallest of possible type, and the
indulgent consumer goes on his way in blissful ig-

the tax has been paid year after year
without any kick. Now, at last, some
one has appeared audacious enough to

money should be bestowed on them is
another archaic mystery. It is expend
ed in all sorts of queer ways. Items
\ such as whitewashing the barracks and

rr-* HE Democratic sons of harmony are an odd. lot.
I Mr. Belmont wants harmony and went up to
* Washington to find it. While he was experiment
ing with his tuning fork Mr.' Hearst went at him with
his pitchfork and told him to his face and in large type
that he is a predatory and improper person, of the kind
doomed to the county jail ' and unhappiqess when Mr.
Hearst gets settled in Lincoln's boots and the White
House. Then Mr. Villard of the New York Post sought
harmony editorially in that old and interesting publica
tion, whereupon Mr. Hearst accused Mr. Villard of rob
bing his sister and sympathizing with Grove Johnson.
It is supposed that the origin of the aspiration for
harmony is to be found in Princeton, New Jersey, when
Mr. Cleveland is at home, and otherwise wherever the
fish arc biting when he is not. This supposition is dis
quieting to Mr. Bryan and no less so to Mr. Hearst.
When the sounds of Democratic contention cease and a
harmonious silence falls blandly and peacefully as a love
ly sunset, Mr. Bryan and Mr. Hearst both stick their
fingers in their ears and cry out, "Who made that si
lence? It's Cleveland."
Mr. â Cleveland has a sense of humor, and in his old
age it has not departed from him. A leading actor in
the events that were staged for history in the last cen
tury, he bore strange burdens and was a past master in
the gentle art of making friends and also enemies, and
they both stick to him like hotel pasters to a globe-trot
ter's trunk. One of the most serious crises of Mr.
Cleveland's second term was the weakly and anaemic
condition of the treasury. Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Car
lisle were watching nights with the gold reserve when
it was so sick it could not sit up and notice things, and
really the national credit was getting ready to quit the
job. Of course men differ as to the cause of this. Some
say it was due to a falling off in revenues caused by
tariff tinkering, and others that the endless chain of
greenback redemption was drawing out gold and the
President couldn't stop it. Whatever the cause, it was
the plain duty of the President to preserve the public
credit and save the Government from bankruptcy. Upon
this all were agreed.
Mr. Cleveland tried to get his party to help him pre
vent national insolvency, but it said unto him, "Ha! hall
go to. The public credit is to us no more than a tinker's
dam, which is made of wet bread. We are for green
backs, poor silver and well executed counterfeit cur
rency. Go chase yourself around the White House lot."
Whereupon Mr. Cleveland, having only a few Jiours left
before the last riches in the treasury would take to them
wings and fly away, proceeded to ring in a hurry call for
J. Picrpont Morgan, August Belmont and the few others
who had not been sent to the poorhouse by the hard
times, and using what little legal authority he had, and
a lot of patriotic sand, persuaded them to give up a few
millions to save the treasury.
It was borrowing money in time of peace, and Mr.
Bryan, who up to that time had never had more than
$4 75. denounced it as a crime. He could not have bor
rowed $io himself, and took it as personally offensive
that a President whom he disliked could borrow $60,000,
000 between sundown and sunrise. â¢
Mr. Cleveland's offense in the eyes of Bryan and
Hearst seems to have been that when he wanted money
he went to the men who had it, instead of appealing to
those who had none. The country was full of busted
bankers, and Mr. Cleveland was expected to borrow of
them instead of going to Mr. Morgan and Mr. Belmont,
who were still solvent.
The ex-President has just printed a too long but very
lucid and satisfactory explanation of his action. It is in
the interest of harmony, to soothe the sore heart of the
Democracy by proving that the only President it has
elected since 1856 was not a common thief. But just
look at the effect on Mr. Hearst! He declares it to be
a defense of ' Mr. Belmont, who has been proved over
the longest leased wire to be outside the almshouse and
jail when he should be in both. Mr. Hearst writes and
prints in vitriol his opinion of Mr. Cleveland. He also
declares and' does it boldly that Mr. Belmont is the agent
of Rothschild! That settles it that we are to have Roth
schild in this campaign. Harmony may pack her thing3
and go.
Dr. Beverly Cole, the late dean of.
the Medical Department of the Univer
sity of California, at times during the
last years of his life was troubled
with a loss of memory. It greatly em
barrassed him and he strove to hide
the fact that his great mind was slow
ly but surely giving way before the
weight of his years. He did not al
ways succeed, greatly to his chagrin.
It was only a few. months before his
death that he had a little experience
that brought home to him the fact that
he was getting old.
It happened in this way: One Sun
day, when he was awaiting the arrival
of an important letter, it dawned upon
him that mall was not delivered on
Sundays. He accordingly went to the
postofflce station nearest his home, and
took his place In line with the fifty or
more people on the same errand as
himself. When he reached the window
he asked if there was any mall for
him. The man at the window handed
him a slip of paper and a pencil and
said: "Step over to the desk and write
your name. Next."
Dr. Cole withdrew and went to the
desk as directed. He started to write
and suddenly stopped. He bit the pen
holder, scratched his. head, looked
sheepish, and finally swore and drop
ped the pen. Then he picked it up
again, but without better results. He
could not remember who he was and it
was only when an acquaintance step
ped up and said "Good morning, Doc
tor," that he regained the use of his
faculties. Then in a rapid manner he
wrote Dr. Beverly Cole, stepped over
to the window, handed in the slip and
got the letter he was looking for.

of the country dailies to the coming celebration that is

import may be found in a journal published in the upper
end of the San Joaquin Valley.
The advantage of this is mainly its effect upon the
minds of the boys and girls. â¢ So many topics are now
taught in the schools that there is not great time for any
one. History*is a part of the course of public education
in many grades, but American history is not taught as
thoroughly as it might be. There ought to be no topic
more engrossing to the American boy and the American
girl than the story of American independence. When
the significance of that is lost* American patriotism will
be harder to define. Therefore it is well that the interior
shall continue, year after yyr, to make much of the
Fourth of July. It is an example which. the cities might
profitably emulate proportionately to their population.

BERKELEY. May 7. â Chicken
cholera, that dread disease that has
been a destructive element among the
poultry ranches of California, is not
such a terror after all, providing that
it is dealt with quickly and intelli
gently. At least that is what Profes
sor A. R. Ward, professor of veterin
ary science and bacteriology at j the
University of California says about it,
and he ought to know, for only re
cently he saved the poultrymen of
Marln County from large loss by
crushing out an epidemic that had be
gun among their fowls.
In a bulletin issued at the university
to-day Professor Ward discussed the
cause, effect and cure of the disease.
The results of observation, he says,
showed that the disease is introduced
into the body through 'food and water
infected with bacteria. To prevent
contamination the roosts must be dis
infected, the feeding and water
troughs cleansed daily and the col
onies moved to fresh ground. Infec
tion through the water is prevented
by placing a' weak solution of corro
sive sublimate in the fountains. The
prompt slaughter and disposal of all
sick chickens is necessary to prevent
a spread of the disease. In conclusion
Professor Ward says that the evidence
"oes to show that chicken cholera is
comparatively easy to control.

* OAKLAND, May 7.â Miss Birdie
McGinnis, who left the home of her
mother at DOS Telegraph avenue yes
terday, is on the way to visit her
father at Fresno. This much waa set
tled by. the police to-day. Mrs. Mc-
Comb, a family friend, says that the
young lady visited her residence short
ly before her departure and stated her
intentions. Mrs. McComb's daughter
saw Miss McGinnis safely started. The
police have been trying to head her
off by telegraph, but she is in hiding
somewhere and it is supposed that the
father will come to meet her. ' The
The following matches were played:
Sidney Salisbury and Frank String
ham beat Harry Rolfe and Harry But
ler, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2, 7-5; Grant Smith and
Dr. Hill beat Frank Mitchell and Her
bert Long, 5-7. C-3, 6-2; Will Allen
and Tracy Crawford, tied, 4-6, 6-4;
Merle Johnson and Crawford beat
Harry Haight and Charles Kuehn, 6-2,
6-3, 6-0; Hardy brothers beat Drs. Hill
and McChesney, 6-3, 6-3, 6-0, 6-8;
Haight tied Johnson, 6-2, 4-6;
Prltchard and Koehler beat the Lisser
brothers, 6-4, 6-1, 6-1, 6-4; Long beat
Allen, 7-5; Dr. Noble and Pritchard
beat Lisser brothers, 6-4, 6-1; W. S.
MacGavin tied Long, 6-4, 3-6.
Tracy Crawford and Allen played
two sets, in which the honors were
evenly divided, each winning a 6-4 set.
Haight and Johnson also played a
tie. Haight won the first set, 6-2, and
Johnson the second, 6-4.
In the singles the matches did not
go over two sets, as the courts were in
great demand. Herbert Long beat
Will Allen in a fast one-set match.
Long next played the veteran W. S.
MacGavin. The latter caused quite
a surprise by playing a tie with his
younger opponent. MacGavin's strokes
are as good as ever, but he is a little
shy on wind and speed.
Sidney Salisbury and Frank String
ham proved too strong for Harry
Rolfe and Harry Butler. The best the
latter could do was to win one set out
of four.
Merle Johnson and Tracy Craw
ford had any easy time beating Harry
Haight and Charles Kuehn. The last
named player could not stand the pace
set by the other three, although he
was at his best.
The California Tennis Club courts
were in great demand yesterday, as
most of the crack players turned out
for practice. Some high-class matches
were played in both singles and dou
bles, but the latter were more num
erous o"n account of the number of
players in waiting.
The feature was the reappearance |
of the Hardy brothers as a team, j
Sumner has been playing several times i
a month of late, but Sam has been out
of the game for some time. Sumner
is playing almost as well as ever, while :
rfam appears to have gone back but !
little. In a four set match with Drs. j
Hill and McChesney. the ex-champions !
easily carried ofÂ£ the honors despite !
the fact that the medical men played !
excellent tennis. The Hardys won the j
first three sets, the third being a love
set, and lost the fourth. I
Another fast doubles was that in j
which Dr. Hill and Grant Smith de- Â¦
feated Frank Mitchell and Herbert !
L,ong. Smith and Hill lost the first set
after having a good lead, but won the
next two easily. Hill played a bril
liant net game in the last two sets and
was the star of the four. Mitchell and I
Long will play together in the tourna- j
ment to-day and are one of the strong
est teams entered. .

Dr. J. F. Dillon was hurriedly called
in, but the woman was past all medi
cal aid. "When he heard of Mrs. Tibbet's
symptoms Dillon became suspicious
and notified the Southern police sta
tion that he feared the woman had
died of poisoning. Detective Ryan was
detailed on the case. He arrested Pen
der, Doherty and Mrs. Aitken and
placed their names on the detinue
book pending the result of an autopsy.
Detective Ryan thinks Mrs. Tibbet died
of alcoholism. He says the four peo
ple had been drinking heavily for some
time.
The dead woman was 37 years of age
and has a son, Harry V. Tibbet, resid
ing at 123^ East First street, Los An
geles, and a cousin. Miss Opal Camp
bell, living in Redlands. The dead
woman is said to have been divorced
from her husband for some time.
The police are Investigating the sus
picious death of Mrs. Mary Tibbet, who
died last night at 8 o'clock in the room
of a lodging-house at 214 Perry street.
The people that were with the woman
at the time of her death were taken into
custody and held.pending an Investiga
tion into their connection, if any, with
the mysterious death of Mrs. Tibbet.
The dead woman was divorced from
her husband and had been living with
a man named Joseph Pender^ a porter
employed at the Railroad Exchange
saloon, .6DS Fourth street. She and
Pendcr, another woman named Mrs.
Aitken and Bernard Doherty, a marine
fireman, residing at 39 Madison avenue,
had been together for the last few days,
drinking heavily.
Mrs. Tibbet and Pender went out
together Friday night. They went to
the store of C. Saladin, 347 Third
street. "While there they drank some
steam beer and Mrs. Tibbet ate some
beans. Yesterday all day she vom
ited constantly and complained of se
vere pains in her stomach. Shortly
before 8 o'clock last night she entered
Pender's room and said that her stom
ach felt as though it were full of
glass. In a' few minutes she died in
great agony.

three lines, disposed of an - estate
worth more than $1,000,000 and

when it disappeared cannot be said,
though it is positive that it was not

This is evidenced by the finding in
the vault, where the will is supposed
to have been, of a memorandum con

The Piper referred to is Harry Pi

been seen, but he knows nothing of

having made any such memorandum

Perry claims to have been a witness
to Noonan's will, which, he says, dis
poses of an estate worth nearly $200,
000 and names himself and Mrs.
Noonan as executor and executrix re
spectively. . Though Noonan's death
occurred two years ago, the will has
never been filed and its supposed
existence was not known of until a
few weeks ago, when Perry came into
court and asked that the widow be
compelled to produce it. These pro
ceedings were dropped, the widow
having denied the existence of the will,
and then Perry filed a petition to
prove that a will had been executed
and that he and others knew its con
tents.
Frances Noonan, widow of Jeremiah
Noonan, founder of the J. Noonan
Furniture Company, demurred yester
day to the petition of D. E. Perry for
permission to prove the contents of
the last will of Noonan, which has
been lost. Her demurrer is inter
posed on the ground that Perry's peti
tion is ambiguous; that it does not
show upon what date the lost will was
made and that the petition is faulty
in that it does not set up the contents
of the lost document.

Judge Lawlor, in the absence of
Judge Cook,, made an order yesterday
distributing the estate of the late
Caroline D. Fair to the heirs after
hearing the evidence of Charles S.
Neal and Joseph Harvey, administra
tors, and Attorney A. R. Cotton, who
represented the Nelson family.
As it was decided that Mrs. Fair
died before her husband, Charles L.
Fair, the will she made making certain
bequests and the residue to go to her
husband took effect. These bequests
had been paid by Mrs. Oelrichs and
Mrs. Vanderbilt Jr., heirs to their
brother's estate, and have been as
signed' to them, so that there was
nothing left to do but to make an or
der, distributing the estate to them.
Frank Smith, one of the legatees,
has not been heard of for some years
and it Is presumed that he Is dead,
but the heirs agreed, in the event ot
his appearance, to pay the $10,000
legacy to him. There was also enough
money retained to pay the inheritance
tax. Joseph S. Tobin represented the
heirs.

A few days ago she told Mrs. A. J.
"Wells, one of her boarders, that she
intended to commit suicide. The un
fortunate woman had been very much
depressed because her property was to
be sold within a day or two under
foreclosure proceedings. Mrs. Morse
retired at 10 o'clock on Friday even
ing. At 9:45 yesterday morning Mrs.
Wells knocked at her bedroom door,
and, receiving no reply, summoned
the porter. He got into the room
through a window and found Mrs.
Moore seated in a rocking chair in
the bathroom, dead, with her head
resting upon a gas lamp,, the key of
which was open.
Deputy Coroner Michael Brown
made a strict search of the room for
a note or other farewell message, but
failed to find any.

COLONIST RATE PROVES
A BOON TO CALIFORNIA
Men Walk Out "When Their Demands
for Increase In Wages Is Refused.
A number of men belonging to
Sheet Metal Workers' Union No. .104
are out on a strike for an Increase of
pay from $4 to $4 50 a day. The
strikers are composed for the most
part of tinners and Jobbers. Sheet
Metal Workers' Union Xo. 270, to
which those that do roofing work be
long, Is not affected by the difficulties
of Its sister organization. The roof
ers are already receiving $4 60 a day.
Thomas Carroll, president of Union
No. 279, said yesterday: "We are not
concerned in the strike initiated by
certain members of Union No. 104.
nor is their action sanctioned by the
Building Trades Council. We are
working in perfect harmony with our
employers at present and no rupture
of the pleasant relations Is at all Im
minent"
SHKI-7T METAL WORKERS STRIKE
It is further averred that the rail
way company has made contracts with
persons to take the places of strikers
for a definite period of time, and that
't expects to make like contracts with
others, wherefore It asks that strikers
"and ethers be perpetually enjoined from
irf'any* manner interfering with the
m;en'ts cr representatives of the com
pany, or their locomotives, cars or
other property, and from tampering,
destroying or obstructing the same, or
from entering the shops, cars or prem
ises of the company without authority
from- its officers, or from molesting,
threatening or Intimidating Its em
ployes or inducing them to break their
contracts and to leave the employment
of the company.
The Injunction covers only the north
ern district of California. It Is very
'strict and sweeping and prohibits
pickets from entering the company's
premises and talking with the em
ployes.
The company asserts the belief that
einrllar methods will be used toward
Itj men, . and that the strikers intend
to obstruct and delay the transporta
tion dl United States malls, troops and
munitions of war unless restrained by
the court.
It ie further charged that Wilson
threatened that similar means would
be adopted as were in use in a former
strike of the Union Pacific employes.
It Â£= averred also that in other strikes
callfcd by this association many of the
practices mentioned have been resorted
to, and that the machinery and ap
pliances of the employer have been
surreptitiously tampered with and loco
motives and motive pojver have been
â¢injured at the instigation of represent
atives of the association: that em
ployes hired to take the places of strika
crs- have been waylaid, assaulted an<r
called approbrious names and threat
ened with bodily harm so as to induce
them to cult the service of the rail
v'ay company.
The complaint charges that prior to
tailing the strike, certain representa
tives and other members of the asso
ciation had threatened on divers oc
casions to injure, damage and destroy
the locpmotives, motive power, cars,
machinery, etc., of the railway com
pany so as to prevent it from carry
ing on its business, and to harass, an
noy and injure its workmen. Vice
President Wilson is charged with say
ing before the walkout, that If a strike
â¢w'as called means v/ould be adopted
.for crippling or injuring the company's
.er.gines, boilers, motive power, cars,
.machinery, etc., and thereby hinder the
interstate transportation of persons or
property.
. United States Circuit Judge Morrow
Â¦yesterday issued a temperorary in
junction restraining strikers and the
International Association of Machin
ists from injuring or otherwise inter
fering with the property or with the
non-ur.ion employes of the Atchieon,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Com
pany. May 26 at 10:20 a. m. was fixed
as the time for hearing arguments on
tb<e petition to make the Injunction
perpetual.

"Unless there is some understanding
reached between the master horse
shoers and the union between now and
next Tuesday the proposition of the
Citizens' Alliance will be accepted and
men . will be brought from the East
to take their places."
Stablemen were in executive session
last night in Butchers' Hall, Eighth
and Folsom streets, to discuss the
present conditions of their strike. A
delegation from the Hackmen's Union
was present and it was agreed to stand
by the position taken. The Hack
men's Union will take the same stand
for the present and stay with the sta
blemen unless the organization of the
latter decides, upon recommendation
from the Labor Council, to call its
strike off. Such a Btep as that is not
looked for by the men In charge of
labor Affairs, but It may be taken.
"We have withhheld from accept
ing the offers of the Citizens' Alliance
to bring men from the East to take
the nlaces of the men called out, be
lieving that the journeymen might
change their minds and not interfere.
"They also appealed to the Horse
shoers' Union and they notified the
Master Horseshoers' Association that
if they shod for any non-union stable
they would take their men and
stamp out of the shops. As a result
the master horseshoers decided that
so long as they paid their men $4 per
day for services and paid regularly
every Saturday between 3 and 5
o'clock the union had no right to dic
tate for whom they should or should
not do work.
L. C. White, secretary and business
agent of the Stable and Carriage Own
ers' Association, yesterday made the
following statement of the causes
leading up to the trouble:
"The stables of Kelly & Sons, John
Nolan & Sons, M. Conlan & Sons, Wil
liam Michaelson and the United Car
'riage Company deposited $2000 each
with Herbert George, president of the
Citizens' Alliance, to be forfeited in
case any one of them started a hack,
coupe or carriage from their stables
until such time as given permission to
do so by the executive board of the
Stable and Carriage Owners' Associa
tion.
"There has been not a single union
man discharged from association
stables and every union man who went
out of the association stables was
called out by Supervisor T. J. Finn,
who is president of the Stablemen's
Union, and their Valklng delegate,
Chris Reynolds. They called the men
out because we put up 'open shop'
cards, consequently we were forced to
put non-union men in the stables to
care for our horses and vehicles.
"After the non-union men were in
the stablemen appealed to the Hack
men's Union not to drive out of any
stable where non-union men were em
ployed, therefore we have been obliged
to tie up every hack controlled by
members of the association.
Every hack, coupe and carriage In
San Francisco owned or controlled by
the Stable and Carriage Owners' Asso
ciation was without a union driver at
6 o'clock last night. That state of
affairs was brought about by the ac
tion of the carriage owners in resent
ment of what they consider dictation
in their business. They are backed by
the Citizens* Alliance. Thus far the
men who are locked out have taken
no steps which can be charged against
them as unbecoming good American
citizens and their officers say they will
hold that record until the differences
are settled.

Asks for a Divorce on the
Ground That Husband De

A big automobile, belonging to the
Mobile Carriage Company and contain
ing four gay people out for a night of
jollity, turned turtle on the south
boulevard, near Strawberry Hill, short
ly after 8 o'clock' last night. As a re
sult of the spill, Miss Emily Wilder,
409 Golden Gate avenue, and Ernest
Smith, who was running the machine,
wound up at the Central Emergency
Hospital, both badly bruised and bat
tered.
All persons concerned in the smash
up" are extremely reticent regarding
the details and no one would talk with
the exception of the chauffeur. He
stated that he was hailed by a man
and two young women shortly before S
â¢'clock. He was instructed to go with
all speed to the Cliff House and as he
turned into the south boulevard tha
machine 'refused to work and before
he had a chance to ascertain the trou
ble It turned over and spilled the occu
pants.
Smith and Miss Wilder were the only
ones to suffer. The other man and
woman picked themselves up in a
twinkling, according to the chauffeur,
end disappeared as quickly. A passing
automobile picked up Smith and Mlsa
Wilder and conveyed them to the hos
pital.
A comely young woman, thought to
be one of the party, called at the hos
pital and asked regarding Mlsa Wfl
der's condition. When questioned
about the accident, the young woman
became mum. The man who was with,
the two girls could not be located.
Miss Wilder is suffering from a con
tusion of the left shoulder and left el
bow and a slight concussion of the
brain. Smith fractured his left collar
bone and is also suffering from a con
tusion of the left hip. The automobile
was badly damaged by the accident.

Myrtle Estes, defendant In the suit
for divorce brought by Dr. WÂ» B.
Estes, a well-known physician and
surgeon, is of th,e opinion that she and
not her husband is the one that should
be granted a decree. Accordingly shje
has filed an answer to his suit, in
which she denies his charges that she
treated him cruelly and in a cross
complaint accuses him of deserting
and neglecting her and of treating her
in such a manner that she lives in fear
.of her - life. The answer and cross
complaint were filed yesterday.
Estes* Is seeking a divorce on the
ground of cruelty, alleging that Mrs.
Estes once locked him In his apart
ments at the Winchester Hotel and
then by the use of force and violence
had him conveyed from there to a
sanitarium at 1815 Sutter street,
where, he says, he was forcibly re
strained of his liberty. He claims that
such high-handed proceedings caused
him great mental and physical suffer
ing and that his misery was increased
some time late.r when he learned that
Mrs. Estes had visited the battleship
New York and spent considerable time
in the company of the officers of the
vessel. She even, he says, went so far
as to accept presents of Jewelry from
the gallant tars.
EXPLAINS CONDUCT*.
In her denial that she is guilty of
any unwifely conduct, Mrs. Estes says
that her visit to the battleship was
not of such a nature that should
cause any one any misery- She says
she made the visit in the company of
several lady friends and defends her
self against the charge that she ac
cepted jewelry from the officers by
saying that the jewelry consisted of a
stickpin given each of the ladies in the
party as a souvenir.
Referring to the doctor's charge that
she % locked him in his apartments and
then by the use of force had him con
veyed to a sanitarium, she admits hav
ing done so, but without the use of
force. She says the reason she locked
the doctor up was because he was adr.
dieted to the use of morphine and she
simply had him restrained of liberty
in order that she might send for aid to
take him to the sanitarium for treat
ment, hoping that he might be cured
of the habit.
Mrs. Estes has evidently given up
hope, for she does not want to live
with the doctor any longer. She winds
up the long legal document bearing
her signature by asking for a divorce
on. the .grounds of desertion and
neglect, claiming that the doctor never
provided for her as he should and
that furthermore she had to leave him
because of his fear-inspiring conduct.
She also asks for sufficient alimony to
maintain her.
NEILSEXS MAKE UP.
Soren Peter Neilsen of 56 Boyce
street, from whom Bessie Neilsen se
cured a divorce about two months ago,
filed a petition yesterday in which he
asks that the decree be set aside and
announces that he and Bessie have
reached the conclusion that matri
mony is not so bad after all and want
once more to resume the marital re
lations.
Judge Hebbard granted Maxlmil
lian Robles a divorce from Agripina
Robles for desertion.
Annie D. Reid filed a suit for the
annulment of her marriage to Fred W.
Ried. ; The marriage took place at
Reno August 3 last, just three days
after Mrs. Rled secured a divorce
from David S. Brehaut. She now
claims that she' only recently learned
that she should have waited a year be
fore marrying again.

ognized by the Government, which be
stowed upon him th^ star of a brig
adier general.
It was to mark this event and to
enthuse the members of the club in
making' the annual gathering and
games to be held at Shell Mound Park
on Monday, May '30, a success that
the stag party was given. The hall
was crowded and it was acknowl
edged that there had not been such a
large., turnout or Jollier time In the
history of the club.
Chief A. M./Macpherson, after pay
ing a glowing tribute to the valor and
personal worth of the soldier - host,
called upon ex-Chief Angus McLeod

The arrival of Colonel Edward A.

great commotion at the Presidio. Hts
rank entitled him to" select any quar

officer of the post.' His eye lighted on
the beautiful grounds -and commodi
ous home of Major Stephenson, so the
major was politely requested to seek
other quarters. As Major Stephenson
has his two sisters visiting him and
desires to entertain in their behalf, he
will naturally choose the next best
quarters in the line, which will oust
a captain, and this will result m a
grand change all down the line.
Things will be merry in the moving

The wedding yesterday at high noon
of Miss Cora Kirk, the pretty Chicago
maid, and Paul Clagstone of Â¦ River
side was as pretty a ceremony as ever
wrought two loves in one. And sim
plicity, well bred simplicity, was the
keynote of its beauty.
True the quaint little church, St.
Matthew's at San Mateo, was as a
garden, with ferns and fragrant mock
orange and St. Joseph lilies, symbols
of faith and fidelity, lining the aisles
and filling the chancel. But there was
with it all a simplicity of design that
made the perfect picture.
As the town clock told the hour of
noon a gay procession of carriages
arrived, nearly all from Burlingame,
gay as befits a village wedding. And
who will forget the bridal carriage,
with its precious burden in white, with
footman and coachman in white
breeches and white top-boots and
orange blossoms pinned to their stoic
breasts, with white ribbons on whip
and steeds? It was a pretty scene,
and no mistake, when the bonny bride
stepped forth in her wedding gown
and veil, surrounded by Mrs. Francis
Carolan, Mrs. Walter Hobart, Mrs.
Walter Martin and other friends, who,
too, were gowned in fetching fashion,
and the party entered the church, led
by the ushers, Francis Carolan, H.-R.
Simpklns, Cyril Tobin and Joseph O.
Tobin.
The groom, attended by Walter Ho
bart. smiling and . debonair, met his
bride, who was unattended by maid or
matron, at the altar rail and, kneeling
before the Rev. N. B. W. Gallwey, the
two were made one.
The ritual was short and the guests
were soon filing out Into the sunshine,
there to greet the bridal couple. Corot
never painted a lovelier spot than that
little rural churchyard, abloom - with
roses and honeysuckle. . Could happier
spot be chosen for felicitations?
The bride's gown was a girlish affair
of white chiffon cloth fashioned with
graduated tucks. ' The bride being of
svelte figure, its charm lay in the snug
ness of fit arid its simple lines. And
herewith is a suggestion worthy of note
âif you contemplate wedding, little
maids.
Among the handsome women hand
somely f rocked were Mrs. Frank Caro
lan, who wore a lavender satin gown
with a fetching lace yoke showing
the throat, with which she wore a be
coming lace hat: -Mrs. Peter Martin,
always a picture, was a study in blue
blue crepe, with white Valenciennes,
"blue parasol and a' large white hat;
Mrs. Walter Hobart in a clinging white
lace gown, with a large black hat, was
very attractive accompanied by her two
little daughters; Mrs. Will Taylor was
attractively gowned in a figured crepe
and picture hat, while Mrs. Gus Taylor
wore a white lace frock.
It was a notable gathering of the men
and women of^tbe Burlingame set â a!
frank, merry set, to whom life brings
many pleasures and seemingly few sor
rows.
The Clagstones left for Santa Bar
bara after, a wedding breakfast at the
Crossways â the Carolan home. Owing
to the untimely death ,-of Mrs. Sanger
In Los Angeles yesterday festivities at
the Crossways were abandoned.

veyed that Ed Corrigan had -purchased
the contract for $5000.
Jockey J. T. Sheehan will leave with
his employer, D. Zallnsky, for Kansas
City. -
On the strength of his prood second to
Illowaho on Friday, J. V. Kirby was
installed favorite for the closing mile
and a sixteenth selling chapter. It
proved a first-rate selection, for the
Keldin? scored a clean cut win after
David S had tired with cutting out the
running. Past Master, at 15 to 1, ran
third.
. F. Clark, who rode Searcher, favor
ite for the two-mile selling race, got
his dates mixed or Pete Romigh's horse
would have won. The black horse
Possart set the pace for one and a half
miles, -vhen he had shot his bolt. Rio
Shannon, the runner-up, was collared
and disposed of the last quarter by Ex
pedient, excellently ridden by Joe
Jones. Clark waited altogether too
long with Searcher, with the result
that he was fortunate to set the show.
Harry Beck showed he is not worth
SO cents.
the finish downed Rollick less than a
length. Show honors went to Profitable,
a CO to 1 shot.
A mile and a sixteenth selling affair,
with a field of ten starting, followed.
Gold Finder had a slight call In the
ring, but Frowen put up a wild, weird
exhibition in the saddle, and the favor
ite got nothing. McHannon moved up
by degrees with Oscar Tolle, and in a
hard drive received a head decision
ovÂ£r the pacemaker. Resigned. Dr.
Shorb ran a s^ood third.
A. B." Cook, the fast thr^e-year-old
from the stable of Stanfield & Ellis,
defeated Ocyrohe for the Futurity
course sprint next decided. The latter
closed a mild favorite, but was out
footed from the jump. Cook, well
handled by Sheebnn, winning by a
lensrth. Tom Ryan's Clauses gathered
ir. show honors.
NEW. YORK, May 7.â There was a
remarkable attendance at Morris Park
racecourse this afternoon. Competent
experts said the attendance was as
large if not larger than that which was
at the course on handicap day. At
least 40,000 people looked on.
The weather was charming and it was
a perfect afternoon for outdoor sport.
Hundreds of automobiles crowded the
clubhouse inclosure, while the club
house lawns were thronged with
women. The card was attractive, the
features including the Toboggan handi
cap, with a cracking good field of
sprinters. The Bouquet stakes, for two
year-olds, also had an excellent field.
There were also a steeplechase and
several other, good races. The track
was fast.
Hurst Park won the Toboggan handi
cap in rather easy fashion. He was
given a perfect ride by Hildebrand. To
a good start the Keene cast-off soon
secured a favorable position, which
Hildebrand Improved as the race pro
gressed. Entering the stretch he was
second. With little urging the colt
drew clear of his field and passed un
der the wire first by a length and a
half. Kohinoor and Gay Boy had a.
hard struggle for the place, Kohinoor
getting the verdict by a head.
Gold Ten had all the best of a bad
start for the Bouquet stakes and won
easily.
In the New York steeplechase, about i
two miles, six of the twelve starters
fell. Jockey Beamis, who had the I
mount of Moon Daisy, fell at the jump
on the hill and sustained injuries which
may prove fatal. He was removed to
Fordham Hospital in a dying condi
tion. Summary:

The champions were given divers and
many chances to win yesterday at Rec
reation Park, and they took advantage
of enough of the same to get five runs
home. Had they taken advantage of
the whole bunch tney would be scoring
yet. Score, 5 to 2.
Mr. Yerke3 issued five tickets to first
base, and each resulted in a tally with
one exctDtion. The big fellow did not
pitch good baseball, and at times his
support was not the real gilt-edged ar
ticle. He kent. kicking and sulking all
thÂ« time, but could not bluff Umpire
Jim McDonald, who insisted that the
ball come over before he called strikes.
Baum was the pitching kid after the
first Inning. It was then that Uncle's
crowd made all their runs. It started
with a base on balls to Hildebrand.
Waldron hit a drive to Cravath, who
dropped It. Meany got a life on another
miscue. Irwin struck out and Massey
produced a fly. Andy Anderson came
through with a bingle to left field that
brought in the runs.
The Angels got one In the first, and
they came around with two in the
fourth on a little good stick work and
some sloppy fielding. Another was
coaxed home In the fifth, and then the
game went on till the ninth, when the
Angels committed their last.
Cravath saved the day for the
champs in the sixth. With two down
and as many anchored on the bags,
Massey tore off a beeliner right for the
center field fence. Cravath ran back
on it and got it as it was about to
bump the wood. It cut off two runs
and probably saved the game from be
ing broken up on the spot.
Tim Flood was put out of the game
in the second round for arguing a de
cision at second base. He refused to
leave at first, and finally a big copper
escorted him off the diamond. He tried
to sneak back In the field, but the um
pire spotted him and ordered him to
the woods once more. This time It was
off. and he stayed away for keeps. The
score:

NEW YORK. May 7. â At the sale
of horses which were the property of
the late W. C. Whitney, held In the
paddock before the races at Morris
Park to-day, I-eonldas (3). by Ham
burg-Boise, which ran second to Ham
burg Belle In the Futurity last year,
was sold to E. E. Smathers for $16,
000. Mr. Smathers also purchased
King Cole, a year old, by Hamburg-
Black Venus, for $4100.
The French domain In Africa com
prises one-third of the surface of the
continent.
It was too glaring a reversal to be
overlooked, and the Judges ruled that
C. W. Chappell and his stable and
Jockey Tommy Butler* be indefinitely
euspended.
Yellowstone, the 8 to 5 favorite, rid
den by "Handriding" Kelly, captured
the introductory six and a half furlong
exiling run. Away well to a straggling
start, the first choice gradually wort
down the lead of Tom Kingsley, and at
The last furlong Jones closed strong
ly with Veterano, and Butler, astride
Caronal. resorted to rough tactics in
order to get the decision, finally win
ning by a head in l:SSVi. Jones lodged
a. claim of foul, which was not allowed.
Joe Lesser, which was coupled in the
betting with G. W. Trahern. went to
the post favorite and finished third.
The day was ideal for racing pur
poses and a bigr throng gathered to bid
the runners au revoir. The grand
stand was filled with members of the
fair sex, and society found representa
tion en the clubhouse lawn and veran
das. The fields were large, but there
was no discount on form, for two fa
vorites, two second and one third
choice and what may be termed a
mild outsider were returned the win
ners. The betting ring was packed to
suffocation, and the 6lxieen bookmakers
were kept hustling to handle the busi
ness.
â¢ Caronal, at odds of 8 to 1. captured
the mile and a furlong handicap in fast
time from a big field of ten. The de
nouement was not pleasant for either
his owner, C. W. Chappell, or Jockey
Tommy Butler, both being indefinitely
suspended. Caronal started In a handi
cap on Wednesday last, with Butler
up," and after receding from 4 to 8 and
10 made an indifferent showing. The
books laid 8 to 1 about the St. Carlo
horse yesterday. Butler had him In the
lead before half the route had ben cov
ered.
After 150 days of continuous sport,
the most successful meeting in the his
tory of the California Jockey Club was
brought to a close yesterday at Oak
land.

pionship of the Northern California
Golf Association yesterday cleverly
with a score of 182 for thirty-six holes
on the course in Happy Valley.
W. P. Johnson of the Oakland Golf
Club was the runner-up, with a score
of 194. A. G. Harvey won the gold
medal and. W. P. Johnson the silver
medal of the association. A. G. Har
vey also captured a silver cup of
fered by the San Rafael Golf Club for
the best score for eighteen holes made
either in the morning- or the after
noon, with 43, 44; total, 87. Harvey

having won it in 1903 on the San
Rafael course, with 187, with W. P.

PORTLAND, Or., May 7.â Oscar i
Graham, who pitched for Oakland to
day, must have aimed for the home
team's clubs, for when the two hours
and more of . baseball was ended flf- .
teen hits, three of them three-sackers
and two two-baggers, were recorded to
Portland's credit. Murphy lasted two
innings at third. After he had made
three costly errors he was ready and
anxious to go to the bench. Castro
then limped to the infield, and, despite
his injured kneecap, played a brilliant
game. His batting was terrific.
Spencer made good at second and
landed hard on the ball. The score:

XFAVS OF T1IK OCKAX;
The Pacific Mail Company's big liner
Mongolia, Captain John H. Kinder In
command, started yesterday on her
maiden voyage to the Orient. Owing
To the fact that her departure followed
closely the sailing of the Oceanic
r Steamship Company's liner Sierra, the
Mongolia carried comparatively few
liassenpcrs for Honolulu. She had
thirty fur Manila. ho\>evcr, and a total
â¢ number in the cabfn of 105 passen
gers.
I'he Tacific Mail wharf was thronged
with friends of the departing passen
zcjrs and pecrple curious to see the larg
â¢vst liner start on her long voyage. In
.her coats of n<.>xv paint, with decks
scrubbed white and bruswork shining,
the "Mongolia presented a handsome
appearance as she backed away from
tht.- wharf, straightened out on her
Â«.ourpe ar.d commenced her Journey sea
ward.
Although she carried little more than
â¢ half the cargo her holds will accommo
date, the big liner was drawing more
than thirty feet. She anchored off
Jtcivg's wharf and there waited until
high water, when Ehe hoisted anchor
and went to sea by way of the north
channel. Pilot Scott guided the Mon
golia clear of the dangers at the har
ber's entrance.
T.he Mongolia carried about 8000 tons
Vf t.Â»rgo. mostly for Japan.
AV. Morgan Collector of the
Port of Manila, sailed on the liner, ac
companied by his wife. Lyman L
Mo-wry, counsel for the China Com
mercial Company, was also a passen
ger. Count Mutsu of Japan and his
daughter are returning to Yokohama
<>n the Mongolia. Count Mutsu is just
recovering from the effects of an oper
atioii fc-r appendicitis, but went away
in good spirits, having received, a few
minutes before the liner left, official
notification that the entrance to Port
Arthur was bottled up effectively.
.Aanong the passengers to Honolulu
were: Mr. and Mrs. A. II. Afbng. Mrs.
Henry Glass, wife of the admiral com
aianding the Pacific squadron, whose
flagj-hip will be in Honolulu when the
Mongolia arrives; J. It. Harry, port
steward of the Pacific Mail Company,

COMMANDER REPLIES.
Last evening a number of the mem
bers of the commandery tendered the
retiring commander a banquet in the
Maple room of the Palace Hotel. In ad
dition to the guest of honor there were
present as special guests Eminent Sir
W. Frank. Pierce, grand commander of
the Jurisdiction of California, .and Past
Grand Commander Sir B. H. Langley
of the Jurisdiction of Minnesota.
The position of ibastmaster was filled
by Sir Robert B. Moore, who explained
that those present could not allow the
leader of Golden Gate Commandery to
retire from the. position, and particu
larly, as he is to absent himself from
the Jurisdiction, without letting- him
see how much they appreciate his
worth. Â¦Â¦> .-
To-morrow night there will be Instal
lation of the new officers, by the retir
ing commander, and at that time ho
will be the recipient of a valuable
Jewel and a "grandfather's clock" as
tokens of. fraternal love and of appre
ciation of the interest he took as head
of the organization. . ' Â¦'-â¢ Â¦ -â¢ Â¦
"I thank the members of. Golden Gate
Commandery for the, every kindly and
courteous treatjnent accorded me as
their commander during the last year,
which has made.. the work incident to
that office a labor of love and pleasure.
"The Templar year now closing has
not only been a successful and- pros
perous one to .the commahderyi but
also, I am satisfied, a very â¢ enjoyable
one to ; the individual members, and
most-gratifying -to your commander. I
desire to again express, my sincere
thanks for the .cordial apd'Joyal sup
port which I have received during my
year as the executive ol this command
ery from its officers and members, and
for my successor in office and for-those
who in turn will follow- him I earnestly
bespeak the; same hearty co-operation
and support that you have so willingly
accorded- me and" my predecessors. -
"Harmony and sociability, together
with earnest and zealous energy de

Templar principles have marked this,
as well - as preceding- years, and kept
Golden Gate CommaAdery on the high

GIVKX FAHEWKLL DINNER BY
.GQCDEX GATE COMMANDERT.
Â¦- . Sembrich was almost herself again
yesterday afternoon. She sang: to an
audience that filled every nook of the
Alhambra a purely delightful pro
gramme in a purely delightful way.
There was still some small evidence of
strain in the upper range of the voice,
but even that had disappeared in the
"Parla" that closed the programme.
There will be another concert on Tues
day night. Mr. Greenbaum has per
suaded the singer to cancel a northern
date to give it. By that time Madame
Sembrich, who rather unkindly imag
ines that San Francisco is a kind of
hcodoo town for her, will be in such
trim as to persuade her that we are
the luckiest city in her itinerary.
And yet who dare ask a finer delight
than the Paradies and Lotti songs,
"M' ha presso alia sua ragma" and "Pur
dlcestl," or the old French "Mon Petit
Coeur Soupire" as they were given yes
terday;- than the incomparable lilt of
"The Lass With the Delicate Air." In
comparable madame is here in the old
Italian school, as in Mozartâ in its no
ble and elegant gayety, its delicate pa
thos. As encore to this group the sing
er grave the Bizet "Pastorale."
The tour de force of the afternoon
was the "Ernani" "Involami," splendid
ly .sung, its glittering trills and rou
lades the acme of lovely vocalism.
Schubert with "Du Bist die Run," the
"Auftraege" of Schumann, the Brahms
"Wie Melodien" and" "Vergeliches
Staendchen"â the v tetter's delightful
drollery encored insistentlyâ and a very
dramatic song of Richard Strauss,
"Caecilie," formed the next group. The
Strauss song was also repeated and
elicited a second encore, to which the
singer responded with the "Nussbaum"
of Schumann, the very exquisiteness of
lieder singing:. The .Arditi "Parla"
closed the programme.
Mr. Ganz, .whose accompaniments
were again of the best, gave also a
thoroughly musicianly rendering of the
Brahms G minor rhapsody, with three
Liszt numbers and a d* Albert scherzo.
The. Tuesday, programme Includes
'Batti Batti," Mozart; another new
Strauss song, the' Rossini "Bel Ragglo"
ar.d the Bellini "Ah no Credea."

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
March 21. â Mr. Nicholson, from the
committee of Ways .and means, present
ed a'bill .further to protect the seamen
and conjmerce.of the United States
against the Barbary powers.
The bill provides that an additional
duty of 2 % per centum per
annum be laid , upon all â¢ im
ported goods at present charged
with a duty ad valorem, and an addi
tional duty of 10. per cent on all such
duties payable on Â¦ goods Imported In
foreign # vessels. . The^ proceeds of th^se
duties are^o constitute a fund to- be
called the Mediterranean fund. The
duties to cease within three months
after a treaty of peace with Tripoli, in
case the United States are not engaged
in war with some other of the Barbary
powers. The; President is authorized
to cause to be purchased, or built, two
vessels of war, to carry sixteen guns
each, and as many gunboats aa he may
think proper. One million of dollars,
additional to the sum heretofore appro
priated., is placed under the; direction
of the President for the naval service,
which sum' he Js authorized to borrow
at a rate not exceeding " 6. per cent!â
Commercial Advertiser (March- 28).
The KennebunkporCcorrespondent of
the Record recently' was talking with
a lady who is a native of - this â¢ town
whose family was one of the first to
settle in this vicinity. During the con
versation she made the remark "that '
she would rather be denicoed," and
upon inquiry said that she had heard
the phrase used by members of her
family-during her childhood, .but could j
not tell where it originated. Being j
somewhat Interested in historical mat- .
ters. the writer, keeping the expression
in mind, found that in 1T55 the English, '
who were at war with the French and
Indians, had taken the French people
who resided in Nova Scotia prisoners
and had distributed them among the
different towns of the English colonies.
These unfortunates were called the '
French iieutrals. The person assigned
to Arundel, now Kennebunkport, was
Joseph Denico, and thus originated the
expression that rather than have some !
misfortune come to them or do some i
very disagreeable task "they would
rather be denicoed." After nearly 150
years this phrase Was used in ordinary
conversation.â Biddeford ( Me.) Record, i
Ktj-molojjy of "Denlcocd/'
Some amusement was recently caused
among those who attended a S-saay
school prize distribution at Twii.*e i
ham, England. In the early years of
the last century the Rev. G. Cham
pagne was vicar of the parish, and he
left Â£125 in trust, stipulating that. the
interest should be spent in buying
books ' and clothes as rewards* to the
ten poor children who had made the
greatest progress in religious knowledge
during the year. The announcement
that the "Champagne prize" would be
distributed to the young people was so
puzzling that the present vicar deemed
it necessary to make this explanation.â

afi&ijions are about to be made to this

triU probably authorize the building

other squadron of eight battleships. It

Attesting the frequency of golden
weddings in these times are Â¦ the ar
ticles displayed in certain shops of a
special suitability for gifts on such
occasions. In making them the best
quality of silver is used, and then there
is an overlaying of fourteen-karat gold.
So in all that meets the eye the gift
will be of pure gold. Probably i* will
wear, too; outwear, indeed, the recip
ients of it by a good many years, and
descend to other generations as heir
looms to be treasured carefully â thÂ»i
more carefully, it is very probable, be
cause in days to come golden weddings
may be more uncommon than now.
The business of cutting off in their
prime marriages that, if all went well,
Ehonld reach the half century mark, is
in such a flourishing condition in the
divorce courts that golden weddings
must be rarer In another fifty years.â
Boston Transcript.
Golden Wedding Gifts.
Since the earthquake in Palestine last
April some one circulated the story
that the mouth of the river Jordan
had been eo affected by the shock that
the level of the river had been altered
to such an extent that at the place
where the historic river goes into the"
Dead Sea there was now a waterfall of
considerable depth and strength. This
is^ altogether false, and no change
whatever has taken place at or near
the mouth of the Jordan. The writer
has just spent some days there and
made it his special business to inves
tigate this matter. Much has also ap
peared from time to time in the pa
pers and periodicals about steamboats
navigating the Dead Sea. This, too,
is a fabrication. The only boat on the
Dead Sea is a small sailing boat, about
twenty feet long. This vessel makes
trips, as the wind allows, from the
north end of the sea to the bav on
the eastern side of the tongue that
divides the water near the middle.
Here at this terminus some Jews are
located. The whole concern Is, in fact,
in the hands of the Jews, who, at a
low rate, buy wheat and barley from
the Arabs, to be delivered on the sea
shore. From there it is shipped to
the Jericho side and carried on donkeys
to Jerusalem, where it finds a ready
sale at . a good price. When adverse
winds blow the little craft is in danger
of being swamped, for the "so-called
Dead Sea becomes a living mass of
waves. The writer recently spent four
nights such as never be forgotte*
on these waters, and the smartness of
the old man at the helm and his boy
with the three sails saved us from
being wrecked again and again. A
charge of one mejedie (three shillings
and four pence) a trip is made for each
passenger, and for such a unique voy
age It is not exorbitant. There is some
talk about a small steam tug being put
on' the sea, but the authorities are loth
to grant permission. It will be a great
boon when, if ever, it does arrive, as
it will bring the east and west sides
of Jordan nearer to one another for
communication and trading purposes.

THE ONLY VESSEL .
ON THE DEAD SEA
During one of Liszt's visits to ' St.
Petersburg he was invited to a soiree
at the Winter Palace and was asked by
the Czar (Nicholas I) to play. He went
to the piano and began one of his Hun
garian rhapsodies. But the Czar en
tered into an animated discussion with
one of his generals, and, after a minute
or so Liszt, without troubling to Invent
a conclusion to the piece, stopped and
left the instrument. Missing the"*ac
companlment to his talk the Czar sent
one of his chamberlains to ask why
the performance had ceased. "The Czar
mu?t well know," said Liszt, with a
steely flash in his gray eyes, "that
while he is speaking every other voice,
even that of music, is bound to be
mute," and, turning his back upon the
outraged functionary, he stalked out
of the room. â London News.

panions she had gone to the park for
an outing. While playing near the
edge of a cliff she lost her balance and
fell over. The vertical fall" was more
than a dozen feet and the roll down
hill a distance of between seventy
flve and 100 feet. She was picked up
unconscious. Over the left eye there
was a gash and the flesh was laid open
to the bone. Her elbow, knee and
ankle were badly bruised, but no bones
were broken.

six semi-circles, two at each end and
one at each side in the middle. The
goals are marked by wide hoops. Only
six couples, three on each side, can take

i But the fun, the real fun of the
day, raged fast and furious< down byr
the Seventh-avenuc ; gate, where two
rival vaudeville shows fated , each
other. Josenh Rosborough? and Ray
Baker "spelled" for the. Vlncentian
continuous performance and their wit

rested and turned into the fold many
a lamb that else would have wan
dered by.
, Across the way Bernard Miller, in a

the price of admission to. his show,
"the greatest on earth," from 'many a

posted sideshow fashion outside . the
enclosure, promised â¢ much Â¦ and the
promise was creditably fulfilled by -the
i "â¢talent." 'Miss Georgle Cope and Miss
I Margaret Knos repeated- some of the
i prettiest songs and daiices from "The
Geisha," in wliich thay recently made
such a hit that people' are' still talk

some black satin kimona, and Miss
Knox, as . Wun Hi,- wore the conven
tional Chinese costume. Oscar Frank,
who has an excellent voice, .-sang
"Only a Bowery Boy," and Kendall
Fellows gave some of his ever enter
taining imitations. -
Miss Agnes Marie Noonan won the
heart* of her hearers by her original
character, sketches . and impersona

sketch of an old . woman. Her other
numbers' were "Dixie." "Down East":
and "Irish Dialect.".. " She Â¦ showed
marked versatility and- artistic ability.

OAKLAND, May 7. â Although
shade trees are plentiful in the
grounds about Arbor Villa", the resi
dence of Mr. and Mrs. F. M. Smith,
where the great May fete took place
to-day, sheltered nooks were at a
premium, for old Sol had come to see
the fun, too, and from h?s superior
vantage -eyed the crowd in a decidedly
uncomfortable manner. In other
words, it was hot as a day in July and
the demand for cooling beverages ex
ceeded the expectations of.evenVthe
most sanguine al the fair workers that
empty, one's pocket in charity's name.
'Ihe Central Free Kindergarten, the
East Oakiand Social Settlement and

richer by the tropical temperature to
day, for in their respective booths
were to be found delicious icecream
and the coldest of cold drinks. The

District Attorney Decides Their Action
In Passins a Bill Cannot Be
Reviewed.
OAKLAND. May 7. â District Attor
ney Allen rendered an opinion to-day
in which he holds that the action of a
l>oard of school trustees In passing a
bill is final. The question was brought
up by Superintendent of Schools
Crawford, who stopped the payment
of the ralary of H. C. Petray at Hay
var<is for the month of November on
the ground that it had not been
earned.
Potxay was sick that month, but the
Trustees decided to pay him his sal
ary. Crawford contended that the
payment was illegal. The opinion of
the District Attorney is that the Su
preme Court hr.s decided that the ac
tion of a board of supervisors cannot
be reviewed, and he holds that a board
of trustees comes under this decision.
They are the Judgo3 of the services'
rendered ar.d act In a Judicial capacity

Points to Trifling Nature

"Politics, nothing but politics," de
clared Supervisor Harrison D." Rowe
to-day on his "return from an up-coun-?
try trliv to be confronted with ah ac
cusation that he had mulcted the coun
ty of $3S 50 In excess 'mileage fees dur
ing his forty months of service. : : . .,
Rowe says he does not know James
E. Guilbault, his accuser, nor does he
understand what relation Guilbault
bears to those the Supervisor thinks
are behind the attack on him.
"So far as the specific 'accusations
of overcharges are made, item by item,
I can -and will meet them in court.
They are so trivial that of themselves
they show that something more than
a mere pro bono publico spirit has
actuated my prosecutors. My mileage
bills have never reached the legal limit
of {100 a month. They average about
$80 and they are less than those of any
other member of the board except one.
But that is no criticism of the board.
"I have not overcharged Alameda
County one cent, and I defy Guilbault
or any one else to prove it.
"The discrepancy in my mileage bills I
to Sacramento is easily accounted for., j
My travel does not limit itself to the i
distance between stations by rail. I
have to â¢ go and return to the, station
from my home. When I go to Sacra
mento on official business I have to!
travel about a good deal in Its trans- !
action. As I only charge for the miles
traveled; there is a difference in the â¢
amount of the mileage charged. It is !
true 1 rharged forty miles for a trip
to San Francisco to see about repairs '
for our read scraper, but that trip In- ,
eluded much traveling on both sides !
of the bay. I had to make two trips
from my house in Brooklyn to Clare- j
mont. AH those incidental Journeys:
were sharped in a single bill.
"If my accusers had been acting in j
good faith, why did they not present !
their evidence before the Grand Jur>
Instead of 'parading it as a public
record? The question answers itself.
They simply desired to make political
campaign material out of it, well f
knowing that the Grand Jury would!
never give the stuff a second's consld- i
eration." I
Superior Judge Melvin has set the
hearing of the accusation for May 16. i
Armstrong awaited a letter contain
ing information as. to when his niece
might be expected, but that' letter was
delayed and did not arrive until yes
terday.
Armstrong was startled to discover
after reading it that the girl was due
to arrive in this city on train No. 3,
May i. The letter contained a re
quest that A, rmstron Â£ .meet his niece
at the depot. Armstrong hastened to
the Sixteenth-street depot to learn
what he could. The only description
in his possession wtis that his niece
was slight in build, had blonde hair,
and blue eyes and that she was small
for her age. _
One of the railroad officials at the
station said that a girl answering that
description had alighted from train
No. 3 on the date stated in the letter.
She had inquired the way to Twenty
third avenue, and the official requested
a young man who was standing near
to show her to a car. That was the
last seen or heard of the traveler.
.. Chief of Police Hodgkins, when in
formed of the case, detailed several of
his men to make a search.
?The police of this city are seeking
Miss Mabel Armstrong, 17 years of
age, who is supposed ! to have arrived
here last Wednesday. 9
Though her relatives have made
diligent search they have yet been
Unable to find the slightest traoe of
her since she alighted from anoVer
land train at the Sixteenth-street sta
tion. ' The young lady is a stranger in
the city and is not known to have any
acquaintances here.
T. G. Armstrong, uncle, of the girl,
called at police headquarters this
morning and reported the case. Arm
strong; is a landscape garneder and re
sides at Allendale. He stated that the
missing child is the daughter ,of his
brother and has lived in Milwaukee
for. the greater part of her life. Some
time ago her mother died and the
family decided to move West. Miss
Mabel was to come ahead of the
others. â¢

The manager of the earning depart
ment may bring home a pocketful *>f
money every Saturday night, but with
out the intelligence and economic co
operation of the home department man
ager will find himself ere long a bank
rupt. The money he earns JÂ» not . all
his. It belongs to the firm. In man
aging the home, superintending or pre
paring his meals, mending his clothes,
to say nothing of caring for' the chil
dren and performing the thousand and
one arduous and nerve-wearing tasks
that fall to the lot of the busy house
keeper, his wife is doing Just as much
for the success of the firm as he isÂ».
if not more. And if we mean by "sup
ported" that she is an Idle department,
subsisting upon her husband's merci
ful bounty, then the term cannot in
Justice be applied to the average Amer
ican wife. â The Housekeeper.
'This question, which is raised by a
leading newspaper,* recalls our own re
cent symposium on "The "Wife's Pocket
book." Before a definite answer la
given It would be well to understand
clearly "Just what is meant by the term
"supported." â¢ Wives are In the great
majority of cases dependent upon their
husband's earnings for their shelter,
clothes and food, but they are not
"supported" "in the sense that children
are, or pensioners, or objects of public
charity. In the ideal marriage husband
and wife are equal partners. Two de
partments engage the energy and at
tention of the firm â the earning depart
ment and the home department. One
is as important as the other. Each
requires an expert, industrious, watch
ful manager if the firm' is to be suc
cessful.

- A FXA\bUS BON HEUP PAINTING "
FREE WITH NEXT SUNDAY'S CALL .
It is the reproduction of a superb painting by one of that world-famous family of art creators, the
Bonheurs. Auguste Bonhcur is the author of the picture, which equals the best work of bis even more cele-
brated sister, Rosa. This art piecs will be given away, free, with each copy of The -Sunday CalL
Auguste Bonheur in presenting "Highland Sheep" to the world made . as fine a contribution to the art
gallery of the ages as did his illustrious sister, Rosa, when she painted that superbly colored revelation of
animal power and physical beauty, "The Horse Fair." Both pictures are so perfect that they seem to surpass
the power of mere art, for they possess qualities of realism which actually fool the senses.
â¢ AuEfusteVclimb into fame was even nto re arduous than that of his sister, for his very name handi-
capped him. In 184s, when all Paris was talking about .the remarkable, exhibits in the Salon by a voung eirl.
named Rosa Bonheur. who had elected to become a painter, of animals, another Bonheur made an appearance
in the galleries. Thisvtime it was a man, Francois Auguste by name, and a man ambitious to be a painter
of genre. His pretensions were laughed r.t. It was critically concluded that the Bonheur family.' taught by
the father, could produce only one phenomenon. â¢ â¢
But the. following year this genre painter exhibited a landscape which attracted attention. In a few years
rr.ore he was a landscape and cattle painter, esteemed but lmle less than his gifted sister. Auguste Bonheur
found his successive medals and, his red ribbon of the legion. It is quite possible that s the greater fame of his
sister overshadowed his and that he might have won a higher position in art under another name.
"Highland Sheep" is probably the most noted canvas of all Bonheur's art career. It was the talk of
the esthetic world at ! the time of its first exhibition. Now that sheep pictures have become a popular fad al-
most to the extent. of a crazeâ the great paintings of this animal and its environment have doubled in value
and large sums 1 of money are paid for the mere privilege of copying the original picture.. All critics have con-
ceded that Bonheur's "Highland Sheep" is far superior to the works of all others who have made animal
study their specialty. The, only artist who ever eaualed him was his own sister*

growing finely. Spring seeding of wheat and
oat* Is from one -half to two- thirds done; some
localities are about flr.lfhed. Early oats, peas

Fre?Â»ed slowly, on account of wet ground. In

Trade, in old Potatoes "was rather quiet, as is
usually^ thp case on Saturday. ' and previous
prices'ruled for all descriptions. The general
tone ot the market was easy, particularly for
low-grade offerings of Oregon Burbanks, which
constituted the bulk , of the supplies of that
description. Receipts of new Potatoes were
368 racks and there were several hundred sacks
of carried -over stock on the market^ Occa
sional lots sold at a slight advance over the
maximum quotation, but the general run of
supplies sold within* the quoted range. Yellow
Onions were firmly held at the recently ad
vanced quotations and dealers were Indifferent
about disposing of their holdings.
' Trade In miscellaneous vegetables was brisk,
ai retailers were purchasing for two days'* re
quirements, and several descriptions di<1 better.
Keen competition among dealers for choice lots
of Asparagus and Peas forced prices of those
vegetables up a little. The canners were atllf
in. the market for* Asparagus and cleaned up
surplus stocks of No. 1 and No. 2 stock at
4%@5c per pound. Mexican Tomatoes were
firmer at higher rates and the Los- Angeles
article did better under very light supplies..
Receipts of String i and Wax Beans from the
south aggregated 121 jsacks and. although the
demand was brisk, prices ranged lower.
Receipts of > vegetables included 1061 boxes
of Asparagus. 518 boxes of Rhubarb and 710

CHICAGO. May 7.â A fair degree of flrmnes*
was displayed at the opening- In wheat, the
July delivery being up a' shade to H@Kc.at
M%c to 8Â«>'-5C. The market stIM felt the ef
fects of yesterday's extremely bullish crop re-
I'orts, but the main feature of strength was
undoubtedly rains In the Red River - Valley,
which will delay still longer the seeding : op
erations. On the smallest advance local longs
took profits and In consequence the market de
veloped an easier tone. There were plentiful
rains throughout the winter wheat country, th<Â»
effect of which is to encourage sales for short
account. Prices held about steady until late
In the session, when renewed profit taking
carried July down to 85%c. Shorts covered
quite freely In expectation of a bullish Gov
ernment crop report. As a result part of the
loss was regained. - The market closed steady,
with July at 86@88Hc. Clearances , of wheat
ard flour were equal to 198,500 bushels. Â¦'
The tone in wheat . bad a depressing effect
on corn prices, but there was sufficient support
from pit traders to prevent any loss. The close
was steady with prices at about the best fig
ures of the day. July opened unchanged to a
shade higher at 48%c to 48Vi@48%C sold be
tween 48c and 48%c, closing at the top. '. , ;
â¢ Selling of the July option, by pit .traders un

The Alaska Packers' Association's

from sea the other day on account of
heavy weather, in bucking which her
cargo shifted and considerable water
was shipped, sailed again yesterday for
Bristol Bay. The Nushagak's original
crew deserted when the vesel returned,
and Captain Larsen had considerable

places, sailors being very scarce.

J. N. Harper of the Kentucky experi
ment station is engaged in an experi
ment which. If It proves a success! will
be of the greatest value to the whole
United States.
"The successful cattle breeder," said
Mr. Harper, "selects his individuals
with the greatest care, taking into con
sideration many points. From those
produced he again selects with equal
care the best Individuals, mating them,
and so on ad inflnltum, producing with
each generation a better individual,
until the perfect animal is the result.
The same rule applies to the breeding
of horses, sheep and hogs, and it is this
rule that I am endeavoring to apply
In the growing of wheat.
"After the most careful chemical
analysis and examination under the
microscope I have discovered the best
variety of wheat and the variety rich
est in protein. I have also examined
the wheat under the microscope and
photographed cross-sections of the
grain.
"I will select the Individual grains
and plant them. Next year I will se
lect from the grains produced the finest
specimens and In the following year
will plant them. In this way I hope
after several years to produce a very
fine quality of wheat."
The experiment 13 in Its infancy, and
several years will be required to deter
mine what Its value will be. Other ex
periments have been made with wheat,
but with methods different from that
Â¦which Mr. Harper Is following. â Lex

Cavallsri?" said the Pontiff. "I Just
called you up because I wish to . send
you and my beloved diocese my best
wishes for the Easter season. I also
send to you and to every one In the

it to my people when you officiate in

Th* California State building at the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, at St.
I^ouis. stands on a hill, in a conspicuous
position, near the center ot the Exposi
tion grounds. While there are many re
markable buildings that will attract the
attention of millions of visitors while
the Exposition gates are open, there la
not one that has more intrinsic interest
than the California building.
It is a reproduction, with great fidelity
to detail, of the famous Santa Barbara
Xlissicn. To rr.ai.fl tbo reproduction per
fect the front has been chipped and
stained and grass seeds have been sown
between the flagstone pavements, that
the ravages of time and the characteris
tics 'to the most minute degrees may be
presented to the spectator, who may
thereby eee a vista of historical interest
exactly in accordance with the original.

ARE 3IADE BY RUSSIA
..Recent Statistics Indicate That the
Revolutionary Movement Is
Growing.
VIENNA, May 7. â The alarming
growth of the revolutionary movement
in Russia is Ehown in some interesting
figures published by the "league" on
the number of Russian political agita
tors banished to Siberia.
From Mar, 1902, tor May, 1303, only
feighly-eight exiles "were sent to the
Â¦Siberian province of Yakutsk, where
as the figures for the same district dur
ing the last eight montiis are 225.
Between April and October, 1903, 470
'exiles passed through the forwarding
prison of Kresnoiarsk. Of these, 17 per
cent were women, 40 per cent persons
of education, 82 per cent social demo
crats. 12 per cent . revolutionary so
cialists and â¬ per cent Polish socialists.
From March, 1S03, to January, 1904,
â¢ ZÂ£4 exiles passed the forwarding prison
of Alexandrovsk. Of these 53.9 per cent
were Jews. 26.4 per cent Russians, 10.4
per cent Poles, n.9 per cent Georgians,
etc. The women in this group were
15 per cent, of whom 58.3 per cent -were
Jewesses, 39.9 per cent Russians and 1-8
per cent Roumanians.
It will be borne in mind that only a
lew districts are here taken into ac
count.
XEW YORK, May 7.â Capital and la- |
tor met again to-day at the continued J
xctotins of thÂ« executive committee of;
the National Civic Federation. The j
object of the meeting tras the proposi- |
tion of Joint trade agreements, one of !
the subjects which thÂ« late chairman,;
Senator M- A- Hanna, believed was the j
closest to the work of the federation. '
John Mitchell strongly advocated the
joint trade agreement. It was, he said,
the csser.pe of trades unionism. He i
continued: ;
"We have now S50 men working under
conditions which are fixed by joint
agreement. "We adjust all differences
by a'rreement; we leave no question to
arbitration. Arbitration is preferable to
strikesâ that is all. The outsiders called
in have said they did not understand
conditions, and the result of the arbl- i
l ration has been unsatisfactory, both to
employers and employes.
"I believe in strikes. I also believe
in lockouts. Neither side must sur
render either one of these rights. But
I believe neither thing should be resort
e3 to until each Eide has exhausted
every peaceful means of settlement.
"Nothing can make eo much for In
dustrial peace as the recognition of the
independence of labor and capital.
. "Officers of companies have open
ed their books to me frequently
irhen there *as some question of the
returns ir.a4e. "We know -what the op
erators are making and in this way
ue have come closer together. We be
lieve the answer to all questions Is the
trade agreement."
In r^ply to questions put to him by
members of the federation, Mitchell
said that ' under no circumstances
vrould he consent to the arbitration of
some fundamental questions. He
Â¦would never consent to arbitrate the
â¬ight-hour -workday or his right to be
long to a union. As an instance of his
position en the question of arbitration,
be cited a case where he had advised
the miners in Kentucky to accept a
vrage reduction of 4 \i per cent rather
than accept arbitration which the em
ployers jvere perfectly willing to grant.
He believed this preferable to having
outsiders come In to adjust affairs
which they did net understand.
A comrnittr-e on trades union agree
ment was appointed, subject to the call
of Its chairman, Francis K Robbins,
president of the Pittsburg Coal Com
pany.

In a discussion of the stage at the
meeting of the Congregational clergy
men last week, in Boston, Dr. Shinn
said: "I would take 100 actors and
100 business men of the ordinary types
and the former would be of a higher
moral grade and more respectful to
ward the church than persons of any
other calling." He spoke about the
popular idea that the stage offers ter
rible temptation to the young, but he
said that from what he had heard in
his work of the frequent insults met
by. young girls in business houses one
might just as well urge girls not to be
come, clerks-land vtenograpners.
"When the white man first reached
