"Heretofore the enemy in operating has relied on his great forces and disposing his armies so as to surround us; has chosen as he deemed fit his time

HOBOKEN. N.yj., Oct- 9.â "My
friends, if you don't spark here, you
will spark somewhere else. " If you don't
spark with one. another you will seek
strangers to spark with. As for spark
ing itself, I am heartily In favor of it.
I hope it will lead to the altar and that
I will be allowed to marry you." So
spoke Rev. Andrew Kenny, rector of
St. Anthony Roman Catholic Church of
West Hoboken, to the members of his
dramatic society, ; whose parents ob
jected to their rehearsing for the play
on the ground that it gave the young
folks too great a chance to spark.
The society is composed of twenty
handsome youths and pretty maids.
Two weeks ago they began rehearsing
for a play. The parents of the young
people did not mind their being to
gether on one evening, but after a
while the girls and boys would go out
every evening and a,s an excuse would
merely say, "Rehearsal."
A petition accordingly was circulated
by the paVents and presented to the
priest. It requested him to discontinue
the rehearsals. They had heard of kiss
ing and hugging behind the scenes,
they declared, and- even in the play a
youth and a maid were allowed to
embrace and osculate. The priest will
not listen to the petition of the parents.

ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 9.â Following Is the text of an order of the day
issued by General Kuropatkin and dated October 2:
"More than seven months a'go the enemy treacherously fell upon us at
Port Arthur before war had been declared. Since then, by land and sea,
Russian troops have performed many heroic deeds of which the fatherland
may Justly be proud. The enemy, however, is not only not overthrown, but
in his arrogance continues to dream of complete victory.
"The troops of the Manchurlan army, in unvarying good spirits, hitherto
have not been numerically strong enough to defeat the Japanese army.
Much time is necessary for overcoming all the difficulties of strengthening
the active army so as to enable it to accomplish with complete success the
arduous but honorable task Imposed upon it. It is for this reason that, in
spite of the repeated repulse of Japanese attacks upon our position at
Tatchekiao. Liandiansian and Liaoyang, I did not consider that the time
had arrived to take advantage of these successes and to begin a forward
movement, and I therefore gave the order to retreat.

. Chinese reports of the Japanese

moving to flank the Russians. His
force is \ already on the . Liao River,

Kuroki to the eastward with the object
of striking the railway and flanking the
Russians out, of Mukden, as was done
at Liaoyang, but the conditions are
now rather different. jjft&Bj
MUKDEN, Oct. 9.â The Russian for
ward movement has begun, and Bent
siaputze has been captured with a
small loss. In order to gain a clear un
derstanding of the situation, It may be
stated that two days ago the Japanese
divisions confronted the Russians north
of the Taitse River. Their left flank,
consisting of two divisions, was on the
railway at Sandiapu. thirty' miles
southwest of. Mukden and. close to the
, Hun ; River. -VThelr, center, of
four divisions, occupied the railway be
tween, the. liiaoyangr and ehandiapntze.
twelve miles noth. Two more divisions
occupied , the extreme Japanese right,
along the road between^ Bentsiaputze
and Bensihu. Their .front extended
about fifty- two miles.
The position at Bentsiaputze was
strongly fortified and intended to with
stand attack. It is reported that Gen
eral Kuroki was there in person. The
Japanese had omitted to - fortify one
hill, which was the key to the position.
The ; Russians, aware of this omission,
made a wide detour eastward and
seized the hill with little opposition.
The hill, once occupied, exposed the
whole Japanese position' to a heavy
flanking fire. The Russians also turned
the Japanese right and, the fortified
positions thus becoming untenable, the
Japanese were forced to withdraw hur
riedly from Bentsiaputze, lighting a
rear-guard action, in which they suf
fered heavily. The Russian losses
throughout were small, although severe
opposition had been expected. .General
Mistchenko's Cossacks had been har
assing the Japanese outposts for sev
eral days and were entirely successful
in a number of engagements.
The Russian southern advance began
on October 4, with the occupation . of
Shakhe, a railway station. The next
day the station, which had been dis
mantled by, the Japanese, was restored
by, the railway brigade, following im
,mediately behind the fighting line, and
the . same brigade also restored the
bridge across the Shakhe River. On
October 6 General Mistchenko ad
vanced almost to the Yentai mines,
driving in the Japanese outposts with
heavy loss at an expense of only one
killed and five injured.
, The Russian forward movement be
ing made in the heaviest marching or

"Large universities," said Harper,
"because of ignorance, cowardice and
indifference, have given too little at
tention to religious education and have
lei the entire matter drift. The result
is that nothing tangible has been done.
Now there is beginning to be a feel-
Ing that something must be accom
plished. Biblical history must be raised
to a level with other historical re
search. The college curriculum relat
ing to religious study must be aban

He asserted that no theological semi

â¢ OAKLAND." Oct. 9. â A great au
dience of Native Sons, of the Gold
en West listened this afternoon
with bowed heads to solemn mu
sic and feeling addresses in honor of
the members of the fraternity who
have died within the last twelvemonth.
The First Unitarian Church was
crowded at 2 o'clock with members
and friends of the order, whose an
nual memorial service was to be made
notable by' the presence of distin
guished men chosen to speak words
for the- dead to the living, as did the
Greeks when their fallen sons were
mourned by the city.
The skies were gray "and dun at the
hour set for the gathering, but the or
gan prelude, a Chopin funeral march,
played by.W. B. King, had not been
concluded before the stained-glass
windows, shone golden and green and
crimson as the light of the afternoon
sun. hidden for hours before, came
stealing through.
Â¦ The church platform was occupied
by prominent divines of the city and
orators, chosen to . take - part in- the
services. Singers of local fame" ren
dered hymns selected for their, beauty
arid . -appropriateness. "Each ' feature
was of value, sigfnlflca.nt and beautiful.
Maurice T. Dooling, grand third 'i vice
president of the order, delivered the
eulogy. He said in part: ' ,
We are here to pay tribute to the dead, Â¦ to
dwell with tenderness upon their memory, to
muse for a little while upon their lives and
work, and mourn In public, with fitting cere
mony, their passing away. The griefs we have
FUffered In private it is here appropriate to in
dulge, with no attempt to conceal the feeling
in our hearts. Â¦ It is decorous- that- we
should do this, that we should pause in- the
swift movement we ourselves make toward the
grave and give appreciative attention to the
memories of the brothers who have preceded
us to the grave. Such moments are of price
less value. They serve to withdraw us from
the earth, to help us fix our thoughts upon
higher things. . - Â¦ -
It is . significant that all of us have an In
stinctive yearning to be remembered after
death by those we have known and loved and
mingled with on earth. This instinct makes
the philanthropist more kind, the wise more
diligent, and the good more just. Each thinks
of what posterity will say when he Is dead.
We wlfrti to be mourned, revered and. held In
tender love when the grave haÂ» covered , ua,
and this wo new do for our dead. â¢ Â¦ . .
Those of our. order who have died during the
last year were even as others, and as we are.
We consider them to-day, in memory, as we
hope ourselves to be remembered. I shall not,
tbough go Into details, or personally eulogize
our dead. That is not necessary. There are
others here who could speak In softer .tones
than I for they better knew and so; more
dearly loved those we mourn. But yesterday
those now dead stood here. We eound a dirge
for them, but there ia no discord in the dirge.

Northwest, has been . missing since
Tuesday of this week. The Northwest
'is lying at Port Hadlock. Tuesday Cap
tain Smith, with two of his crew, A.
Nelson and Henry Arto, came here. The
men were in charge of an officer, who
escorted them to the Justice's Court,
where Captain Smith swore to a com
plaint charging the men with assault
and battery upon his person.
Smith's story was to the effect that
ther two men had come to him the even
ing before and demanded money. He
was not able to accommodate them,
and was attacked and beaten. The men
had a different tale, and the trial was
set for the next day on account of the
absence at that time of -an essential
witness. When the case wag called
Captain Smith failed to put in an ap
pearance, and t.his waa repeated the
next day, the case having been again

Smith's whereabouts, but to no pur
pose. ' He has not returned to his ves

L>lke all other human institutions, this' order
has its shortcomings; in some things It may
not at all tiroes have made rood, but no man
will ever truthfully say of us that we have
failed In chanty, and no brother is there but
feels our record Is due In large measure to
the encouragement to active charity resulting
from the exhortations and precepts of the order.
And so, I fÂ«el that our ' memorial service
to-day, in addition to the tribute it is meant to
be to- our departed dear ones, subserves an
end and a purpose In the grand plan of mu

It is a '. recognition of the spiritual - life.

If I mistake not our inculcation of the prin
ciples of friendship, loyalty and charity. It is
for the purpose ':of encounur'ng one another in
the practice of those virtues in some active
way In our every-day lives. To what end our
praise of friendship if not an invitation to
practice It in our dally lives? To what pur
pose our recalling the historic incidents of
friendshipâ Damon and Pythias â the pioneersâ
the drop of water in th.e desertâ the crust of
bread in the- snowbound canyon, and all the
unnumbered others â if not ; an exhortation to
Imitate and exemplify this noble virtue, strong
as the oak and the granite, deeper than 'pas
tiion, better than : loveâ rthe pure, undying
friendship of man for man?.
Our lessons In loyalty we're never meant to
promote a mere academic Interest in civic af
faire â to bo divorced from the ordinary duties
and burdens of life and to be practiced only In
fair weather. He is no true Native- Bon who
simply admires loyalty, cr who can upon oc
casion grow eloquent upon Its beauties, and
who yet falls to do his duty to the State, or
the nation, at -whatever cost, when the summons
comes. Wherever we -fail to promote active
co-operation for the best Interests of society,
wherever we fall to build up an active public
spirit for the betterment of our fellow men,
whsrever we shirk the common, every-day du
tie* of the citizen we have failed In loyalty.
Active work and self-abnegation ia all that
will count. Be our ritual never so splendid,
if we only produce a Pharisee who wraps his
robes about him. and thanka his God he is not
as other men. we fail. Nothing short of the
acted life Itself will count. The whole purpose
of "the Inculcation of this doctrine is not mere
ly to create a mere mental realization of the
nobility and beauty of loyalty, but to encour
age our brothers to aid the State, and at all
times, under whatever stress, in whatever
presence, at ' whatever cost, to do their clvlo
d-ity - ...
And our principle of charity â how un
thinkable and farcical it would be. if not an
active principle. And to what end are .our
lessens, if not an encouragement of this
activity? On no charge do we linger more
lovingly than that of charity. None is . more
beautiful. Tet the reputation of this order
will not rest upon its mere appreciation of
tbe transcendant beauty of our lesson j In that
divine virtue, but in the active promotion of
the ' virtue, the practice of which that lesson
One jTear ago at our memorial services the
day was "bright and dear and It seemed
ftrance that we should have come from the
outer sunshine Into the shadows of the memo
rial hall. To-day the clouds have gathered

of thln-s that are silent. Bat we must, re
member, as Lonfrfrtlow has said, that the
shadows and the rain must .come" to us at
some time. Our brothers have passed away,
but like unto shadows that creep up the moun
tain side the darkness will soon disappear
in the rays of the sun.
We must not forget ; the pioneers whose
places we fill in this great community. We
must remember their tolls In what was a

are of that race; the dead were of that race. AVe

' Y JUDGE DAVIS' OKATIOxl
In accordance with an annual cus
tom that has been in vogue for several
years with the parlors of the Native
Sons of the Golden West, the beautiful
memorial services in remembrance of
the deceased members of the order were
conducted yesterday afternoo.n at Na
tive Sons' Hall on Mason street.
Despite the gloomy weather the spa
cious hall was filled with daughters and
sons of California, together with many
specially invited persons. The hall was
simply dressed with flowers, bear flags
and the national colors. Prominent
officers of the order were. on the olat
forrn. Instrumental music, with an oc
casional-vocal selection, was chosen for
the exercises.
Chopin's "Funebra" was rendered by
Fitzgerald's orchestra. The opening
remarks were spoken by the chairman.
Judge Frank H. Kerrigan, who said
that what waa being done by the Na
tive Sons of San Francisco upon the
sacred occasion had become custom
throughout the State of California. He
declared the solemn services in memory
of dead brethren one of many marks
of respect that helped to make one
feel a further interest in the community
in which Californians live. Acts of love
and respect could render it a still bet
ter home.
After an affecting rendition of "Lead.

Quartet, Rev. A. A. McAllister. U. S.

and paid splendid tribute to the men
whose names grace the tablets of
brotherly remembrance. His words were

Captain Amundsen's expedition \ has
been described as having for its pur

in the domain of terrestrial magnetism.
The plan was to go first to King Wil

land, and then proceed for Bering
Strait. "If the plan should be carried
out, it would take the expedition almost
directly across the north pole. The
vessel on which the expedition sailed
is the- Gjoa, forty-six tons, yacht
rigged, having an auxiliary petroleum
engine. She was, equipped for a four
years' stay in "the Arctic regions.
Captain Amundsen is experienced irt

1879 as a first officer of the Belgica.
After .his return, -Amundsen consulted
with Professor Neumayer of Hamburg,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Oct. 9.â "Do unto
others as you would that others should
do unto you" was often preached by
"Golden Rule" Jones, the -lamented
Mayor of Toledo, In his lifetime. The
executors of his estate have discovered
that he followed the injunction liter
ally, giving away more than $100,000 a
year to save defaulters from arrest and
disgrace. There are 200 men in Toledo
for whom Jones indorsed notes. Bank
tellers, bookkeepers and confidential
men ; of large corporations who had
taken money from their employers to
.speculate or pay expenses of high liv
ing are included in this list.
In no instance has it been discovered
that any of these men ever returned
to their evil ways, and it has been
found that Jones never received back
any of the money- that he gave, nor
did he expect it.
MOVE IS DISCUSSED.
Critics Aroused by Kuropatkin's Order
to Advance.
LONDON, Oct. 10.â The new phase of
the war involved in General Kuropat
kln's stirring address to his army is
keenly discussed by English military,
critics. In the light of the probable
motives underlying Kuropatkin's de
cision to take the offensive it is not
forgotten how recently the Russian
plan of campaign was reported to be
to draw the Japanese northward in
order to attenuate their communica
tions, and hence there is greater sur
prise at what is considered a remark
able order. Various reasons are ad
vanced by the critics as having pos
sibly actuated Kuropatkinâ first, that
Japanese inactivity led him to suppose
that he was stronger numerically; sec
ond, that intrigues connected with the
appointment of a new commander in
chief may have determined Kuropat
kin to Precipitate matters, and, third,
according to the English critics, by far
the most acceptable explanation, that
he again has been overruled from St.
Petersburg and is acting on imperial
orders.
"He seems to be thrusting his head
into the lion's jaws," says the Daily
Telegraph, "under instructions, from St,
Petersburg to givethe Czar victory at
any cost." â¢ â¢
' Spencer Wilkinson, in the Morning
Post, takes similar jviews. He says
that Kurbpatkin's mention of the relief
of Port. Arthur and the fact that'im
mediately following the decision to send
out a second army, he is about to risk
everything in an attack by the first
army, suggests government pressure.
If so, Wilkinson says, his advance is
a sign of desperation; but if he is act
ing on his own judgment, it is a bold
move and he is a formidable antago
nist. â¢
While all the morninsr newspapers
comment in a similar vein, the con
sensus of opinion is that Field Marshal
Oyama has nothing: to fear from a
Russian advance and that he likely will
welcome the prospect of a decisive
battle, since it is . considered after
such an order further retreat is im
possible for the Russians without de
moralization; and, as Wilkinson re
marks, should Kuropatkln be beaten
now, Â¦ nobody will expect the second
Russian army to succeed any better
than the first.

There are at least five reasons why the
eold standard cannot be considered as fixed:
(1) it l* unconstitutional.
Whether the Wall street Influence which
produced the establishment of the gold stan
dard emanated from wiser heads than these
of Jefferson end Hamilton may be doubted
Beth of thwse great men served their country
a long time and died poor. In fixing bimetal
lism as a system and the silver dollar aa the
unit of value., they had no Â«clflsh motive
Two lofty minded statesmen agreed upon that
system as the rlffht system. It remained In
force, giving full satisfaction until the money
power In Us march of conquest found It to be
a barrier. The money power demands a Etan
dard which It can control, and one metal Is
easier to control than two. For the same rea
son It ODDOses governmental issues of paper
money, and will never content Itself until the
greenbacks are called In and destroyed.
To establish the single sold standard, which
sets the constitution aside, the statute had to
be violated. The word "coin" had to be con
strued to mean "cold only," and the paper
note, issued on silver, had to be redeemed in
a manner different from that prescribed by
law.
Once upen a time we had a financial system
of our own. Placed In the constitution as
St*.! Â« OU Â£ '""^mental law, it seemed to be
firmly fixed. For a hundred years this money
s>stem was In operation among us There
fore it seemed to be "irrevnchiv
fixed." Very w!*e men created â¢
â¢yst<-m of national finance. It was the one
subject upon which Thomas Jefferson and
Alexander Hamilton agreed. These two were
perhaps, the greatest statesmen this country
ever produced. So pre-eminent were they
above all others that they divided the people
into two olstlnct schools of political thought.
But. UDon the vital eubject of finance these
master minds reached the same conclusion,
and that conclusion became a part of the con
stitution.

Did the people of Russia demand war with
Japan? Were tht-y consulted? Did they have
any grievance against the Japanese? No. The

not want it. Who then forced Russia Into

The corrupt ruling das* â the predatory capi
talists who were seeking new fields of con

Yet. !i one really wishes to know the truth,
and will but look around him, he will observe
cyrnptoms which have always characterized
the <ii.w-.aM-d nation when afflicted by class
legislailon.
Hut these thir.gs happened so long ago;
they fcar>jÂ»ened to people of another race; In
modem times and among the white races such
mlirgoverr.ment would be Impossible. Self
complacent Ignorance of the present day takes
that k:r.d of comfort to Itself, and blandly
congratulates Itself upon the fact that legisla
tive vysterr.s of robbery are things of the past.
Editorial writers, whose papers are owned
ai.d salaries paid by the pets of class legisla
tion, lose no opj>ortunity of patting the self
complacent earÂ« on the back, and of strength
ening his belief that all Is well with the re
public. Clars !<-EiÂ»-latlon did, once upon a
time, lead great nations to ruin â but that was
long ago. Class legislation is the same old
tree, but the fruit is not the same. Thus
eaycth thf subsidized editor; and, the self
complacent sage who knows that all Is well
with our republic, purrs with satisfaction, and
thinks highly of the editor.
When two great political parti's have, in
turn, governed a country, and have between
them, brought about unsatisfactory conditions,
it is but a natural fact that a third party
should arise. Citizens who have looked in vain
lo '-the two great parties" for remedial legis
lation lose confidence in both after a while,
and cdopt one of two courses: they either
submit to the evils of bad government, or pro
fÂ«t by organizing a third party.
To the istude&t of history, there is nothing
more saddening than the tendency of the peo
ple to submit. Ais a rule, political education
never reaches the masses. Statecraft, like
prlestcralt. Jealously guards Its secrets. There
Is always the lnnÂ«-r sanctuary which the peo
ple *r* taught to believe would be profaned by
the touch of their unholy feet.
Again, in organized government there Is a
irysterious reverence for authority. "What
ever Is. Is right" to thÂ« unthinking multi
tude; and the votaries of power never Â©ease
to dÂ«pen that Impression. Thus, partly from
ignorance and partly rrom reverence for es
tablished authority, the people, in every age,
have ehown more inclination to submit to bad
government than to resist It. The crimes
which have been committed under forms of
law by ruling classes against subject masses
elmost stagger belief. They have been so de
liberately cruel, so relentlessly selfish, so
Ehamefully unjust, that the blood of the stu
dent bpils within him as hÂ« reads the record.
What was the purpose of the law maker In
forming such heartless legislation? The motive
was to render permanent the rule of the few,
the privilege* of the fÂ«w. the power and the
Â¦weaJtJi of the few. Always and everywhere
the result of this sort of legislation has been
the same â It defeated Itself; and the aristoc
racy Jell with the etate which It misgoverned.
Thoee who rule by corruption, being corrupt
themselves, sap the very foundation of social
and political order; and when thÂ«re Is nothing
in tho mifses of tie people but tame submis
sion to tyranny, there is no robust strength
lÂ«-ft to meet the enemy, within or without.
A handful of Englishmen are able to hold
Egypt down, and plunder Its people In the In
terest cf the Rothschilds and other holders of
bonds signed by decadent and helpless Khe
dives. Why? Because the life had bwn taken
out of those poor creatures by centuries of mis
rule. The common man, in Egypt, has been
<!lrt under the teet of masters so long that he
hÂ»s come to believe that he is dirt, and noth
ing more. See how the two hundred millions
of Hindoos a:e held down by one hundred
thousand British! See fcow they submit to be
eo closely ehorn by English plunderers that at
thti least breath of t&mlne they perish by
millions. Hew was that horrible situation
nuiif possible? Centuries of misrule did It.
Soulless aristocracy, thinking of its own In
terests only, killÂ«d the eplrtt of the people by
atrocious laws. When the evil hour came end
India needed robust manhood to defend the
empire, no robust manhood was there. The
rules were effeminate, weakened by their won
v<-a!th. their own pelf-indulgence, their own
monopoly of power, privilege and opportunity.

A third party has no right to exist unless
there are abuses in government 1 which "the
two great parties" refuse to reform. Unless
both the two old parties are wrong, there is
no room or excuse for a third. But, if both
the old parties are equally guilty of class
legislation, and are equally subservient to the
beneficiaries of special privilege, then it . is

PARKER A MOVING TARGET.
In Mr. Bryan's book called "The First Bat
tle" he compared the possible effects of the
British cold standard to the ruin wrought by
an invading army, sweeping the land with
fire and sword. Mr. Bryan was 1 right. The
vast increase in the world's stock of metal
lic money and the enormous use of credit
money, which universal confidence keeps afloat,
postponed the evil day, but It Is bound to
come. Let the supply of gold fail. let con
fidence take wings, let the insolvent banks
be suddenly called upon to make good their
Inflated liabilities, and such a storm will break
over the republic as has not been known fn
its history. Our financial system is rotton to
the very core. What has been aptly called
hocus-pocus money Is doing the biggest busi
ness It was ever known to do. What is enti
tled "frenzied finance" Is holding such a car
nival as It never held before. This cannot
last. The crash will surely come, and those
.who live to see It will feel as though the
world were coming to an end. Would to God
that Mr. Bryan were with me in this "The
Second Battle." Together we could have
won the fight in 1896, but the Southern
Democratis bosses would not have It so. Chair
man Jone* bad to drive the allies apart by
brutal Insults at the very opening of the cam
paign. In 1004. had all the Bryan Democrats
refused to be bound by the Infamous. sellout to
Wall street at>St. Louis, and had Mr. Bryan
Joined, forces with me, we could have won
this contefct. The temper of the people is ripe
for revolt, and Its getting hotter every day.
They only need leaders whom they can trust.
The Democratic masses* who followed Bryan
are sick at the heart. J They listen without
conviction when Bryan speaks for Parker.
They want fighters at the head of the army
and Parker Is no fighter.
' Roosevelt Etands in the open and dares Par
ker defiantly, almost mockingly, and Parker
meekly stays out of the fight. In his formal
letter of acceDtance he says that he takes up
the glove thrown at his feet, declaring that
he will revoke that pension order. No. 78. But
In the same breath he hastens to admit that
Roosevelt did precisely what he. Parker, thlnka
ought to be done. If elected he, Parker, will
at once have Congress do what Roosevelt has
already done. Heavens! what a meek warrior
ia this. "Roosevelt did the right thing but
not in the right way, and if you will elect me
President I will do the same thing In the
proper way'." Did any nominee ever seek the
presidency on that kind of a platform before?
When Is he going to free those Philippines?
He does not say. What is he going to do to
the trusts? Will he deal drastically with the
Standard Oil trust, which has coddled his po
litical ambition for the past two years? What
will he do to the sugar trust, which his cam
paign Â¦ manager, Gorman, represents In the
United States Senate? On the negro ques
tion â why has he been silent? Does he con
demn Roosevelt for that Booker Washington
lunch? Does he condemn the appointment of
negroes to- office? Why did he fail to make
any . reference whatever to that plank in the
Republican platform which his running mate.
Davis, seys created a "race issue" ? The
Solid South is being kicked and cuffed Into

he differs from Roosevelt on . the negro ques

THE DEMOCRATIC WEAKLING.
They ejected Cleveland on a free silver plat
form, nnd called a special session to violate
the contract. They promised to put an end to
national banks, and they Issued new bonds
to keep , them In life. Then. ' when the bank
charters expired, they united with the Repub
licans to give national banks a new lease of
life for twenty years. They promised to re
lieve the farmers from the McKinley tariff,
ar.d they Increased the tax on lumber, nails,
horseshoes, rl/ets, tacks, screws, pipe, flues,
and wire. They doubled the tax on molasses,
and put an addition of $45,000,000 to the price
which the people were paying for sugar under
"tho culminating atrocity of class legislation,"
tho McKinley act. They pitied the laborer and
promised to be his : friend, and they let the
Pullman Palace Car Company have the. use of
the army to compel the submission of laborers
to a cut In wages. They promised to abolish
child labor* and In those . States of the South
where tho Democratic narty Is most absolute
child slavery Is most immovably planted.
They promised the people a graduated Income
What avails this cry about "extravagance"?
That the Government is run with a reckless
disregard of the middle and lower classes who
pay most of the tariff taxes is known of by
all men. But who believes that either of these
"two great parties" is- going to retrench ex
penditure? Appropriations for administrations
are on the Increase everywhere. With the
Federal Government there is no* such thing as
going backward. The "billion dollar Congress"
of tho Republicans was succeeded by a Cleve
land Congress pledged to "rigid economy";
and it was not long before the Democratic ap
propriations reached the billion dollar mark.
Harrison reduced the public debt by a quarter
billion dollars, and Cleveland was not long In
adding more than Harrison had taken away.

With a Standard Oil accumulation, a Carne
gie accumulation and other similar accumula
tions reprVented by such men as J. P. Mor
gan. August Belmont and Arthur Gorman,
what is to prevent "the deadly principle of
compound Interest" from operating with appall
ing results in this country? By the law of
their nature those monster fortunes will grow
larger and larger. As the owners of this huge
wealth have taken more than their share of
the common stock of the nation's wealth so
there must be Increasing millions of men who
get less than their share. What will be the
end of It? No student believes it can go on
as it is forever. All see danger signals ahead.
That a rising tide of angry discontent is pour
ing over the country cannot be disputed. The
evidences of it are visible everywhere. If
H. H. Rogers. J. P. Morgan. August Belmont
and men of that type think there Is no* act of
spoliation to which the people will not sub
mit they are making for themselves a fool's
paradise. If the Standard Oil crowd and the
sugar trust crowd think that the American
pec pie are going to stand idly acquiescent
while they gobble up all the wealth of the
republic they are playing with fire. It will
not be permitted. Already more than half
of the annual Increase of wealth Is absorbed
by less than a dozen trusts. Already we have
men bo rich that they could buy up the en
tire property contained in one of our States.
If the "deadly principle of compound inter
est" continues to work for the Standard Oil
that group of plunderers will soon own the
whole of the United States. They and their
confederate kings will have such a grip upon
our entire system, commercial, financial and
political that the Government will amount to
little more than a piece of necessary me
chanism to the Standard's system. The Fed
eral administration will take orders from some
future Rogers Just as boards of directors of
dozens of huge corporations now do. The
very life of the republic demands the curb-
Ing of these gigantic combinations and every
aKgressive step they take, from henceforth,
will hasten the day when imperative public
opinion will compel the constituted authori
ties to protect the public from ruthless spoli
ation of this kind. s
Another example of class legislation is found
in a study cf our transportation system.
We have given to the various corporations
which control our telegraph, telephone, express
and railroad business such enormous powers
that the Government itself is a dwarf among
these giants. Their revenues are greater than
those of the Government. Their power to tax
falls not only upon the public, but upon the
Government itself. In the late conflict with
Spain the manner In which they preyed upon
the Government was something frightful in its
rapacity. And. the constant practice they have
of charging the Government for the annual
use of a postal car a greater sum than the cost
of the car is but one evidence of the undisputed
fact that the Government dares not deny them
anything. They almost openly use the "frank"
of members of Congress to all to the weight of
mall matter during that annual period when
the mall Is weighed to adjust the "average."'
Hundreds of tons of Junk is thus handled dur
ing those few days, and upon this fraudulent
mail matter the average for the entire year is
based. The taxpayers have to pay. The Con
gressmen who lend themselves to this swindle
get free passes and other good things. In ex
press charges, freight rates, telephone and tele
graphic tarffs the pubic s plundered every day
In the year, and the manner In which they
submit to it Is one of the marvels of the age.
No other people among civilized nations are so
cursed with corporation tyranny as ourselves,
and we never seem to think that any remedy
Is possible. Half a dozen corporation kings
can meet in the office of J. P. Morgan and
can tax the life out of any town or city In the
United States. By a spurt of the pen they can
add hundreds of millions of dollars to the bur
dens of the people. They enable the trusts to
slay their rivals by granting rebates, or spe
cial rates, which make competition impossible.
They debauch public morals by their methods
of gaining what they want from Governors,
Legislatures, Judges, editors, politicians and
members of Congress.
Napoleon once rose from a study of inter
est tables with the remark, "When I consid
er the deadly principle which lies hidden in
those tables I marvel that It has not de
voured the human race." That deadly prin
ciple Js precisely what has devoured so great
a part of the human race every year. That
deadly principle does devour a portion of the
human race every year. The big fortune,
by the law of Its nature, tends to grow big
ger. Each colossal accumulation represents
what one victor gained and ten thousand
victims lost. For, in a fortune of a hun
dred millions there can be no such thing as
fair reward for productive labor. Such a for
tune, ' or anything like it, represents, as a
rule, the spoil of the successful marauder in
the fields where others had tolled.*- Such
a man is a freebooter and his hoard often
costs the losers more lives, more tears, more
broken hearts and ruined homes than are
to be found in the track of actual war.
When those Standard Oil knaves robbed the
people of 136,000,000 In one day they felt
entitled to the admiration of the business
world. On the same day, perhaps, hungry
women stole bread for hnngTy children and
went to prison for it. J. P. Morgan, Andrew
Carnegie. Charles Schwab and other conspic
uous captains of industry Increased their un
wieldly fortunes by pocketing $500,000,000
which other less conspicuous persons confided
to the steel trust. No one was punished, and
at one of those libraries which Carnegie has
been establishing all over the country admis
sion was denied to one of the best books of
one of the best Russian authors because it
gave a vivid description of the condition of
thÂ»" peasantry in Russia. Himself a mon
strous product of governmental favoritism and
"protection," no book which exposes and de
nounces class legislation can be satisfactory
to this man who has In his coffers bo many
millions which should have been left in the
pockets of those whose honest industry pro
duced them. Â¦ .
Republic Pictured as Helpless in Their
â¢ Mighty Grasp.
RAPACITY OP THE TRUSTS.
LABOR AND CAPITAL.
PRINCIPLES OF POPULISM.
Party/ Described as Jeffersonian to
the Very Core.
The People's party is Jeffersonlan to the
core. It has never emasculated Its creed to
curry favor. It has preferred to win Its way Into
minds and hearts by earnest advocacy of fixed
principles. Its chief reliance has been on po
litical education. It assails tha evils of cUse
legislation and for every abuse offers a remedy.
It does not blindly seek to tear down. It seeks
to reform, to repair, to renovate, to restore.
We would If we could go back to the system of
our forefathers. The class legislation which Is
the bane of our Government at this time ob
tained the upper hand In our republic twice
before and was twice driven out. Jefferson
did it once, then Jackson. Democracy in Jack
son's day paid off the national debt, overthrew
the national bank, revoked many of the privi
leges of favored classes and put the reins oÂ£
power back Into th* hands of the people. The
protective principle was struck down and the
Walker tariff Inaugurated an era of great
prosperity. Charles Dickens, who visited this
country previous to the Civil War. wrote back
to his home that a flaming sword in the air
would not excite more amazement than a
beggar in the streets of Boston, and he ex
pressed his astonishment at the general pros
perity of the people. That was when genuine
Democracy was ruling the land and Inspiring
Its legislation. This prosperous condition con
tinued, in the main, until the Civil War. That
deplorable conflict -was hardly lass terrible
In loss of life than in the legislation to which
it gave provocation and opportunity. National
banks gained foothold once more"; a mountain
of bonds arose; monstrous tariffs, framed with
the view of enriching favored industries, were
Imposed; corporations seized the public lands;
the money power began that series of forays
upon the Government and upon the producing
classes which has transferred almost the whole
of the wealth of the country to those who
never bravely fought for the Government In
time of war nor honestly served It In time of
peace. The grand armies of industry win the
yearly victory over nature by toil, producing
the wealth which the captalLs of Industry ap
propriate to themselves by subtle chicanery.
The vastly greater part of the wealth of this
country is enjoyed by men who never pro
duced a dollar in their lives.
The People's party makes no war upon
private ownership, upon honest wealth or le
litlmate profits. It simply combats the legis
lation which builds up one man at the ex
pense of another, which gives special privileges
to one class at the expense of another, which
discriminates against a citizen or a class of
citizens in favor of others. In short, the Peo
ple's party declares Its hostility to privilege
and demands legislation whose motto shall
be "equal and exact Justice to all. without
favors to any."
Such rascality as that of the copper trust
or the steel combine should cither be made im
possible or the administration of law so In
vigorated that the criminals who steal millions
shall wear the ball and chain side by side
with the thief who atole a pig.
We believe In the money of the constitution.
We do not bend in superstitious reverence to
sliver and gold. We believe that any cur
rency which the Government declares to be
lezal tender will be "sound money" as long
as the Government is "sound." We have less
fear' that the Government will ever issue too
many paper dollars than we have that It will
issue too many bonds. A government must
govern, and the creation of money Is a part
of the sovereign power. The Government must
decide how many soldiers shall come to the flag;
must decide how many battleships shall hold
"the ocean lists against the world in mail." It Is
no more likely to make a mistake by Issuing
too much money than it is to make a worse
mistake by calling too many breadwinners Into
the military service.
"Rag baby!" cries the editor: . "Rag baby!"
cries the fossil in the academy. Yet that
same editor and that same academic fossil Is
quick to approve when the Government makes
a bond out of rags and allows the banker to
issue rag notes on the rag bonds. What chil
dren we are. after all! Some men go around
in mental swaddling clothes all the days of
their . blessed lives.
The People's party favors tb- public owner
ship of public utilities. In nearly every civil
ized country the Government owns the rail
ways, the telegraphs and the telephones. The
last two should be a part of our postofflce
system, to which should be added the parcel
post, to free our people from the extortionate
charees of the express companies. The Peo
ple's party has always earnestly advocated the
graduated income tax. This would not only
throw the support of the Government upon
the rich, where It should be. but would. In a
sreat measure, prevent the accumulation of
huge, unnecessary and dangerous fortunes. We
favor the eight-hour law and the abolition of
child labor In factories, where thf unhealthy
moral and physical conditions are almost certain
to destroy the child. . We believe it to be a part
of man's natural liberty and equality to labor
for himself and not -for a master, and that
the laws should be so framed that there
should be no monopoly of the land for either
the living or the dead. Recently we have
heard the Insidious voice of those who tell us
that "man is not born free, but must earn
his freedom." This pernicious and false state
ment comss from one of those millionaire col
leges where opinions are censored. Just as
books are censored for the Carnegie libraries.
Upon this subject Mr. Jefferson said that
"the God who gave us life gave us liberty at
the same time." Ha also announced as a
principle that "The earth is given as a com
mon stock for man to labor and live on. If
for the encouragement of Industry we allow
It to be appropriated we must take care that
other employment be provided to those ex
cluded from the appropriation. If we do not.
the fundamental right to labor the earth re
turns to the unemployed."
To this doctrine 1 heartily subscribe. I can
not bring myself to believe that It Was ever
God's intention or that it was ever Just, for
any portion of the human race to deprive
other portions of that race of the opportunity
"to labor the earth," or. in lieu thereof, to
bÂ» provided with other liberty to work. Idle
land which no man Is permitted to work.
Idle hands which are not allowed to work,
form an Indictment against any ruling class
which will result In a verdict of guilty be
fore any impartial Jury of intelligent think
ers.
Mr. ' Jefferson further said. "The earth
belongs in usufruct to the living; the dead
have neither right nor dominion over it."
. One of the evils of our system is that the
living can transmit a monopoly to their de
scendants and thus the grip of the dead Is
never loosened.
National Board to Arbitrate Their
Disputes Favored.
It Is to-day more apparent than it ever â¢was
before that combined capital has deliberately
come to the conclusion that union labor must
be crashed. The verÂ» spirit now actuates thÂ»
Pullman Car Company, the harvester trust
companies and similar confederations of cap
ital, which moved the British Parliament cen
turies ago when It punished a combination ot
workmen as a crime. Not only did the capi
talism of that day deny laborers the right to
form unions, but a low scale of wages was
prescribed and the workman who refused to
work at the stated price wan punishable by
law as a criminal. Having thus enacted legis
lation which created poverty, there was only
one more step to take, and they took It â
they made poverty a crime. The moneyless
man who could not pay his debts rotted In
prison. The hungry man who begged for
something to eat was hanged. During the reign
of Henry VIII two thousand Englishmen wera
put. to death each year for the high crime of
being so persistently poor that they repeated
the offense of begging three times. It was
penal to beg at all: it was death to do It
three times. The English King unHÂ«r whom
these horrors occurred was at the head of the
church of Christ, was the official "Defender
of the Faith." an.i was as constant In at
tendance upon divine service as the Baers.
Pullmans. Rockefellers and the Armours of our
own day. He had known Erasmus, and had
written a book against Luther had reveled
with Francis I on the Field of the Cloth of
Gold, and had for confidential Ministers
Cardinals of the church of God. In other
words, he conformed to all the outward forms
of Christianity and ranked as equal among th*
great men of his own time, yet he put to
death an average of two thousand paupers
every year of his reign for no other crime than
that of giving cry to the pangs of hunger â tha
peculiarly atrocious feature of which barbarity
being that the law had produced much of the
poverty which It had punished.
In our own land there are many indications
that capitalism is being instigated by thÂ»
same spirit as that which lived In tha ancient
code. If labor unions can be crushed by cap
italism which has formed its trust, liberty
will be gone, not only from the individual
laborer but from every other individual. "Be
long to the trust or obey it," will be abso
lutely the only possible outcome if tho en
croachments of these rapacious monsters arm
allowed to go on unrestricted. In every Til
lage, every town, every city, every State. the>
American people are so badgered and insulted
and robbed and oppressed by the hundreds of
monopolies and trusts that the Individual citi
zen is reduced to a state of indignant but
remedylesa Impotence.
From a Republican nominee one does not ex
pect a great deal upon the labor question and
would be disappointed if he did expect Jt.
But from a Democratic nominee one natur
ally hopes for a deliverance. Judge Parker's
formal letter does not recognize that such &
thing as the labor question exists. He offers
no solution of the trouble, and upon the calm
tide of his smooth rhetoric there Is no sugges
tion that civil war smolders in many a region
of our Christian republic, where capital and
labor have taken each other by the threat. It
is true that Judge Parker thinks tariff reform
would benefit the wage-earner. So It would.
If It were of the right sort. But Cleveland,
once upon a time, sounded the slogan of
"tariff reform," and after one defeat was
elected to do the work. Arthur Gorman waÂ»
the master-builder who framed the measure
which was to lessen the burdens of the op
pressed, and when Arthur Gorman got through
with the Job the burdens of the oppressed
had merely been shifted from one shoulder to
the other. The. great- warm-hearted Senator
from Missouri, George G. Vest wanted coal
put upon the free Hat. In order that cheaper
fuel could be had by the people. Arthur Gor
man opposed the measure stubbornly In thÂ«
Senate. When the sugar trust wanted a better
rate than the Dlngley bill was about to give
them Steve Elklns brought Havemeyer and
Gorman together in personal conference and
the trust got what Havemeyer came for.
And Arthur Gorman ts Parker's manager
The "tariff reform" of the Democratic nom
inee must, therefore, be taken with care: and
to the Parker letter of acceptance should be
attached the Gorman tariff act of 1S04 as
"Exhibit A." and the speech of General Joe
Wheeler against that measure as "Exhibit
B."
If I were President I would recognize that
capital and labor have reached & dangerous
antagonism. Its utmost influence would be
used to establish a National Bureau of Ar
bitration. I would ask combined capital to
choose one man. union labor to choose an
other and I would myself, as chief magis
trate, choose a third. Such a board of arbi
tration should have Jurisdiction over labor
troubles and would become a power of good.
That something must be done, and don*
soon, should be clear to all. A few more
Colorado situations would precipitate the rule
of the soldier, paid by the corporation, or by
the taxpayers whose State officials are owned
by corporations.
The People's party advocates the- Initiative,
by means of which the people can pass such
laws as they desire: the referendum, by means
of which they can veto such legislation as
they disapprove, and the right to cancel the
commission of such public officials as have
riven dissatisfaction.
One of the evils of the present system la
that the people are not consulted when laws
are to be made, they only hear of the legis
lative actsr after they are published. Even
fleet footed lawyers find it difficult to keep
pace with the changes constantly being made
in the statutes.
The initiative and referendum would correct
most of that and the imperative mandate* and
right of recall would do a great deal toward
keeping public officers faithful to trust. To
cancel the commission of the public servant
who has been recreant to duty la mild enough
punishment. If such a power be not given

In considering the labor question we should
not lose sight of the fact that our working
classes have had much to endure. Those who
kr.ow something of the horror, of their con
ditions in the Pennsylvania coal fields, for
example, as shown In Congressional investi
gations, can well understand their point of
view. In many cases .they have been goaded
to madness by hardships, brutalities, oppres
sions, which human nature cannot always
stand. -The virtual slavery which exists in
many a .mine Is no secret. The despotic
control which employers exert over employes
In many fields of labor deprives the laborer
of any real political freedom and amounts to
a systematic serfdom. These men have,
been mocked by many a pledge and prom
ise. Many a politician has ridden Into office
a* their especial representative and advocate,
only to bring disappointment and despair to
those who trusted him. Time and again na
tional platforms have promised abolition of
sweatshops and unreasonable hours of tabor
Sweatshops have not been abolished and. un
reasonable hours of labor are much too com
mon. In spite of all this talk of general
prosperity I deny that It exists. The mass
of the people have no surplus money. All

driftwood, the floating wrecks beaten to
pieces In the great storm of life. Into nol

It was the power of ipecial privilege, given
to the national bankers by Congress, which
had put them in position to create the panic of
1893. If a history could be written of tha
inception of that convulsion, the base motives
of those who brought it about and the awful
cruelty with which It smote Its victims, the
world would shudder at the revelation. It
was a cold-blooded, premeditated crime: .t
darkened many homes; it wrecked many a
life; and it was the legitimate offspring of
class legislation.
Not long ago an entire family destroyed
Itself because irTiad no money. The parent*
put their little ones to death and died with
them rather than sink Into the hell of vie*
and crime and misery which yawns for the
man or woman who can get no work. This
case was but one of a thousand. Does It de
serve no attention from rulers and lawmakers?
Is it beneath the notice of the great? God
fcrbld! I will Incur all the odium which may
cumÂ« to me .from making the statement that
a serial and political system under which sucn.
awful tragedies are of constant occurrence is
profoundly unrighteous. Is infernally wrong.
There Is absolutely no reason why our laws
should not be so reformed as to bring a.bout *
more ecultable distribution of the good things
ot life; no r?ason why the individual man or
woman able to work and wllltnc to work
should not always find It at a fair wage; no
reason under the sun why the reign of priv
ilege may not be brought to end.
. Almost ev?ry 111 that now afflicts the body
politic can be traced to Its source in vicious
legislation. Government, instituted for public
purposes, has been prostituted to private pur
ooses. and that is the true secret of most of
our troubles.
Upon the other hand we have the boys
and girls of the excessively poor, growtns uÂ»
under conditions which make unblushing lru
mcrallty a matter of course. The rapid In

The great party of six and a half million
voters sent their leaders to St. Louis without
any instructions to surrender to Wall street.
That surrender created a profound discontent,
which will not down. Mr. Bryan himself can
not make that bitter pill palatable to the
Bryanltes. The sell -out was too brazen too
sudden, too complete. Nobody suspected an
earthquake like that. The ground opened, and
down into the yawning chasm fell all -the
principles of the Democratic party. These
leaders went to St. Louis clothed from head
to heel in good Jeffersonlan Democracy. When
Dave Hill. Pat McCarren and August Belmont
finished their work the Democratic bosses
were so nearly nude that had it been a per
sonal matter rather than political they could
have been indicted for "a notorious act of
public Indecency." Able statesmen have un

The most un-Democratlc portion of Judge
Parker's letter Is that wherein he eulogUes
the policy of James O. Blalne and William
McKlnley upon the subject of reciprocity.
What is reciprocity but free trade in those
raw materials which the protected manufac
turers want? If free trade be such a good
thing, why. not let all of us have some?
If protection be such excellent medicine for
the masses, why not compel the manufacturers
to take It, too? In other words, why not have
a system and -stick to It? If protection Is
right, it should operate on all alike. If free
trade is right, then the manufacturers should
not be the only ones to get It.
Judge Parker pleads for greater favors to

If Republican policies are to be overthrown.
It must be done by men who boldly declare
against them and who go up against them
with a determination to defeat them. The
way to whip the enemy Is to fight it. The
Democratic party has known what It was to
be led by captains who put the battle cry into
plain language so that all could understand
where the difference was on vital Issues. Such
a leader was Jefferson. Such a leader was
Andrew Jackson. Such a leader wai Stephen
A. Douglas. Such a leader was William J.
Bryan. In this campaign It has no such
leader. To their secret shames and disgust, the
rank and file of the great Democratic party
sees that their captain will not light. In
spite of party loyalty and a wish to believe
otherwise, they see that Parker remains what
Bryan said he was last April â an "artful
dodger, absolutely unfit for the Presidential
nomination." That Mr. Bryan himself sup

public, it is curious to note that Mr. Parker
does not once mention the name of Jefferson.

of Democracy amounts to a riddle.
How any party which has for recent year*
stood for so many different things and broken
so many contract* can new expect to be trusted
is a puzzle In -politics. The manner In which
the platform cf 1904 was evolved, the manner
in which Parker's nomination was brought
about ought to Intensify the distrust which
the bad record of the party Justly creates.
Every line of the platform seems to be In a
tremble lest It should displease the bene
ficiaries of class legislation. Every tone of Its
quaking voice seems to say to the corporations.
"Don't be afraid; I won't hurt you." With
the anxious fear of Snug the Joiner in "Mid
summer Night's Dream," the apparent lion
kindly dissipates the fear of his audience by
assuring them in advance that its roar is only
for stage purposes. If that platform had been
meant to please the people, how easy It would
have been to write It! But It was meant to
delude the people and to please the corpora
tions, hence its wonderful contortions in ver
biage, its agonized efforts to use much lan
guage and say nothing. This much must be
admitted, however, to the candidate fits the
platform as though a political tailor* had meas
ured him for it. Parker can probably use
more words and say less that you are certain
of than any man In America.

not the kind of Democrats to clamor for a

Those things which Mr. Bryan said were
facts, before the nomination, were obliterated
from the catalogue of facts by the nomination;
they are facts yet.
By a dictatorial tone, amounting to menace.
Judge Parker was driven by the New York
World Into the sending of the telegram which
told the Democratic Convention for the first
time, and many hours after Parker had se
cured the nomination, that the gold standard
was "Irrevocably fixed." Neither then nor in
any utterance afterwards did he say that the
gold standard was right, until he had been
shelled so vigorously by myself and others for
having deserted the free sllverltes without
faying they were wrong, and having gone over
to the frold standard without saying it was
right. Kven Judge Parker finally realized
that the ground was caving under his feet
and was literally driven to firmer footing. At
last he has taken his place (side by nlde with
Roosevelt on the most deeply important Issue
before the people.
Let It be borne In mind that Wall street
wanted the last Congress to Issue more bonds;

the money power to hide their plans until the
victim Is In their, trap â and you will begin to
realize what terrible dangers still lurk In this
money question.
Whether or not the healing 1 virtues, tho
nomination cured all the hypocrisy and fraud
by which It has been obtained. Is a question
each citizen should put to his own Intelligence
before he votes.
Much abuse has been heaped upon me be
cause more time was 1 devoted by me to de
nunciation of Parker than ot Roosevelt. The
reason Is obvious enough. Roosevelt Is a
straight out Republican who declares boldly
fcr Republican principles, defiantly defending
existing conditions. To attack him is a short,
easy Job. He is so conspicuous and stationary
a target that no one who wishes to take a
shot at him could possibly miss the mark. He
is not in ambush; he is behind no "blind";
he stands out In the open and he says to his
enemies, "Here I am â a Republican who
stands pat on all existing: conditions; if you
want to fight, come on!" Now, I can under
stand a Republican like that; and, while I
would lovo to make my battle-ax ring on his
helmet until one of us went down in political
defeat and death, yet I could respect him all
the while, as a foeman worthy of any man's
steel. Mr. Roosevelt will get Republican votes,
and no other. He is not seeking the support
of Bryan Democrats upon false pretenses. He
is not playing a confidence garce on the negro
question. He is not attempting to win Jeffer
sonlan!! by a sham adherent's to Jeffersonlan
principles. In short, there is no danger thai
Jeffersonlan Democrats will vote for Roosevelt
upon the assumption that he is a Jeffersonian
Democrat. There is no danger that Roosevelt
will get a single vote to which I, as a Jeffer
sonlan in principle, am entitled.
With Mr. Parker it Is different. He is not
a Jeffersonlan Democrat, yet he seeks to secure
the support of Jeffersonlans. If he" would
speak out plainly and tell the people that he
Is in principle the same, practically, that
Roosevelt is. the Bryan Democrats would fall
away from his by the million, tt would then
be enabled to organize such a party of revolt
against the Republican rule as would sweep
the country. His attitude Is thoroughly dls
ingenious, profoundly lacking in true man
hood and leadership. He was willing to stand
upon the New York State platform which Mr.
Bryan denounced as a dishonest platform. His
position was so indefinite, so foxy, so entirely
neutral, that Mr. Bryan declared, to cheer
ing thousands, that Parker was "absolutely
unfit for the Democratic nomination," and
,that "nobody but an artful dodger" could
stand upon that New York platform â which so
much resembled its father, David B. Hill.
I believe it was also in the same speeches
that Mr. Bryan declared that a. man should
be willing to die for his convictions â which is
also a very sound proposition.
Mr. Bryan, who Is always careful In the
statement of matured opinions, has assured
the country that "the Influences back of the Par
ker candidacy are so intimately associated with
trusts and great corporations that the Demo
cratic party could not appeal to the masses."
"With such a candidate," said Mr. Bryan,
"they would begin with a foot race and end
with a rout." Likewise he stated a self
evident fact when he declared that "the plu
tocratic element for the first time being is In
control of the Democratic party."
It was equally clear to Mr. Bryan, as it
was to many others, that "the nomination of
Parker was secured by crooked and indefensible
methods," and that the "nomination of such
a man who had, as Mr. Bryan declared, won
the honor with "loaded dice," virtually nul
lified thftj. anti-trust plank In the Democratic
platform. *
These were fearfully Important facts, and
they produced the impression on the minds of
millions that there was something stealthy;
deceitful, cowardly and utterly dishonest In
the Parker campaign for the nomination. Mr.
Bryan stated facts, profoundly important facts,
and they continued to be facts up to the time
that Parker actually got the nomination which
he had sought on a "cowardly and straddling
platform," the honor for which he had played
with "loaded dice."
ship If we fall to realize our responsibility.
The ballot Is one of the weapons with which
we must hold our ground. The contention of
the People's party being that . both the old
parties- are wrong, we wage war on both. Ours
Is the two-edged sword. In our campaign it
may happen that we do greater damage to the
Republicans than to the Democrats â as In

Democrats were instructed by the Cleveland
managers to vote for Weaver. In another cam

Populism, which Is sound Jeffersonlan dem
ocracy, and to hit the Republicans on the one

Jefferson and Jackson waged war against
national banks, contending that they were hos
tile to the spirit of our Government. The
Republican party has always favored national
banks; thus, in the national platform of the
party In 1S96 and 1900, national banks were
denounced In language strong- enough to have
satisfied Thomas Jefferson. At this time, how
ever, the counsels of the Democratic party
are presided over by Arthur Gorman, who has
always supported the system, and by August
Belmont, who is a national banker. To prove
that both "the great political parties" are now
"Irrevocably fixed" in their support of the na
tional banks, we have only to remember that
they united hands and hearts to recharter
them two years ago.
One of, the worst features of our financial
system is the farming out to the national
banks of the power, privilege and profit of
supplying the country with paper currency.
Instead of using its own credit for the equal
benefit of all the people, the Government lends
this credit to the national banker to be used
lor the benefit of the banker. Thus the na
tional banker becomes a beneficiary of special
privilege, and, basing his notes upon the credit
of the Government, charges his fellow citizens
for the use of them. He, the privileged, fat
tens upon usury at the expense of the unprivi
leged. There are now about five thousand na
tional banks, which keep In circulation more
than $400,000,000 of their notes. At S per
cent this represents a yearly profit" of more
than $30,000,000 which they derive from the
special prlvileue of using the public credit for
their private benefit. Clothed with the sover
eign power of creating what is practically a
legal tender currency, they can contract It or
expand it whenever they please; and, if they
decide to give the country a taste of their
despotic power, as in 1893, there Is no power
which can protect the victim. No class of citi
zens should be clothed by law with such terri
ble advantages over their fellows.
(5) The cold standard is not "irrevocably
fixed." because it Is unscientific and wrong.
Nothing Is more certain than that the people
of this country will continue their struggle
until they have a national currency which the
money power cannot control and which an

(2) That both parties drew their campaign
funds frcm the trusts and the corporations.
(3) That the platforms of the two parties
were made as much alike as possible â so much
that one of the candidates on the national
ticket admitted that they were "almost Iden
tical."
(4) That the environment of the candidates
of the two parties was exactly the same.
(5) The political record which proved that
both the old Dartles had united to defeat any
measure of reform. .
(6) The fact that the record ehcrwed that
both the old parties had united in establish
ing, step by step, the system as we now
have It.
These proofs are all at hand. Any well In
formed citizen can see the facts If he will.
To rely upon one of "the two great political
parties" means possible defeat and disaster.
By obtaining control of both, the element of
risk is eliminated. This is so obviously true
that I only state it as a basis for further
comment. In controlling only one of the "two
great political parties" the corporations might
be willing to let tho fact be more or lens
known. Mark Hanna, for instance, did not
seem to care, nor did Quay. Both of these
Republican managers took a business-like view
Of the question and compelled the Â£>eneficiarieÂ»
of class legislation to put up the campaign fund
necessary to perpetuate the system. They
knew what they wanted were willing to pay
for it, did pay for it and got it. Really no
secret was made of the way in which It wai
done. The corporations were plainly, bluntly
told that if they wanted to keep things just
as they were- they must pay the price, and
they paid It.
But when it becomes the better policy to se
cur* control of both the "two great political
parties," so that the corporations will not be
hurt In any event, secrecy Is necessary.
There must always be an ostensible party for
the people, a party pretending to be demo
cratic In principle. If the corporations wer*
Â¦Â«en to be In open, undisputed control of both
"the two great political parties" there would
be an Immediate revolt of the Democratic
masses. An open control of both the two old
parties would defeat Its own purpose. To make
the scheme a success, secrecy and denial are
absolutely necessary. Positive, direct evidence,
therefore, could hardly ever be had. But If
aich a deal has been made, and both the old
parti?* are in control of the corporations, there
ought to . be circumstantial evidence whicii
would carry conviction to any sensible mind.
Suppose that the corporations had deter
mined to control both the old parties, and
were In fact controlling them, what would be
the evidence of it? -
(1) That some of the corporations and trusts
joined the Republicans and others the Demo
crats . :.

Xobody will question the statement that by
far the greater part of the wealth of this
country Is new owned and controlled by cor
porations. Xor will any one doubt that they
intend to maintain the present legislation
which is to favorable to them.
Grant these premlsss and then go a step
further; nothing will better serve to keep them
in power and to maintain their wealth and
advantage than the control of both "the great
political parties." As long as the corporation*
own but one of these great parties their sys

General Wheeler's speech was a terrible ar
raignment of German's bill. But as he was
about tc take his seat this question was asked
by Mr. Hopklne:- "I take It from the gentle

bill." The reply of General Wheeler was
prompt: "Xo, sir; I will vote for it." and the
griKled warrijr aat down amid laughter.
Consider the ease of General Joseph
Wheeler, also 1 . This grinled" soldier was a
member of Congress when the Infamous Gor
man tariff act came back to the House to be
voted on. Its sell-out to the trusts was so
palpable, its slavish submission to corporation
greed was so brarenly apparent, that' General
Wheeler made an elaborate speech against thÂ»
bill. He showed how the entire South had
txvri discriminated against by an Increase of
tax's upon â¢ those articles which she bought,
mhile at the same time those products which
she said were put upon the free list where they
had to meet the competition of the world.
He also showed how the very tools with which
the laboring man had to toll for his dally
bread were subjected to a higher tax than
had been put upon them by the McKlnley bill.
He aUo showed â¢ how the trusts had been fa
vored, how money would be taken from Â¦ one
class to swell the fortunes of a more favored
oliss. He showed how the farmer would have
to pay more under the Democratic tariff than
had been expected under the Republican tariff
on various articles, which may be reasonably
calied necessaries.

OAKLAND. Oct. 9. â The Oakland
Real Estate Dealers* Association at
its monthly meeting yesterday ap
pointed a committee of three mem
bers to investigate the assessment of

clothing torn to shreds, stark naked
and moaning: like an animal in pain,
Paolo Angelo, awaiting trial on a
charge of horse stealing, was found
in his cell at the County Jail this

termittent spells of quiet, when the
prisoner would listen to the pleas of
the Jailers to settle down;
Angelo was arrested and taken to
the County Jail August 28 from Liver

down the grated doors with the agility
of a monkey. Angelo is 38 years old.

There is a steadily increasing demand
for residence property In Fruitvale. and
dealers are kept busy securing suita
ble locations for purchasers. Renting
is at a standstill, there being few

ALAMEDA, Oct. 9.â There is a lull
in the local realty market, which is
attributed by many dealers to the po
litical campaign now on. and to the un
usual tail of rain for this time of the
year. The demand for modern cottaces
to rent continues, but building has re
ceived a setback because of the wet
weather. No transfers of any note have
been made during the last week.
Frank N. Dodd of the Alameda Land
Company states that his firm has had
numerous inquiries from San Francisco
persons concerning local improved and
unimproved property. He attributes
this inquiry to the impression that is
becoming general that it will not be
long before the Southern Pacific Com
pany will change the motive power on
its two Alameda lines from steam to
electric. When that change is made
it is admitted that property along Rail
road and Encinal avenues, on which the
steam roads run. will command higher
prices.
Hammond & Hammond are busy
with persons looking for houses to
rent.
Through W. J. Mortimer &. Co.,
Richard Mou of the Contra Costa

dren are going to the University.
J. J. Mason & Co. have sold thirty
three of the -10 lots in the Fairview
Park tract, the southeastern entrance
to Berkeley. This tract was recently
thrown on the market, and is one of

* number of lots in the Hopkins Ter
race tract, half of which is sold.
Through this Una B. C. Brooks of
tlureka has purchased J. L. Barker's

Suburban real estate dealers are
well satisfied with the oondition of
the market, and are contident that
the winter will be marked by activity.
There is a demand for all kinds of
residence properly. Inquirers want to
Â£et cash prices on property.
Building is active, and construction
will continue during the rains.
That Berkeley is becoming desirable
as a residence town Is patent from the
number of sales to outsiders. Isgrigg
& Harris have been successful in lo
cating home builders. Within the
week the firm has disposed of eight
lots, upon which the purchasers will
build. These purchasers are all out
siders, live ol them hailing from
Southern California, two from Oak
land, and one from San Francisco.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 9.â Fire broke out
at 11 o'clock to-night in Armory Hall,
the headquarters of Company G, Fifth
Regiment, N. G. C, destroying several
thousand dollars' worth of military
equipment and badly damaging the
building. Of the company's arms only
one Krag-Jorgensen rifle waB saved.
A large quantity of regimental sup
plies, including blankets, tents and
clothing in custody of the quartermas
ter, was burned or ruined by water.
Members of the company, at consider
able risk, carried four thousand rounds
of ammunition out of the burning arm
ory. There were explosions of car
tridges at intervals as the fire ad
vanced, showing that the men did not
save all of the shells. Some shelter
tents and blankets were rescued- About
fifty rifles were burned, as were all of
the fittings of the company's rooms,
including furniture, piano, carpets, bil
liard tables and the like.
The fire was first seen on the roof at
the front of the hall, wnich is on Park
street and Buena Vista avenue. By the
time the firemen were at work the
flames were under good headway. The
building is a large frame structure, old
and infiammable. The rains helped to
check the spread of the fire. It is* sup
posed a defective flue caused the fire.
There was a large auditorium in the
main building and the rooms adjacent
were occupied by Company G. The
company's loss approximates $2500,
with $500 insurance.
The regimental loss cannot yet be
estimated. The building was damaged
to the extent of $3000 to $4000. It is
owned by the Dr. J. C. Tucker estate.
When they commanded me to put up my
hands I did so, without loss of time, and told
them to bo to it. One of them took what
money I had in my pockets and the. other fel
low, who kept me covered with his" gun, said
"get his watch." They did not find the watch,
which I carried in a small pocket In my
trousers. I observed that one of the fellows
had red hair and the other black hair. I be
lieve they were green at the holdup business,
as their voices seemed to tremble when they
spoke.
Stanley has a barber shop at 1533
Park street, Alameda. After counting
and pocketing the receipts of the day
he boarded an electric car, which he
left at Twenty-third avenue and East
Fourteenth street. What happened
after that, as related by Stanley, fol
lows:
Upon leaving the car I proceeded north alone
Twenty-third avenue toward East Sixteenth
street. I observed two young fellows walking
ahead of me for two blocks. When I came up
with them they separated and permitted me to
pass between them on the sidewalk. They
then crossed over to the opposite side of the
avenue, quickened their pace and disappeared
in the darkness. The next I saw of them was
when they stepped; out from the shadows on
the same side of the avenue on which I was
traveling and ordered ma to throw up my
hands. They both wore masks and had pistols
aiming directly at me.
Two masked highwaymen held up
and at the, point of revolvers relieved
Edward Stanley of $25 last night at
10:30 o'clock on Twenty-sixth avenue,
near East Fourteenth street, while the
victim of the robbers was on his way
to his home in Fruitvale. Stanley of
fered no resistance to the footpads, as
they took him by surprise and got the
drop on him before he realized their
purpose. He yielded all the coin he
had and was told to go and earn some
more.
While one man kept guard with the
weapon the companion robber, also
displaying a revolver, deftly removed
Campbell's jewelry and relieved him
of his money.
Campbell was permitted to continue
his interrupted journey after being ad
monished to raise no alarm.
Two pairs of highwaymen at oppo
site ends of the city operated last
night. Each brace of., footpads was
successful. The first encounter was
that of two robbers armed with pis
tols, who held up C. W. Campbell on
Tenth street, near Market, and robbed
him of a watch, chain, diamond locket
and $9 while he was walking home last
night at 9:30 o'clock. Campbell lives
at 966 Tenth street, near the scene of
the robbery.
Because he objected to the notoriety
Campbell kept his adventure from the
police until this afternoon. The vic
tim could give only a meager descrip
tion of his assailants, the darkness
preventing him from getting a fair
look at them.
Campbell told the police that }he
footpads suddenly came upon him from
the cover of trees that line the side
walk. Before he had time to move
he was ordered to throw up his hands
and a pistol was presented at his head,
Inforcing the demands.

The old man's most serious external
injury was the fracture of the leer,
coupled with a mass of cuts and bruises
about the head, face and hands. In
fact he was almost unrecognizable. On
top of this was the severe shock
followed by the exposure to the
storm of the night. Miller was ly
ing between â¢ the railroad tracks, his
body clear of passing trains. The
switching crew that found him. took
him on a car to the foot of Peralta
street and thence he was removed by
the police to the hospital.
Dr. J. J. Meigs, the Southern Pacific
Company's surgeon, censured the crew
for not sending word to the company's
doctors. He said Miller would have
been sent immediately to the Southern
Pacific hospital In San Francisco If
the medical department had been in
formed.
Harry Borchert. steward at the Re
ceiving Hospital, found among Miller's
effects a slip of paper upon which was
written: "If anything should happen,
telegraph to Mrs. F. M. Lilly. Oxnard.
Ventura County." Miller regained con
sciousness enough to say Mrs. Lilly
was his Fister. Another address was
that of Mrs. Sarah Benson. 259 East
Sixty-second street. Chicago. She is
supposed to be another sister of Miller
with whom he had been visiting.
After a night of wretched exposure
from the storm, lying between the
Southern Pacific Company's tracks near
Sixteenth-street station, with his right
leg badly fractured, D. L. Miller, 72
years old, of Santa Margarita, was
found at 6 o'clock this morning by a
railroad switching crew. He had fallen
from an overland train last night. Un
conscious and helpless from hts severe
injuries and the shock, the aged man
was taken to the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. R. T. Stratton, the chief surgeon,
found the patient in a critical condition.
Amputation of the injured member will
probably be necessary, as circulation
had ceased in the extremity.
Miller had lain exposed to the drench
ing rain for at least eight hours. It
Is supposed that he fell from an in
bound overland, as his papers showed
that he had bern in Chicago on a visit
and was returning home. Near him
was a lunch basket. The theory is that
he had prepared to leave the train and
had stepped out on a platform to make
ready to alight, mistaking Sixteenth
street station for the Oakland pier. The
swing of the car at a curve caused
him to lose balance and pitch off the
platform, unseen by any. of the train
crew.

The Bay Cities Water Company has
renewed its offer to sell a municipal
water supply to Oakland for $3,750,000.
Its idea is to Increase its tender of a
guaranteed delivery of 12,000,000 gal
lons of water daily to 20.000.000. This
is said to be made possible by the ac
quisition of a large, watershed alone
the Arroyo Valle in Alameda County,
to be connected with the Santa Clara
watersheds already acquired by means
of tunnels. The company Indicates
that it has met with objection ur^ed
to its scheme by Desmond Fitzgerald,
who made a report on the tender that
was presented to the city last year.
Fitzgerald outlined the tunnelinsr idea
which the company has probably
adopted. This, second scheme is based
upon the same cost as the first one.
On the city's part will lay the con
struction of receiving and impounding
reservoirs and the construction of the
necessary service distributing pipe
lines throughout the city.* The com
pany requires that the* proper legis
lation shall be enacted by which the
scheme shall be submitted to a board
of hydraulic and civil engineers. Thl3
board shall make a thorough investiga
tion of the plan and shall say whether
the company is capable of fulfilling its
guarantee to deliver 20.000.000 gallons
a day. If the experts* report shall be
favorable, the company asks the City
Council to pledge itself to submit the
project to the people at a bond elec
tion. In case the engineers' report
shall be adverse the Bay Cities Water
Company agrees to pay the cost of the
Investigation. No suggestion is made
as to how the board of engineers shall
be appointed.
The amended tender comes on the
eve of a special meeting of the City
Council, which was called for to-mor
row night to consider the question of a
municipal water supply.

WANTED IN SANTA CRUZ.â Edwin Bur
ling, alias Brown, was arrested in a house
or. Central avenue yesterday by Detective
O'Dea and Sheriff Trafton of Santa Crux. He
Is wanted there on a . charge of stealing a
horse and buggy belonging to A. G. Abbott.
The rig . was recovered on Friday by Sheriff
Trafton. Burling has served two terms in
the County Jail; one for passing a fictitious
check, the other for petty larceny.
J. W. . Thornton, alias Wilson, the
Eastern pickpocket, was arrested last
week by Detective Ryan and identified
by H. E. Floyd. Thornton stole
Floyd's diamond stud, valued at $250,
on an electric car at the Cliff House
on the afternoon of September 30.
The pickpocket has now been identi
fied by another victim.
Amon G. Carter of 1417 Sacramento
street selected Thornton from among
five men who were ranged before him
in the City Prison on Saturday morn
ing. Carter said that he and his wife
were on a car going to the Cliff House
on April 24. Thornton jostled against
him and almost immediately he dis
covered that his diamond pin had been
taken from his necktie.
Carter accused Thornton of the
theft, but Thornton indignantly de
nied it. Thornton jumped off the car,
however, suspecting that Carter would
hail a policeman. About an hour later
Carter saw Thornton in Golden Gate
Park and chased him, but Thornton
was the better sprinter. The police
are satisfied there are other victims
to be heard from.

Charles Fermath, a machinist, who
lives at 912 Michigan street, was so
indiscreet as to. drink with two
strangers at Third and Howard
streets at 2 o'clock yesterday morning.
They professed to know him, and were
very sociable. After the drinking
they walked down the street with
him.
Suddenly one of them dealt Fer
math a blow from behind. It knocked
him down, whereupon the other
"friend" took $3 from Fermath's
trousers, after which the two left him
bleeding on the sidewalk.
Fermath's head was patched at the
Central Emergency Hospital, where he
described the footpads in such a way
that the police say they will be able
to find the criminals.

Ed Murray, a Barbary Coast "bum,"
hit upon the old trick yesterday aft
ernoon of pretending that he was
minus an arm and a leg. He sta
tioned himself at Kearny and Sacra
mento streets, sitting: upon one foot
and having one of his arms under his
coat. He held his hat in the other
hand and a number of people dropped
nickels into it Those who did not
were met with a storm of abuse.
Complaints were made to Police
man J. L. Nelson, and he went to
where Murray was begging. Seeing,
as he thought, a cripple, Nelson told
Murray to get a move on. Murray
Jumped to his feet and struck at the
astonished policeman with both hands.
Nelson instantly recognized him and
soon took all the fight out of Murray,
who was taken to the City Prison and
booked on a charge- of begging. When
searched one of his pockets was al
most filled with nickels. The Judge
will probably sentence Murray to
warm quarters with three meals a
day, as there is no chain gang, no pun
ishment other than shelter and food
for such men.

sion to drill on the golf links. Here the
maneuvers directed by him were wit
nessed by great crowds, all of whom
were instructed and edified. Such bril
liant and snappy exercises had not
been seen in years. Though an able
and efficient officer in Uncle Sam's
army, Major Bigelow is also possessed
of literary attainments of a high or
der. He was professor of military sci
ence at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology from 1894 to 1898. He is
author of "Mars-la-Tour and Gravel
otte," "Principles of Strategy" and
'â¢Reminiscences of the Santiago Cam
paign."
Major Bigelow was in the battle of
San Juan and on July 1 was severely
wounded there.
Contributions of any description will
be gratefully received by officers of the
nursery. In aid of the good work' the
Wells-Fargo Express Company has
consented to ship free of charge all
packages addressed to the nursery un
der fifty pounds in weight. All sub
scriptions and donations of supplies
should be addressed to the San Fran
cisco Nursery for Homeless Children,
1534 Mission street. â¢
The San Francisco Nursery for
Homeless Children is one of the oldest
institutions in San Francisco. For
many years it has been doing nobly
and well the work for caring for poor
children, but now appeals to the public
for aid in the erection of a new build
ing to house the increasing number
of applicants.
The work of the nursery is different
from that of other institutions in the
city. It receives aid from no church,
as it Is non-sectarian, and gives to all
the little ones a broad Christian train
ing. The nursery previously received
children of both sexes under the age
of 14, with no other recommendation
than that of necessity. At the present
time, however, it is compelled to turn
away from one to six applicants daily,
owing to lack of accommodations.
It Is the endeavor of the nursery to
give the children a home free from
anything that would mark them as "in
stitution children." At present sev
enty-five children are living In the
building at Twelfth and Mission
streets â a house that is old, not ar
ranged for nursery work, unsafe in
case of fire, and even insecure in the
society's tenure of it.
After many years of close economy
and hard work the nursery has been
able to purchase a block of land on
Lake street, between Fourteenth and
Fifteenth avenues, and the need of a
new building is keenly felt. Plans for
the building have been finished and
the foundations laid. The sum of $15,
000 has been raised, but fully $20,000
more is necessary to complete the
work.
BOSTON, Oct. 9.â Great crowds went
to Trinity Church to-day to hear the
Archbishop of Canterbury preach, and
to the Church of the Advent, where a
mass meeting in the interest of uobold-
Ing the sanctity of the marriage bond
was addressed by several well known
leaders in the Episcopal church.
Right Rev. William C. Doan, D. D.,
Bishop of Albany .and chairman of the
Interdenominational Committee of
Churches which is endeavoring to se
cure conformity regarding the remar
riage of persons who have been di
vorced, quoted from the marriage rit
ual of the prayer book to show that
nothing but death could sever those
who have -been united in holy matri
mony and said:
"I think it is time that the canons
of the church agreed with the prayer
book."
Rev. Dr. W. W. Webb of Neochita.

Those consecrated into the Holy
Childhood Sodality were:
A pretty ceremony took place at St.
Mary's Cathedral yesterday afternoon,
when a number of children were conse
crated Into the Holy Childhood Sodal
ity and the Holy Angels' Sodality.
The consecrations were performed
with solemnity by the Rev. Father Je
rome B. Hannigan, who also delivered
an address to the little ones. Father
Hannigan said that while the conse
crated ones were exceedingly happy at
being admitted to the sodalities, he was
happy, too, In being able to admit them.
He told of the child life and growth of
Jesus and of his love for the little ones.
Touching , upon sin and evil, the
speaker hoped that those children be
fore him would never know or experi
ence either one, but that their lives
would be free from trouble, from temp
tation and the trials of the world. To
avoid evils and sin they must trust in
and appeal to God.

secrated into the Holy Angels' Sodality:

Rider Haggard, whose new novel,
"The Brethren," is to appear soon, is
convinced that, on one subject, at least,
*he has become a bore. "Whenever I
enter a room," he said the other day,
"I hear the remark passed, 'Here comes
Rider Haggard, for heaven's sake
don't mention the word agriculture.' "
The subject of how the English coun
try land Is to be developed and the
young people of the rural districts kept
on the farms is, of course, that in
which Richard Whiteing also takes so
keen an interest and which largely in
spired "The Yellow Van." True it is
that Rider Haggard, has dwelt on this
theme "many a time and oft," and
the pubMc can hardly be blamed jfor
preferring him in his capacity of, story
teller. Realizing that it does thus
prefer him, the author of "She" says
JB WOMAN was asked not long ago what she would be if she
/\ had her choice and replied that to her to be the widow of a
/ \ rich man she had not loved seemed ideal. This being a widow
appeals mightily to some women, but, on the other hand, there
are widows who say they would not wish their worst enemies anything
worse. But the independence of being a young widow is extremely fas
cinating; of course the possession of means goes without saying as a
necessity to ideal widowhood. Now, of course, this, all sounds very
heartless and I fear that many women will be shocked at me, cays a
contributor to the St. Paul Globe, for discussing so painful a sub
ject in a light way, but no offense is intended and the occasion was
given by the remark quoted above. A young widow with plenty' of
money is possessed of a freedom which a woman could surely gain in
no other way. She does not need a chaperon and, her life is hers to do
as she pleases with. /
Some women were talking recently of the troubles thaUrarely come
singly and one woman told of another whose sorrows seemed more
than she could bear. "In the first place she lost her husband," said
she, but not a word was said. "Then she lost all her money," at this a
perfect chorus of "Oh, how awful!" went round. Comment is unneces
sary. You can get a second, nay, a thirds fourth or fifth husband, but
when you lose your money it is sad indeed. For money is a protection
to a woman that nothing els? is, even sometimes a husband. Years
ago when a woman's husband died, leaving her without means, some
body, perhaps a relative or friend, would offer a home and she would
be cared f6r. " While that often happens now, more often a widow, will
turn to account some talent or accomplishment she has or go into busi
ness. And the ways in which women can now help themselves are in
creasing yearly- It, is not, literally, the dreadful thing to lose one's
husband' that it was years ago. This is speaking, of course, from
a material point of view. Love is the same and the sorrow of separa
tion is Just as dreadrul as formerly, but a woman is not as utterly
bereft as she was In* another age. fcshe can support herself if necessary
and bring up her family well merely by her own exertions.-
So do not say the times are not improving and that women should go
back to an age when they were encased in cotton wool and knew
nothing. of the world. It is an excellent thing for many men that
women can do for themselves and have left behind them a day when
they were merely expected to look pleasant and be able to embroider
pretty little things.
Now there may be a few young widowsâ even with plenty of money
âto whom life looks dark and who think they can never, never smile
again. But let them cheer up, for * when one is young there is al
ways hope. And then if a young widow who is rich only stops to
think how many women envy her, it will ' be ' some - solace. Black is
exceedingly becoming to young faces, and a small white frill round the
face is really fetching. It is surprising that the widow's bonnet and
white cap have gone out of fashion, for they are stunning on a young
woman. "A little widow is a dangerous thing," says an up-to-date
calendar, and a truer thing was never printed. So if at first life seems
insupportable, remember that skies will be blue again.

t-nROFESSOR METCHNIKOFF of the Pasteur Institute in
r""^ Paris believes that he has discovered an elixir of life, and while
* he does not promise perpetual youth, like, the charlatans who in
all ages have reaped golden harvests from the credulity and supersti
tion of men, he does claim by means of his preparation he can add
many years to the ordinary span of human life.
Professor Metchnikoff is of course a scientist of considerable
eminence, otherwise the half-derisive interest which we are told his
announcement has aroused throughout the scientific world would
certainly be of a far more pronounced character. Civilization has
been wittily defined as a means by which we acquire the luxuries
and dispense with the necessities of life, and the modern craze for
prolonging existence by other than the most obvious and effective
means is certainly one of the signs of the times. -~ / '
There is of course no need to go to the laboratories of the
Pasteur Institute to know that by an observance of the wellrknown
laws of mental and physical health life can be preserved far be
yond the present average limit, but what we are clamoring for at
the present day is some method by which we may continue to break
the ordinances of nature and at the same time escape the penalties
of premature decay. Whether Professor Metchnikoff has discovered
such a method time and experience alone can show. It would. still
remain an open question whether such a gift would} constitute a
service or 1 a disservice to humanity.
A NEW ELIXIR OF LIFE.
BEFORE the International Geographical Congress, recently in
session, there appeared for discussion the well-worn propo
sition of an international railroad to connect New York and
Paris via Bering Strait. M. Loicq de Lobel, who fathers the scheme,
is so certain of its practicability that he is going to seek the aid
of President Roosevelt in bringing about a convention with Russia,
neutralizing the frozen strait between Alaska and Siberia. So far
has the French enthusiast elaborated his plans that he even ac
counts for elevators which shall carry the Bering tunnel passengers
to the surface that they may enjoy the picturesque view of the white
ocean.
Not many years ago, when the idea of a round the world rail
road was first advanced, the editors of three papers in New York,
London and Paris, scenting the news feature in the idea, sent a
journalist, Harry de Windt, over the route proposed by the pro
jectors of the movement. In a book, recently published, De Windt
gives what appears to be a convincing refutation of all arguments
for the scheme's practicability, by detailing the impassable condi
tion of the northern Siberian country. The regions about the Bering
Sea and for over a thousand miles west into the interior he shows
to be but a floating morass in the short summer when the ice has
left the ground, which no railroad could bridge at any expenditure
of time and labor. In winter time the winds from the Arctic^ sweep
ing relentlessly over the treeless plains of snow, make life itself a
questionable* quantity. The tunneling of Bering Strait would be
only one of the minor engineering problems to be confronted, ac
cording to this explorer.
Despite these discouraging reports M. de Lobel's project con
tinues to have a romantic interest. It is remembered that when the
Atlantic cable was first proposed, the world scoffed, and there are
those who hold that in this age of mechanical wonders there is no
such word as "impossible."
PARIS TO NEW YORK BY LAND.
"When working at his country house
at Wallingford Jerome's habit is to
wander from room to room, and when
most absorbed in thought he will gen
erally be found In front of a clock
which he regards with seemingly in
tent eyes. Several years ago Jerome
went to visit some newly made friends,
and, having no end of commissions
to work off, arranged that he should
have his mornings to himself, a pro
viso, of course, that was readily agreed
to. The first morning he retired to
his room after breakfast, remarking
that he was going to "grind." Not long
afterward, however, his hostess dis
covered him in the dining-room, appar
ently transfixed by the beauties of the
timepiece on the mantel, and the good
lady, not knowing how dependent the
author is on clocks, began chaffing him
on his "work." Jerome, however,
didn't seem especially Jovial â on the
contrary he made his escape with an
abruptness that was almost rude. An
hour later his hostess came upon him
again, this time in the drawing-room
and, as before, with eyes, apparently,,
only for the clock. Once more she ral
lied him on his apparent laziness â
whereupon' Jerome sought out hfs host
and explained matters with the result
that his clock-gazing was disturbed
no more., Wallingford. where the au
thor has lived since he deserted Lon
don, is in Berkshire, and the house
there which Jerome and his family in
habit is an almost ideal country re
treat, furnished with every modern
luxury," including a brown fox terrier.
: Apropos of the coming unveiling in
London of the monument to Milton, to
which so many Americans have sub
scribed, a grewsome fact of which
few are aware in connection with the
poet has just been recalled. This "is
that the body of the author of "Para
dise - Lost" was once on view at a
charge of 6 cents a head within a
few yards of the site chosen for the
new tribute to his memory. It was
in 1790, after heavy drinking on their
part, that two overseers and a carpen
ter entered the Church of St. Giles,
Crfpplegate, where Milton lay buried,
and, having discovered the leaden cof
fin which contained his body, cut open
its top with a mallet and chisel. "When
LONDON, Sept. 25.â Jerome K. Je
rome's new story, "Tommy and Com
pany," published here recently, must
have made Its appearance at home,
too, and American readers may be in
terested to hear that clocks probably
played no small part in its composi
tion. Clocks are Jerome's surest means
of inspiration. Not in their ordinary
capacityâ not that they stimulate him
by calling attention to the rate at
which the minutes are flyingâ but
merely as Quaint objects the contem
plation of which suggests things to
him.

INSPIRATION
Thus we see expansion in wealth and the volume of general
business on all sides â financial, mercantile, railroad traffic, mill
>perations and returns to farmers for their crops. All this is but
another term for, prosperity. And when we consider that this is a
Presidential year, the most unpropitious of alltimes for trade expan
sion, the most pessimistic observer must admit that general business
is improving. We are not doing the huge business that we did during
the boom years immediately following the Spanish War, but we
are doing very well indeed, with most excellent prospects for the
future. Hence the feeling of buoyancy and confidence which for
some weeks has been growing all over the country.
AS autumn advances the trade outlook steadily becomes more
promising. No important adverse influences have developed
for weeks. Trepidation over the condition of the corn and
cotton crops has passed, as both* crop9 are now practically out of
danger, and while neither will be the bumpers expected a couple
of months sgo, they will be large, cotton being estimated at about
11,000,000 bales and corn at about 2,200,000,000 bushels. The wheat
crop will be comparatively light, and the New York financial in
terests are now figuring on about 100,000,000 bushels for export,
with prospects that the reduced export this year will be fully
offset by the higher prices obtained for the grain. When it is con
sidered that the trade situation this year depends almost exclusively
on the condition of the three or four great crops, it will be seen
at a glance that the coming year is full of promise.
It is this condition more than any other, or combination of
others, perhaps, which is the cause of the recent expansion in trade
and the supersession of optimism to the pessimism which hung
over the country during the spring. With large corn and cotton
crops we will draw heavy amounts of money from Europe, find a
large freight traffic for our railroad lines, keep our mills running,
hundreds of thousands of workmen employed, and our farmers'
pockets well supplied with ready money. All this means trade
activity and consequent business prosperity. In addition we have
very firm and active markets for wool, hops, hay, hides and many
minor products of the soil, a good and gradually improving tone
in the iron and steel trades, with the railroads larger buyers of
material than for some time. The provision market, too, that most
excellent barometer of trade, has been in better tone than for some
weeks, and the tendency in prices is now rather upward than down
ward, with a strong undertone pervading the market.
Wall street is reflecting these improved conditions and the feel
ing in stock and financial quarters is decidedly bullish. There is no
excitement in the. New York stock market, but the buoyancy of the
feeling there is apparent, and all efforts to further depress the values
of railroad and industrial shares are unavailing. If stocks are not
rising rapidly they are certainly not receding, and there is now a
good and growing demand for standard railroad and industrial
shares, and, what is a good sign, this demand is for dividend pur
poses and not for feverish speculation.
The financial statistics are especially encouraging. During the
second week of September forty-three railroads reported a gain
in earnings of over 6 per cent, and in the first week fifty roads an
nounced a gain of over 4 per cent as compared with the same weeks
in 1903. These steadily increasing earnings are accepted as demon
strating the gradual expansion of business. Confirmatory of this is
the increase in bank clearings, which last week showed the pro
nounced gain of 18.8 per cent over the corresponding week of 1903,
with the aggregate clearings increased to $2,588,000,000, the largest
figures for at least a year. ,
If these aggregate clearings are a 'reliable index to the con
dition of trade, then business in the United States last week was
the largest for many months. Further confirmation is found in the
increase of over $107,000,000 in gold coin in the cash reserves of the
5000 national banks during the year ending September 27. In
creased gold certificates for the same period, amounting to $29,
000,000, have been issued by the United States Treasury, thus
making $136,000,000 increase in the country's gold money circula
tion during the year ending September 27.

Tailormades in Demand !
AMERICAN DUCHESS
PUTS A STOP TO
STREET GAMBLING
The beginning of the fall season al
ways finds the tailor-made the late".
esting consideration of the moment so
far as affairs of the wardrobe are con
cerned. The present month is no Â«.
ception to the rule. On the contrary,
the rumors of a definite change in the
fH|hions which have stirred the air
during the summer have given walk
ing and visiting suits uncommon im
portance, says the New York Sun.
But those rumors â many of them â
are groundless, for no startling revo
lution is apparent, so far, in Incoming
models.
Among the ready-mades, suit de
partments never displayed rarer bar
gains than they are doing this month.
The art of women's tailoring has ad
vanced far in the last few years, and
women who a few years ago scorned
to wear anything that was not made
to order have their wardrobes stocked
these days with garments found in
"ready-to-wear" sections. Among the
suits of moderate price, cheviots and
serges prevail. These are made, as a
rule, with plaited skirts and coats of
any length between the brief bolero
and the three-quarter depth. A pret
ty suit of black cheviot, marked $25.
has a skirt laid in clusters of half-
Inch tucks which were stitched below
the knees. The coat had a fitted body
with basque cut away in front and at
sides and rounding rapidly to a half
length tail at the back. The collarlesa
neck and cuffs were finished with
bands of velvet and braid. In the
front was a narrow waistcoat of plain
black cloth finished with- two parallel
rows of brass buttons.
In blue, brown and black broadcloth
there are jaunty suits to be had in
excellent quality and finish as low as
|35. Some of the prettiest suits are
of invisible checked cheviots and
cloths. These are trimmed with plain
cloth braided. The sleeves of the
prettiest wraps arÂ© large, most of
them being full at the top and gath
ered or plaited into wristbands or
cuffs.
The popular colors in cloths are the
blues and browns; the dull green?.
such as bronze, reseda and rr..
â¢tone grays and reddish purples. The
new tones, such as the coppers and
dahlia shades, appear in the new cloths
as well as in the materials provided for
the milliner. The nuances of modish
shades were never more beautiful and
effective than this season. Of the
browns, tobacco is at this moment
the leader.
The costume of dotted green taffeta
has a skirt with four flounces which
are somewhat shaped at the top and
fitted to the skirt in tiny tucks. They
are bordered with bands of plain vel
vet. The bodice has a shallow lace
yoke with a shaped bertha, the lines
of which continue in the short flow
ing sleeves. A deep velvet girdle fas
tens at one side. The undersleevea
; are of lace like the yoke.
The brown broadcloth gown has a
very full skirt gored and plaited into
the waistband. The plaits flare about
ten inches below the top, and the
skirt, which Is very voluminous at the
hem, measures fully six yards at that
point. The Jacket Is close fitting and
has a hip-length basque. Girdle and
lapels are of velvet. The yoke is
tucked and crossed by two straps.
For the Table.
More anecdotes are told concerning
the only daughter of the German Em
peror than have eveV been furnished
by her six brothers. The latest is told
by the Tagllche Rundschau, and runs
thus: The little daughter of thÂ«s
v. d. M. is a playmate of Princess
Louise. The other day she was at the
palace, and the two ladies, young as
they are, discussed the secrets of their
toilet. "Just fancy," the little Prin
cess said complalningly, "I have to
put on clean underclothing every. day!
Does your -mamma make you do that,
too?" "No," said the visitor, "not ev
ery day." "Then you are well off."
replied the Imperial Princess. Little
v. d. M. repeated the conversation at
home, and her father, imagining that
the child had perhaps asked indiscreet
questions, said to her: "My sweet
heart, people don't ask about such
things." Soon after the little girl
was again invited to the palace. Mean
while the young Princess also had
faithfully communicated the important
conversation to her parents, adding
that she envied her friend, who was not
worried every day by all these changes
of garments. The Emperor was highly
amused by the affair, and said laugh
ingly to his daugther's friend: "Why,
you lucky little mortal, and so you
need not put on clean underclothing
every day!" Whereupon the young
lady made her prof oundest curtsey, and
said: "Your Majesty, my papa says
people don't ask about these things."
When she got home she told that the
Emperor must have thought she had
said something very nice, for he had
shouted with laughter at her reply.
LONDON, Sept. 25.â While many
English society women gamble heavily
themselves and encourage others to do
likewise, the Duchess of Marlborousrh
sets a wholesome example by putting
her foot down hard on it whenever she
gets a chance. She got a chance the
other day in aristocratic Curzon street,
where her new town house is situated.
It is a favorite haunt of street book
makers, who, probably by methods
very similar to those adopted in New
York and other big cities in America,
have been able * to carry on their
operations free from police molesta
tion. Opposite the chief entrance to
her house one of these bookmakers
has plied his nefarious calling for the
last two seasons. The Duchess noticed
that several boys and laboring men ac
costed him, especially during the hour
of respite from work allowed them at
midday, and handed him slips of pa
per and money. She inquired what It
meant and on learning that the man
was a street bookmaker, who took bets
on horse races, she immediately lodged
a complaint at the nearest police sta
tion. The result was one or two raids
and now the fraternity are cursing the
day when <he American Duchess de
cided on taking a residence In Mayfair.

The Outdoor Art League has decided
to extend its work for the encourage
ment of window gardening, seed plant
ing and the planting of shrubs and
flowers in vacant lots. In furtherance
of this plan it has enlisted the aid of
the College Settlement. This organiza
tion has promised to engage actively in
this work, particularly in the southern
part of the city.
Â¦The J5000 which the Board of Super
visors recently appropriated for the
improvement of Dolores street, between
Fifteenth and Seventeenth, one b,lock
on each side of the Mission Dolores, is
now available, and the committee of
the league having this work in charge
hopes soon to have the plan for the
adornment of the surroundings of the
old mission completed.
The members of the league have been
actively engaged during the last ten
days In preparations for the benefit
performance at the Majestic Theater,
on October 17. The chief feature of the
performance wilj be the "Japanese

Whatever human frailties have been
attributed to Senator GÂ«orÂ«e C Per
kins by the Nstural-born Knockers.
tactlessness has not figured among
them. From San Pablo Bay to Oyster
Bay he has earned a reputation of say
in? just the right thing at the light
time â that is, to men. Bat alas and
aiackS Pitfalls there are In the hish
v ays and byv.ays of the great, even as
of the lowly, and Into one of these was
the astute leader led by the seductive
hand of woman.
In an unguarded moment â rather In
two unguarded moments â be essayed, to
address two organizations of women â
the Native Daughters of the Golden
West and the Association of Pioneer
Women, and therein lies his woe. Who
Ehall say what dire fate would befall
the senior Senator should the bellig
erents meet shield to shield, with the
unhappy statesman between them?
But away with gloomy forebodings!
Perhaps the Senator will have hied him
to Washington ere the battle is on.
But even there he wouldn't be safe,
because in Washington lies the cause
of the war.
In the innocence of his heart and his
>\hoiesome desire to help the women to
help California all the trouble liesâ the
crimination, recrimi nation, tears and
the feminine ultimatum, "so â there."
And it all came about bo Innocently.
thus: The Senator 'was invited to ad
dress the pioneer women at their
third anniversary celebration. Being a
Kullanl man, and an admirer of the
plucky women blazers of the trail, he
respondedâ and right nobly. Among
other interesting things he announced
that California was as yet unhonored
and unsung in Statuary Hall at Wash
ington, where every State is invited
l>y the Federal Government to perpet
uate the memory of two of its most
prominent sons in bronze or marble.
Of course, they must be dead sons â
because no man's a hero till he's a dead
one.
Well, on went the eloquent states
man, telling the interested ladies that
it was essentially their work to pro
ceed in the matter: that he himself
would send to Washington for the nec
essary papers for an intelligent begin
ning. Ah! 'Twas a noble sight to be
hold the dear old pioneer mothers
swamp the Senator with gratitude for
his â¢wise and gracious suggestion. He
couldn't drink his tea so overcome was
he with emotion.
And then the news spread abroad
that the Pioneer Women were Eoing to
start the statue movement, that a com
mittee had been appointed consisting of
Mrs. Anna Mclntyre, Miss Anna Mc-
Intyre, Mrs. Ella Lees Leijrh. Mrs.
Louise S. Chase. Mrs. Thorndyke. Mrs.
Julia PL Brown and Mrs. Louise Berry
man, and that they had cleared decks
for action.
In fact, I plead g-uilty to the charge of
helping 1 to spread the news, whereupon
lettersâ dozens of themâ telephonic sal
utations, more or less sanguinari' in
tone assailed me from dozens of out
raged Native Daughters, who clamored
in my eaxs that I had deliberately aided
and abetted the Pioneer Women in
Ftâ appropriating their honors: that
on July 24 K^ith Parlor of their order
had beg-un this FPlfsame aeitation. and
that later Senator Perkins advised with
them in methods of diplomatic proced
ure â and this many weeks before the
Pioneer Women episode. Now, ye who
know what it is to brave the wrath of
one woman may hold out the soft hand
of sympathy to the forgetful Senator,
who had thus suggested the same thine
âso say the Daughtersâ to two bodies
of women, 'something like two^hundred
<'f thrm. â¢
Now. the upshot of it all is that the
unhappy statesman is being bombard
ed with delegations and letters from
both until he can't sleep
o' nights. Thfn on Friday at the Pio
neer Women's meeting, just at the psy
chological moment, there arose a mem
ber who presented an invitation from
the Katlve Daughters bidding the Pio
neer Women to join with them in the
matter of "placing etatues of honored
sons of California in Statuary Hall, in
Washington." Phew: What a bomb
shell! and just before the Pioneer
Women had read their own resolution.
After quiet had been restored the home
motion wa; put and passed, and in the
putting the names of Leland Stanford
and T>r. Joseph Le Conte figured as the
heroes to be thus honored. The petition
of the Native Daughters leaves the
names blank. Both of these petitions
will bÂ»? circulated immediately for sig
natures, bo say both sides, and present
ed to the Legislature in the spring, un
less a flag: of truce is run up ere then.
Singular that the revered and most
logical name, Junipero Serra, he who
brought civilization and Christianity
into California, was not one of the two
mentioned. Surely all Californians who
are fair-minded and broad-souled feel,
v.-lth Helen Hunt Jackson, Charles
Lummis and every other student of
Western history, that Junipero Serra
shouldâ and mustâ be one of the two.
However, in this matter 'tis not poor
old Junipero, who hated pomp and
pride, who is to be pitied: 'tis Senator
Perkins. And our sympathies are with
him!

HONOLULU, Oct. 2.â Governor Carter
is in receipt of the following romantic
epistle from a widow in Denver, Colo.,
and is at a loss as to what disposition
to make of it. The only bachelor of
ficial of whom he knows is the Secre
tary of the Territory, A. L. C. Atkin
son. The letter says:
I know you will think this a strange request,
but hope you will help me out in It. I have
had a dream and made a banter and want
to be thf. winner. I like romance alao. It
Is this, that within a year I will marry a
Government official of Hawaii and through
you I make my request. Now I beg you to
give this to a refined gentleman, forty years
of age or over, who can appreciate a sensi
tive, poetical, musical and refined nature.
Am a widow without any incumbrance and
am affectionate. The object must be a worthy
one and I must love with my whole heart or
not at all. I am from a Ions,* line of intel
lectual ancestry- I am at present reviewing
rcy music in a conservatory in Denver, Col
orado. I can give you the best of references
as to my standing and character. This la
the only Indiscreet act of my life, but I feel
that I am Intrusting this in the hands of one
In whom I can have perfect confidence. This
must to you seem silly, but don't throw It
in the waste basket, but see what you can
do for me and I will forever remember you
in my prayers.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.â The Presi
dent has not yet decided, one way or
another, what action to take in regard
to the petition of the British and For
eign Anti-Slavery Society and Aborig
inies' Protection Association that he in
vestigate the alleged cruelties to na
tives in Congo Land. The impression
which has gone abroad that the Presi
dent will not act favorably upon the
petition is declared to be erroneous, as
he has not made up his mind.
The rule of the administration not to
initiate any radical policy just before
an election applies to the Congo peti
tion. On the other hand many people
of prominence have attached their
names to the petition and the President
does not care to risk offending them by
replying that the conduct of affairs in
Congo Land is none of the business of
the United States. The petition has
been referred to Secretary Hay for con
sideration and reply to the White
House. This status will be maintained
in all probability until after election.

WANTS ir THrY ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANTNEW YORK, Oct. 9.â John F. Eck
berg to-day hanged himself at his
home in Evanston. and when his body
was discovered the suicide held a DiDe
between his teeth. The pipe was still
lighted and Eckberg had apparently
continued smoking as long as he could
draw his breath. He was an Inveterate
smoker and all indications are that he
went about the matter of self destruc
tion- methodically- and determined to
get what solace he -might out of the
disagreeable affair.
There was no evidence of a struggle
or that Eckberg had suffered when he
expired. He was* a native of Sweden
and had been out of work. He told
some friends that there was no room
for him in the world.

KEAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Then came the apology, which in its
pathos, wrung the hearts of the dele
gates present.
The climax to the excitinff scene
came when the venerable Bishop
stood before the assembled bishops
and deputies and, with his eyes filled
with tears, his head sunk upon his'
breast, expressed an humble apology
for "having used words which a
Bishop should not have allowed him
self to use." Bishop Tuttle said:
"There is a certain parish on the
Hudson where there are a hundred
communicants and, according to the
missionary report last year, they gave
not a dollar to missionary work. In
that parish there is a conspicuous
personage. If by the vote of American
citizens he should be elected chier
magistrate of our nation by God's
providence, he would find that when he
went to Washington and attempted to
steer tho ship of state through the
islands of the Far Orient, he would
find that this land of ours had a great
deal to do with the rest of the world
and would send back a parthian arrow
to that parish on the Hudson â that
there is a need of a generous gift to
the world of missions."
BOSTON, Oct. 9.â Politics was intro
duced into th. Episcopal general con
vention in a startling manner when
Bishop Daniel S. Tuttle of Missouri,
the venerable presiding Bishop, scored
Judge Alton Parker, the Democratic
Presidential candidate, and gave him
what manv delegates called "a slap in
the face."

Another incident, related by Miss
Kirchner. told of a time when she and
McCrum were left in the house alone
together. It was on the Fourth of
July. McCrum had managed to induce
his wife and son to go awav. No
sooner . had they departed than Miss
Kirchner says he hugged and kissed
her anu forced his attentions upon her
in a most obnoxious manner. McCrum
vigorously, denied this.
Miss Kirchner was the hired girl in
the McCrum home, near Cherokee. Her
testimony was to the effect that Mc-
Crum had hugged and kissed her. She
said he came in from the field one day
in the afternoon about 2 o'clock,' while
Bhe was sweeping, and grabbed her
and embraced her, telling her that she
was a nice girl and kissed her. His
little boy entered the room and came to
her assistance. "I'll tell your wife on
you," she swears she said to him, but
he persuaded her not to tell.
DES MOINES, Iowa, Oct. 9.âFreder
ick Schmidt, a wealthy resident of Los
Angeles, has come out victor in the
suit brought by his son-in-law, J. H.
McCrum. demanding $15,000 damages
for the alienation of Mrs. McCrum's
affections. McCrum Is out both wife
and fortune because of his fondness for
the hired girl, as it was her testimony
that turned the jury in favor of the
defendant.
Miss Marv Klrchner. who had been
employed In the McCrum household,
went upon the stand yesterday after
noon and constituted the climax of
what has been a sensational trial in
the Federal Court of Sioux City. Mc-
Crum's wife had left him and McCrum
sued her father, Frederick Schmidt,
for $15,000, accusing him of alienating
her affections.

The Emerald Gaelic- football team
had an easy time with the Thistle-
Independent team of the California
Association yesterday at the Presidio

the Gaelic rules, thus giving the for
mer men the advantage. The final
score was 9 to 3. The Emeralds
scored 1 goal and 6 points. The as
sociation men rolled up but 3 points.
Barrett, at goal for the Emeralds,
played a great game and prevented
his opponents from scoring many a
point. Ryan and Shaughnessy, at for
wards, also performed in good form.
For the association men, Taylor, the
captain and forward, was the star.
The teams were made up of the fol
lowing players:

NEW YORK, Oct. 9. â Tom Wil
liams, after his ride in the match race
with Sydney Paget, at Morris Park
yesterday, was the victim of much
good-natured chaffing. Mr." Williams
was not only nearly dismounted, when
his horse shied at the start, but, after
he came loping in fifteen lengths be
hind Paget, Williams was completely
tired out and wind-broken. The Cali
fornian has a theory that race horses
are set too arduous a task in their
early days; that if they were not
trained until well into maturity the
species - would ultimately be largely
benefited.
Paget, who is also a practical horse
man, holds opposite views. In the
management .of horses under his care
Mr. /Paget has not hesitated to put
such of them as were suited to it in
active training early in their two
year-old form. Men naturally bet on
their opinions, and the match at Mor
ris Park was the result. Williams^was
unlucky in having chosen a horse
which- was ''trackwise." . This, ' to
gether with his lack of practice,
helped to contribute to his defeat. .
His Mount Shies at the Start and
Calif ornian Racing Magnate Is
â¢ Nearly Dismounted.

RENOWNED BOSTON PITCHER
WHO HAS STARRED FOR MORE
THAN TWENTY YEARS.
A regatta for power-boats was set
down to take place yesterday on the
schedule of* the San Francisco Yacht
Club. The launches and motor-boats,
however, differ so greatly in dimen
sions and speed that the regatta com
mittee found it almost an impossible
task- to get up a satisfactory race, and
the event was declared off. Even if
this had- not been done, the water off
Sausalito was so rough yesterday
morning that the race would have
been called off for that reason. A
strong southwesterly wind created
quite a commotion among the yachts
lying at anchor.
Hillzer Deuprey's little sloop Mary
Anne broke from her moorings and
was carried into the corner made by
the southerly side of the clubrlouse
and the seawall. A line was made
fast to her and she was pulled toward
the southerly float, but she filled and
sank.
The schooner Martha left her moor
ings at Sausalito at 4 o'clock on
Friday afternoon for Vallejo, and
returned about .11 a. m. yester
day, under jib and mainsail. The
schooners Chispa and Challenge
left Sausalito on Saturday afternoon
for a cruise in the upper bay. Chispa
picked up her moorings at about 2
p. m. and Challenge at about 4:15
p. m. yesterday afternoon.
About 2 p. m. yesterday the wind
moderated, and the sloop Ariel hoist
ed sail for a cruise in the upper bay.'
The flagship Challenger and the sloop
Curlew also got under way, sailing
out to the. channel. They returned in
good season. .
H. R. SImpkins' yawl Tramontana
has gone out of "commission.
The keel sloop Emilie, formerly
owned by Frank Baker of the Corin-*
thian Yacht Club, and. sailed during
the past two seasons by Frank A.
Bartlett, has been bought by Morrison
F. Plxley, whose name has been pro
posed for membership in the Tiburon
Club.

The issue will be settled with the
first game if Boston wins. If Boston'
loses the second game will decide. - It
is easy to predict there will be some
thing approaching excitement in that
second game "if New York manages to
capture the first. Never before has a
pennant been the subject of contention
right up to the last game- The Na
tional League closed its season yester
day.
Two of the greatest pitchers that
ever trod the green diamond will match
their cunning, speed and cleverness
when time is called for the first game.
These men are Cy Young, the dean of
American slab artists, and Jack Ches
bro, the former pride of Pittsburg and
the sensation of Gotham this year.
. Young blanked the Highlanders yes
terday on the Boston grounds, the
Champions winning the game by' the
hair raising score of l.to 0. The Bos
ton fans think he can do it again to
morrow, but he will be in a foreign
box and facing a howling mob of fans
who would stop at nothing in order to
see the Highlanders wtn that game.
If Young gets away with j this strug
gle he will be the most talked about
man in America for a few days at least.
Young is unquestionably the most
wonderful pitcher the game has ever
produced. For more than twenty years
this giant has starred In the fastest
kind of company and to-day he is as
effective as he was when he started out
a young man full of hope and ambl-^
tion. Ten years ago he was known as
a veteran, but since that time he has
triumphed in many a great diamond
battle and has succeeded in gaining
fame and fortune.
Chesbro Is also a remarkable pitcher.
He did much to win the pennant for
Pittsburg in 1901 and 1902. His per-'
formances gained him a place on the
New York American League team in'
1903. That year was a bad one for
him, but at the beginning of the pres
ent season he succeeded in getting into
form once again and at the present
time he heads the list of slabsters in
the American League.
If New York wins the first game the
knowing ones concede them the flag,
for then they will be inspired with a
vast amount of confidence and playing
on their own battle grounds, they will
fight as they never fought before. If
Boston wins the initial struggle the
pennant is theirs and the dream of
Clark Griffith will be shattered. There
fore the first contest is the important
one of the day and the most important
in the history of the great national
fame. _

NEW YORK, Oct. 9.â Clark Griffith's
Highlanders must win both baseball
games from Boston in the double-head
er at American League Park to-mor
row in order to land the American
League pennant. Griffith and his men
were hopeful to-night of beating Bos
ton twice, but the most faithful fans
were dubious in view of the great ball
the Beaneaters are playing at the close
of the season. It is the Highlanders'
last chance to-morrow afternoon and
a great crowd will go out to watch the
final round in the most sensational
baseball race in history.

August Pape, in the competition shoot
of the San Francisco Schuetzen Verein.
ran up the high score of 223 and 230
in his two ten-shot strings, leading his
comrades by a long margin.
P. V. Kington, the well known pistol
expert, showed he was still in srood
form. "With the revolver in the Golden
Gate Club competition he put " uo the
fine scores of .92. 90 and 90. He was
closely followed by P. A. Becker with
91 to his credit.
George H. Tammeyer did himself
proud in the contest of the Germania
Schuetzen Club. He made 231 rings
in his first ten shots. The record for
his twenty shots totaled 444 rings, a
creditable score for any young marks
man.
The attendance at the Shell Mound
rifle range yesterday was "much larger
than marksmen anticipated. The hard
rains seemed to have no effect on the
riflemen. The principal event of the
day was the fifth annual king shooting
of the Hannoveraner Verein. The con
test was held at the eagle target, and
as piece after piece of the wooden bird
was shot, away the excitement among
the members became intense. Every
time a well directed shot brought a
wing, claw or other part down the
lucky marksman was greeted with the
cheers of his comrades, as every piece
carried with it a coveted prize. When
Fred Helms shot away the left foot the
bird was completely dismembered and
everything was made ready to see to
whom the lucky king shot would fall.
It was finally determined when that
well known shot, John Heitman. after
a careful aim, pressed the trigger and
brought down the last remnant of the
eagle. The shouts of his â¢ comrades
at once proclaimed him king of the
Hannoverans, and he .was led to. the
pavilian and crowned with the insiernia
of his office. : - i

HORSEMEN LOOK FORWARD
TO A SENSATIONAL MATCH
Efforts Are Being # Made to Bring
Sysonby, Oiseau 'and Tradition
Together in a Sweepstakes.
"NEW/YORK Oct. 9.â It is ar
dently desired by all turfmen that the
much talked of special race between
Sysonby, Oiseau and Tradition may be
arranged and run off on Saturday next
at Morris Park. It is proposed that
It be a three-cornered sweepstakes for
$1000 each, the association to add
$5000, the distance to be seven fur
longs and weights to be equal, except,
of course, that Tradition will receive
three pounds sex allowance. Definite
announcement is expected to-morrow
that the foregoing details have been
agreed to by the respective owners.
All signs point to the fastest trot
ting race on record when the cud con*
test is decided on the 18th Inst. at
Memphis.- Lou Dillon defeated Major
Delmar in 2:04^4 last year, but the
gelding was Jaded and in no such con
dition as at the present. That she
can beat him again if she is right is
generally believed, but it is also be
lieved that she will have to trot two
neats in 2:03 or better to do it. As
Lou Dillon was timed a mile and re
peat in 2:02 and 2:03 in her work at
Cleveland Just before being shipped to
Memphis, she would seem to be in
great form to go one mile or two. Mr.
Billlnjrs is confident* she can trot a
mile in 2:00 without a wind shield.

Dr. Kucich started the jaws working
with a touch of his fingers. "If I catch

threat ended in a slutter, for the jaw
was out again.
Â« The surgeon once more put the jaws
into working order. "I'll keep quiet
now," said Whitney. "But if I ever
catch that â ugh." The jaw was out
again.
Dr. Kucich patiently pulled the loos
ened maxillary into place. "Thank you,
doctor." said Whitney. "If I catch
that â " The jaw was again dislocated.
This time the surgeon held the maxilla
ries in place while the steward bound
them tightly. As Whitney was taken
from the place by some friends his eter

bandages. He may have to nurse his
wrath for several weeks.

McKINLAY'S MAJORITY.
The Republican newspaper men of
the district are confident of Mr. Mc-
Kinlay's election by a large majority,
but do not intend to diminish work in
his behalf on account of the assurances
of victory. Vigorous efforts will be put
forward to bring every registered voter
to the polls. It was clearly demon
strated that Bell, the Democratic nom
inee, has been forced to abandon the
platform of his party and omit all ref
erence to Alton B. Parker, the Demo
cratic candidate for President. There
was a general tally of reports that Bell
was explaining and floundering. Under
cover he is appealing to the Native
Sons, the Eagles and the Red Men for
political assistance. His campaign tac
tics in this respect will be fully dis
closed by the Republican press. There
is a strong element of Republican citi
zenship in these organizations, and the
scheme of Bell and his managers to put
a Democratic tag on the fraternal or
ders will not succeed.
Though Bell does not openly deny
that he is the nominee of the Demo
cratic organization, he refuses to go be*
fore the people and proclaim his alle
giance to the principles of that party.
Old-line Democrats of the district are
not giving him the support that they
would give to a Democrat who pos
sessed the courage to stand by his
party in adversity.

BATTLE TO WIN
CONGRESSMEN
Officials of the quartermaster's depart
ment and. the army transport service
having finally acknowledged that three
quiet investigations have been conduct
ed for the benefit of the service, there
is but one thing left for the War De
partment to do to assure the public
that these Investigations were made in
good faithâ to give the Grover charges
in full to the people, togelher with the
decision of the boards of inquiry.
If these investigations took placeâ as
it is now admitted officially they didâ
why not answer these questions:
Why were transfers made and why
were quartermaster's officials In a
quandary as to what to do when they
had become possessed of evidence in
the matter of the transportation irreg
ularities?
If clerks in the present employ of the
Government j have been guilty of per
mitting questionable accounts to pass
to the treasury, why are they not dis
charged, instead of being "transferred"?
Until these queries are answered it
will be difficult for the department to
convince the public that the affairs of
the Government have been, conducted
in an impartial manner. It will be an
easy thing for the local office of the
transport service, through Washington,
to set all at right by a clear official
statement, incorporating the Grover
charges 'and saying just what became
of them.
Grover charged that things are not as
they should have been in the service,
and that gross carelessness resulted in
great loss to the Government. The find
ings have been returned to Washing
ton and are said to be in the hands of
the quartermaster general, yet these
papers are not offered as evidence in
rebuttal of the criticism to which the
department 'has been subjected.-
The investigation of the army trans
port service that is now on or has been
ordered for a near date will seek to
eliminate abuses that are apt to result
in the handling of a vast governmental
institution. The thing to be ascertained
is, "Who in the present employ of the
service have been, directly or indirect
ly, responsible for past abuses?" Grover
has claimed that these men are still in
the Government employ. Who they are
only . the board of Inquiry and the
Washington officials know. They are
men, it is said, who were employed un
der a prior transport administration.
At present a board of inspection Is
engaged in examining into hay con
tracts recently let, but those who are
acquainted with the depot quarter
master's service say that the board was
convened for the purpose of ascertain
ing whether the hay. was up to the
standard named In the contract.
Another Investigation Soon
to Begin Will Have Chance
ta Eliminate Abuses if
Secrecy Is Abandoned
An imposing ceremony took place at
the Church of St. John the Evangelist
last evening, when the handsome new
stations of the cross, which the rector,
the Rev. Father Peter D. Brady, pur
chased during his recent trip in Europe
for $600. were blessed. The stations
are vÂ«Â»rv beautifully executed, the fig
ures, which stand out prominently, be
ing raised in bisque. They are the
work of Signor Simi. a well-known art
ist in Rome. His coloring is especially
fine, nothing of a similar description
In the churches of the State showing
a more perfectly artistic and har
rnonious finish.
The ceremony of blessing the stations
was performed by the Rev. Father
Augustine McClory, O. F. M., assistant
pastor of St. Boniface Church, assisted
by the Rev. Father Brady and the Rev.
Father William Butler. Father Mc-
Clory in his sermon gave an explana
tion of the stations, their origin and
advantages. He also told the way to
make the stations of the cross.
The sermon was followed by the
benediction of the blessed sacrament,
the Te Deurn being intoned at the al
tar and the choir singing, "Holy God,
We Praise Thy Name."
St. John's has just been fitted with
new pews at a cost of $1600. They are
massive and commodious and are in
perfect harmony with the architecture
of the church.
-An eminent barrel organist' of my ac
quaintance has long been Insisting that
"The Burgomaster" is a better opera
than "The Prince of Pilsen." After yes
terday's performance at the Grand
Opera-house â as our sporting editor
puts itâ the money is his. The success
of "The Burgomaster" is ancient his
tory in the chronicles of musical com
'edy. In the dark ages of five years
ago it was achieved in Chicago, by the
way. Boston also approved it, while
New York passed it. by. But with this
opera Luders and Pixley gathered the
nest egg of the fame that is now theirs,
and to my mind have not since so well
deserved it. Most of the music has been
barrel-organed, planoled and warbled
into one's consciousness long ago. The
listener will find it, like "Hamlet," full
of quotations, and will be the readier to
enjoy the opera. But even if he has
miraculously escaped it so far, he will
not the less enjoy it.
Â¦ W. H. Cullen "presents" the opera.
Oscar L. Figman is the chief presenter.
The two wandered into town yesterday
unknown. To-day they are identified
with some of the funniest loot of the
season. They tell me at the theater
that "The Burgomaster" has been play
ing all through the country at the $1 50
houses. Well, we usually ask more here
in the shape of gowns and pictures for
that. Otherwise 'twould be cheap at the
price. The production rather reminds
of the Tivoli in its unfashionable days.
It is a little dusty, fusty-throated, too.
But it has the vim, the cozy all-in-the
family funâ the heart and joy of those
same old Tivoli shows.
Upon New Amsterdam, date 1660â
the audience is "urgently requested not
to worry about historical Inaccuracies,
anachronising, and lapses from logical
sequence and common sense" â the cur

days of New York's history, and our
Stuyvesants, De Peysters andVander
bilts are discovered making it. An

caught the house first, and the grip
never relaxed. Peter Stuyvesant, the
burgomaster, with the first dramatized
â¢wooden leg of my acquaintance, makes
his . first appearance. Mr. Flyman,
long, lank, and lithe, brings a dry vint
age of fun to the enactment. But Mr.
Figman is hardly a There
is In fact no one "touched with race"â
as Henley has itâ In the cast. The
sheer fun of the idea and the dialogue
carry "The Burgomaster."
In the next act Peter, after doing
the Rip Van Winkle stuntâ but for 200
years, and, with his friend Doodle von
Kull as sleeping partner â finds himself
in modern New York. The old Dutch
man has grown, a new leg during his
nap, by the way. Pugilists, soubrettes,
dowri-at-heel actors, the union, theoso
phists, all kinds of modern ,improve
ments, Stuyvesant is brought into con
tact with, and no fun is lost in the
process. Plot, properly speaking, there
is none r but the lively Incident lavishly
compensates.
Miss von Hatafeldt does a little sine
ing, and as a male Astorbilt wears the
trews with the art of a Melville Ellis.
Oscar B. Ragland, who 'carries the
voice of the company, is funny as the
pugilist, and R. J. Moye as the fore
man of the "Street Gang" looks as if
he had carried a pick from birth. As a
theosophist lady Miss Harriet Sheldon
sees fun and makes it. and Louise
Bracket wears pink as well as Ruth,
the girl from Chicago. The singing
in chief is done by the chorus, the male
end of it mostly. And in the female
quota young and pretty-pretty, one
finds token of the pocket chorus Rirl
now in fashion In the East. Mr. Fig

A Japanese play by a Japanese wom

They have it at the Majestic this week,
with Onoto Watanna's "A Japanese
Nightingale," produced here for the first
time last night. The piece was drama
tized by William Young from the lady]s
novel of the name. Comedy-melodrama,
perhaps comes nearest its genre.
How far the play deviates from the
novel I do not know. As It stands, the

After an absence of five years from
the city of his birth the Rev. Edward
T. Mallon celebrated his first mass fol
lowing' his ordination as a priest in the
church of the parish where he spent his
boyhood. Father Mallon was assisted
yesterday in the celebration of the sol
emn mass by Father Cary, Father
Welsh and Father Stark in Old St.
Mary's Church, situated at the corner
of Dupont and California streets.
Father Mallon began his preparatory
studies at St. Mary's College of the
Christian Brothers, Oakland. Five
years ago he left San Francisco for
Washington, D. C, where he entered
the Paulist House of Studies. Following
a long and arduous theological course in
Washington, Father Mallon was or
dained September 21 by Bishop Cusack,
the auxiliary Bishop of New York.
After an absence of five years Father
Mallon's one desire was to celebrate
his first mass in the city of his birth,
in the church that he loved so well and
surrounded by relatives and friends.
His stay will be short, for he will leave
during the week for Chicago, where he
will be assigned to the Paulist House.
Father Mallon has two brothers who
are also in the priesthood â Valesian of
St. Mary's College, community of
Christian Brothers, and Gregory, of the
Sacred Heart College in this city.
