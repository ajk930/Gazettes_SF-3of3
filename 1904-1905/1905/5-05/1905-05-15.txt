"Yes, I left with Leona Brooks.

that I got the <:heck for $15,000. I never

**I won't say anything," declared
Smith. "1 want to see my attorney.

And Smith, who disgraced. his na
tive city, broke his wife's heart" and
betrayed all his friends, feels more
hurt from injured vanity than" from
a realization of his guilt. He , wants
to he regarded as a financier, not : as
an ordinary crook, as the world re
gards him.
EXRAGED AT ANDREWS.
When the train stopped at takers
field Smith was given an opportunity
to escape If he had cared to make the
attempt- Detective Wren and Detective
Cowarden, the last named of the Pin
kertons, left the train to get lunch.
Smith was left alone" in the car. The
â¢window was open and no one- was
\u25a0watching. The criminal must -have
meditated making a dash for it. \ He
put his hands on the window ledge and
looked out on the open country. Some
women happened to pass and Smith
ducked into a corner of r his room.
Had the man the desire or the cour
age to end his life he had plenty of op
portunity then. But he cowered back
into his berth, and when the detectives
came back he querrelously complained
because his meal was not brought to
him sooner.
Gaunt and haggard, a pitiful wreck
of what he used to be, Edward Smith,
the defaulting Tax Collector, arrived
in this city early this morning. During
the Journey from Needles he refused
to leave the drawing-room section of
the Pullman.
Soon aY spectacled "and - bewhiskered
man rushed up and greeted'the,'prison
er, with whom he conversed { for a r few.
minutes.'; Smith told the detectives that
the visitor was. his: lawyer.^ but the lat
ter declined .to I either/ affirm - or? deny
this statement or to give his name:'"- ;^
At the foot ; of i Market % street T there
was no one ; to <\u25a0 mcct \ either? detective*

After a: hurried walk to the boat he
was seated downstairs and .'surrounded

He . was * the * last passengeri to alight
from the last car of the long. train, -and
he came forth , like hunted/,- quarry
scourged from its lair.' When he pulled
up the high collar of his long overcoat
and sought with trembling -hands: to
cover his haggard features from \\ the
view of a hundred strangers he was the
picture of despair.
Biff ! Bang! Bang! went : the 'flash

the face caught by the lenses was one

he shrank from publicity at every step

tory Information concerning Vice Ad
miral Rojestvensky's use of Indo-China
waters has reached the Japanese Gov
ernment froih a variety of sources,
both official and private, i A nigh Japa
nese official , to-day sketched the im
portant acts of the Russian fleet since
France* was first moved to preserve
neutrality. He said:
"The Governqr General of Indo-China
officially reported that the Russian fleet
had entirely departed from Kamranh
Bay on April 22, but on April 23 there
still remained in the bay one cruiser,
one torpedo-boat destroyer and fifteen
transports of the Russian- fleet On
April 24 the entire Russian, fleet re
entered Kamranh Bay and rode at an
chor until April 26, when a majority of
the warships sailed, leaving, behind
four converted . cruisers and one tor
pedo-boat destroyer. These latter ves
sels took supplies I of coal .and provi
sions. On the evening of the 26th these
vessels stopped and examined the Ger
man steamship Loo Sok and the Nor
wegian steamship Providence, which
passed outside of the bay. \u25a0 . \u25a0â¢. \u25a0
"On April 27 more than thirty Rus
sian vessels were anchored at Honkohe,
and at 5 o'clock in the afternoon they
stopped and examined the British
steamship Stettin, which was passing.
"According to the French official . re
port Vice Admiral Rojestvensky prom
ised Admiral de Jonquieres that he
would leave Honkohe on May 3.- It is
evident, however, that .the Russians
were anchored at Honkohe on May 8. \u25a0\u25a0.
"The . latest telegrams j from [ .Indo-
China indicate the presence at Honkohe
on -May 12 of seven Russian .'"battle
ships, seven 'cniisers,*.two torpedo-boat
destroyers and four converted- cruisers.
: "Since the appearance of the Russian
fleet -in- the-iF.arrEesferjSaigon, has... be
come a base for the. transportation of
military supplies for. Vice Admiral Ro
jestvensky's fleet. The number of ves
sels furnishing euppHea -to-" the-
sians is so .great that those, which were
anchored at Saigon on May 5 were
countable by tens." â¢ ji.*^.*.

Spedal Dispatch to The Call.
This was evidently a great* dlsap
onintment to Edward J. Smith. We.de-
None of Smith's, brothers, were 'at
Point Richmond: or at the '.Santa Fe
depot on . this side of ; the bay to greet
him. The brother who is alleged' to
have advanced $165,000 to save the de
faulting Tax Collector on a former oc
casion did not make his appearance.
The gangplank rattled down and the
man who was once a respected official
sf San Francisco,, with bowed head and
6haking limbs, was swept across with
the crowd.
Smith turned away from the crowd
that gathered around him on the boat
and. walked to the outer deck. As the
Eteamer drew near the city he began
to tremble and bowed his bead. Shame
or fear overcame him as he saw the
lights along the water front and rea
lized that he must soon face all those
whom he had wronged. .
"I refuse to answer any questions,"
he declared. "If anybody follows me
I will walk around town all night. I
â¢tvill not tell my name or what my busi
ness is with Smith."
Fut when the stranger was question
ed he refused to reveal his Identity.
"I have nothing to say now. You will
hear from me later on."
"Are you Smith's attorney?" was
asked.
When Smith boarded the boat the
Btranger darted away from him and
tried to lose himself in the crowd.
"That is my lawyer," asserted Smith.
"Go talk to him."
But Smith's blue lips closed tlrbtly
when the Inquiry was centered about
the $165,000. "It was put uo byc-my
brother," he declared, and that was
all that could be got out of him.
when Smith stepped off the Santa Fe
train at Point Richmond he waa met
by a mysterious stranger, who claimed
to be an attorney. The fellow walked
with Smith to the boatÂ»and engaged
him in a short whispered conversa
tion.
The story of the alleged- shortage of
$165,000 was the signal, for Smith. to
cease all conversation. JtÂ»waa ;tbe
point that Foreman Andrews dwelt
upon most persistently.' The foreman
of the Grand Jury is certain that be
hind it la a big conspiracy.
The defaulter has had but little
eleep since he left St. Louis. Through
the nights he tossed about in his berth.
Bometlmes moaning, sometimes mut
tering and frequently cursine. â¢
Wren appeared to be rather chagrin
ed when Foreman Andrews boarded
the train at Needles. He objected
strenuously to the foreman of "the
Grand Jury seeing the prisoner at'-'all,
but when Andrews presented an order
from Chief Dinan, Wren yielded and
Smith was taken from the train. \u25a0 .;Â»
From the time he left St. Louis,
Bmith refused to talk about his-'4e
falcatloaa with either Detective "Wren
or Detective Co"warden. "I'll OTme
along all right, but Tin not going to
talk," Â«he declared. ..-,. Â«>\u25a0:
Prom the way that the defaulter
was treated it would be hard to real
ize that he was a malefactor being
brought back to Justice. He might
have been a tourist in the minds of
those who saw him but for his hag
gard face and his shifting eyes that
could not meet any glance.
His clothing hung about him loose
ly. He has lost over fifty pounds since
his arrest. His face, however, still
retains the swollen fullness of the T^aâ¢
who has dissipated. yn* eyeballs are
bloodshot and there are big pouches
under the eyes.
TREATED LIKE A TOURIST.
Wren obligingly granted the request
of the criminal. 'At Bakersfield his
lunch was brought to' him in his pri
vate compartment and he supped in
state at Merced. The remarkable con
sideration shown the prisoner was
commented upon extensively. \u0084
After the interview with Andrews
and Ralph Smith of the National
Surety Company. Smith asked ; Wren
to keen him where he could- not be
seen. "I vrant to be where ng one can
gape at me," he said. v"Dbh't ! let
camera men get at me, for God's
sake."
Had it not been for this violent dem
onstration, the other people in the Pull
man would not have known that the
defaulting Tax Collector was on the
same car with them. â¢ .
"You be ," shouted Smith, and
in his puerile rage he stamped upon
the pai>ers, then tore them to pieces
and flung them out of the window. The
paroxysm lasted so long that the two
detectives thought for a while that the
mun's reason had forsaken him.
"Oh, well, there axe lots who have
been worse treated than . you," ob
served Wren Boothingly. "Take it
easy."
When Smith received the papers from
San Francisco at Fresno he new Into a
hysterical re^e and his curses could be
heard all through the Pullman.
"They've treated me like ," he
shouted.
"Why didn't you leave the country?
Didn't, you know that you would be
caught in" time?" -
"I only had $700 with me. How
could I go any place with that?"
"Why did you take Lieona Brooks
with you?"
"I â well, that's nobody's business."
STA3IPS OX PAPERS.
"What right has he got to hold me
up this way?" Smith snarled. "I don't
\u25a0want to talk to anyone till I see my
attorney and my brothers." .
When Andrews left Los Angeles he
turned toward Smith and said, "Good
bye." The defaulter turned on his
heel and swore beneath his breath.
Wnlle ttoe detectives were at lunch
s. Call reporter interviewed Smith
through the window.
"I'll tell my story to the police," he
declared. "I won't talk now. JThe
papers have been making me out a
cigarette fiend and giving me a rotten
deal all around." .
"He is an awful liar,*' declared An
drews, when the interview was fin
ished. "He is a thorough crook."
All the way from Needles Smith
cursed Andrews. He had been permit
ted to do as he pleased and was not
bothered until the foreman of the
Grand Jury instilled into him the fact
that he was* a common criminal.
Smith was enraged when â¢ Foreman
Andrews had him taken from the train
at The Needles. His replies to An
drews were short and snappish. But
the energetic foreman put him through
a sterner sweating than a criminal has
received for some time.
Drews of the Grand Jury are certain
that the defaulter has stored away
some of the loot -until such a time as
the prison doors that will probably
soon close on him shall open.

FOR A VACATION
The sportsmen of the Livermore Val
ley are tb'forma protectlve'associatibn
to co-operate with the state game 'com
mission in protecting the game of this
section. . ' . ' . - - '
Deputy Game Warden W. R. Welch
made a quiet trip , to Livermore last
week, and taking, with him John Mc-
Glinchy, the local game warden, started
for "No Man's Land." They were care
ful about their . movements, and re
turned yesterday ' with W. P. Jones
and John W. Hampton.. .Jones is from
the San Antone Valley and Hampton
has a cabin .near the headwaters- of
the Arroyo Mdcho". \ " v :
OAKLAND. May 14.'â Deputy : State
Game Warden W. R. Welch has
returned from a raid of the moun
tain fastnesses south of Livermore
and, he. brought, back with . him
two men who .were caujnt with veni
son and' deer hides. The offenders were
W. P. Jones and John W. . Hampton,
They pleaded -guilty, before Justice.Tay
lor of Livermore and paid their. fines..
It is not often that 'minions of the
law penetrate this inhospitable moun
tain district that is sometimes called
"ISo Man's Land." The few-mountain
eers who inhabit the forbidding section
have long enjoyed immunity from the
came statutes .and not until Deputy
Welch, accompanied by John Mc-
Glinchy, the warden at Livermore,
made his unexpected visit was . there
ever the .sjigh test, respect shown for the
Jaws designed to protect game.
The district in question lies partly
in Alameda. Santa. Clara. Stanislaus
and San Joaquin Counties, where these
counties Join. The responsibility of au
thorities being thus divided and /the
country almost inaccessible from the
populous sections, scant attention \ is
paid to the section by the officers.
There are hardly more than a hundred
residents and they are allowed to do
about as they please so long as in
fractions of the law do not become'too
notorious and too great. The result has
been^ that these mountaineers and cat
tlemen have come to regard the coun
try as their own for any. purposV they
choose to use it. Most of the country is
barren and forbidding, and nearly all
Is J government land. Private titles, ; ex
cept for, mines, are almost unknown. \u25a0
Game has become plentiful in this
district. Driven out of the valleys by
the farmers the deer have retreated
into these wilds. and there are large
droves that are seldom hunted,, except
by a few sportsmen from the Llvermore
district who know of- their existence.
The mountaineers of this section are
not averse to taking parties into the
mountains occasionally and. guiding
them to some of these hunting grounds.
It has -been known for some â¢ tim,e
that a few of these mountaineer hunts
men have been absolutely disregarding
the game laws.

A^ similar attitude Is demanded to-day, r. The
church should say to Mr. -Rockefeller and other
men wbo represent the fame business methods
that ; it - cannot approve of Â« their principles."; If
they wish . to give,' lt must be- with . the distinct
understanding \u25a0> that i. the ! church i does - not â¢ en
dorse ' their ' business j transactions,; that ; it re
gards these methods as hostlle'to the gospel of
Christ and as doing In < the world exactly what
the -' ; church ;was <=\u25a0â¢ established ''to . oppose.-;.'- It
should be unmistakably clear, that In- Itt efforts
to * Christianise,' the -: heathen the : church --- doe*
not 2 endorse methods j that's are heathenizing

wise and Insistent efforts to lecure money from
these men. Our trust magnates are warranted
in m inferring : that ; the n church â¢ approves : their
methods when it is so ready to share their. UN
gotten gains. ;\The Baptist denomination has s,
peculiar responsibility In â¢\u25a0 this i matter. '-\u25a0 A .con

In the application of this. principle the honor
of the church 'may be: protected in two wayi.
Firafr by care -in soliciting I and receiving rifts.
The 'representatives of the American Board did
wrong ia. planning! a three , years', compelgn.to
secure a' larsre I contribution: from ,one \u25a0 who in
the â¢ language >of .the Outlook : is . "an illustrious

that are /'justly , BUbject to general puWlc - con
demnation. 1 / : Between * fifty * and * seventy-five
years % ago a - similar \ controversy, was ' waged
over .th ereception of money "from slaveholders.
The : American Board finally, settled its attitude
totward that -question, by declaring in 1843 that
it would: not; examine into. the motives ; of \u25a0,giv

HdXOR OF ; CHURCH.
slt Is evident then/ on the one hand, that to
Investigate all gifts is an Impertinence . and > an
impossibility, and on the other hand, to re
celve.-; all gifts 'may- weaken [ the" testimony . of
the church to righteousness/: '.Can any reconcll
irig- principle be found? I think so,.and sug
gest, the* folio wing .as ; a principle -worthy of
general, adoption:, ."Money ought not to* be In
thY Lord's \u25a0 treasury, when . Its prtsence there
weakens â¢ the . testimony \u25a0. of . the' : church " to thÂ«
great ethical principles that it is established to
represent.". , For instance, . It does not weaken
the; position oÂ£ the church if a gambler drops

are not as good this year as they have- been in
the past, but notwithst&ndinr this fact there
is not a. piece of property within the limit* of
the town of Livermore that is at present for
*a.le. The cause of thU activity In the demand

plans of the Western Pacific . Railroad have
been rcade public people arÂ« anxious to secure
land In th!Â« town, which will be directly on
the line of the new system.

to tell than that of Captain H.. C.
Cross, commander of the 'American

blockade at Vladivostok. . -The H.- M.
Dollar is still in the hands of the" Jap
anese awaiting the decision ..of the
High Prize Court, which Is holding
sessions in Tokio. *\u25a0 Captain Cross tells
with many thrilling details of his pur
suit b>' the Japanese and their ulti
mate capture of his vessel and with a
frankness that plainly suggests that
the .courageous Yankee mariner, bears
no malice toward the little brown men
for taking away his: vessel, and he
freely predicts that the Japanese "court
will condemn the vessel and also,forty
five others that have been captured
since the war. commenced. Discussing

Embassador Conger said that his
transfer to Mexico afforded him con
siderab.'e comfort in that it would
mean a change of surroundings, give
himself and family an opportunity to
visit their old home in this country oc
casionally, and further it brought to
him an advance in rank, a welcome
condition to all Americans serving in
the diplomatic service of their country.
CorK-!u3msr. Embassador Conger re
marked that he looked for great
char.pcs in China, but not for several
years to come, for the Government
seemed to be patiently awaiting the
determination of the war between Rus
sia and Jnpan. The Chinese are put
ting everything: off until that event, *
fact they do not readily admit, but one
ihs>t Is perfectly apparent to all for
eigners who are acquainted with the
situation in the emnlre.
The Pacific Mail steamship Siberia,
which arrived in port from the Orient
yesterday, brought among her cabin
passengers a number of notables, most
prominent of whom was E. H. Conger,
for the past seven years American
Minister to China, who has been ele
vated to the position of American Em
bassador to Mexico. The diplomat is
accompanied by Mrs. Conger and Miss
Campbell and erpects to leave for the
southern republic in a few days. His
successor at Peking, Minister W. W.
Rockhill, who recently passed through
San Francisco, arrived in the Orient
the day after Exnbassador Conger left.

his new post in Mexico, Mr. Conger

move toward advancing- her military strength
or advance in any other particular step. Of
course, the s.tuation is somewhat critical in
view of Chiaa"s peculiar position, she prac

but as jet no serious difficulties have ariren
from ihis fact. One thin* I will say and
that is that China believes, and properly- so,
iftat. ounnc the lart four years the United

. Thomas Monson;. of 521 Thirtieth
street stationed himself on a rock at
Bakers Beach yesterday afternoon and
became so busily engaged in pulling in
big rock cod. /sea bass and other deni
zens -of the 'deep that he' forgot all
about the treacherous tide that was fast
coping im Shortly after 6 o'clock he
realized his'perilous' position, and after
calling for aid for more than two hours
was finally rescued -by the crew of the
Fort, Point life-saving station.
It was when Monson had filled his
bag and got ready to start home that
he discovered that he was entirely sur
rounded by water and the beach was
hundreds of feet away. ' The water was
still rising and the treacherous break
ers dashed wickedly. against the rock
on which he was perched.

Monson flashed distress signals, shout

everything within his power, to attrmst ;
the attention of some wanderer on the

and his cries were unheard by all" save
the sea gulls and the porpoises. â¢ â¢
For more ; than two hours Monson
continued .to' cry for aid and signal to
an imaginary passer-by. He knew that
the tide would soon : wash him off the
rock, and perhaps carry him out to j
sea. - The situation was beginning to
look desperate when the life-saving
crew spied the lone , fisherman on the
rock'andcame to his rescue in a boat.

I>t go or die. That's the alternative
of the shipwreck *Â»d man with thÂ« monry
bags. A groat many people have a like
alternative before them. BuMners men
como to a point where the doctor tells
thÂ«m that they must "let go or die."
Probably he advitwd a sea voyaan or
mountain air. There's an onstinate
cough that won't be shaken off. The
lnng? are weak and perhaps bleeding.
There is emaciation and other symptoms
of disease, which if unskilfully or improp-
erly treated terminate in consumption.
Thousands of men and women m a like
condition have found complete healing
by the use of Dr. Picrce's Golden Medi-
cal Discovery.
"It give* me pleasure to send yon this
testimonial. so that some other poor sufferer
may bo saved, as I was. by Dr. Plerce's
Golden Medical DisroxerT," writes Geo. A.
.Thompson, of Sheldon AyÂ©.,A vÂ©., Chatham. On t..
Canada. "I had a courb for years, expector-
ated a great deaL and was slowlr lalllnp.
Was lostr.jr flesh every day. Lost In wejjrbt
from I.V) pounds down to 12$. *Mx fleeh srot
soft and I had no strength. Did 'not say any-
thing to any one but made up sir mind that
ths end was, not far off. One day my wife
was reading In the* Common Sense Medical
Adrlser ' about Dr. Pierce** Golden Medical
DlsooTcry. and I saMLtAot sounds more like

header to-day, and but for the . poor
work of Charley Hall in the sixth innr
Ing Seattle would have taken both j
games. The Seals got a lot of hits off
Roach, but his support was so good
it was hard to 'get runs. Frisco made
five hits in the fourth Inning of the
first game, yet got only two runs. Joe
Corbett had a bad inning In the first
game when he hit a batter and walked
two more, forcing in &\u25a0 run. *:, ;i . .
Whalen pitched . a' beautiful game.
Seattle lost in the sixth inning when
ia couple of passes and bad throws by
Hall, followed by hits by Wilson and
Gochnauer, -gave -the visitors.' four
runs. Seattle came back strone' in'
their half, but they could not close up

The patrons of the coursing game
witnessed many a good race at Union
Coursing Park yesterday." Patched Up
and Quita captured the reserve and
class stakes', respectively. Patched Up
had all kinds of v eyeed and led every
thing, winning about "as he pleased.
Quita-. had Pocatelll, Tom King and
many other fast ones to go- against,
but managed to weather the storm and
bring home the money. ;
The hares were the best seen at the
park this season and were so lively that
many escaped. Pocatelli ruled a 3 to 1
favorite over Lord Brazen in the first
round of the class stake, but was led
by three lengths. Following are the"

Oakland seamed satisfied after that
1 :'.g rally had been pulled off. They
H tre not apparently overanxious to ac
cumulate any more runs. As long as
they managed to hold the Angels down
they were Rattened. This was one easy
task, for Schmidt had several things
besides his dove and his smile, and
although the Angels ripped off two
more hits than the Oaks they were
never near beine there with a run.
Hall wa* called to the bench after
the sixth and big Toren went out to
amuse the fanatics. He pitched some
baseball during those last two spasms,
and not a Commuter got even as far
as first. Hall was all right when hia
disastrous spell had been overcome, but
It was too disastrous while it was onâ
bo bad, In fact, that it abstracted all
the fight out of the southern warriors
for the rest of the game. The score:

RUNS AND HITS BT. IN7CIXGS.
The Angel ban<i of balltossers expe
rienced their worst day of the season
yesterday. The Commuters took them
over the route twice, and without turn-
Ing a. hair at that. The Angels were
shown up like a bunch Just out of the
bushes, and they took the big aerial
climb each time when the Oaks were
ready to hammer a few runs through.
Bcores: Morning gameâ Oakland 7, Los
Angeles 4.; afternoon game â Oakland
S. Los Angeles 0.
The second Deriod contains all the
news of the conflict. It was then Mr.
Hall was given the roust treatment,
and it was then his team mates as
sumed wise expressions, while the Com
muters were busy sending a delegation
of five safely through the inclosure
Heine Spies was ao jealously guarding.
Four Singles and a wide heave to the
first sack allowed the. Commuters to
clip a bunch of five in. The rumpus
was inaugurated by Streib with a safe
hit. Then the rest of the gang Just
went down the line and picked out the
goad ones. No one was overlooking
any bets. Jimmy Byrnes* two-sacker
against tfce left field fence helped some.
This was followed by Van Haltren's
bingle and a smash by Kruger to
third. Over Dillon's head Smith threw
the ball, and the mistake meant two
more runs.

SECOND RELAY.
The race was spoiled as a competi
tive event by the presence on the road
of a large number of powerful motor
cycles, the riders of which are charged
with having assisted various men iÂ«j
the race. One man who is credited
with having made. a. big gain for his
club is accused of having caught the
cqat of a man on a motor, and was
thus assisted ulong until he reached
the riders out in the lead.
No one club is singled out as an
offender, all of them being charged I
with having accepted this pacing some
time during the race. The Garden
City Wheelmen of San Jose filed a
protest with Chairman C. L. McEner
ney, charging the Bay City
men with having 'accepted the assist
ance of pacemakers at various stages
of the race. The protest will be heard
at the annual meeting of the associa
tion in San Jose next Saturday.
' Owing ' to the bad condition of. the
road at the end of the first relay
the distance was cut down to' nine
miles. The tenth mile was covered en
foot. The riders were started for the
second relay in the same relative posi
tion as their clubmates finished on the
previous relay. "
-The Garden City riders led at the end
of six out of the ten relays. When
Waibel was handed the packet at; the
start, of. the last relay he was nearly
two minutes ahead of the Bay City and
California Club men. Both these rid
ers beat him at the finish. His club
mates claiih,they were paced and were
thus comparatively fresh when the
final struggle commenced. . .-
The Bay City men were in first place
at the end of the first and third? relays.
They were fourth in the fourth relay;
third in the sixth: fifth in the seventh
and third in the eighth and ninth. "''
...The clubs .were striving .for. the Mor
rill trophy.'whlch had been won twice
by the Garden City wheelmen. .An
other victory would have made it. the
property of that club. â¢ \u0084 ' : ; ..
There were comparatively few racci
dents, although each mile was" rldderr
at an average speed of 2 minutes and
63 seconds.
The official table of the race as made
up by the hardworking referee, C. L.
McEnerney, follows:

NEW YORK. May U.â Although
Monday is generally considered one of
the off days, some interesting racing
is announced for. to-morrow at Belmont
Park; ivith the. Claremont Handicap as
the feature. There is not a dull race
on'the card and class runs high from
start, to finish. The track wlllfprobably
be a. ".bit heavy, but this stiould not mar
the sport, for nearly air the horses en
tered-:have at one time "or another
proved they can â¢ handle themselvs on
the track when the mud flies.
A peep again at Tanya will be one
of the features of the card. Opposed to
her in the opening event will be Stal
wart, the hero \u25a0of many hard-fought
battles. last year, and one of the best
3-year-olds. He gave the impression
that a route was more to his liking
than sprinting, so he is probably grad
ually working up- to longer distances.
Dreamer^ran several high-class races
last season," and the Hamburg gelding
should be heard from in the sprints in
the best of company. Handzarra has
aiready proved she is possessed of elec
tric speed, â¢ but . more than six fur
longs may take her measure, still she
figures to; be in at. the death. Big Ben
has a grand reputation and- if- he lives
up toMt here he will be flghtlng.it out
with Lady Amelia. Roseben and others.
Tfce McLaughlin \u25a0 pair. Pasadena and
Oxford, should go well. Mud .suits
both of them jand they have recently
sho\yn they are fit. Wotan ran a fine
race at Jamaica, but has not shown
much since. The entries:

Pala-was: a noted . slave trader and
warrior when the Americans first oc

with his followers to the Island of Pula
Sekar, near Borneo. One; of Pala's
leaders deserted and took refuge in the
British settlementV of Lahad. â¢ Palo,
discovering his whereabouts, landed
with a following* and demanded of the
British "magistrate that he turn^the de
serter over to him... The demand was
not, complied with, and Pala ordered
n. massacre. " Twenty-five ; persons,' in
cluding several British, were ; killed.
Pala escaped to the island of Jolo and
organized. the present uprising.
It is reported that the ;; Borneo au
thorities requested General .Wood to

Ingleside traps yesterday and quite a
number of the devotees of the sport
participated. The weather conditions
were excellent for good scores, which,
prevailed.
Klevesahl was the shining light ot
the day, as pigeons were as easy for
him to hit as the side of a barn, and in
consequence the twenty-four birds un
trapped to him failed to leave the
bounds. N'auman and G. B. McCon

and got their slices out of the differ

Casey, the business agent.^was taken
into an Inner office and | questioned.
The police say he confessed.' In this
confession he told how Gilhooley, Fee
ley and Looney had been engaged by
the union. The trio was known as the
"educational committee."
The confession related to how â¢ Gil
hooley, Feeley and Looney, were invited
to a meeting of the union and on that
occasion the plans were arranged. At
the conference, when no fund was
found available to draw on. it was de
cided to create one to be used by the
"educational committee,'* as the "slug
gers" were known. Then $150 was
voted to the three sluggers In their
efforts to "get" Carlstrom.
The three . men went to "work" and
the result was the slugging of their
victim.
The testimony promises to be sensa

the labor union involved are said to
have been laid bare in the confession.
The prisoners will not be Booked until
a thorough Investigation is made.
Carlstrom was killed because he re
fused to go on strike.

CHICAGO. May 14.â Unless compro
mises are offered by all the opposing
Interests in the fight now in progress
In Chicago between capital and labor
the teamsters' strike will spread many
fold daring the next forty-eight hours.
The refusal of the teamsters' Joint
council, representing 35.000 union driv
ers, to accede to the demands of the
Chicago Team Owners' Association to
handle merchandise for all business
houses having contracts with the mem
bers of the owners' organization with
out discriminating against the firms in
volved in the present strike has brought
the controversy to a point where a
speedy settlement will have to be
made to prevent an extension of the
trouble.
After receiving the announcement of
the teamsters' joint council refusing
to obey the ultimatum of the Team
Owners' Association, a meeting of the
latter organization was held, and it
was decided to give the teamsters un
til Tuesday to consider the proposi
tion.
Information which the Team Owners
say they received to-day, that the
teamsters' joint council was not a unit
last night in its determination to fight
the owners, was given by the owners
af the reason for the postponement of
the enforcement of the ultimatum un
ti: Tuesday.
That last night's decision of the
teamsters will be reconsidered was
evinced to-night when a call was sent
out for another meeting of the team
eters' joint council for to-morrow night.
A call was Issued -to-day also for a
meeting on Tuesday of the executive
committee of the International Broth
erhood of Teamsters'. This committee
is the controlling body of the teamsters'
organization, and it is this 'body that
orders or has the final word In the set
tlement of a strike of their members.
Another death was added to the list
of strike victims to-day. In a con
troversy arising out of the strike be
tween John Cahill and two compan
ions, with James Jennings, a negro, the
latter was shot In the head and killed^

galloped on the scene. Then cheers and
handclapping, mingled with shouts of
derision, broke out along the line for a
block. But there was no work for the
police.
The procession formed in the vicinity
ot the Pierce home, 904 South Central
avenue, at 8 o'clock in the morning.
Immediately following Â±he carriage
bearing the aged mother, sister and two
brothers of the deceased', came thirty
carriages occupied by union labor offi
cials. In the first was International
President C. P. Shea of the Teamsters'
Union, with Vice Presidents John Sher
idan and E. J. Mullen. Tne succeeding
carnages contained officials of the va
rious locals of the Teamsters' Union
and of other affiliated unions. At in
tervals along the line were the ban
rers of the different locals and four
American flags, each draped in black.
Kighi hundred men marched â¢ behind
the carriages at the start. All along
the way other detachments joined their
ranks until, when the station was
reached, the column extended ten
blocks.
A brass band marched at the head.
Eight strikers who worked with Pierce
were the active pallbearers. Eight
other striking teamsters acted as hon
orary pallbearers. ; ,-
Pierce was an employe of Rothschild
& Co. as driver on a delivery wagon.
He was shot by Special Deputy Sheriff
E. T. Waldorf. He is thÂ« only union
man who has lost his lifs Juring the
strike and is regarded by other men
as a martyr to the cause. % Pierce is
said to have assaulted a non-union
driver in the presence of Waldorf. Wal
dorf was exonerated by a Coroner's
Jury. y -
At the Cook County Democratic
headquarters, where the funeral pro
cession halted en route to the railway.
President Shea of the Teamsters' Un
ion addressed the mourners. All the
heads were bared while the address
from the balcony' of the second floor
of the Democratic headquarters was
delivered. President Shea said:
The members of the Teamsters' Union do not
compose the disorderly element In the present
strike disturbance!!. The teamsters are not
seeking to do violence in order to secure vic
tory for themselves, and they regret deeply
that violence has-been done, occasioning such
events as the death of our mourned brother.
It is our dutr as members of the Teamsters'
Brotherhood and as law abiding: citizens to re
frain from all acts of violence and to discour
age such acts, both on the part of the union
men aad their sympathizers, wherever occasion
arises. â¢.
We will win the present ftrlke, not through
violence or force, but because we are law abid
lns: citizens of. the United State* and of this
city. t>eeklnr to obtain what is rightly ourÂ» by
peaceful methods.
Deep silence prevailed during the
address of President Shea, but at its
conclusion he was wildly cheered and
urged repeatedly by. the crowd to tell
more of the plans and purposes of the
strikers, but he remained silent.

CHICAGO, May 14.â Marching with
draped banners and muffled drums
more than 2000 union men followed the
remains of George S. Pierce, a strike
victim, from his late home to the Union
station here to-day. The body was
taken over the Pennsylvania Railroad
to Louisville, Ky., for burial. No funer
al services were held here, but the es
corting of the body to the station was
made the occasion of a labor demon
stration in which not only the Team
eters' Union, but organized labor gen
erally, participated. The progress of
the cortege was without incident. The
rren marched solemnly, four abreast,
each bearing upon his coat lapel a
white button with the inscription in
black: "We mourn the loss of a mur
dered brother."
Even the spectacle of three coal
wagons manned by non-union negroes
rj*ar the Union Station elicited no more
than rnutterinKs as the column filed by.
The only break in the serious mien of
the men occurred when. a patrol wag
on, called in anticipation of trouble.
The men arrested were â¢ Charles J.
Casey, business agent; George - Miller,
president, and' Henry J. Newman, sec
retary of the Wagon Makers' Union,

were taken into the office of Inspector

"T^ESTIMOXY given recently before the Interstate Commerce
| Commission in Chicago, that the profits of the Arniour car lines
*\u25a0 on icings of the cars ran as high as 500 to Coo per cent, and that
rebates have been given to favored parties of 50 per cent and over,
reminds us of the big profits in a general way that are made by the
transportation companies out of the California fruit industry. There
is a newly published pamphlet giving the report and opinion of the
commission in some cases of the Southern California Frujt Ex
change and the Consolidated Forwarding Company versus the va
rious railroads which transport their fruit, and therein it is shown
that the citrus fruit traffic alone yielded the Southern Pacific over
one-twenty-sixth of its total freight revenue, and that the charge
lor this is about four times as much per ton as for airfreight. The
figures, were S2 53 for average freight and $10 for each ton of
citrus fruit.
From those figures it is seen that the -fruit industry is paving
an immense proportion of the revenue of the roads; but it is j/mall
when compared to the proportion which the Atchisoii, Topeka ami
Santa Fe proper makes the fruit pay. A. study of the revenues ot
that system for 1903 shows that the average for each ton of freight
was $270.2-3, but that the amount obtained from the transporta
tion of citrus fruit was $21 per ton. It is admitted that the cost of.
transporting the fruit is largely in excess of general freight, but this
difference is far exceeded in the charges. In the above-mentioned
report and opinion of the commission the subject of charges i (or re- â¢
frigeration is considered, but owing to the insufficiency of evidence
then given in the commission did not feel justified in' condemning
the refrigerating charges as unreasonable.
If the testimony given the other day by an ex-stenographer of
the Armour; Company, who knew the secret. cipher of the; company, ,
showing .the enormous profits of the car lines' and the uiiconscion- j
able extent of the favoritism in rebates, be accepted by the conunis- !
sion as reliable,, then the next published report and opinion of the
Interstate Commerce Commission â¢ will probably make a much
stronger statement of the unreasonably big profits with which rail
roads, car lines and favored acceptors of secret rebates are enrich

KING EDWARD, like most Euro
pean sovereigns, is out of the
reach of what Is known as com
\u25a0 jnon law; that is, the law which
is binding on every subject of the
crown.
Special laws control the action of
jthe sovereign, among others being: <mÂ«
which forbids him to take an action
in the civil courts against any of his
subjects. His Majesty, however, can
institute criminal proceedings against
any person, but if he does so his evi
dence h,as to .be taken on . commission ;
that is, it must be. read out in court
and sworn to as being true by some
official, for .under no- circumstances
'can the \u25a0 sovereign ever apear person
ally in any. court of law. Three years
ago King . Edward prosecuted a man
for forging : his name to a check
drawn on Coutts' Bank, when his
Majesty's evidence; was taken on com
mission. This is the solitary instance
of i King Edward f. having .^.proceeded
against a subject in a criminal court,
though as Prince of Wales he ap
peared as the plaintiff in two or three
civil actions, which he .was entitled
to do, being then a- subject 'of the
crown. Any ; subject can take' a civil
action in ';' England against the sover
eign by presenting to Parliament. what
is known as a "petition of right," in
which! must be fully stated the nature
of the petitioner's ciaim and the evi
dence he is prepared to support his
case w - ith. The petition is then re
ferred to the law lords in the House
of Lords, â¢ who decide whether the j ac
tion against the sovereign is to be
heard or. riot; but as a matter of fact,
no action against the sovereign has
been taken by a subject of the British
crown* for the past 100 years.
The Kaiser is not permitted to in
stitute personally any -proceedings'
against a subject either in a civil or
criminal court and no legal action can
be taken against his imperial Majesty,
except for debt, in which case the
plaintiff must sue . the* Comptroller of
the Imperial Household. Not: long
since a wine merchant sued the Kaiser,
through the Comptroller of the House
hold v for $15. ; The money was claimed
as interest due on an outstanding ac
count, and the merchant won his case;
but as the German law- decrees that
mo costs can be . given : against the
Kaiser .the merchant did not gain
much by, winning his action.
If the King; of Italy enters into any
litigation with a subject a special
court is summoned for the hearing of
the case. The King must appear per
sonally as -a witness, , but he posseses
! the' privilege, of declining to answer
any questions put' to him by counsel.
If ih<i King wins his action the sub
ject has the right to appeal, , but this
simply nieans that the case. will ;be re
tried before the same court, and most
probably will', result in a confirmation
of the original -.verdict.
The' present King 'of Italy has only
Qnee taken an action against a subject,
which was for breach' of contract ; in.
connection .'with some j painting' work
that a house decorator had undertaken
to do at the loyal palace, but which
he never completed, although he . had
been paid lor the wc-rk. The case,
however, was settied, out, of court by
the contractor rttunding the mopey. he
was sued for.
The Czar can be sued in the civil
courts .of Russia by any of his sub
jects, but this has not been done for
many years, tor the simple reason. that
the man who did : go, wnother he had
a good case or not, .would certainly
end his days in a Siberian prison/

MIRROR OF DAME FASHION

WHATEVER new feature to the financial and commercia
situation was exhibited last week- was in the New York
stock market, which dropped off materially in the volume of
(business; which accounts for the decrease in, the aggregate clearings
oi the country from over $3,000,000,000 to $2,622,500,000. There
was no pronounced tendency in stock quotations either up or- down,
some days being higher and others lower. Les,s public interest in
stocks -was manifest, however, and the market was reported pretty
well back into professional hand? again.
One active firm of brokers issued a statement saying that it
had spent two weeks looking over and checking up the condition of
large New York commission houses, and had found that the aver
age commission house has now only from 10 to 40 per cent of its
usual line of securities, which means that from 60 to 90 per cent of
customers have sold their securities, either at a profit or a Joss. It
concludes by saying that these relinquished securities are. now
owned by the wealthiest men in America and the large financial
institutions in New York. In other words, the public has agjjain
left the market. "?] , .
Be this as it may, the clearings themselves, though smaller than
for several weeks, still indicate general trade expansion throughout
ihe country, the increase over the corresponding week in 1904 being"
29.6 per cent, with every important trade center except Providence
and St. Joseph, Mo., showing a gain over last. year, ranging from
42 per cent at New York down. Philadelphia increased 35.9 per
cent, Pittsburg d/.i per cent, San Francisco u.i per cent, Minne
apolis 18.7 per cent, and so on. The gains at' -Boston and Chicago
were small, being 2.8 and 4 per cent respectively.. The feature of
1 lie clearings was still the general gain throughout the country.
Mad it not been for the stormy weather, which cut seriously into
the retail trade, the gains would probably have been much larger.
liven as it was, the showing was excellent.
Another feature worthy of attention was the flattering exhibit
made by the winter wheat crop. The Government report on the
condition of the crop showed it to be 92.5 per cent, against 76.5 on
the same date in 1904, and 85.7 as the mean average for the past
ten years. Tins is a brilliant showing for the winter wheat, though
since the report was made up there has been considerable deteriora
tion of I the crop in Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma and several other
States, owing to excessive rains, rust and the Hessian fly. ,But this
deterioration does not thus far seriously impair the condition of the
crop as a whole, especially as the seeding of the spring wheat has
been pretty well finished. The adverse weather, however, has re
tarded corn and cotton planting, which is about two weeks late.
Aside from tj^cse two features â the decreased trading in Wall
street and the crop conditions â there is nothing especially new in
the general trade situation. The president of the United States
Steel Corporation has gone to Europe and reports that his vast
company has never been in such good condition as at present, while
his views of the steel industry are decidedly optimistic. The differ
ent iron and steel mills continue to report an active business, while
the lumber and building trades have all the orders they can attend
to, according to^heir reports to the mercantile agencies. Money is
still abundant, with rates of interest low, showing continued ease in
funds, and collections are fully up to the average. The money cic
culation of the country increased $19,000,000 in April. Provisions
< : re firm, the situation in coffee being particularly strong, statisti
cally considered, but sugar has lately declined.
The export trade of the country still makes an excellent show!
ing. That of San Francisco is exceptionally good. The foreign
shipments from this port in Aprii were $5,7*58,694,. a falling-off of
about $1,000,000 from March, but $2,600,000 over April, 1904, and
$2,800,c00 over April, 1503. For the first four months of the year
the exports from this port amounted to $20,000,000, against $13,450,
000 during the same period in 1904. This exhibit ought to satisfy
almost anybody. . '
These facts about cover the current commercial situation and
show it to be sound and encouraging. The year 1905 has thus far
shown no unfavorable condilions, nor is it likely to, as far as pres
ent indications go. The usual summer lull is approaching, however,
but that always occurs with mere or less intensity and, being one
of the regular features of trade, need cause no apprehension' when it
appears. *\'it^ * ? :t'V '
ONE of the secrets of being happy
is learning how to forget. If
i you have found it exceedingly
difficult to form the cheer habit, ..no'
doubt the trouble lies in your- failure
j to forget.
I Do you know why it is that so often
| when you struggle to think optimism 1
1 you think pessimism, and when you
strive to maintain a, courageous, hope
iul attitude you fail? It is because
'\u25a0 your memory slate is filled* with im
j pressions you ought, to eraseâ imprest
of past thoughts. that are glum,
\u25a0 cheerless and discouraging to the last
'_ degree. --"'."/ f 1 â¢'.:/.
' You .are, writing your che.er thoughts
right on top of your blue thoughts,
with the result that the latter blur the
! impression of the former and hence
nullify their effect. â¢
j Every day adds new/ records, new
'â¢ impressions to your; memory slate. Do
you realize that you have the right to
, decide which, you shall permit to re
i main and which you shall forget? It
is entirely in the power of every hu
i man- being to select for his memory
! slate the impressions he' wishes* to pre
serve and to reject those he would not
remember.
Why should you remember any ex
cejjt the things that help and inspire
you â the things that -contribute to
your well-being?- "Why should you
ever cherish the disagreeable mem
ories?
It is my conviction that when we
permit the ugly impressions to remain
we err, and err grievously. It is aston
ishing how prone we are to sin in this
way. .
It is amazing how, we harbor in our
minds the hateful, unpleasant things
and exaggerate them.
The grewsome story, the unfortun
ate occurrence,, the unflattering re
mark some one passed about vs â these
memories are hard to banish. Our
minds cling to them, often as if fascin
ated. . /
With most of us the tendency is to
let the unhappy impressions sink
deeper than the happy ones. It seems
to be a weakness of human nature to
dwell upon its grievances.
But if we really intend to cultivate
the habit of. happy thinking we must
overcome allthis, and a sure way to
do it is to form the habit of definitely
erasing the. things we -ought not to re
member. .
Every night it is possible to go over,

Trained dogs are the most accom

spirit of the occasion, and seem to ap
preciate the fact that they take des
perate chances and that their 'lives are
at stake. They start off with precious
burdens, know by instinct where tha"
lookouts are posted, and, make a' wide
detour. But If they think (yes, dogs

The motor cycle racea this year are
proving an exceedingly interesting
event, as the adoption by every one of
the cycle makers of the double cylin
der system of motor for the first time
is thought by many to be a doubtful
experiment. \u25a0:'..
A. M. Schreyer, an American, will
guide onÂ«of the Barry's, which is an
entirely new production and causes
considerable speculation as to its use
fulness because of its , almost revolu
tionary change in construction. . The
fly wheel and cooling apparatus are
both eliminated." .Their functions are
performed by -a revolving double-con
densed cylinder which turns so rapid
ly that it is supposed to give all the
efficiency of a fly wheel, and in its con
sequent action all necessity for a cool
er is contended to be superfluous.. / The
weight of the whole structure -4s less
than forty, pounds," while the limit,
under the rules, ; is 110 pounds." The
motor cycle race is held under the
auspices of the Auto-Cycle Club, -which
is the body to which the Automobile'
Club of Great Britain arid Ireland. has
delegated the control of motor cycling
in the United Kingdom. . - -. j \u25a0
The first three winners of both races
will participate in the icontest for. the
Gordon Bennett cup and the interna
tional motor-cycle : races in France^' re
spectively. While the! eliminating, races
are strictly "confined; to English -ma
chines,all the .par t8 of xwhich must

There has been a change in the date
for this trial and unless the committee
finds furher reasons for another shift
the race will be run on Tuesday, May
30. The weighing in occurs the day
before, both for the Gordon-Bennett
eliminating trials for autos and the
motor cycle races which occur on
May 31.
MOTOR' CYCLE RACES. v
All the cars participating are prac
tically new creations except the Wolse
leys, which are the same as contested
last year. The most radical change in
the construction of this year's cars is
the decidedly lower gear. This is ap^
parent in all the cars, as the high gear
of last year proved to be too slow to
operate in making the numerous short
turns. The experience of last year has
taught the makers that only a com
paratively moderate speed will, be
maintained, of say about, fifty miles
an hour. This being the case, a lower
gear will enable the negotiation of the
sharp turns. This will prove of still
greater advantage on ' the French
course, which is much more irregular
than the Isle of Man rpute. ,
.- The committee - of , the^ Automobile
Club in charge of. the arrangements has
just decided. to change the route from
that of last year. The portion cut out
lies between Ballacraine and Kirk Mi
chael, passing through Glen Helen. The
change is made as the narrow roads
proved dangerous. The new route con
tinues the same as last year, starting
and finishing at Douglas, until Balla
craine is reached, 'when there is an
abrupt turn westward to Peel and
then along the sea coast to Kirk Mi
chael. The distance around the correct
ed route is 54Va miles, and the contest
calls lot three round trips, or 163&
miles. \\l%.i~* \u25a0;" ;.-/<
S. F. Edge will never drive another
car in a race. It is understood he feels
he can advance the interests of his

driving than if he participates himself,

secured all available advantages. : '\u25a0â¢

"Wolseleys, one of which will be driven
by C. Bianchi, who was formerly
Charles Jarrett's machinist, but the
driver of the other Wolseley has not
yet been nominated. -A. Lee Guinness
has entered a Darracq, made by Weir
in England, and unless he withdraws;
as rumored, will operate it himself.
Leopold de Rothschild has entered a
Slddley car, which will be 'driven' by*
Syden Girling. Sir Alfred Hickman,
M. P., places his reliance in a Star, to
be steered by F. R. Goodwin. 'Another
Star has been nominated by E. | Lisle,
but as his license has just, been re
voked by a police magistrate for two
years because of a recent serious acci
dent opinion is divided as to whether
his car will compete. The most famous
of the drivers of the ten cars entered
is A. Macdonald,' who last winter es
tablished the" world's mile record at Or

one of the Napiers. . %

Tes, good fun. these warm elections.
They make good substitutes for spring
tonics.
No â no call came foV the police, but
some pretty tall talking was done and
loud and frequent threats were made
to have the election declared illegal.
But nobody snatched the ballots or
otherwise made unlawful demon
strations, and when the votes were
counted the following was the tale
they told â much to the delight of the
friends of Mrs. Sidney Palmer Smith r ,
who received a second year in the
chair: \u25a0';. '
The Daughters of Pioneers held a
warm session on Monday last, when
their election was on.
On the succeeding Wednesday a de
lightful day is on the cards, when Mrs.
Clarence Wetmore and Mrs. Maude
Wellendorff will present Strauss'
"Enoch Arden."
On Wednesday Mrs. Wilbur Swett
will present the programme of the
Forum Club, which promises to be In
teresting.
On Wednesday the Laurel Hall Club
>Â»il! install its officers and will cele
brate the affair by breaking bread to
gether.
Luncheon will be served at the
Sorosis Club rooms at 12:30, and a
beautiful time is assured. These
Laurf 1 Ha'J women are not of the type
that are witty to order â their fun is
spontaneous. If you doubt it, drop in
there some luncheon day.
During the preliminaries of the fete
many committees were found to be
overlapping the duties and the rights
of. others. To be sure, the/c was a
sjtuttering end a magpie-chatter for a
moment or two. in the good old femi
nine way. But a conference would
follow, where the law of "One talker
at a time" prevailed, and la! the war
ring contingents were soon at peace,
ana weaving garlands together.
And thus do the results ot.all
worthy club e'ndenvor reach far beyond
mere material gainsâ they make for
:orgiÂ»tiulness-of-self. thus becoming a
panacea for "nerves "; they enlarge the
vision and contribute to the expansion
of characters.
This' is the true worth of clubs â
this fharacter-welding.
This is one of the schools in which
men were trained, and these the meth
ods whereby they learned the lessons â
imperfect though they be â of tolera
tion, self-control, and the great law of
\u25a0give and take."
In the nrst place, the women were
forced to subjugate their personalities
to the cause â they were forced to
lose themselves in their committees,
and thus act impersonally.
This is the hardest thing in life for
HOtnen to do, and the most necessary
for their development.
To be sure, some dear men helped,
and helped pluckily on Thursday, the
opening day; but at that time were the
details of every booth in good shape â
in all save one, where a wretch of a
contractor had dallied o'er-long with
the wine jug. Tempararily the wom
en were stalled, but a few minutes
nt the telephone put an end to la
menting, for soon were a half-dozen
men friends at work with hammers
and saws, and all went merry.
And when the public â that vague,
uncertain, unfathomable entity â ap
peared in the marble hails that night
'.â¢verything was in shipshape.
Now, the object of that three-night
cirtair and the three months' work be
fore it was primarily to raise funds
wherewith to furnish the new club
house on Clay street. *v .
It is the hope oi every busy mem
ber, and every friend of a busy mem
ber, thax. shekels in plenty will remain
with the treasurer, after the raids of
the people with bills.
That, of course, was the primal ob
ject of the whole great affair â as far
<*s the women saw it. But beyond this
motive, and infinitely more important
than the mere lurnishing of v club
house, was the experience that it gave
the women.
The scheme was proposed and out-
Mned by a woman â Mrs. E. P. Schell â
and the entire affair planned and ex
ecuted Ly women, and herein lies
much of honor.
The festival given by the California
Ciul> at the Palace will go down in the

*-as attacked by two men on Pacific
Btre'et, near Kearny, about 2 o'clock
yesterday morning. He was knocked
down and a silver watch and gold
chain taken from him.- He informed
Policeman Skain of his experience and
gave a description of, the two- men.
Brady was under the influence of
liquor.
Both ladies made a deep impression
on the congregation. Mrs. Roberts
i-poke strongly against placing young
girls in jails along side women who
are habitual criminals, one way or
another. She said that young girls
learn to smoke cigarettes in Jail and
confess after acquiring the habit that
they find comfort in it.
The Rev. William Kirk Guthrie, the
pastor, spoke of the increase of crime
in â¢ the land, and said that conditions
â¢were . such that in up-to-date cities
men could not walk out/at night. The
lawless youths when they become men
will terrorize the homes. He advo
cated that the delinquent boy be re
claimed by kindly care and love and
not by fear. .' .
