KUROPATKIN'S SHATTERED ARMY IN FULL RETREAT FROM MUKDEN TO TIE PASS
Russians Fighting a Way Through Japanese Hordes That Are Attempting to Surround Them
TOKIO, March 9. â Kuropatkin, badly beaten in the bloodiest battle of the war, began the retreat from Mukden yesterday
morning. The Japanese center armies are in pursuit, while the flanking armies are endeavoring to cut off the retreat. The Russians
are stubbornly fighting their way to the north. It is now a race between the Japanese and the Russians for Tie Pass,

MISS RICHMOND
MORE CONFUSED
Now Says McWhinney May
Not Have Uncorked Bottles.
Miss Elizabeth Richmond, formerly
Mrs. Stanford's maid, was in a talka
tive mood yesterday. To a Call re
porter at South Mateo ehe spoke freely
of the poisoning mystery and frankly
acknowledged that in the work of the
detectives to ferret out the murderer of*
murderers they must proceed on the
theory that she is not above suspicion.
Herself, Miss Berner and Ah Wing, the
Chinese factotum of the house, were
the only ones, so far as Is yet known,
who had access to Mrs. Stanford's
sleeping room, where the strychnine
was probably placed in the Poland wa
ter. The solution of the mysterious
poisoning in San Francisco on January
14 ought to be a solution of the mys
tery In Honolulu.
Miss Richmond insists, in behalf of
her own reputation, that the great
mystery shall be thoroughly worked
out. She demands that those in charge

of the investigations shall free her
from the suspicions now resting on
her. She does not hold them blame
worthy, she says, for entertaining the
suspicions, but she contends that the
detectives should be kept at work until
the cloud is raised from her.
The maid stoutly protests her inno
cence, but takes a remarkably reason
able view of the situation as to the
efforts of the police to find evidence
against her. She is aware that Cap
tain Burnett places her through a
"sweating" process almost daily, be
cause he is not convinced of her inno
cence On the termination of her visit
to hts office on Tuesday, he told her
to be ready to come before him again

J. C. Stubbs Resigns

Director.
Positive Statement to This
Effect Made at Omaha
Headquarters.
S. W. Eccles, Now of the American
Smelting Company, Selected lor
the Position.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Neb.,. March B.â lt was
stated positively this afternoon at the
Union Pacific headquarters in this city
that the resignation of J. C. Stubbs,
traffic director of all the Harrlman
lines, had been handed in. The resig
nation is believed to have resulted di
rectly from the discovery of the secret
traffic agreement between the Southern
Pacific and the Santa Fe, which was
signed by Stubbs on behalf of the
Southern Pacific and by Paul Morton,
now Secretary of the Navy, on behalf
of the Santa Fe. While it is under
stood that Stubbs' resignation was not
requested, it is said that the friction
between him and the Harriman inter
ests has been growing greater until he
had practically no alternative.
Stubbs has been receiving a salary of
$50,000 a year and is considered one of
the brightest traffic managers in the
country.
It is understood here that S. W.
Eccles, third vice president and traffic
manager of the American Smelting and
Refining Company, has been appointed
to succeed Stubbs. Eccles \Â» as for
merly traffic director of the Oregon
Short Line and is believed to stand
well with the Harriman interests.
TOPEKA, Kans., March B.â lt is un
derstood in railroad circles here that
the board of directors of the Rock
Island Railroad has decided upon Gen
eral Manager H. V. Mudge of the
Santa Fe, to be general manager of the
Rock Island, to fill the office which has
been vacant since the resignation of
H. I. Miller.

Improvement in Traffic
Conditions on New York
Eoads Affected bj Strike
NEW YORK, March B.â A very de
cided improvement in the conditions of
traffic on the subway and elevated
roads marked the second day of the
strike of the employes of the Inter
borough Company. This was especially
so on the subway, on which, by the
time the evening rush hours came, ex
press service had been established and
affairs had almost resumed their nor
mal aspect. On the elevated lines ser
vice was more irregular, but continued
to improve, especially on the Sixt'h
avenue line. There was practically no
disorder and only a few minor acci
dents occurred during the day.
Officials of the Interborough Com
pany expressed confidence that they
had the situation well in hand, and
that a few days would see a full re
sumption of service on all lines. To
night tHfe officials announced that they
had received assurance of the inten
tion of 50 per cent of the strikers to
resume work as individuals, and that
forty of the old motnrmen had already
been taken back. This was positively
denied by President Pepper of the
Amalgamated Association of Street
and Electric Railway employes.

INTO A RACE
FOR TIE PASS
Slav Army Will Be Crushed if
Its Retreat to the Northern
Stronghold Be Cut Off.
Losses Now Exceed 100,000 Men
MUKDEN, March 9. 1 1 a. m. â Mukden is still in the hands
of the Russians, but withdrawal from the line ol the Shakhe
River is in full progress. The Japanese are making a strong at
tack north of Mukden, where they occupy a rig-ht-anelecl position,
one side parallel with the railroad n ml three and a halt miles
distant, and the rear facing northward, three miles north of the
imperial tombs.
The Russians have retired somewhat from the positions they
occupied yesterday in the region ol Tatchekiao. but are making
a strong stand against the force here. The Russians also are
holding the village of Ushuntun. which at nightfall yesterday
partly in the hands of the Russians and partly in those of the
Japanese. At 2 o'clock this morning the Russians succeeded in
taking complete possession of the village, which is of great strat
egic importance tor the accomplishment of the withdrawal.
TOKIO, March 9, 6 a. m.â The great
battle in Manchuria raged all day yes
terday along the entire enormous front.
The Japanese were generally victorious
and they drove the Russians from a
series of important positions. By night
fall it seemed imperative that General
Kuropatkin would have to withdraw
his shattered legions to avoid a com
plete disaster, indeed, it appeared im
possible for him to effect a retreat
without heavy losses of prisoners, guns
and stores.
The continuous battle is already the
bloodiest of the war. On the ground
that General Oku alone gained lie 8000
Russian dead. The reports from the
other armies are expected to triple this j
figure, it is estimated that the Japa
nese have lost 50,000 men, making the
joint slaughter far exceed 100,000 men.
Details of the combat are lacking, but
It is believed that the Japanese have
cut the railway north of Aiukden, leav
ing only the roadways and a lignt rail- >
way trom Kushun to Tie Pass as aye- i
nuts for the retreat of the Russians; {
but army headquarters refrain from
affirming or denying a report to that
effect.
MUKDKN, March 9.â Telegraphic
communication with Harbin was de- j
stroyed by the Japanese early this
morning, but has since been restored.
The Russians on Tuesday captured
500 prisoners, who appeared to De al- j
most exhausted.
The losses on both sides have been
enormous. The casualties on the Rus- |
sian left flank on Tuesday exceeded j
7000.
The burning of commissariat ware
houses and the destruction of supplies
south of Mukden is said by Russian of
ficers to be complete. Everything that
could not be carried away was de
stroyed.
To-day the situation is more tense. A
terrific cannonading is in progress and '
the streets of Mukden rumble as with |
the roll of 10,000 drums.
MUKDEN, March B.â The Russian |
army Is evacuating positions south and
southwest of Mukden. The sky is
lighted with the brilliant glare of burn
ing warehouses, where tons of commis
sary supplies have been given to the
flames. The retirement is being effect
ed in perfect order, the Russians beat
ing off attacks by pursuing Japanese.
The withdrawal was necessitated by
a heavy concentration of Japanese west
and northwest of Mukden, whither they
have transferred a large share of the
I forces from the southern front to rein
; force the original striking force of Gen
\ eral Nogi.
The Russians still hold their position
at Madyapu. where a strong attack is
j expected at any moment.
A division of Japanese troops ap
peared north of Mukden, on the heights
west of Hushatai station.
Except for fights at Ushuntun and
Tatchekiao, Tuesday was quiet, com
pared with the fighting on the previ
ous days. The Japanese evidently were
completing their transfer of troops.
The Japanese arrangement for fur
nishing ammunition along the enor
mous front is acknowledged by Rus
sian officers to be admirable.
A large number of Japanese and
Chinese spies have been captured dur
ing the last three days within the Rus
sian line?. The former were especially
bold. A Japanese officer in full uni
form was captured on the Inside posi
tion of a Russian battery. For several
days tho Japanese have been throw
ing proclamations inside the Russian
lines and circulating them in Mukden,
warning th^ inhabitants of the ap
proaching bombardment of Mukden
and predicting the capture of the city
by, March 10.

General Oku's army has swung north

miles north of the Mukden line. Tha
two left armies (General Oku's and
General Nogi's). which are executing a

STILL WAIT
FOR RESULTS
OF INQUEST
Suicide Theory Rejected
Detective-Chief Burnett Does Not
Think Mrs. Stanford Ended
Her Own Life.
"I am awaiting the result of the in
quest," said Chief of Detectives Bur
! "ott yesterday. -I'ntil then little can
be done here."
I "If it is proved tKat murder was
done, what then?" was ask"d. .
"My men will be put on the case and
bring results," was the answer.
"Do you think that it was a case of
murder?"
"i do not know. I will net know un
til 1 get the result of the inquest from
Honolulu," replied the official. "It
may come to-night."
"You are prepared to act when word
does come?" â¢
'Vrtainly, everybody who could be
suspected is within reach."
"Do you think it possible that Mrs.
Stanford poisoned herself?" was asked.
Fur some time Burnett pondered over
the question. "I do not," he replied at
length.
This point was touched upon by At
torney General Andrews of Honolulu
at the inquest, on the death of fifffl.
Stanford mi Monday. The line of ques
tioning was objected to by Deputy
Sheriff Rawlins. who has charge of the
inquest, and the Attorney General did
not appear at the succeeding sessions.
Burnett's answer proves that the lo
cal police assume that murder was
done. The local detectives are only
waiting the final results of the inquest.
"Our man will be at Honolulu soon,"
observed Burnett, referring to De
j tective Harry Reynolds. "We will get
: some reports from him soon."
"What was the object in sending
! Reynolds to Honolulu. '"
"Ttie Police Department intends to
familiarize Itself with every detail of
the case."
"Do you contemplate making any ar
rests at present?"
"None at present. We are waiting
for tne result of the inquest. "
"Have you finished with Miss Rich
mond. BevÂ°rly and JlcWhinney?"
"For the present, yes?"
"Are they being watched?"
"Not to my knowledge."
In spite of this, it is known that the
local police are not passive. Detectives

FROM ST. LOUIS
Special Dispatch to The CaH.
ST. LOUIS, March B.â lt is known
here that when Mrs. Nancy Jane Mil
burn, who is believed to have been
murdered in Southern California, left
this city for the Pacific Coast she had
a large sum of money with her. Her
body was washed up by the sea at
Ocean Boach near Los Angeles. The
autopsy showed that the woman's neck
had been broken, and there were in
dications that she had been strangled.
The condition of the stomach indicated
that death had resulted before the
body was thrown into the sea.
Judge Wurdeman, of Clayton, Mrs.
Mil burn's attorney in St. Louis Cowtity,
said to-day that she took with her on
January 20, when she departed for
California, $13,000 or $14,000, part of the
proceeds of the sale of property near
the World's Fair grounds. . â¢
â¢What she did with the money. I
know not," he said. "I wrote several
letters to her, but received no reply.
Somebody must have intercepted my
letters, as none of them came back."
Mrs. Milburn came to St. Louis previ
ous to 187U and was for a few years
principal of the Oak Hill school. Later,
in 1875. she was a teacher in the Shaw
school, on Kings Highway and Old
Manchester road.
Her first husband was Moore. Of the
union there resulted two children, Mrs.
Nancy Jane O'Brien, of San Francisco,
and a son. Kent, who went to th*
Philippines as a soldier, but is now, it
is understood, in California.
Mrs. Mllburn's mother dying in the
early 70's left her an estate of about
$17,000. Soon afterward her husband
died, and she quit teaching school and
by real estate speculation and invest
ments she added to her fortune. After
a few years of widowhood she married
William Milburn in St. Louis, but the
second marriage was unhappy. Di
vorce resulted a few years later. She
and her divorced husband have fre
quently met since the divorce, it is said,
but efforts toward reconciliation have
failed. Mrs. Eoline Stanley, of St.
Louis, for fifteen years a friend of Mrs.
Milburn, says the latter's management
of her property was excellent, though
her investments at times were daring.
She says that Mrs. Milburn sometimes
heavily incumbered her holdings for
fund? to make other deals, but that
all obligations were met and that when
she went West in January her property
was clear. Two years ago, says Mrs.
Stanley, Mrs. Milburn made a will.
Her property was then valued at $35,
000, although it has since increased by
$15,000 to $25,000. The will left the
estate to her son and daughter. Mrs.
Milburn is ' survived by three sisters
and one brother, all living in Illinois.

BANKERS DEEP
IN THE FRAUDS
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March B.â The
case of the Government against Mrs.
Cassie L. Chadwick was completed
this afternoon. One witness for the
defense, an expert accountant, was
sworn, but an adjournment was taken
until to-morrow morning before he had
given any testimony.
The entire afternoon session of the
court was taken up by the introduc
tion as evidence of checks, deposit
slips, books of the bank and two let
ters written by Mrs. Chadwick to
Beckwith and Spear.
The mqst important point made by
the State in the entire case was when
District Attorney Sullivan secured the
admission as evidence of two drafts ag
gregating $80,000 issued by the Oberlin
Bank in favor of Mrs. Chadwick on
August 24, 1903. On this same date Mrs.
Chadwick obtained from the bank a
certified check for |12,500, and Receiver
Lyon testiijed that there was nothinc
on the books of the bank to show that
at the time of receiving the drafts and
the check Mrs. Chadwick had a cent
of money in the bank or was in any
way entitled to credit. The drafts were
entered on the books of the bank one
month and five days aftek* being issued.
During this time the books of the Ober
lin Bank showed that the money was
held to its credit at the Importers' and
Traders' National Bank in New York,
while it was in reality in the posses
sion of Mrs. Chadwick.

Continued From Pace 1. Column 2.
Sheriff Henry and May Hunt were present.
MiÃs Berner was asked if she suspected anybody in the Stanford house
hold. Following is her statement in full:
"There is nobody against whom I have the slightest suspicion and no
body I can think of who would do such a deed. It is impossible to think
that any of the people in the household could have done it. It is horrible
to think anybody could plan such a crime in advance. I know that It Is
believed in San Francisco that I do suspect somebody, because I have seen
cable messages to that effect. I have been asked to-day if it were so.
Our position here is dreadful enough without such thing* being said."
Turning to High Sheriff Henry Miss Berner asked if he had seen a story
in the afternoon paper about two mysterious women exchanging a package
on the Siinday preceding Mrs. Stanford's death. Replying in the negative,
Miss Berner added:
"We have never been away from the hotel, yet they make people believe
we are being watched. I cannot conceive why the papers can say such
things. Our positions are bad enough without making them worse."
When asked about leaving she said, "Naturally, I will be glad to
go under such circumstances, but I want to say that everybody has been
very kind to us." Turning to Miss Hunt she said, "Can I say the same
for you?" Miss Hunt assented and said. "Everybody has treated us
nicely and the officials were very gentlemanly. I like Honolulu and IÂ«
like the people here."
"Perhaps you may not care to return after the unpleasantness of
the visit?" was asked. Miss Hunt declared she would never care to go
, back to Honolulu.
Miss Berner said, "I would not care to say that I do not care to
come back here on another trip. The time might come when I would be
glad to come back."
Both women complained of being nervous at night. Miss Berner said
that since the death of Mrs. Stanford she had got but little sleep. She
apologized for her costume, explaining she was about to retire. Miss Berner
said that her salary as Mrs. Stanford's secretary was $200 a month. She
had saved nearly all of it. Mrs. Stanford had given her many gifts of cloth
ing and money. She had everything to lose by her benefactress' death and
nothing to gain that she had known of.
Throughout the interview Miss Berner showed that she had been under
a severe strain. She was extremely excitable and nervous, complaining of
hf-r inability to sleep.
In refutation of the suicide theory. Miss Berner said several acts of
Mrs. Stanford proved that she did not contemplate self-destruction. Re
cently Mrs. Stanford had purchased a bonnet for the trip to Japan and
with a high degree of pleasure had shown it to a friend and fitted it on.
To this friend, also, she had spoken of Honolulu being an Ideal place to
live. sW deprecated the extent of idleness she observed.
"Nobody should be idle," Mrs. Stanford had said. "There is work for
all to do. Wherever I am and no matter how long I live I expect to work
till the day of my death."
RUNS ASHORE
IN HEAVY FOG
SANTA MONICA, March B.â The
steamship Cascade, a new vessel on
her fifth voyage, ran ashore ten miles
north of Point Duma, while bound
frum San Pedro to San Francis
co, in a dense fog, at 2 o'clock this
morning. The mate left the ship in a
rowboaf for Port Los Angeles and ar
rived there this forenoon. He states
that when he left the vessel the bow
was resting on a gravelly beach, the
stern afloat, and he could not tell
whether the propeller or the rudder had
been broken when he left, on account
of darkness. The Cascade was in bal
last and carried fifteen passengers. The
passengers have been safely landed.
One of Banning's tugboats has been
sent to render assistance and expects
to get her off at high tide.
SANTA BARBARA, March 8. â The
passengers were not rescued from the
Cascade until 2 o'clock this afternoon,
when they were taken from their
perilous position by the steamship
Queen. There were twenty-two aboard
and none was lost. They arrived here
to-night, en route to San Francisco.

HENRY LOOKS HERE
FOR THE AUTHOR OF 0
THE ALLEGED MURDER
More Testimony Will Probably Be
Taken at the Inquest in Hono
lulu To-Day.
HONOLULU, March B.â The inquest
into the death of Mrs. Jane L. Stan
ford has been postponed until to-mor
row night at 7:30 o'clock. The police
surround the case with considerable
mystery.
High Sheriff Henry says the Inquest
was postponed because the stenog
rapher's transcript of thÂ« testimony
was not ready, aad the Hawaiian law
requires that the witnesses must
and sign their testimony In the pres
ence of the jury.
Sheriff Henry also said that he ia
not certain whether or not additional
witnesses will be called upon to t â -
It is understood that the chemists.
Dr. Duncan and Dr. Shorey. will be re
called and an attempt will be ma .
determine the character of the strych
nine in the bicarbonate of soda, if
anything in this line can be ascertained
It may be of aid in finding where the
strychnine was bought.
Sheriff Henry expresses the opinion
that the guilty person must be looked
for in San Francisco. He says that he
has carefully traced the history of the
bottle of bicarbonate of soda from ttn
time Mrs. Stanford took a dosa from it
in Honolulu to the packing of the bot
tle in San Francisco. He is convinced,
hÂ« says, that the poison could not have
been mixed in the soda during this time
and that the criminal act must there
fore have been committed in San r ran
cisco.
The statement of the High Sheriff
that the guilty person must baJbund in
San Francisco and not in Honolulu vi
virtually an opinion that frees Mi d Â»
Bertha Berner, the private sÂ«cretary,
so far as Henry is concerned. He wilj
not entertain the theory that Mrs.
Stanford committed suicide.
Crowds of morbid women invade thÂ»
office of High Sheriff Henry dally offer
ing all sort* of suggestlonÃ on thÂ«
Stanford case. All sorts of cranks hayÂ«
theories and suspicions. Many spirit
ualists hare offered the official what
they consider valuable advice In thÂ«
matter.
The weirdest and most disconnected
tale is told by a man named Nelson. H'
is almost a total stranger in the town,

a few weeks ago.
He asserts that the Sunday preceding

Army Must Fight Its

BT. PETERSBURG, March 9.â The
battle of Mukden has resulted in a
Russian defeat.
Field Marshal Oyama has once more
proved himself one of the greatest mas
ters of offensive strategy since Napo
leon, while General Kuropatkin is now
â¢ngaged in endeavoring to defend his
title as a master of successful retreats
and bring off his army, with its im
mense train, safely to Tie Pass, where
a position was U nz ag" prepared with
this contingency in view.
The problem before the Russian com
mander-in-chief is much more difficult
tiian the one he met successfully at
EJBOfMft since now he is threatened
on both nanks, his ieft wing being en
tangled, in a mountainous region far
from the railroad. Nevertheless, Rus

degree of confidence in General Kuro

s given out yesterday.
HOPED TO AVOID BATTLE.
l|l newspaper contained
-port of doubtful origin, cred
i.mese sources, but the first
::;ent was derived from
the prest dispatch from General Kuro
headquarters, the contents of
which were quickly telegraphed to
many Liberals from friends abroad.
The report probably will not be printed

news, however, is only what was ex- j
i. ultimate retirement having

KKNNENKAMPFF IN" DANGER.
The gTeat question now and the one
over which the general staff burned
its Jights late into the night, is wheth
er Field Marshal Oyama has entangled
the Russians in his strategic net suf
ficiently to prevent a successful retreat
Â£ss. General Rennenkampff's
to the eastward admittedly is in
â¢ danger of being cut fÂ»ff, and a
derabk- force of Japanese appears
to be operating on the Russian right,
rr.ward Tie Pass. If the Japanese
eed in reaching the railroad and
interrupt traffic, if only for a few
hours, it may have the gravest conse
<|uc T^neral Kuropatkin, who
ie now engaged In a literal race with
the Japanese to rearh a naturally de
r f^nsibie position forty miles north
ward. Thus tar he has stood off all
attacks directed apainsi the flanks of
rmy and hoMs the way of retreat
He undoubtedly was forced to
ion a number of siege guns ori his
Shakhe position, but if he succeeds
. rning over the army intact, with
the principal portion of its artillery
-train, to his successor, the Russian
' will be by no means desperate,
â¢'â¢yama will again have missed his
quarry and a comparatively barren
: y will have been purchased at an
enormous co6t of life.
â¢ All reports indicate that the Jap
anese were utterly reckless of sacri
making attack after attack,
ially or. the center and west,
ajrainst machine guns and infantry
which literally mowed down the
advancing columns, making human
flesh so cheap that the survivors could
hide themselves behind piles of
corpses.
RIROPATKIX TO BE DEPOSED.
After this action. General Kuropat
kin's deposition may be regarded as
<ortain. War Minister Sakharoff is
picked as his probable successor;
though Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholo
. of the Board of Strategists may
be entrusted with the direction of af
fairs.
A strong faction of the army â thos 1 ?
high in influence about the Emperor â
sed General Kuropatkin from the
first, and though his early defeats were
mcd because it was realized that
â¢ ral Kuropatkin was doing all that
man could with the tools at his com
l, it is now felt that after twice
.g had the opportunity to show
what he could do with a powerful
arrr.y. and having failed to accomplish
victory either time, his removal is
ad v: sable.
A high mlltary official said last night
;he Emperor had had enough of
a general whose interpretation of a
was a successful retreat.
Fabian tactics are well enough in
their way, say these critics, but
Kuropatkin went beyond those of Fa
bian, and neglected to take account
of favorable opportunities for counter
stroke*.
Friends of General Kuropatkin, how
ever, pay that no other general is apt
to do ap well as he has done, and de
clare that his removal may mean, as

REVIVES PEACE TALK.
The news of a retreat on Tie Pass Is
bound to revive talk of peace, though
if Field Marshal Oyama has failed to
crush General Kuropatkin, peace is no
more imperative now than it was last
month. Peace advocates point out the
departure of Vice Admiral Rojestven
sky's squadron from Madagascar for
Jibutil, simultaneously with the loss of
Mukden, and intimate that, perhaps
the movement of the fleet may have
been made in view of the latter event.
The movement, on the other hand, may
be in pursuance of a plan for a junc
tion between Rojestvensky and the re
inforcing squadron, preparatory to giv
ing battle to Togo's fleet.
The peace movement admittedly has
a strong following, even in the Min
istry; but it cannot be stated now
whether the defeat at Mukden has been
effective enough to turn the scale.
No decision can be taken, at least un
til the extent of the reverse is known.
ON THE EVE OF DEFEAT.
Incidents of the Fighting West of
Mukden Station.
MUKDEN. Tuesday, March 7. â The
chief objects of the Titanic combat
west of Mukden were the villages of
Ushuntun, seven miles west of Muk
den station, and Tatchekiao, where
the results practically were a draw;
but a further turning movement has
developed. The Japanese are extend
ing their forces still farther toward
Tie Pass.
At dawn to-day, after a night bro
ken by irregular musketry fire and
cannonading, the fight began at
Ushuntun and Tatchekiao, both of
which are large villages nestling in
groves of tamarinds now bare of
leaves. The houses are constructed
with thick walls and the villages are
surrounded- by high clay ramparts,
converting them into fortifications
impervious to rifle bullets. It was
most difficult" to approach these vil
lages and each house had to be taken
singly by hand-to-hand combat.
The Russians who held Ushuntun
for a night were forced to withdraw at
dawn the next day by a terrible fire
of shrapnel and shimose shells, under
which the village seethed as if in a
caldron; but, reinforced by the bri
gades of riflemen and reserves, the
Russians again advanced to the at
tack. Under the eyes of General
Kaulbars. who, with his staff, moved
about where the hail of iron was
thickest and who seemed to bear a
charmed life, the riflemen deployed
over the plowed fields as if at maneu
vers and without firing a shot, though
bespattered by the continuous burst
ing of shrapnel and shells. They
pushed on in skirmishing order, cap
tured the village and advanced on the
Japanese flanks. The fight then grew
more bitter, the Japanese attacking
madly, but at 4 o'clock in the after
noon the Russian position became
more secure and General Kaulbars,
who had spent most of the day at this
point, moved off to visit the other
Russian positions, the Japanese bid
ding him adieu with a burst of shi
mose shells.
Opposite Tatchekiao the fighting
was of an equally desperate nature.
The Russians established themselves
in the villages of Tsunhuanche and
Liudyaofani, but night fell with Tat
chekiao still in the hands of the Jap
anese.
North of Tatchekiao the cannon
also roared. The regiment under the
command of Colonel Zapolisky clung
tenaciously to a village, under a show
er of shrapnel. Toward evening Gen
eral Kuropatkin rode out of Mukden
in an automobile and examined per
sonally the positions of the second
army.
At the close of the fighting this
evening the infantry on both sides
was short of ammunition and the night
was devoted to replenishing supplies
of individual soldiers. Southwest of
Mukden, at the Shantan pivot fight,
the Japanese succeeded in establish
ing themselves in the southern part
of the village, but they were expelled
by the Russians.
Reports received here say the re
peated attacks of the Japanese on
Poutlloff and Novgorod hills have
been repulsed with heavy loss.
A division of Russian cavalry which
was patrolling the Liao Valley and
was cut off on March 2 by the rapid
advance of the Japanese succeeded
to-day in rejoining the Russian army
without having sustained any losses.
It took a number of prisoners.
RUSSIAN FLEET TURNS BACK.
Baltic Warships Are Steaming In
Homeward Direction.
PARIS. March 8. â A dispatch to
the Temps from Tananarive capital
of the island of Madagascar, says the
entire Russian fleet has left the wa
ters on its return to Jibutil, French
Somaliland.
HAMBURG, March B.â Shipping cir
cles are not surprised at the return of
the Ruseian fleet to the Red Sea, since
recent events here indicate that the
Russian Government is undecided with
reference to further attempts to send
the fleet to Eastern Asiatic waters.
The chartered steamship St. Ninian,
which was en route to Batavia with
coal for the second Pacific squadron,
returned here recently upon orders
from the Russian Government.
TWO STEAMSHIPS SEIZED.
TOKIO, March B.â The British
steamship Venus was captured by the
Japanese patrolling flotilla on March
4 and another British steamship, the
Aphrodite, was seized on March 6
Both vessels were bound from Car
diff, "Wales, for Vladivostok.
Since the beginning of the war the
Japanese have seized thirty-two
steamships, ranging from 1000 tons
register upward and totaling more
than 100.000 tons.

orderly manner before the onward rush
of the Japanese, who have advanced
more than twenty miles in four days,
always being in touch with the Rus
sians.
The Russians had many strong de
fenses along several lines, but these
were not defended by them as strongly
as the Japanese had expected. It is
evident that the Russian soldiers had
become disheartened by the fall of
Port Arthur, and it is believed at these
headquarters that they are. or have
been, in almost open revolt. Many
strong positions were given up by them
without a show of resistance.
The battlefield shows evidence of a
hasty retreat. It is covered by bits of
clothing and heavy felt boots, thous
ands of the latter having been thrown
away, probably because they Impeded
the hasty flight of the Russians.
Many rifles and thousands of rifle cart
ridges were thrown away.
The Russians are retiring to the east
and north in confusion, and it is now
evident that all plans for retreat were
upset by the rapid rushes of the Japa
nese. The entire Russian right seems
to be disorganized, and reports re
ceived to-day show that the troops are
in an almost panic-stricken condition.
One Russian army corps opposed to
the extreme left of the Japanese armies
is retiring rapidly, making practically
no effort to stop the movement of the
Japanese.
The Russian center ne^ar the railway
still retains Its position, but it is be
lieved that unless the Russians there
retire the entire command will either
be surrounded or its retreat cut off at
Tawankampu on the Hun River, which
was captured last night by the Japa
nese. In this capture the Japanese se
cured large quantities of supplies and
considerable light railway material, the
Russians having retreated precipitately
without having time to either carry
away or destroy their supplies.
The advance of the Japanese left
armies has been the most rapid they
ever made. Recognizing the fact that
the Russians had become demoralized,
the Japanese determined not to allow
them time to rally. So far the Japa
nese have not captured any gruns, but
they have taken a large number of
rifles and much ammunition.
The movement of the Japanese troops
practically throughout the entire battle
was conducted by telephone, the per
fect flatness of the country not allow
ing any hill from which a commander
could direct the movement of the
troops. The ground is still frozen, and
therefore it Is impossible for the ad
vancing Japanese to throw up any
shelter, and they are using various de
vices for protection, some of the men
being furnished with small steel shells
large enough to cover the head whil<
lying, and others carrying sand baj .
Some of the Japanese even use a ha!
dozen bricks taken from the ruined
Chinese houses and bound together
with wire.
The Chinese are suffering greatly as
a result of the fiehting. Many of their
villages have been burned by shell fire,
and others have been set on fire by the
Russians. All the houses containing
anything of value, have been looted by
the Russians.
MACHUNTAN CAPTURED.
Village Southeast of Mukden Taken
by the Japanese.
TOKIO, March B.â The following dis
patch was received at 4 o'clock this
afternoon from the headquarters of the
Japanese armies in Manchuria:
"Our force which has been engaging
a superior force of the enemy in the
neighborhood of Machuntan (southeast
of Mukden) dislodged the enemy from
his positions at 8 o'clock this morning
and is now pursuing him northward.
"In the direction of Singking on the
morning of March 6 our force ad
vanced toward Huaijen. It first occu
pied Pinshihhata, and then Huaijen.
"In the direction of the Shakhe River,
east of the railway, at 3 o'clock on the
morning of March 7, the enemy's in
fantry attacked the heights north of
Tunchiatun. but were repulsed. The
enemy left thirty dead on the field.
"At 2 o'clock on the morning of
March 7 the enemy's artillery concen
trated its fire on the lines between Ta
Mountain and Wanpao Mountain, and
a large body of infantry attacked us.
but was entirely repulsed at 4:30
o'clock.
"West of the railway we occupied
East Hanchenpao on March 7, and later
we repulsed an attempt of the enemy
to retake the right bank of the Hun
River.
"There are indications of the enemy's
gradual reinforcement, and of a gather
ing of trooos in the vicinity of Yang
shihtun, seven miles southwest of Muk
den.
"We caDtured two-thirds of the vil
lage of Likuanpao, repulsing a counter
attack made by the enemy with a
division. Likuanpao is situated eight
miles west of Mukden."
WJtLJj OF HUMAN BODIES.
Japanese Plastered Their Dead To-
gether With Mud.
MUKDEN, March B.â Up to noon to
day, when the order to* retreat was
given, the almost unparalleled death
struggle ln which the armies of Kaul
bars and Nogi were locked seemed to
be largely a question of endurance. It
was difficult to decide with which force
the advantage lay. The Japanese
stormed village after village, only to be
driven out again by Russians. Some
positions were captured and recaptured
many times. One village was occupied
by each side four times. This village
was finally held by the Japanese, who
made entrenchments with the bodies of
their own dead, piling them up through
the night and making of them a com
pact wall with mud.
A correspondent to-day rode over
ground strewn with Japanese dead. An
hour later the Japanese marched back
and reoccupied the same ground. Push
ing on, they encountered Russian
troops, which held their ground stub
bornly and ultimately hurled the Jap
anese back.
At sunset three Russian regiments
marched across the plain, a distance of
two miles, into battle. They advanced
in column of companies, with their ri
fles at the shoulder, colors flyirfg, bands
playing and the men singing the
mighty chorus of a Russian hymn,
rhich was heard above the roar of bat
e. Shimose shells burst so thickly
.. ound them that black smoke hid
them from view; shrapnel raged over
head like an electrical storm, but still
the regiments moved forward, closing
up gaps in their ranks and forming
into line when they reached the point
of engagement, as if on parade. The
spectacle was sublime.
BEHEADED BY BANDITS.
Chinese Put to Death Two Alleged
Russian Spies.
NEWCHWANG, March 8. â With
Japanese flags flying, a band of Chi
nese bandits to-day beheaded two
young Russians, who were alleged to
be spies, at Sinmintin. The first one
executed was evidently an officer, but
ha was wearing a Chinese overcoat.
He kneeled without a murmur, while
his companion watched the death
stroke. The second captive was
clothed in Chinese clothing through
out. He whimpered for a moment, but
regained his nerve and struggled
fiercely. He was thrown and killed,
while long trumpets fanfared. The
chief of the bandits was a mild-man
nered old man, wearing a Japanese
sv.ord. He watched the executions un
moved.
"They are spies," he said, "and we
should kill them. Besides, it Is dif
ficult to transport them."
SLAV COMMANDER'S FAULT.
Kuropatkin Uses Subordinate Gener-
als Merely as Messengers.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 8. â A
general who has just returned from
the front says that General Kuropat
kin's faults as commander in chief
are due to hia bureaucratic training
and his desire to keep all the reins in
his own hands. Instead of relying on
the judgment of the army command
ers to carry out his general orders he
made them simply orderlies for the
transmission of specific orders to in
dividual units and kept constantly be
fore him a map showing the location
not only of the corps but of the bri
gades and regiments, and undertook
to control the movement of every unit.
"The genius of Napoleon," the gen
eral added, "could not acocmplish the
task Kuropatkin set for himself."
Jew's Action Prevents Rioting.
LODZ, March 8. â In consequence of
threats of anti-Semitic disturbances
the authorities have induced Poznan
skl, who is a Jew, to withdraw his or
ders shutting down his mill indefinite
ly and throwing 6000 persons out of

and the men returned to work.

SHARP BREAK IN PRICE
OF JULY WHEAT OPTIONS
Excellent Weather Conditions Cause
a Drop of More Than Three
Cents.
CHICAGO, March B.â A break of 3%
cents in the price of wheat for July
delivery occurred here to-day. Other
options suffered almost as shamly.
Excellent growing weather throughout
the winter wheat section of the United
States was the cause of the general
selling that resulted in the severe set
back to prices. The close for July was
at the loweÃt point of the dayâ 92%c.

ST. PETERSBURG. March B.â A sen
sation was caused to-day by a leadilng
editorial in the Moscow Gazette, the
traditional spokesman of autocracy,
declaring that the present revolt in the
interior should be put down immedi
ately by the method by which General
Michael Muravleff crushed the Polish
and Lithuanian rebellion in 1863.
"It would be a sad sacrifice of life,"
says the Gazette, "but a hundred times
less now than if the revolt were allow
ed to continue until it becomes abso
lutely necessary to take decisive steps."
LONDON, March 9.â Anarchy and
open defiance of the authorities, ac
cording to the Dally Mail's correspond
ent at Batoum, Is spreading in the
Western Caucasus. The situation is so
serious that an expeditionary force has

districts of Georgia. It consists of
seven battalions of infantry', six com
panies of Cossacks and a battery of ar
tillery, and is commanded by General
Alikenoff, who Is noted for his drastic
methods. The Georgians threaten that
the first shot will be the signal for a
revolution.

VACCINATION
BILL VETOED
Governor Refuses to Sign
Measure Which Contains
1 Blow at the Practice
PEXB A LONG MESSAGE
Thinks It Would Be a Big
Step Backward to Allow
It to Become a State Law
SACRAMEXTO. March 8. â Gov
ernor Pardee to-day Bent a message to
the Senate vetoing Senator Lieavitt's
bill to prevent vaccination being made
a compulsory condition for admission
10 the public schools. The message,
which contains nearly 1500 words, is
In part as follows:
1 speak as one familiar by training and edu
caCoo with the subject matter when I
tay that the vast preponderance of expert
medical authority throughout the civilized
world asserts that vaccination Is the prim*
cause of the practical disappearance of small
pox â one of the most dreaded and dreadful
diseases of preâ vaccination times â from com
nmnitieg protected by it Under Its benefl
c-em infection the decimating epidemic*
which f /meriy swept through Europe have
1 (â  ry nearly disappeared and the disease, modi
fied by vaccination, haÂ« now. to a great ex
tent, lout it* terrors In the minds of those
who have neither witnessed nor Â«uflfÂ«red from
its devastation*.
Before the discovery and application by th*
immortal Jtnner. the disease, was nearly uni
versal, and it was considered to be a grave
dindvgiiiKi^ not to have had smallpox in
childhood. Severe and terrible epidemic* have
gradually but surely become things of the past.
except where from any cause vaccination has
been neglected.
That accidents of many kinds, even death,
may follow vaccination la not and cannot be
denied. But that the number of these acci
dents compared to the many, many thousands,
even millions, of times which this beneficent
procedure is practiced, is anything but infini
tesimal, is not borne out by the facts.
Tetanuc or lockjaw not infrequently follows
injuries of various kinds, slight wounds, even
scratches, being followed, if infected with the
specific bacillus by the disease. Such oases,
not following vaccination, are not looked upon
with the horror that follows an infected vac
cination scratch which may. like any other
&brasioe be followed by lockjaw.
X\ hen vaccination is compulsory and thÂ« law
is well administered there is but little small
pox; co little that those protected by vaccina
tion soon lose their fear of the dread disease.
And turning their attention to the lesser evils
of the ractine virus, many of us conjure a
fear not warranted by facts against the very
thing that -save* us from a much worse fate.
And this I think, Is what ha* called into
betns the bin which I now return to you un
signed. Were it to become a law there can
be no doubt that vaccination would soon â 
fall into practical disuse. And thus would be
prepared among our children <not mine, for
they shall always be protected) a field for
smallpox to fairly revel in.
The only thins at hMM here and now in
this bill, it (Mist to â *, is -whether or nor
ihe State shall or shall not reverse its present
pro-vacclnation policy and assume what this
bill practically provides for, a no- vaccination
Policy. I have no hesitancy whatever in say
ing that in my Judgment it would be a sad
mistake for the State to thus change front on
this moet important mstttr.
By a vote of 23 to 3 the Senate to
day refused to pass the bill over the
Governor's vÂ«to.

special Dispatch to The t.'all.
'RAMENTO, March B.â ln obedi
ence to public sentiment, as expressed
by the people of their various districts,
enough Assemblymen voted to-day
against the building and loan bill
transmitted from the Senate to encom
pass its defeat. The vote was a close
<Â«ne, the result being 38 to 37, the pro
ponents oi" the measure lacking; threti
votes of carrying it.
The nght was a pretty one. Ever
since the bill failed of passage on
Aionday night its backers have worked
incessantly to bring over more votes.
Transue of Los Angeles headed this
i>nting*Â»nt. An effort was made to in
duce Walter Parker to get behind the
bill, but he refused to have anything to
do with the rtght. Beardslee, Crom
well and the others, who stood for the
home associations, did not relax their
vigilance, and as a result the measure
has gone fo the legislative graveyard.
Though opposed to the measure, King
called it up for reconsideration as a
matter of fairness, the opposition at no
time evincing any disposition to give
the bill other than a fair chance, that
it might be carried or beaten on its
merits. Most of those who were
against it voted for its reconsideration.
Before the discussion opened Transue
said that knowledge having come to
the Senators that had helped frame the
bill that their motives had been im
pugned, they wished to make a public
statement, and he submitted the fol
lowing, which was read from the desk:
STATEMENT OF COMMITTEE.
To the Honorable Members of the Assembly
of the State ot California â Gentlemen:
Knowledge has come to us of certain state
ments alleged to have been made upon the
fl'-or of the Assembly last evening during the
consideration of the committee substitute to

ili That William Corbln, secretary of the
Continental Building and Loan Association,
dictated In whole or in part the provision? of
said bill.
That the members or the special Senate
Investigating committee who submitted said
substitute were Interested financially in the
passage of e aid bill.
That said bill was drafted by said com
mittee in the interests of that class of build

"National" and to the detriment of that claw
of building and ioan associations called
"Local."
Wf: the undersigned, feeing members of the
special investigating committee of the Senate
who proposed said bill, do moet emphatically
d-r.y
'li That Oorbin communicated di

he had anything whatever to do with the
drafting of said bill: that hÂ« could have had
any possible knowledge of the contents of said

"If you are desirous of correcting the
abuses that exist in the building and
loan business you will vote for this
bill," said Transue. "If you do not
want such correction, then vote aeainst
It. I trust it will be passed by a unani
mous vote."
John rose to a question of personal
privilege. He said that after the dis
cussion of Monday night Senator
Lynch, one of the framers of the bill.
came to him at his deck and told him
he was making a fool of himself. John
told him he was merely representing
his constituents, and Lynch then. John
stated, called him a liar.
"I am for the people of San Luis
Obispo," said John in conclusion, "and
no man who has failed to stand for
them can hope for future political fa
vors at their hands."
SHARP DEBATE FOLLOWS
"The evils that exist are not as bad
as some of the evils in this bill." said
Drew. "The so-called locals are build
ing the homes of ihe State. There are
twelve large companies that it is de
sired to regulate, but there are 138 mu
tuals that we must give our protection.
I think the bill we have sent to the
Governor providing that .companies
muet pay back on demand the money
of investors is a big step in the right
direction and will curtail abuses."
"When this bill came up for passage
Monday night." said Devlin, "there
was no Â£opy on my desk. I thought at
that time the locals were being im
posed upon and voted against the bill.
I have studied it since and will say
frankly I think it a great improvement
over the present law. I shall now vote
for it." The proponents of the meas
ure ( heered Devlin.
"The original scheme of buildinir'and
loan business is excellent." said Mc-
Gowan, "but its execution is faulty.
That legislation is needed is admitted.
For sixty days committees have been
at work trying to get out a satisfac
tory law, and the bill before us is the
final result of all that work. The use
of the liberties given some building
and loan associations is being abused."
McGowan took up the John-Lynch
row in defense of the Senator, but
John stopped discussion on that matter
by stating frankly that he believed
Lynch's honesty could not be Ques
tioned.
When all had answered on the first
roll call, the vote stood 35 for and 32 !
against the bill. On the first call of
the house the bill gained two votes
and the opposition three. There was
another call of the house, the opposi
tion gaining two and the proponents of
the bill one. Chandler changed from
"no" to "aye," but Manwell offset his
vote by doing the reverse. There was
a tie vote on a demand for a third
call of the houae, and the Speaker de
rided the question by voting against
it. The final vote stood 38 to 37. It
takÂ«>F forty-one votes to carry a meas
ure.
Waste, who voted for the bill on Mon
day because he had been on the joint
committee that framed ! t. changed his
vote to-day to "no." his constituents

NO BARBER BOARD.
Bill to Re-establish Commission Killed
in the Senate.
SACRAMENTO, March B.â The pro
ponents of the bill aimed to establish
a barbers' commission "to regulate the
pursuit, business, art and vocation
of barbering; to license persons carry
ing on such business and to insure the
proper qualifications of persons fol
lowing such business and to enforce
sanitary regulations in the shops of
the State, ' made a desperate attempt
in the Senate this morning to pass
their measure on reconsideration. They
failed by two votes and the bill is
now dead. As a result the commission
that was abolished by the Legislature
two years ago, after a thorough exam
ination of its methods, will not be re
vived, and the barbers that want to
hold their trade by installing the most
up-to-date methods -will be permitted
to proceed on their own lines without
dictation.
After the Senate voted this morning
to reconsider the bill Carter was the
first to attack it. He said he saw no
reason why a commission should be re
vived whose methods resulted in more
scandal during its limited existence
than any othtr in the State's his
tory.
Belshaw said the sole purpose of the
measure was to enable certain mem
bers of the barbers' associations to go
through the State and collect 50 cents
from each victim and then go into pol
itics with the fund thus collected, as
had been done by the late unlamented
commission.
Senator Rowell said he was unalter
ably opposed to the bill, and had
noted that one of the late Commission
ers had been in Sacramento since the
opening of the legislative session lob
bying for the bill. Its only purpose, so
fir as he could see, he said, was to get
rid of the barber schools in San Fran
cisco. Instead of fewer schools, he
favored more, he paid, because he be
lieved the theory of sanitation could be
impressed upon the trade by such in
stitutions to a much greater degree
than by any commission that might be
named.
The call for the vote found only sev
enteen members in Its favor. Senator
Pendleton demanded a call of the
house, and several absentees were
gathered in, but out of the lot the bill
found only two In its favor. The bill
was then declared defeated by the
chair.
OPPOSES THE PURCHASE.
SACRAMENTO, March B.â The
Committee on Ways and Means of the
Assembly to-day reported adversely
on the Selvage bill, providing for
the purchase of the Port Humboldt
property at Eureka, which has passed
the Senate. Assemblyman Jones of
San Francisco, who was sent to Eu
reka to investigate, has expressed the
opinion that the property, for the
purchase of which the bill appro
priates $35,000, Is worth only $15,000.
Investigate the building and loan as
sociations and file a report covering
needed legislation with the next ses
sion.
TO AMEND THE ACT.
At the afternoon session Waste sub
mitted some amendments to the Sen
ate bill, introduced to supplant the ex
isting act establishing a building and
loan commission, acknowledged to be
unconstitutional. It Is thought these
amendment* will help regulate some of
the evils existing in the building and
loan business. They provide that at
least once a year without previous no
tice the comlssion shall visit every
association, count the funds and check
the balance with the amount the books
show to have been on hand at the hour
of the beginning of the investigation,
and that the commission shall make a
revaluation of real estate on which
loans havp been delinquent six months.
The last amendment will serve as a
means to force investors to pay up.

SENATE COMMITTEE
IGNORES SANTO DO
MINGO PROTOCOL.
Perfects a Treaty Radically
Differing From That
Drawn Up by Hay.
WASHINGTON, March Â».â The Santo
Domingo treaty was practically per
fected to-day by the Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations, so far as the
phraseology is concerned, and without
regard to the principles involved in the
procedure proposed by the Dominican
convention. The committee progressed
so far that it was agreed to take a vote
on the treaty to-morrow to determine
whether the report shall be In favor of
ratification or rejection. What that re
port will be cannot be determined posi
tively, although it is believed it will be
favorable. The Democrats on the com
mittee have expressed themselves aa
against the treaty fundamentally, al
though they took an active part in the
presentation and adoption of amend
ments. It is expected most of the Re
publican Senators will vote to report
the treaty as amended.
All of the amendments adopted by
the committee are with a general aim
of making the question covered stand
alone and of removing all chance of it
being used as a precedent for like pro
cedure in other countries, under guise
of being required by the Monroe doc
trine. For instance, one of the first
amendments strikes out that portion of
the second paragraph of the preamble
which has been construed as a defini
tion and application of the Monroe doc
trine to the Santo Domingo case. Other
important amendments are as follows:
That part of the preamble which de
clares that the Dominican Government
is in "imminent peril and urgent men
ace of intervention on the part of the
nations whose citizens have claims" is
stricken out and the preamble left to
read that the proceeding is on the
ground of* having debts "which burden
the republic."
FIRST ARTICLE AMENDED.
In the first article, which describes
the character of the claims this Gov
ernment purposes to adjust, an amend
ment was adopted to include obliga
tions "liquidated and agreed upon."
This amendment is for the purpose of
giving the treaty application to the ad
justment of the claims of the San Do
mingo / Improvement Company, the
payment of which already has been en
tered on by the agreement under which
the United States has taken charge of
a number of custom-houses under the
protocol of July 31. IW3.
The article which declares that the
Government of the United States, at
the request of the Dominican Govern
ment, shall grant the latter such other
assistance as the former may deem
proper to restore the credit, preserve
the order, increase the efficiency of the
civil administration and advance the
material progress and welfare of the
Dominican republic, was amended so
as to permit the Government of the
United States to grant this additional
assistance if it desires, but It Is not
bound by treaty obligations so to do.
TREATY TO BE BINDING.
A new article was added, w r hich
provides that whatever is done under
this treaty shall be binding on suc
ceeding Governments in the Domini
can republic, so as to eliminate the
chance of a succeeding government at
tempting to repudiate its agreement
with the United States.
The probability of the treaty being
brought up in the future as a pre
cfdent was discussed freely in the
committee to-day and it was predicted
that the procedure was a forerunner
of what might be expected to take
place in regard to Venezuela. It was
declared, too. that this Government
might have to take over the Santo Do
mingo country as territory of the
United States. In this connection an
amendment will be offered in the' Sen
ate striking out that part of the pre
amble whereby the United States
agrees to respect the complete Integ
rity of the Dominican republic.
MR. ROOSEVEI/FS MESSAGE.
IVesident Again Explains Purpose of
Dominican Convention.
WASHINGTON, March 8. â The Sen-
I ate in executive session to-day made
! public the second message of President
! Roosevelt on the Santo Domingo
I treaty. The message follows:
To the Senate: I wish to oall the attention
| of the Senate at this executive seesion to the
! treaty with Santo Domingo. I feel that I
| ought to state to the Senate that the condi
tion of affairs in Santo Domingo is such that
( it 1h very much for the interest of that tp
: public that action on the treaty should be
; had at as early, a moment as the Senate.
j after giving the matter full consideration, may
â  find practicable.
I call attrntion to the following facts:
1. This treaty was entered into at the
earnest request of Santo Domingo herself, and
is designed to afford Santo Domingo relief
and assistance. Its primary benefit will be
;to Santo Domingo. It offers the method most
! likely to secure Deace and to prevent war In
the Island.
2. The benefit to the T'nited States will con
sist chiefly in the tendency under the treaty
i to secure stability, order and prosperity In
Santo Domineo, and the removal of the ap
prehension lest foreign powers make aggres
sions on Santo Domingo in thÂ« course of col
lecting claims due to their citizen*, for it iÂ»
generally to our interest that all the islands
in the Caribbean Sea should enjoy peace and
! prosperity and feel goodwill toward this coun
try. The benefit to honest creditors will come
, from the fact that, for the first time, under
; this treaty, a practicable method of attempt
! ing to settle the debts due them will be ln
â  fcugurated.
3. Many of the debts alleged to be due from
I Santo Domingo to outside creditors unques
tionably on their face represent far more
â  money than ever was actually given Santo
j Domingo. The proposed treaty provides for a.
I proctss by whioh Impartial experts will de-
I termlne what dpbtg are valid and what are, in
I whole or in part, invalid, and will apportion
I accordingly the surplus revenue available for
i the payment of the debts. This treaty offers
i the only method for preventing the collection
i of fraudulent debts, whether owed to Ameri
cans or to citizens of other nations.
4. ThiÂ» treaty affords the most practicable
' means of obtaining payment for the Just
I <:laim!> of American citizens.
5. If the treaty is ratified, creditors belong
i Ing to other nations will have exactly as
good treatment as creditors who are citizens
of the United States, and at the same time
Santo Domingo will be protected against un
just and exorbitant claims. If it is not rati
i fled, the chances are that American creditors
will fare ill as compared with those of other
I nations: for foreign nations, being denied the
; opportunity to get what is rightfully dua
their citizen? under the proposed arrange
! ment. will be left to collect the debts due
. their creditors a s they see fit; provided, of
course, there Is not permanent occupancy of
I Dominican territory. As in such cases the
j United States will have nothing to say as
j to what debts should or should not be col
lected, and aÂ» Santo Domingo will be left with
! out aid, assistance or protection. It Is impos
! slble to state that the sums collected from It
j will not be improper In amount. In Mich
; event whatever In" collected by means of for
! clble intervention will be applied to the cred-
I itors of foreign nations in preference to cred
j itors who are citizens of the t'nitrd Ptates.
6. The correspondence between the Serretary
of State and the Minister of Hayti. submitted
to the Senate several day? ago, shows that
our position is explicitly and unreservedly
that, under no circumstances, do we Intend
to acquire territory in or possession of either
Hayti or Santn Domingo, It being stated In
these letters that, even if the two republic*
desired to becom* a part of the United State*
the United State# would certainly refute It*
assent.
7. Santo Dominfto grievously neede the aid
of a powerful and friendly nation. This aid
-ive are able, and. I trust, willing, to be
stow. She hae asked for this aid, and the ex
pressions of friendship repeatedly sanctioned
by tb# people and the Ocrvernment of the
Inited States warrant her tn believing; that
It will not be withheld in the hour of her
need THEODORE ROOSEVELT

E. S. Cramp Suggests Plan for Secur-
Ing Most Formidable Scout
Ships in World.
WASHINGTON, March B.âSecre
tary Morton has under consideration
a Huggestion from E. S. Cramp, vice
president of William Cramp & Sons,
shipbuilders of Philadelphia, for the
installation of turbine propulsive ma
chinery in the cruisers Columbia and
Minneapolis. Cramp's letter says In
part:
The cruisers Columbia and Minneapolis are
the only three-screw vessels of the United
States navy. If equipped with ttirblne* thÂ«
department will have two of the most formid
able scouts In tha world, and the eott of
changing them will bÂ« about the coat of one
of the new scouts aa already designed.
The board of construction does not
regard the proposition favorably.
TO REGULATE LOANS.
Bill to Correct Evils Practiced by
Pawnbrokers Passed.
SACRAMENTO, March B.â The bill
Introduced in the lower house by Bspey
and in the Senate by Woodward "to
provide for incorporation of associa
tions for lending money on personal
property, and regulating the same, and
to forbid certain loans of money, prop
erty or credit" was passed by the As
sembly this morning and Is in the
Govtrnor's hands.
"As the law stands," said Espey In
explaining the bill, "banks cannot now
loaÂ» money on personal property In the
way of pledges. In the East corpora
tions, financial and charitable, have
existed for years under this proposed
law and have been very successful and
wrought much good. In this State there
is now r>aid to pawnbrokers $300,000 a
year in Interest at rates from two to
five per cent a month."
This afternoon the Senate refused to
reconsider the vote passing the bill re
quiring that the lenders of money on
chattels shall charge not more than
ten per cent per annum on loans and
that on each ticket Issued by them
there shall be printed the law setting
forth the limitations placed upon them.
Senator Wolfe made a hard fight for
the reconsideration of the bill and gave
as his reasons that the bill under the
guise of an attack upon the pawn
brokers of the State was in reality a
measure in the interest of money
lenders who were not classed as pawn
brokers. Senator Wolfejnade the point
that the clause of the VH which com
pelled pawnbrokers to give a bond in
the sum of $1000 was unconstitutional
and that the bill sought to impose
hardships upon pawnbrokers that were
unwarranted. Wolfe also called atten
tion to the provision of the charter
of San Francisco which gives the police
commissioners the power to revoke the
permit of any pawnbroker who violates
the law.

WITNESSES DESCRIBE
SANTA CLARA WELLS
Tell of Connection Between Them
in Suit Against the Water
Company.
SAN JOSE, March 8. â The case of
Charles Miller against the Bay Cities
Water Company was continued this
morning before Judge Rhodes. A
' number of witnesses for the plaintiff
were examined and the evidence ad
duced was along the line of proof of
the plaintiff's contention that the wells
of the Santa Clara Valley drew their
supplies from the same underground
stream and were to a great extent in
terdependent.
John A. Wetmore, Harvey Swickard
and William B. Fielding testified to
the fact that a large quantity of water
drawn from one well invariably low
ered the level of all other wells in the
neighborhood, which, in their opinion,
proved that the wells were connected
underground. Cross-examination was
directed in the main to a determina
tion of the character of the strata
through which the wells were bored.

Ability to Withstand the
Ravages of the Disease
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, March B.â Russell Sage
is seriously ill at his home on Fifth
avenue, suffering from pneumonia
brought on by an attack of grip. His
relatives and friends are greatly
alarmed, as there are grave doubts of
his ability to withstand the ravages of
disease at his age. Dr. Munn spent to
day at Sage's bedside and to-night
said:
"I do not look for a crisis in the pa
tient's case at once. If he were a
younger man the symptoms would not
be alarming. He was taken down with
the grip five days ago and this has de
veloped Into a touch of pneumonia,
which, of course, is grave in any case.
A man of Mr. Sage's great age has not
the resisting power of a younger per
son. However, he has a strong con
stitution and his condition Is by no
means hopeless."

OBJECTS TO BILL FOR
GRADING SAN BRVNO ROAD
Protestant Alleges Fewer Ix>ads of
Macadam Were Furnished Than
Charged For.
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday heard the protest of George
H. Roundy against the payment of a
bill of $412 30 presented by McHugh
& Sheerin for spreading macadam on
San Bruno avenue. The bill called for
217 loads of macadam, and Roundy
alleges that only eighty loads were
furnished. The demand was referred
to the Finance Committee for investi
gation. /
The complaint of the Central Park
Association of the bad condition of the
north side of Duboce avenue, which is
obstructed by falling rocks that are
dangerous to passers-by, was refe.%.ed
to the Board of Works. .
The committee reported in favor
of dedicating the block on Baker
street, between Golden Gate avenue
and Turk street, as a boulevard.
The committee recommended the
construction of a sewer in Mission
street from Onondaga to Porter ave
nu?, the cost to be defrayed out of the
sale of sewer bonds. This will permit
of the paving of the street, for which
$80,000 has been appropriated, here

specifications for street work to be
filed before authorizing the improve
ment.
The petition of Rosenberg Brothers
for a spur track permit on Japan

Park, Succumbs.
Michael Meagles, who had for the
past thirty-three years been employed
as a carpenter at Golden Gate Park,
died early yesterday morning at his
home, 2590 Post street, from heart trou
ble. Mr. Meagies had been ill but a few
days and his death was unexpected. A

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, MARCH 9. 1905.
Can Be Observed
With a Small
Telescope.
Seen on Eastern
LimD of the
Great Orb.
EDWARD IRVING
AUTHOR OF "HOW TO KNOW THE
STARRY HEAVENS."
For some little time past there has
been an unusually fine assortment of
dark spots drifting across the visible
surface of our sun, as It slowly rotates
on its axis. Those who have been re
cently watching the sun with their
telescopes have been rewarded by an
ever shifting panorama of sunspots, as
one group after another came into
sight on the left or eastern limb, pass
ed in review across the disk and disap
peared around the western edge.
Judging by previous experience, the
present sunspot epidemic will not last
very much longer. The freckled face
<if the orb of day is liable at any time
to change into a spotless disk of al
most uniform brightness.
It will be well, therefore, for all who
are interested in the welfare of the
giant globe whose radiant energy
keeps our world alive, to give an oc
casional glance in its direction with
any suitable instrument that may be
at hand. Even a small telescope pro
vided with a dark glass will give in
teresting views of the drifting sun
spots.
Most of the spots are in irregular
groups or clusters, the individual spots
breaking out. enlarging, and merging
into one another; or splitting up and
growing smaller, until they finally
close over and disappear.
The dark spots in each group are all
surrounded and connected by a less
dark shading which is known as the
penumbra. There are also brilliant
white clouds or faculoe scattered about
in the neighborhood of the dark sun
spots.
It takes the sun about twenty-five
days to turn completely round on its
axis. The earth goes round the\ sun
in the same direction, so that If the
periods were equal, the spots and
groups of spots would appear to go
through their various maneuvers
without changing their places to any
great extent on the sun's disk. But
as a matter of fact we take a whole
year to go around the sun, while it
rotates on its axis in about twenty
five days. Each group of spots, there
fore. If it lasts for any length of time,
come* more or less opposite our earth
every twenty-seven days, or there
about.
The visible part of the sun, on which
these sunspots occasionally make their
appearance, is a spherical mass of
luminous clouds, enveloping the entire
body of the sun and hiding its dense
and superheated gases from our sight.
From the intense heat andllght thrown
out by this cloud-sphere it may readily
be inferred that its clouds do not con-
Fist of condensed water-gas, like the
clouds which sometimes fill our earthly
skies. They consist of similar con
densations of the dense metallic gases
which constitute the main body of the
sun beneath them. What we see of the
sun is therefore a layer of clouds com
posed of small liquid drops of the un
combined chemical elements, both me
tallic and non-metallic. These drops
have been condensed, by their exposure
to the cold of outer space, from the
hot elementary gases of which the sun
is composed.
METALLIC CLOUDS.
From the globular shape and intense
brilliancy of this enveloping layer of
metallic clouds, it is known to astron
omers as the solar photosphere or
light-globe. It is this photosphere that
we refer to when we lay that we can
see the sun.
The sunspot freckels, which occasion
ally disfigure the surface of this visible
photosphere, make their appearance
somewhat periodically, their maximum
of frequency being about every eleven
years. They are confined almost en
tirely to a broad belt on each side of
the solar equator. These two sunspot
zones correspond fairly well with the
earthly zones which we term the Tropic
of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.
Sunspots appear to be due to violent
and sometimes cyclonic uprushes of in
visible superheated gas from the in
tensely hot interior of the sun. They
temporarily force back the clouds com
posing the photosphere and cause them
to pile one on the other in eruptive
looking cloud banks. As the ascending
gases are less luminous than the photo
spheric clouds around them, they as
sume the appearance of dark patches
or blotches surrounded by lighter shad
ings, with the bright photospheric
cloud banks outside.
The bright sphere which we call the
sun is about 864,000 miles across. A
duster of sunpputs is orten 59,000 to
1 "30,000 miles long and wide. Single
spots are sometimes 50,000 miles across,
with a dark central nucleus 30,000 miles
wide. Thus a spot as large as our
world wDuld be too small to attract
much attention, when seen from the
earth, 93,000,000 miles away.
SunsDOts are intimately connected
with the earthly phenomena known as
the aurora borealis, or northern lights.
Also with what are called magnetic
storms, affecting our electric lighting,
telegraph, cable and telephone systems.
The invisible torrent of finely divided
matter which is continually ejected
from a stanspot appears to be strongly
charged with electricity. Its particles
are so extremely small that the pres
sure of light from the sun overpowers
the the solar gravitation and prevents
them from falling back to the sun
when the original impetus is exhaust
ed. They therefore keep on ascending
until they finally leave the solar sys
tem behind.
If ihe sun did not rotate this finely
divided material would shoot straight
out into space like a huge fountain or
jet of steam. But owing to the solar
rotation it is bent back into a spiral
form, like that of a watch spring or of
a Catherine wheel.
INVISIBLE SPIRAL.
This invisible spiral of electrically
charged matter is continually enlarg
ing. When any part of it strikes the
earth it produces the various electrical
phenomena already mentioned. Our
"magnetic storms" generally arrive
about twenty-six hours after a sun
spot has come opposite the earth, and
similar magnetic disturbances are lia
ble to occur subsequently at intervals
of about twenty-seven days until the
outrush of electrically charged mate
rial has ceased. This is often long after
rhf sunspot from which it was ejected
has dwindled away and died out tele
scopically.
These intervals of about twenty

Concern to Their Sorrow
Ececial Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March B.â More than
a score of women, some of them of con
siderable prominence, are mourning
the disappearance of a dapper young
fellow who was known here as J. S.
Smith, and who during the past three
weeks cleaned up nearly $3000 by vic
timizing people in a ' get-rich-auick
game. Nearly all of his victims are
women.
Smith played no favorites and as a
diversion made love to Miss Carrie Car
ter and was soon engaged to marry
her. She learned of his business enter
prise and desiring to profit thereby
gave him $900 to invest for her. telling
him that the profits would be sufficient
for them to furnish their prospective
home. He took the money, but the
profits have not been forthcoming.
His game was very simple. He ad
vertised that he would pay 10 per cent'
a month interest on investments for
more than $100, and stated that his plan
could not be beaten. He invited corre
spondence or personal investigation. ]
When a victim called upon him he rep
resented that he had- an infallible sys
tem of beating the races, and in order
to convince a victim he would offer to
place a small bet. This invariably
won and resulted in a larger invest
ment next time. Having gained the
confidence of his victims it was easy
for him to get what money the victim
had. Fpr a month he paid the 10 per
cent dividend, using a portion of the
capital intrusted to him, but when his
bank roll approached thtÂ» $3000 mark he
departed. It is supposed he went to
San Francisco, and the authorities
there have been requested to look out
for him.
WIFE WINS COUNTER SUIT
FOR DIVORCE FROM HUSBAND
Hnrry Carpentar, Charjriner Desertion,
Is Sued by Spouse for Cruelty
and Loses.
The tables were reversed on Harry
Carpentar yesterday in Judge Gra
ham's court, when after praying for
a divorce from his wife, Fredda Car
pentar, on the ground of desertion,
she was given a divorce from fcim on
the ground of cruelty and penurious
ness. The couple have a child.
In the cross-complaint upon which
Mrs. Carpentar obtained her divorce
she told of the cruelty of her husband '<
and showed marks upon her wrist and
arms where, she said, he had grasped
her. When asked by Judge Graham if
ho gave her money, she said he had,
adding that the amounts never exceed
ed 10 cents.
Judge Graham also granted a di
ve rce to E. W. Dixon from her hus
band, George A. Dixon, on the ground j
oi cruelty.
Several suits for divorce were filed
yesterday in the County Clerk's office.
Emma Vialard asks for a divorce
from her husband, Albert Vialard, on
the ground of cruelty. She says he
twisted her arms, beat and kicked her
when she was weak after undergoing a
capital operation. She asks for a re
straining order to prevent his dispos
ing of his savings,

COUNSEL FOR PROPONENTS
REST IN YOELL CASE
Testimony in Rebuttal Will Be
Brought by Contestants and Suit
Will Soon Be Argued.
The testimony for the proponents in
the Yoell will contest, which has been
up for hearing in Judge Kerrigan's
court for several weeks, is finally in
and the counsel for the contestants
spent all day yesterday in rebutting
previous testimony.
But one witness, Samuel G. Buck
bee, was called to the stand, but the
point needing his testimony was finally
argued between counsel without the
witness testifying. To-day the attor
neys will argue on the insolvency fea
ture of the case and several warm de
bates betwen counsel are anticipated.
The depositions filed in the case are
those of Edward J. McLaughlln, a
banker of Santa Clara, and Samuel G.
Tompkins, an attorney of San Jose.
Tompkins told in his deposition of the
visit made by Mrs. Yoell while en
deavoring to secure a loan on a deed
to valuable property that she said
Yoell had given her. The loan was re
fused when Mrs. Yoell would not per
mit the deed to be recorded.
Passes a Fictitious Check.
William J. Boradori of Frank B.
Peterson & Co., wholesale grocers, 52
California street, obtained a warrant
from Police Judge Conlan yesterday
for the arrest of "John Doe" on a
charge of uttering and passing a
fictitious check. On March 4 a man
representing himself as J. D. Sunol
called at the firm's office to pay an
account of $22. He gave a check for
$42 on the Anglo-Calif ornian Bank
purporting to be signed by J. Nathan
& Co., and received the balance of
$20. The man was not Sunol and the
check was worthless. Detective
Whitaker is searching for "John
Doe.'
Asks Court to Dismiss Action.
J. A. Drinkhouse & Co. in answer to
the complaint of the Blackwell's Dur
ham Tobacco Company claims that the
action against it should be dismissed
on the ground that the Durham Com
pany, which is a corporation, has fail
ed to file the necessary certificate of
incorporation with the Secretary of
State and asked that the action be dis
missed.
seven days are. of course, due to the
fact that it takes the sun that length
of time to rotate sufficiently to bring
the sunspots once more opposite to the
earth.
The periodic succession of magnetic
storms and the exact nature of their
connection with sunspots are qufte re
cent discoveries made by E. Walter
Maunder of Greenwich Observatory,
England. They throw light on a num
ber of what were previously inexplica
ble phenomena.

FIND WIDOW'S
GOLDEN HOARD
Police FnooTer Treasure, the
Secret of Which Drives an
Aged Woman Into Madness
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 8.
Brooding over a hoard of gold that
she had hidden in all sorts of out-of
the-way places in her humble home, the
secret of which was known only to her
self, has driven Mrs. Catnerine Meyers,
a widow, residing at 663 Eaat Sixteenth
street, insane. Two years ago her hus
band, Robert Meyers, a wine expert,
employed by the W. M. Watson Com
pany, died. Since his death Mrs.
Meyers has lived alone and in se
clusion, keeping vigil OTer the little
fortune that represented the savings
from many years of toll.
Buried in cans and boxes, eewed into
dress linings, covered under shelf
cloths and concealed in every room in
the little cottage, the police this after
noon brought to light the hidden treas
ure, when they were summoned to re
move the demented woman to the Re
reiving Hospital. Nearly $3000 in coin
and jewelry was recovered by Patrol
man James Walters, who took the un
fortunate woman into custody. The
hoard was counted in the presence of
Captain of Police Wilson at police
headquarters and it netted $2015 in gold
coin, $11 in silver, besides watches and
other jewelry, roughly estimated to be
worth $800.
Mrs. Meyers' peculiar actions at the
house aroused the patrolman's sus
picions. She was induced to give an
inkling as to any personal effects she
might possess that they might be taken
in charge until the proper persons
should claim them in Mrs. Meyers' be
half. The search followed. The patient
is Fixty years old. Of late she had
been acting strangely and neighbors
to-day called the authorities. She will
be examined to-morrow by the Lunacy
Commissioners.
SOCIETY MAKES
PLEA FOR AN
ART GALLERY
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND, March 8. â "Why doesn't Oak
land have a permanent art gallery?" Is the
question asked dozens of times every day of
the prorressive women of the Starr King- Art
Fund, who are conducting the exhibit at Maple
Hall. And they rejoice at every repetition of
the lotion, for it chows the trend of the
popular feeling, and public demand is always
sooner or later satisfied.
The art exhibit has been well attended and
ihe merit* of the display are more apparent at
â if it. Oaklandera would have been bet
ter ratisfied, perhapy. if the committee had
abided br Kb decision to limit each artist to
five exhibits. There Is always a possibility of
having too much of a good thing.
Mies de Xeale .- -Morgan and lMss Annie
France* Brig&B, both Oakland artists have
Borne canvases on exhibition of real merit the
misty view of Halfmoon Bay being the best I
have seen of Miss Brltes' work. Oscar
Kunath has. two fine figure pieces and John
M. Gamble has several clever landscapes. Gor
don Coutts. Harry Seawell and Willis Davis
seem to divide popular favor, after one has
eliminated Keith. There la only . one .Keith
and. wise that ha Is, he sent us only one
canvas, to make us lone for more.
Art with a bis: A has for decades looked
with contempt on mere photography, but since
the camera has fallen' lnto such skillful hands
as Mrs. Brifnnar.'s and Mrs. Aimer's one
muM hesitate â  before drawing the line too
tightly. Nothing surely could be more artisti
cally l>eautiful than the "Madonna of. the
Peach Tree," by Mrs. Brirfman, or than the
wonderful suggestion of Dante in "The
Laurels," by Laura Adams Aimer. The Ma
donra was suggested by Maurice Hewlltfs
story of that name In his little- "Stories of
Italy," and is perfect In post and detail.
The "Monterey Cypresses." by W. -E. Mil
wain, is also a fine bit of work, "though not on

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 9. 1905
WATCH GRILL
OF DECEIVER
Widows to Whom Bunko
Man Made Proposals of
Marriage Sit at His Trial
GATE HIM THEIR MONEY
William Proctor Steadfastly
Denies That He Ever
Whispered Words of Love
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 8.
With two eld women who charge
him with having bunkoed them out of
money and jewels as interested spec
tators at his trial to-day on a charge
of having stolen $108 in cash and two
diamond rings from Mrs. Emily Tyson
of Niles, William Proctor this after
noon gave out to the world his story
of a mock proposal of marriage he
made to Mrs. Tyson, a woman nearly
old enough to be hia mother.
There was little gallantry in the de
nial made by Proctor. He denied that
he ever spoke a word of love or mar
riage to Mrs. Tyson, but said that she
gave him the rings to have reset as
she said her sens got drunk and she
was afraid she might not get them
back; the money he said she lent him
to help him put a patent oil burner
on the market. According to the stDry
of the old lady, these were a pledge
of her confidence in him.
Beside Mrs. Tyson sat Mrs. Hannah
Flemming, formerly of Santa Rosa.
but now living In San Francisco. She
accuses Proctor of having swindled
her out of $2000 in the same manner,
and while she made no effort to have
him prosecuted, bearing her loss in
silence, she traveled across the bay to
day and introduced herself to Mrs.
Tyson and told her the story. The
two watched with interest the strug
gling of the victim finally In the grasp
of the law.
The sons of Mrs. Tyson, big burly
men, were also in the courtroom, and
Benjamin stated from the witness
stand to-day that he said to Proctor,
"I will shoot the man that niarries my
mother." The Tysons are a well known
family and their broad acres are worth
over $100,000. Ju%t outside the court
room, with tw r o little children, sits
Proctor's real wife, waiting for the
trial to end.

COLLEGE MEN
CAST BALLOTS
University Students Decide
to Have Committee for
Self Governing Purposes
INTRODUCE NOVELTY
Discipline Now to Be Ad
ministered Through Me
dium of Undergraduates
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street. March 8.
After months of discussion, in which
the student body of the university has
argued the merits of the proposed plan
to form a students' affairs committee,
made up of students, which committee
would practically rule the student
body in cases where discipline is re-
Quired, a vote was taken to-day on the
I proposal and it was approved by the
(students.
Voting was in progress throughout
the day at the university from 9 until
4 o clock. . Besides the plan to organ
ize a students' affairs committee, the
varsity men and women voted on an
honor system," which, however,
failed to receive their approval.
The vote on the students' affairs
proposition was: For, 248; against, 45-;
on the "honor system," for, 132;
against, 162. .
The organization of the new com
mittee is due in part to the strained
relations that followed the seniors'
famous collision with Captain Nance
last term. .Complaint was general then
that various students were unjustly
treated by the faculty students' affairs
committee, this being due, it was said,
to the failure of the faculty men to
get the students' point of view in the
matter.
It is proposed now to have the stu
dents' committee co-operate with the
faculty committee of the same title.
T*ie students' committee is to be made
up of three seniors, to be appointed by
the president of the Associated Stu
dents, the president nlso to be a mem
ber of the committee.
President* of all the classes are to
be members ex-offlcio, to act in mat
ters that concern members of their re
spective classes. The president of the
graduate students is also to be an ex
officio member of the committee.
The committee ia empowered to
either take independent action in cases
where undergraduate discipline is called
for or to refer the question to the fac
ulty committee on students' affairs.
The committee "assumes equally with
the faculty committee the responsibil
ity of preserving discipline."
The so-called "honor system" fea
ture, which was not approved by the
students to-day, requires every stu
dent to sign a statement at the end of
each examination paper in this form:
"I give my word that during this ex
amination I have neither given nor re
ceived help." Four years ago the j
honor system was presented to uni- j
versity students for their approval and j
v.as then voted down by a decisive
majority.

MOTT STANDS
FOR PROGRESS
Tells Seventh Warders What
They May Expect if He Is
Elected Mayor of Oakland
TALKS ON LOCAL NEEDS
Favors Fostering Legislation
to Improve the East Side
Water Frontage Facilities
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 8.
Seventh Ward voters heard Frank K.
Mott to-night in a speech at Cameron
Hall, Thirteenth avenue and East
Sixteenth street, during .which he as
serted his position touching his candi
dacy for Mayor. Speeches were also
made by Fred C. Turner, A. P. Leach.
C. D. Bates Jr., Arthur H. Breed and
other candidates. In the course of a
strong address Mr. Mott said:
I have always been an advocate of public
Improvements. In every sense they are es
sential to the well being and growth of a
city. Oakland Is no exception. Our city needs
good streets, and I shall make It my first
business as Mayor to find a way to get
greater appropriations for that department.
The co-operation of our friends in the Sev
enth Ward Is needed just aa much as In any
other ward In the city. You can all help the
administration by your own attention to the
local requirements. I repeat to you that
as Mayor I shall be glad to receive sugges
tions at all times touching your needs in this
district of the city. If you do not already
know my position with relation to the tax
rate. I can only tell you what I have said
throughout the campaign, that the charter
limits the rate to one dollar for maintenance
of the municipal government. I stand on that
law of the municipality.
I come here to tell you that I believe In
honesty and efficiency In municipal affairs as
I believe in them for the conduct of private
affairs. Honesty without efficiency will not
accomplish much. ThÂ« combination Is Invinci
ble. I believe such a union of elements will
occur under the administration commencing
April I, when I hope to take the Mayor's
chair.
The Seventh Ward has a peculiar Interest
in the development of shipping facilities, for
along the ward's southern boundaries are
thousands of feet of water frontage which Is
beginning to teem with large factories and
commercial enterprises. To the development
'if the harbor, and to give outlet for products
by water communication, I am committed.
The Bast Oakland basin should bÂ« improved
so that shipping may land at the wharves
which must be built for commercial uses. The
time is near when another transcontinental
railroad will be operating through the lower
portion of the Seventh Ward. We must ace
to It that the benefits to be derived are shared
her<Â« as wpII as In other districts of the city.
When the municipality granted It* franchise
to the Western Pacific Railroad It did so be
cause of the returning benefits It hopes to ob
tain from the entrance of another great rail
road system. If it shall come while I am
Mayor of Oakland I shall give my Influence
toward that end. And that assurance is given
in no demagogic way. I have repeatedly said
that I would make no ante-election promises.
And I still stand to that declaration.
The people have the right to know that I
believe In fair dealing for all men. and they
have the right to know that I shall exert all
of my efforts Â«o Insure a government that
shall maintain the principles of Justice. But
In all fairness to the people I cannot stand
here and make pledges and promises that
might cover every incident connected with
the handling of public affairs. I have pur
posely abstained from that sort of thing
throughout my canvass of the city. I do not
want it said that I have done anything or
declared anything that could be construed
as mere vote-getting" buncombe. My position
in the Seventh Ward on that score is ex
actly wha< it has been in every other ward
in the city.
The Republicans will close the muni
cipal campaign Friday night with a
mass-meeting at the Dewey Theater.
Samuel M. Shortridge of San Fran
cisco will be among the speakers.

Mrs. Frances Feriera Seeks
Arrest of Those Who Dis
turbed Marriage Ceremony
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 8.
A crowd of young men and boys,
nearly all of whom wore black mask*,
last night bombarded the home of Mrs.
Frances Feriera on Twenty-third
avlnue with stones and tin cans, and
so serious was the damage done to the
rouse that Mrs. Feriera complained
to the police this morning, and asked
that the offenders be arrested.
The occasion of the disturbance was
the wedding of Miss I>aura Feriera
and Manuel Carver. Mrs. Feriera al
leges that hardly had the ceremony
been performed when a crowd of young
men and boys, all wearing masks,
came to the door and demanded re
freshments. On being refused the
crowd began to pelt the house with
stones and tin cans, and only when
Mrs. Feriera started in search of an
officer did the bombardment cease.
Airs. Feriera said to-day that the
fronr door of her home, at which most
of the misilea of the crowd were aimed,
was so badly shattered that she will
have to put ih a new one. She was un
able, however, to give the names of
those who participated in the dis
turbance and was unable to secure
warrants to-day. She says that she
will not allow the matter to drop, but
will investigate and learn the identity
of the leaders of the crowd, and will
then see that they are punished.

OUSTED MANAGER SECURES
CONTROL OF THE COMPANY
A. C. Denman Jr. in Position to Dic
tate to San Bernardino
Concern.
SAN BERNARDINO, March B.â A
sensation was sprung at a special meet
ing of the board of directors of the
San Bernardino Valley Traction Com
pany held this afternoon, when it be
came evident that A. C. Denman Jr.
had acquired a majority of the stock
and was in position to dictate his terras
to the Fishers.
A couple of months ago trouble arose
in the management of the road and
President Henry Fisher succeeded in
ousting Denman. who was then general
manager of the company, the place
being given to John Fisher, son of the
president. Denman left for the East.
He returned a few days ago, but had
nothing to say and the disclosure at
to-day's meeting was a revelation, it
being found that Denman had pur
chased most of the stock, wiping out
several of the smaller stockholders and
securing 1000 shares from Fisher's own
broker. Horace Slater of Redlands.
The next meeting of the board will
take place on Tuesday, when Den
man will be at liberty to elect himself
president and general manager, ousting
both of the Fishers. While Denman
denies it, it is asserted by those in a
position to know that the money which
enabled him to work with was ad
vanced to him by Huntington and that
the transaction will have an important
bearing on electric railway building
operations in this section.

The days nf humiliation, prayer and

"VVedne?- <-.::>.. ::>. Places of worship were
fllied and the faithful with contrite
hearts cast aside all things eartffly
and cevuted hours to all that is spirit
ual. Sermons were listened to with
rapt attention. It was a day of prayer,
a day to be followed by others of equal
rt through the Lenten season.
One- of the most remarkable of the
first of vhe Lenten devotions was the
noonday service for business men held
by the Right Rev. Bishop William
Ford Nichols at the Chamber of Com

Punctually at noon professional men,
lams, bankers, clerks and mc

Bishop Nichols was seated In the
hair which at other times is occu

tion of material things, and on the
which usually bears volumes c-f

David Evans, rector of Grace

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Pnsj People Know How Useful It Is
In Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knowg that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
tew realize its value when taken into
uman system for the same cieans-
jjurpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better, it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
pases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
emoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effVotuÃlly clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
t*tth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases whith
collect In the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poisoa of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the best
>al and the must for the money
if in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
' omposed of the flnest powdered
Willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics In tablet form or rather in
The form of large, pleasant tasting
lozengers. the charcoal being mixed
with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
poor tell In a much improved condition
â  <- general health, better complex-
pweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it is. that no pos-
piMe harm can result from their con-
i upe, but on the contrary, great
benefit.
A P.uffalo physician in speaking of
the f charcoal, says: "I ad-
lart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
t.\* suffering from gag in stomach
and >-"wels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and j
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box
nt drug stores, and although in some
*ense a patent preparation, yet I be-
H*>ve I get more and better charcoal in
Ftiiarfe Charcoal Lozenges than in any
of*the ordinary charcoal tablets."

EJECTED FROM HOTEL
R. \V. Francis of Chicago, After a
\olsy Scene, Is Put Out of the
FHeosTs Life.
There was a lively scene at the St.
Francis Hotel last evening that ended
in R. W. Francis, a recent arrival
irom Chicago, being ejected from the
hostelry after a rough bout with As
sistant Manager Wills. Francis' con
duct, it is claimed, became objection
able to the management of the hotel
and when Wills no Informed Francis
the latter became noisy and abusive.
Hot words led to a fight between the
two, whereupon House Detective

and. getting, a firm clutch on the slack
portions of the excited guests cloth
ing, rushed him out of the hotel.

BLESSING THE ASHES
The morning service at Grace Church,

periods for stillness and repose in the

mill's. -..;â¢Â«.-. j
Such times of repose- and t quiet were
needed in worldly matters, needed, he
said, for the man of letters, for the
physician, for the statesman and for
the business man. ,
This being so he asked how much
more is such rest essential in things
pertaining to man's spiritual nature
and his relation to God.

of Grace Church, assisted in the ser

There were services at all the Episco- '

CIRCUS CONTINUES TO
DRAW LARGE CROWDS
Xorris & Rowe Shows Have Record
of Forty- Eight Thousand Paid
Admissions to Date.
With last night's performance the
Norris and Rowe Circus at Mechanics' i
Pavilion has a record of forty-eight
thousand paid admissions to the shows. ;
This is a greatly increased attendance
over that of last season. That the circus
features are interesting a large portion j
of the public of this city is evident by ;
the attendance and the excellent advance '
sale for the balance of the week. The j
exhibition is going very smoothly now I
and is given within two hours, which is
long enough for any one. It is the first
time San Francisco audiences have had
cause for complaint on the score of too
i much show for the money. Norris and
! Rowe advertised a greater circus and
they determined to give the public all
they claimed in advance. The graceful
j bareback riding of Miss Rose Dockrill
! has never been excelled in this city, and
! never will be, for it is utterly impossible
to accomplish any more feats with the
horse, ride better, make a better appear
ance or secure better trained ring stock
than Miss Dockrill has. George Holland
accomplishes somersaults on a horse's
back while the beast is in rapid motion,
I rides upon the neck of the horse while
galloping around the ring at full speed,
rides backward, forward; drives two
horses while standing and carrying Miss j
Dockrill; Frank and Dolly Miller are an- j
other duo of capable bareback riders and
accomplish many dashing and daring i
feats. Austin King does a high school !
menage ring act, makes his horses cake- \
walk. Spanish trot, high jumping and
hurdle leaps. The display of expert i
horsemanship Is an innovation with this :
circus and is proving decidedly success- I

SUSPENSION OF BAEHR
WOULD BE USELESS
Such Is the Decision of Mayor
Schmitz, "Who May Sne the
Auditor.
Mayor Sehmltz yesterday consid
ered the advisability of beginning le
gal proceedings against Auditor Baehr
to compel that official to reimburse
the city for moneys paid on audited
demands for Grand Jury expenses.
This course the Mayor thought would
be wiser than to suspend Baehr, as
he had threatened to do, in view of the
fact that the Mayor did not hope to
have the suspension ratified by a vote
of fourteen members of the Board of
Supervisors as the charter requires to
make the suspension effective.
Karlier in the day the Mayor ex
pressed his intention to frame a letter
notifying the Board of Supervisors
that he had suspended Baehr and ap
pointed his chief deputy, William J.
Wilkinson, to act as Auditor pending
action on tho suspension by the board
named, which he was to call in spe
cial session for this afternoon. At 5
o'clock the Mayor gave out a state
ment that he had decided to modify
his threat of suspension, and for that
purpose he called into consultation
Abe Ruef. his legal adviser. Super
visors Rea and Gallagher. The Mayor
remarked that it would be useless
to suspend Baehr, knowing that the
Supervisors would override his action.

HARDWARE MEN
IN CONVENTION
Retailers of State Confer
in Annual Session About
Interest of the Trade
ORGANIZATION IS URGED
Means Devised to Enlist
All Dealers Who Are Xot
Enrolled Yet as Members
The members of the California State
Retail Hardware Dealers' Association
met in annual convention at the St.
Francis Hotel yesterday. About 200
delegates were present, representing
the various district associations of the
ytate. The district bodies are the San
Jcaquin Valley, Central, Southern,
San Francisco, Alameda County, North
Coast and Humboldt associations, each
of which is represented by two mem
bers in the executive committee. The
convention will last three days. To
day the real business will be taken up.
To-night a theater party will be made
v] for the Orpheum and there will be
net less than 800 hardware men in at
tendance. To-morrow evening the an
nual banquet will take place at Golden
Gate Hall.
The proceedings of the opening day
were marked by a long and earnest
discussion of the trade attitude of
wholesalers, manufacturers and agents,
representing the coast and. also the
East, in relation to parties who are not
regular hardware men, but who, sell
ing refrigerators, hose, stoves, tinware,
etc., as side lines, are given as low
prices by the wholesalers and manu
facturers as the regular retail hard
ware men secure. Some resolutions
adopted by the Southern California
retail hardware dealers were read and
several delegates spoke on this very
interesting trade topic.
Oscar F. Sites, the president of the
association, is in the East. An annual
report written by Sites was read by
Vice President Gunman, who presidad.
An interesting address, marking the
progress of the association, submitted
by Secretary Henry Gracey, was also
read.
President Sites advocates thorough
organization of the retail hardware
trade in California. It was de
cided to have a State organizer,
v.-ho will during the coming
yrar visit every house and indi
vidual in California that sells hard
ware in this State at retail. The path
way of this organizer was paved by a
vote to hereafter admit to membership
In the State association any reputable
individual In the State who retails
hardware. Heretofore the member
ship of the State association has been
drawn exclusively from the ranks of
the district associations. There are
localities that are isolated where it is
not practicable for local dealers to
take part in the district association
proceedings. The new move includes
all these.
A report was received from the ex
ecutive committee, which waa fully
discussed. Secretary Gracey reported
that during the past year it had not
been necessary to call the entire execu
tive committee together to consider a
grievance, which was unprecedented.
To-day the reports of sub-committees
v.hlch have interviewed the whole
salers and Jobers will be heard.
TRIAL OF WITTMAN
STILL IN PROGRESS
Prosecution Will Conclude the Taking
of Its" Testimony at the Session
This Evening.
Little of importance transpired at
the trial of Chief of Police Wittman
before the Police Commissioners last
evening. The case for the prosecution
will be concluded this evening and on
Friday evening the defense will pro
ceed. The only excitement was when
Chin Fay, a Chinese gambler and
member of the notorious Chinese Ed
ucational Society, refused to produce
his certificate and Attorney Kahn in
sisted that he be taken into custody
and brought before the United States
Marshal. The Commissioners refused
to grant his request, but Kahn says he
will have the witness arrested to-day.
Chin Fay and Lee Sing, both own
ers of clubs, testified that gambling
was going on during the month of
November and Fay said that when he
paid blood money to the "eight states
men" the raiding of his place ceased.
Dr. Rupert Blue, who is connected
with the Federal Board of Health, ;
could not swear positively that gam
bling was ever conducted in the dis
trict. Sergeant of Police Cook,
who has been successful since
the first of December in suppressing
gambling, asked to be relieved
from duty on account of â¢verwork
and ill health. The matter was post
poned for one week and Cook was told
that he would be given one month's I
vacation with pay.

TO DEMOCRAT
President Is to Appoint

trict Attorney in Georgia
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, March B.â Another
shock is to be given the regular party
men in the Senate and another Demo
crat is to draw a prize from President
Roosevelt. The President has an
nounced his intention to appoint for
mer Representative Carter Tate of
Georgia United States District Attor
ney for the Northern District of that
State. He is to succeed E. A. Angler,
a Republican, who has held the office
for eight years.
Tate has been a lifelong Democrat,
has served twelve years in Congress,
and was beaten for a renomination by
his brother-in-law. He supported
Bryan in 1895 and 1900 and Judge Par
ker In 1904.
Mr. Roosevelt boldly declared at a
dinner party when he complimented
Senator Cockrell (Democrat of Mis
souri), whom he afterward appointed
a member of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, that he would hereafter
not be bound by party ties.
His uncle. Robert B. Roosevelt, in a
recent interview, hinted that "Theo
dore might accept another nomination,
if tendered him by the people." This
also is considered most significant.

COWBOYS VISIT
WHITE HOUSE
Seth Bullock's Range Men
Tendered a Reception
by President Roosevelt
Special Dlupatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, March B.â Captain
Seth Bullock"s cowpunchers to-night
wound up their "ride on this range" by
going to the White House in a body,
by special Invitation, and visiting for
an hour in western style. In the party
were: Bud Driscoll, Ed Cessna, Ed
Leppla and Jesse Driscoll, who owned
ranches along the Little Missouri ad-
Joining that of Mr. Roosevelt, when he
was raising cattle near Medora, N. D.,
in 1883 and 1884. It was hard to tell
whether the President or the cowboys
derived the most pleasure from the
visit.
The reception to-night resulted from
the presentation to young Theodore
Roosevelt by the cowpunchers of one
of their flnest horses and a complete
riding outfit, consisting of saddle,
bridle, chaps and slicker. While Theo
dore was with the cowboys at the ball
park yesterday afternoon he took a
fancy to a gray horse belonging to
George Fuller of Deadwood. When the
cowpunchers heard of It they "chipped
in" and bought the horse and outfit and
gave them to the boy after the show
at the ball grounds to-day. Captain
Bullock made the presentation speech.
Said he:
Ted: I take great pleasure in presenting to
you. on behalf of the cowboys, this outfit, aa a
slight expression of the great regard we enter
tain for your father and the affection we have
for you. We highly appreciate our reception
at the White House, and are deeply mindful
of the honor paid ua. Our trip to this distant
range has bean a delightful experience, ever
to be remembered with gratitude and pride.
We sincerely hope you will take the same
pleasure In the ownership of the outfit that we
do in presenting it.
In commenting to-day on the In
augural ball, at which they were
guests, some of the cowpunchers ex
pressed surprise regarding the dresses
worn by the society women. As one of
them expressed It, the correct garb for
social functions appeared to consist of
nothing but a "lariat and a saddle
blanket."

MORMON FINANCE.
A MORMON friend of- fifty-three years' experience .;in* that
church criticises, by way "of .'queries; our remirks on Senator
Kearns* speech. V\ c are unable to say. except by the indica
tions, wliai use the church tithes are made to serve. To become n
proprietor and engage in the large. number of secular occupations in
which the church is engaged requires enormous- capital, and we
know of no other source from which to derive the money than the
tithes and the income of the secular business of the church. As to the
equipment of the church buildings, its temples and other houses of
worship, nd the support of its religious, ministrations, all that should
be easily possible when every year it takes one-tenth of all its people
have, as a religious tithe.
Our friend intimates that seme of this is spent for the support
of those who cannot take care of themselves. This is no doubt true,
and it is praiseworthy. The only difference between the Mormon
and other churches in that respect is, that others rely on the vol
untary* contributions of their people, and have not the power to
compel a tithe of one-tenth. Again, if all other churches owned
mines, mills, smelters, salt works, street railroads, sugar factories.
dry goods and grocery stores, banks, drug stores, and other secular
properties, and took their profits to be turned into the xhurch treas
ury, it is easy to see that they would all be in funds and have more
than enough money, without being compelled to pass the hat. ;
But does any one think that such a condition is desirable"- Is it
well for the people and for the civil state that churches should en
gage in secular business? Is it the ideal social or religious condition
that the revenues of secular business should go into the treasury of
any church? Our friend asks. "If the Mormons' are satisfied with
their manner of financing, making all contribute, whose business is it
to meddle?"
If the heavy tithe is paid and used for religious purposes, to
p temples and churches, and to administer the chanties of the'
rch. and the members are willing t<> pay that annual tax for
'hat purpose, it is not the business of any ">nr to meddle. Certainly
â¢hf uld not. and there is no power less than sovereignty that
can. It should be understood that no "tic desires to interfere with
I a form of the rciigious idea, so long as it i- free of
rices, like polygamy. that revoit civilization. In such respects
â¢monism may be subject only to the antagonism which always
eeti the adherents of the many forms in which the re
!i? idea if held among men.
Mormon proselyters are busy among the (ientiles. and Gentile
-eiyter^ are bus) among the Mormons. This is a normal condi-.
. with which no one has a right to quarrel. If the Mormons can
be converts it i< not the 1 of the state to interfere, [f-the
1 lentile missionaries can convert Mormons the state cannot be used
persecute the apostates. Within the proper and legal limitations
- religious organization the Mormon church has equality of rights.
and there may be much in its church polity that can be profitably
ied by other religious organizations. But all this has nothing
o with the secularities of that church. If its vast tithes are used
bing the secular business of Utah, and so monopolizing it
â  a < ientile is practically denied the right to live in that State, and
â¢ Ã¼blic schools are perverted to the uses of the church and
teach Mormonism. then the State has not a republican form
rnmeit under our constitutional interpretation, and Congress
the obligation, put upon it by the constitution, to guarantee tD
State a republican form of government.
We have no doubt that a theocracy in Utah is entirely satisfac
rhe Mormons themselves. They are willing to submit to the
mand of the church to patronize only its stores and other bust*
i freeze all non-Mormons out nf Utah. Brigham Voting
imed of a Mormon empire, and through most of his career he
i tiled such an empire. His exceedingly astute successors have had
the genius to. do what all men would have said ten years ago was
'â le. No non-Mormon then believed that it would be possi
after I'tah became a State, to make a complete conquest there
'he Mormon church, [f ivas not believed that an "American State
completely subverted by a church. It is one of the
- of history. The remedy is Â«o difficult that it may well
appall the statesmanship of the country. The church has become a
ss truÂ«t. a complete monopoly. It may be touched indifferently
ugh its flight relation to interstate commerce. Rut who shall say,
-and. how it may be reached in its control of the internal secular
â¢t of the State" Resort to the State Legislature is vain. The
controls it. No anti-trust or anti-monopoly law of Utah,
hitting th* church in its secularities, can be either passed or en
forced.
But numerous as are the difficulties, the nation cannot permit a
theocracy to masquerade in the garments and muniments of an
American S+ate. Our Mormon friend practically asks us. "What are
you going to do about it?" We confess that we do not know. We
only know this, that the secular and political interests of the Mormon
church in Utah presetit conditions that are insufferable under our
form of government, and that when anything becomes insufferable
ways are always found to deal with it.
PARENTAL BOARDING SCHOOL.
'T~"*HERE are pood reasons why the work the cit"- is successfully
performing for the wayward youth of the community by means
of the juvenile court, and the day parental school, should be
extended by the establishment of the parental boarding school, which
measure is being urged upon the Supervisors by the Superintendent
of School*, the Board of Education, and the California Club, through
section. Were the parental boarding school merely an cx
oefiment ttie need of it and the promise of its usefulness just from
common sense reasoning would strongly argue for our giving it a
but as such schools are : successfully accomplishing their be
nevofent design in various cities, our adoption of the plan would be
no more than following a good example.
The Day Parent School, on Eighth street, which has been for
Â«e--en months doing the work expected of it, reaches effectively to
c. hut not to all cases where the State must step in to fully pro
vide the child with its educational rights when the family is failing to
are him for good citizenship. The parents l boarding school
would save a large majority of those children who. because of vicious
or grossly neglectful parents, are exposed to all the evil influences
of the streets and of dwelling places which are a mocker)- of the
name of home.
Education that has not moral training interwoven all through Its
texture is more of a menace than a benefit to the community, for its
conferring would but increase the power of an evil nature to retard
and prey upon society. The proposed school would furnish to those
of our unfortunate youth who have not the safeguards of good" home
life all the advantages of such surroundings as would tend to mold
them into useful citizens. To neglect the opportunity of starting
them right in their youth would be but to invite the later evils of
suffering from and punishing the crimes they would naturally drift
into committing.
There are three principal factors which go to the molding of
character, namely, heredity, environment and the will. Which of
these is the strongest determining force may be still an open ques
tion : but it cannot be questioned that the most practical way in
which organized society can influence the moral character of its in
dividual members is by wisely using its power of control over en
vironment. This being true, and also true that statement, which
President Harper of the University of Chicago is authority for. that
(is the work we do with children, .the desirability
Itool is obvious and we should have it.

A HUMAN APPETITE

DOROTHY FENIMORE
HKRE is a question which I have

preatcr than other loves?" I

and presumably I :-hall have occasion

WEALTH OF ETHIOPIA.
There are gems and gold in Ethiopia,
writes Robert P. Skinner, in the Feb
ruary World's Work. The gems we
saw were found scattered over the
dflMrt wastes, washed down from the
mountains above. Gold is hidden away
in the mountains in quantities Which
can be estimated by no existing data.
Even now the annual production of
gold by methods as old as Moses
amounts probably to $500,000. As for
copper, iron and the ordinary metals,
their extraction is merely a question of
finding facilities for shipment and,
probably more important still, a mar
ket capable of absorbing them. Pe
troleum has been discovered in large
quantities, but the Emperor is cur
rently believed to regard as the most
I important of Abyssinian activities the
cultivation of his fertile table lands.
WASHINGTON SOCIETY.
The much discussed article on
Washington society, contributed to a
recent number of Harper's Weekly by '
Captain Algernon Sartorls, has called :
for, among others, a letter of protest
from one of the Weekly's readers. He
does not agree with Captain Sartoris
that Washington Is deteriorating so
cially. "Fashion Is fashion, whether
one finds it in London or in Bogota."
And as to the "low ebb of morals,"
Washington, he says, compared with
Kuropean capitals and with some
other American cities, "is singularly
free from scandal."
GRANT LOVING CUP.
Has the "limit been reached" in the
construction of loving cups? The Den
ver friends of a Western railroad
president have given him a little
Bouvenir in the form of a silver lov
ing cup that holds seventy-five pints.
They do things In a great way in the
generous West, and it breeds pr im

pint loving cup seems too large for hu

grabs us by the nape of the neck and
takes us away from our mothers, as if
we were kittens. It is a human ap
petite, as hunger is, or thirst, but
greater than these in that it is spiritual
and mental as well as physical; and it
is one which is less to be calculated on
than they are since we do not know in
advance what will be the food at sight
of which we shall be tempted. Like
other appetites it is to a certain extent
subject to our control. If we govern it
wisely it will never dominate us.
In love particularly is it true that "he
who ruleth his spirit is greater than he
who taketh a city."
Therefore the greatest love in the
world is â like the greatest man â the
one that has been most thoroughly dis
ciplined and tested. Who can believe
for a moment that a love which would
sacrtfiee honor could be greater than j
a love which is built on a self-respect j
that is above m price? If it were true, do |
you suppose that this famous cry of
Lovelace would have echoed down the
years to us:
"I would not love thee. dear, Â«o well,
Loved I not honor more"?
There are as many ways of loving as
there are people. In spite of the fact
that, for the sake of convenience, we
like to classify love stories by their re
lation to a few conspicuous types.
Some love is best measured by its
quality, some by its quantity, and some j
by its lineal dimensions. This does not |
alter the fact that the one who loves !
is bound to stamp his love with his I
distinctive character.
There Is a great deal of nonsense
written about "superb passion." which
Is supposed to be a ralnbow-hued
frenzy, a genteel kind of berserker
ragre. Now, no man flies off the handle
that way from love unless there is a
screw loose somewhere. Why, then,
should we judge his love by more
lenient standards than those by which
we would judge himself? Indeed. I
think we should be more exacting in
our requirements. For love is an up
ward tendency of human nature. It is
dignifying, ennobling; and for that
reason it imposes upon individuals who
experience it new obligations.
NEW THEORY OF SLEEP.
An interesting and novel theory of
sleep has recently been put forward by
Dr. Claparede, a French s< ientist. who
holds that sleep is a positive function
oi an instinct designed to arrest func
tioning. Dr. Claparede makes the as
sertion that we sleep not because we
artÂ« intoxicated or exhausted, but in
order to avoid such conditions. Not
only are there various kinds and de
grees of sleep, but it does not always
follow exhaustion. Furthermore it is
*yell known that sleep is not propor
tional to the degree of exhaustion, and
it may be either total or partial. In
measuring the profoundness of sleep
vztiOUS conditions are encountered
which are not i,uspectible of explana
tion on the toxic theory, but which
**ree perfectly with the hypothesis
that it is a positive nervous function.
Thp definition of sleep, according to
this new theory, is a reaction produced
by various excitants, and is an inhibi
tion which manifests itself subjectively
by a lack of interest in exterior things.

AN entertaining letter written by
George Bernard Shaw is
printed in the "Books and

y*-ars ago to Shaw's American agent.
Miss Marbury, in response to an apolo

QUEEN DR A GAS JEWELS
The London papers give full particu
lars of the recent sale at an auction
rcom in London of the jewels and cos
trmes of Draga, the murdered Queen
of Servia. The prices paid were not
high, considering the circumstances.
Thus the brilliant tiara worn by the
Queen at her wedding brought only
$6000. For a caboohon emerald and
brilliant bracelet, a gift from the Czar
of Russia, $240 was paid. For the
small sum of $575 there was sold an
article which has never been known
to be offered for sale before â the Per
sian Order of the Sun, a star and
be dge set in diamonds. This was pre
sented to Queen Draga by the Shah of
Persia on the occasion of his visit to
Belgrade in 1900. The order is of the
greatest rarity, being only represented
by sovereign ladles. The only others
known to be in existence are those
held by the German Empress, the
Czarina and Queen Margherita of Italy.
The Turkish Order of Mercy brought
$750. The total sum realised by the
sale was $11,676. â Leslie's Weekly.
A FRIEND'S PRIVILEGE
An eminent army officer has a man
servant who has been with him a num
ber of years and who occasionally
speaks his mind with a candor that,
as he imagines, is warranted by his
long service. A friend of the oftVer.
who overheard the servitor's frank
ness, asked why such familiarity was
permitted.
"Well." said the officer. "I hardly
look upon James as a valet, but rather
as a friend, and, as you know, it is a
friends privilege to tell you things
about yourself that you hardly like to
think about yourself." â Success Maga

books, prints representing the horrors
of war in their most realistic aspect,
and everything that can throw a can

guest of the Gridiron, a famous dinner
club in Washington, wan a President
of the United States, who but a fe*c
days before had occasion to speak with
spirit and point to the commanding
general of the army, two bears entered
the banquet chamber. One of them was
a real bear; the other was an imitation
bear with a man inside of it. The pair
rolled into the middle of the hall and
stood up and faced the toaatmaster.
"Where did you come from?" hÂ»
asked them.
"We've been over to the White HouÂ»Â«
to see the President, " said the smaller
bear dolorously. It was then >hs rvM
that his fur was much disarranged, one
of his ears was nearly iVWMi from
his head, and that he was in an ap
parently muc^i enfeebled condition.
"You do notllook very well, " observed
the chairman.

WINS PLAUDITS

Beginning unevenly and unsatisfac

finish, the Savage company gave a per
formance of "II Trovatore" at thÂ» Co
lumbia last evening that ranked high
in comparison with any of recent years
in this city. At first the conductor
ruled with an iron hand, unsympa
tbetically and severely, to the utter
loss of the languishment that is char
acteristic of the opera. Later the en
tire muFical forces were In sympathy
and discoursed music worth going
many a mile to hear. Others have
surpassed Gertrude Ren ny son in par
ticular as Leonora, but as a whole her
performance was excellent, her vocai
ism delicious. Rheehan had a phe
nomenal disaster in the "Dark Scaf
fold" song, his voice entirely failing
him where high C was expected to
ring. At other times he thoroughly
justified the reputation already won.
Goff was the most picturesque figure
as De Luna that has been seen In the
role in several seasons. His singing
has been better in other roles. In "II
Balen" he was off the key the first
rendering during a score of phrases,
but redeemed himself later. Marion

â¢SJtty paid back to shippers the
sum of f1. 198.362. This fact was devel

HeaJey, freight auditor for the Santa

is taking: depositions in the case he has
instituted to ascertain whether or not
the fianta Fe is violating the anti
trust law of Kansas. Healey said that
this amount constituted the total of
overcharges made fr> r the year. It is
the tJkeory of thÂ° State that these over
charge are in reality rebates, and th a
en examination of the vouchers will
show that the greater portion of the
payments have been made to the
Standard Oil Company and other con
cerns.
Healey was asked to have the nec
essary records and vouchers in court
this afternocn, but on the advice of
R. Duniap. general attorney of the
road, refitted to permit the examina
tion of these papers. A conference of
the Santa Â¥> officials was held later
to discuss this point, but a decision
was not reached.
Healey was als<r examined concerning
his knowledge of the workings of the
Transcontinental Freight Bureau, the
Trans-Missouri Freight Bureau and
the Western Trunk Line Committee,
the three organizations that are al
leged to settle the questions of freight
rates in the Western country. Healey
denied that he knew anything concern
ing these organizations, or that he
knew who were their officials.
\V. J. Black, general passenger agent
of the S^-nta Fe. explained the system
of interchangeable tickets and the re

every denomination for services on
Sunday. The sick or unfortunate are
kindly cared for. The table is pro
vided with an abundance of good, well
cooked food. The rooms are clean and
the beds comfortable.
The present building is a monument
to the enterprise and devotion of the
ladies of this society. Twenty-nine
years ago it was a wreck. By their
individual efforts they raised $40,000
and made it not only habitable but
homelike and comfortable.
The following programme will be ren

SEQUOIA CLUB
TO MOVE INTO
ITS NEW HOME
After thâ¬ ISth the Sequoia Club will
burn incense unto the household gods
under its own rooftree.
After that date the club will be in
possession of two floors In the new
IJoyfl building on Sutter street, near
Mason, where seven well-appointed
rooms will be occupied as permanent
headquarters. .
These are now in process of decora
1 tion and furnishing, and when com
; pleted will represent an lnterÂ«trtins
! phase of the social life of San Fran
! cisco.
The building Is divided into two tene- j
, ments, each containing seven rooms, .
I arranged upon two floors.
As a neighbor, the Sequoians will :
have the French Club, of which many i
interesting things are told. And though I
the clubs will undoubtedly be famous
j good friends, they can't get unduly j
chummy, as their rooms are separated
by an unyielding partition. And this
is said to be "deadened." Whether this ;
precaution was taken out of regard for '
the Sequoia Club or the French Club is
still in the hands of the jury.
This brave venture of "going house- I
keeping" â for such it really is, since
there'll be all sorts of home comforts to
be had for the wishing â augurs well for
the club's substantiality.
The new rooms will be far enough
down town for the men to drop in for a
smoke or a bit of lunch, at the same
time to enjoy a little tete-a-tete with
the ladies.
The Sequoia Club in its new quartern
will become a striking feature of West
ern social life, since It Is the only club
in the Far West in which men and wo
men are members of equal standing.
And it's good fun, this new Bohemian
club of men and women, and threatens
to explode many of the old traditions
about w%>men not being clubable â in
the sense that men are clubable.
Within its hospitable dc-ors will be
welcomed many famous travelers that
happen along this way, and the spirit
of comradery promises to make the
club a pleasant place to tarry a while.

MABSH ACTS AS HOST
Entertains the Executive
Board of the Association
at Elaborate Luncheon
George T. Marsh broke the monotony
of the daily business sessions of the
Pacific Coast Forest. Fish and Game
Association yetterday by entertaining
the executive board, together with spe
cial guests, at luncheon at the Bohe
mian Club. The luncheon in no way
interrupted the business in hand, but
rather facilitated matters. Many im
portant measures were taken toward
the success of the great exhibition in
Mechanics' Pavilion during the first
fortnight of April.
The gaining of automobile exhibits
hÂ» been hanging fire, but it was hap
pily disposed of by the presence of sev
eral prominent dealers, who agreed to
start the affair moving.
E. Courtney Ford, chairman of the
automobile committee, will follow the
advantage and will make these exhibits
a feature of the show. An important
matter was decided upon when the
contract for transporting the forest of
trees from the mountains to the pavil
ion was let to H. Willis Jr. The latter
assumes full control of this work under
the guidance of Chairman Theodore
Kytka and the work is now under way.
It was the best meeting of the series,
because the reports of work In hand
were all of obstacles overcome rather
than of obstacles to be passed. There
is a world of labor ahead, but the lines
have all been gathered up. Now comes
tht detail of putting them into actual
execution.
Those present at the luncheon were
President William Greer Harrison, A.
J. Treat, A. Van der Naillen Jr.. Gen

\UII fight Ijtvk Powell To-Morrow
Nijrlit at Woodwarl- Pavilion.
Owing to a fractured rib Young
Choynski, the boxer, will not be able
to fight Lew Powell to-morrow night
at Woodwards Pavilion. Bob Cairns
will be substituted. Choynski was hurt
ten days ago and thought it was a
flight injury. Inflammation set in and
he may have to undergo an operation.
Matchmaker Harry Baker of the
Hayes Valley Athletic Club, feared
Choynski would not be able to go on
and he directed Cairns to go into
training. As Cairns can fight Powell
at catch weights he will be in splen
did shape to give the Hawthorne Club
champion a good fight. When the
pair fought before Cairns weakened
himself making weight. The balance
of to-morrow night's card follows:
Jim Ford vs. Jim McÃride, 125
pounds; Jack Bradshaw vs. Willie Ed
wards, 115 pounds; Nobby Otts vs.
Mike Synfy. 135 pounds; Abe Label
vs. Southside Jack O'Brien, 122

Hares Arc Still Scarce.
Owing to a scarcity of , hares there
will be no coursing at Ingleslde Park
this week. No draw $vas held by
Union Coursing Park last night. If
a supply of har<^ is assured the Union
Park draw will be held to-night. It
v.as thought Oregon would supply an
unlimited number of hares, by the
men who went up there report their
inability to catch them in sufficient
numbers to supply the coursing parks.

GLENDENNING OUTRUNS PICKAWAY
IN A FIVE-FURLONG SCRAMBLE
Isabeau, Eidden by Larsen,
Downs Avonalis for the
Two - Year - Old Fixture
MY OEDER WINS EASILY
Andrew Mack, With K.
Walsh in Saddle, Disposed
Of AVith Ease by Scherzo
BY FRED E. MILHOLIAM).
The card at Oakland track yesterday
was not supposed to possess much
class, but it afforded some fair sport.
The horses ran well to form, and three
out of six public choices were encased
with brackets.
CJl^ndenning: left the paddock and was
back in a minute for the opening five
furlong scramble. The chestnut sprin
ter ruled a 3 to 5 choice in the betting,
and outfooted Pickaway from the start.
The latter handily disposed of Redan,
a 20 to 1 shot, for the place. Revolt
could not, or would not, take part in
the fracas.
Kquorum Rex, favorite for the two
year-old half mile speed recital, found
ered at sea and Captain Minder and all
hands were lost. St. Francis, the sec
ond choice, encountered the same
storm, finally reaching port with a bad
list to the starboard.
ISABKAU BEATS AVOX'ALIS.
The winner turned ud in Charley
Patterson's Isabeau. a 5 to 1 rhance,
which beat Avonalis a neck in :48\.
April's Pride, at 30 to 1, ran a fair
third.
Dr. Rowell's Mv Order can strike
more soft spots than a policeman in
the redlight district. The gelding's
price was pounded down from S to 5 to
11 to 10 in the gambling done on the
Futurity course run, and he actually
m alked in first. Edrodun finished sec
ond, more than a length before Meada.
Just two horses had a chance to pick
up first money in the mile and one
hundred yards selling affair â Scherzo
and Andrew Mack. Billy Cahill's horse
had the most friends and Andrew Mack
closed favorite. "Big Bill" Knapp
hustled Scherzo to the front on the
far turn and aj the wire he could give
away a point or two to the first choice
and then win. P. Ryan's mare, Esher
in, ran into the show.
Bab, ridden by Knapp. did every
thing but get left at the post and of
course this made the seven furlong
selling number a certainty for Hugh
McOowan. Dr. Rowell's gelding went
to the post a 11 to 10 favorite and lead
ing throughout ran home three lengths
in advance of Bab. Serenity was third.
Louis Ezell's Trapsetter was touted
as the real thing for the closing mile
Belling run. He enjoyed first call in the
betting and led for more than seven
furlongs. Then he was seized with an
attack of stage fright, and ran un
placed. Meistersinger, a played 4 to 1
opportunity, led Tannhauser and Silur
ian over the line. .
TRACK NOTES.
Travers piioted two winners.
The misunderstanding existing be
tween Bianchi & MrGovm and Ap
prentice Frank Sullivan looks in a fair
way to be adjusted. The young rider
will purchase his release.
In the mid-summer book General
Kur.patkin and Ed Corrigan are each
quoted at 15 to 1. The latter will prob
ably find out that John Condon can
see a long way ahead, for a blind man.
Wanted â A jockey; colored preferred.
Apply to "Walter Jennings. Emeryville
track. Solomon Bonner has done gone
and made his getaway, and Walter
Jennings can throw no light as to the
whereabouts of his dark-skinned rider.
Bonner apparently did not want to en
ter the employ of Jennings & Co.. and
many think that Charley IfcCaffertjr,
who lost the contract on th^ jockey,
could tell somethir.e about his disap
pearance. At any rate, Solomon Bon
ner departed from Emeryville track
â¢ r-pt.-rday morning, and if he started
for New Orleans he did not leave be
hind his address.
Twenty-three books cut in.
Trapsetter was clnimed from the last
racÂ£ for $72". by F. J. O'Rourke, owner
of The Fretter.
Tuoman. who has done some good
work in the saddle at Ascot Park, has
b^en secured by C C. MeCafTerty to
do the riding for his stable at Oak
land.
Af b<--ing kept on the ground for
som^ weeks at the request of his em
ployer. Willie Harris, the clever light
weight. W. Davis, will make his re
appearance in the saddle to-day.
Minder, who rode Equorum Rex, got
hi* thoughts crossed just as the barrier
was released.
Johnny Mellin. the popular little turf,
man formerly connected with the late
Caesar Young, arrived from Los An
soles Tuesday night with the following
horses: E. M. Brattain, Princess
Titania. Orsora, Avonella, Lord Nel
fon, Lovely Mary and Laura F. M.

SOLONS DELAY
FIGHT MEASURE
After Being Before the Leg
islators for Two Months
Defect Is Found in Bill
IN PRINTER'S HANDS
Time Presses in Which It
, Can Become a Law and
Stop Boxing in California
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, March B.â lf the As
sembly is going to send the anti-prize
fight bill to the Governor it will have
to hurry. Amerige called up the Rals
ton Senate bill, identical with his own,
for passage in the lower house this
afternoon, but instead of being put to
a vote it was amended and put over
until to-morrow.
There is something peculiar about the
status of the bill. It was introduced
in both houses early in the session and
though it could have been brought to a
vote long before it was in both houses
it was passed by the Senate only a rew
days ago and has been called up for
final passage in the Assembly only
two days before the time of adjourn
ment. This is not all, though. The
failure to call the bill un earlier could
easily be placed on the ground of legis
lative expediency, but there is some
thing else that cannot be so easily ex
plained. Though the bill has been be
fore the legislators of both houses for
nearly two months, a glaring error
that would make It unconstitutional,
had it been passed as introduced, was
only made known to-day.
When the bill was called for passage
Cleveland offered an amendment, cut
ting out that portion which permitted
four-round amateur contests. Amerige
at once objected, saying this was an
unfair scheme to kill the bill. Cleve
land replied that if the Legislature in
tended to legislate against prizefighting
at all it should not do things by halves.
The amendment was lost.
Espey of Alameda then offered the
amendment that makes the measure
constitutional. As the bill stood the
first paragraph after the enacting
clause started with "Section 412." Es
pey's amendment changed this to legal
phraseology by starting it "Section 1.
Section 412 of the Penal Code of the
State of California is hereby amended
to read as follows."
Amerige at once accepted the amend
ment, the opponents of the bill gladly
voting for it. as when amended the bill
would necessarily have to be sent to
the printer for correction and then to
the Senate, which would have to con
cur in the amendment. Amerige had no
course but to accept the delay, as the
bill would be worthless without the
amendment.
Exciting Tennis Match.
The final match of the mixed
doubles tennis tournament, com
menced last Saturday, was played yes
terday on the Golden Gate Park
courts. It resulted in a victory for
Miss Vera Crocker and Morris Mc-
I-oughlin in straight sets. Their op
ponents were Mrs. C. Watson and R.
Strachan, who received a handicap of
owe 3-6.
Although the match was won in
straight sets, it was by no means one
sided. Miss Crocker and McLoughlin
won the first set easily, the score be
ing- 6-1. Mrs. Watson and Strachan
tcok the first five games in the second
set and it seemed they would surely
win it. At this point Miss Crocker
and McLoughlin braced up and won
five straight games, making the score
5-5. They also won three out of the
next four games, giving them the set
by an 8-6 score.
The tournament was held jointly by
the Ladies' Annex and the junior club.

FIREMEN READY
FOR "FINEST"
O'CONNELL IS TO OFFICIATE
The bl* benefit baseball game to be
played next Sunday afternoon at
creation Park between the nines repre
senting the police and the fire depart
ments, promises to be one of the sport
ing events of the season. As the days
roll by interest increases till at the
present time every one seems to be
talking about the coming contest.
The fire laddies got together on Tues
day and defeated a fast team from St-
Ignatius College by a score of 4 to 3.
The coppers went over to Goat Island
yesterday and played a team from the
training shiD Pensacola. The finest
were beaten, 9 to 8, but they made a
fast finish at that and would have won
but for a lot of hard luck.
The fire laddies are busily collecting
all the bells in the department that
are not In use. The coppers' strong one
is a whistle and between the two noise
makingr devices there is sure to be do
ings at the Eighth-street lot on Sun
day afternoon. Fireman Tom Fitzpat
rick. the twirler, will arrive from Fres
,no on Saturday. He has been working
hard with the Tacoma tigers and is in
fine form.
Jack O'Connell, the ever popular in
dicator man, will call the balls and
strikes and a great welcome is due him
when he ste?s into the middle of the
lot. The committee in charge of the
game has placed a box at the disposal
of Jim McDonald and it is likely he
will be present. Reserved seats are on
sale at Harris' cigar store.
REGATTA COURSE
IS IN DISPUTE
Oarsmen of Rival Univer
sities Unable to Agree
on Stretch of Water
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March
8. â A controversy that may end in the
canceling of the date for the intercol
legiate regatta with the University of
California is going on between the
boat clubs of the two colleges. The
difficulty is over the selection of a suit
able course on which to hold the races.
The authorities of both universities
have decided on the course they want,
but neither will agree to the selection
of the other.
The California oarsmen want to use
the Oakland estuary, but the men of
the cardinal refuse to row there. Stan
ford objects to this course because the
water is rough at times. The Univer
sity of California crew are dome all of
their practice there, which would srive
them an advantage, as they would be
accustomed to the winds and currents.
The location the Stanford Boat Club
contends for is at Stockton, where there
is a three-mile straightaway. The
course in on a slough about a hundred
yards wide, and the water is always
still. Besides the fine facilities for row
ing, this course has many advantages
for the spectators. In addition to a
road along the entire distance of the
course the Chamber of Commerce of
Stockton has offered to build a larsre
grand stand at the finish. If the re
gatta is held at Stockton the boat club
there will give a cup to the winner of
the race and the Chamber of Com
merce will divide the receipts between
the two universities.
In addition to the races with the Uni
versity of California the club here is
also planning contests to be held with
clubs of Southern California and a re
gatta with the University of Washing
ton. It is also probable' Stanford will
take part in the aquatic sport at the
Lewis and Clark Exposition In Port
land.
YOI'NG CORBETT GOING EAST.
Ex-Champion Hopes for Another
Meeting With Terry McGovern.
Young Corbett will start for the
East to-day with Al Herford and Joe
Gans. Corbett goes to Philadelphia
first, where he hones to get on some
six-round bouts. His ambition at the
present time is to arrange a third
meeting with Terry McGovern. If this
match is made it can be held in Bal
timore before Herford's club.
Gans has a match on with "Willie
Lewis in Baltimore and still has hopes
of securing a match with either Britt
or Nelson.

POPULAR FREXCH WRITER.
Anatole France is now by far the
most popular of living French writers
and has a record of sales that is little
short of amazing: His "Crime "of Syl
vestre Bonnard" has gone through 85
c-ditions, and ' Is Lys Rouge", through
86. "L'prme dv Hail" is in, its 77th
â¦â¢dition, "Le Mannequinn d'Osier" in its
7,".ih, and "Monsieur Bergeret" in its
Tath. The figures are a credit to
French taste, considering that the au
thor is the leading stylist of his age.
A good deal of interest is being
taken in a reprint just published in
London of - "Oronooka," a novel by
Mrs. Aphra Behn, who is supposed
to have ; been the first English pro
fessional authoress and female play
wright. Born in 1640, Mrs. Behn was
also one of the first English women
to take un the business of a political
FpVr and; in this "capacity she was sent
to Antwerp in 1666 to find out the de
signs of the Dutch, her husband being
a gentleman of that nationality. She
conducted her mission with some suc
ceps and gave information of the pro
je<-tod expedition of the Dutch to the
jha mes, . though Charles II and his
â¢sapient counselors thought proper to
ignore her warning. Then she took to
writing plays, which had some success
en the stage, though they were not re
markable for their delicacy. "Oron
coka" was the best of her novels.

The Pacific Mail Company's liner Si
beria, Captain J. Tremaine Smith,
sailed yesterday for the Orient crowd
ed with passengers and carrying about
11,000 tons of cargo. Captain Smith,
who underwent a surgical operation
during the liner's stay in port, cleared
the Siberia and went away with her,
but was not able to take his place on
the bridge yesterday. He expects to
be all right before the liner reaches
Honolulu. Chief officer Arthur
O'Neill was on the bridge when the
liner sailed and under his direction
the big steamship made as pretty a
departure as the Pacific Mail dock
"good-by contingent" ever saw.
Among the passengers to Honolulu
were Colonel and Mrs. Sam Parker
and Miss Alice and Miss Beatrice
Campbell. Quite a number of navy
officers sailed on the Siberia. Admi
rals Miller and Whiting are bound for
Manila on lourt-marial duty. Lieu
tenant Frank Marble is going to To
kio as naval attache at the American
legation. Commander J. C. Col well
and Captains H. W. L.yon and B. W.
Very will join the Siberia at Hono
lulu and will accompany the* two ad
mirals to Manila.
F. A. Carl, who was China's com

President Will Make Kadical
Changes in the Personnel
of the Panama Commission
NOT AT ALL SATISFIED
Eoosevelt Hopes by Reduc
ing Membership to Three
to Get Better Kesults
WASHINGTON. March 8. â Radical
changes are to be made in the person
nel of the Panama Canal Commission.
President Roosevelt has let members
of Congress know that he Is not at all
satisfied with the work of the commis
sion. While no authoritative state
ment concerning the President's inten
tions is obtainable at the White House,
it is known to be his purpose to make
such changes in the membership of
the canal commission as, in his judg
ment, will facilitate work on the great
waterway. His desire, i^>is under
stood, is to reduce the commission to
three members, all of whom shall be
practical engineers of eminence. Un
der the Spooner act one of these engi
neers must be from the navy and one
from the army. Admiral John Walker
now represents the navy and General
George W. Davis the army on the com
mission. It is said positively that Ad
miral Walker will not continue long
as a member of the commission.
It is very likely that the President
will reduce the commission to three
members, simply by not filling the
places of those whose resignations
shall have been accepted. The Presi
dent is deeply interested in the con
struction of the canal and proposes to
do everything possible to facilitate the
work.
The Siberia's Cargo.

$114. The. leading exports were as follows:
To Japan â 62.803 cs assorted canned goods.
3390 bdls 5 cs leather. 1407 bales cotton. 157
pkgs machinery, 178 cs sheetings. 30,475 lbs

TWO MORE INDICTMENTS
FOLLOW WYMAN SCANDAL
Patrolman W. R Byrnes and Election
Judge L. S. Carson Implicated
In the Frauds.
The Grand Jury yesterday after
noon returned indictments against
Patrolman William R. Byrnes and L-
S. Carson for their alleged illeg-al ac
tions In the Wyman scandal. Byrnes
is charged with perjury, his testimony
in the recent trial in favor of Wyman
convincing the grand jurors that he
should be indicted on this serious
charge. He was arrested last night on
a bench warrant issued by Superior
Judge Lawlor.
Carson was a judge in the Thirty
seventh District at the time the al
leged ballot-box stuffing was perpe
trated last November. The Grand
Jury also had enough evidence in its
possession to warrant his indictment.
The inquisitorial body will probe still
further Into the case and it is expect
ed that more indictments will be
brought. The jurors paid a visit to
the City Prison and after a close in
spection found everything there to
their liking.

ARGUMENTS CONCLUDED .
OX EPPINGER'S MOTION
.fudge Lawlor Will Decide Saturday
..a f'oliii.) Ral*Â«d aa to Diaquali-
Acalluit uf <Â«raiul Jurors.
Argument* on .the. motion ; to set
aside the indictments against Herman.
1,1. vi. and Josua Eppin#;er and
Jumea Dealings : were concluded be
fore Judge i.awlor yesterday. The
Judge MMd he would render his de
olsion on Haturday. , ,
Attorney Pelxofto followed ex-Gov
ernor Uudd yesterday for the defend
ants, contending that uÂ« bias and
prejudice had been shown by lome of
the grand Jurors the Indictments
should be set aside. If only one
grand Juror was diqualifled that was
enough to invalidate the proceedings
of tha whole.
Attorney Campbell replied for the
prosecution and argued that by the
decision of the Supreme Court In the
Northey case It was held that the dis
qualification of a grand Juror wan not
a ground ' or setting aalde,an indict
ment. It was only necessary that
there should be twelve Jurors voting
on an Indictment who were not biased
or prejudiced.
George A. Newhall was recalled and
testified that he did not vote on the
indictments and was only present at
one meeting when the Indictments
were under consideration.
SOLDIERLY ANNEXATION
HAS VARYING RESULTS
One Fightinc Julius Caesar Wins
Fame, but His Modern Namesake
Goes to Alcatraz.
Julius Caesar, a soldier who served
under the standard of the Roman
eagle, annexed thÂ« territory of
the Gauls. Julius Caesar, a sol
dier who served under the stars
and stripes In Company I, Tenth In
fantry, annexed the property of a fel
low defender of the flag. The first
went down to history in a blaze of
fame. The second has gone to Alca
traz for twelve years. Such are the
forutnes of annexation. General
Moore approved the modern Caesar's
sentence yesterday, and this morning
he will be making little stones out of
big ones on "the rock."
John Moynihan and John Walsh
were sentenced to three months each
at Alcatraz for absence without leave.
Because the canteen was abolished
they had to come down to the Barbary
Coast to assuage their thirst and were
delayed in returning by Anastasia
Johnson and others.
Bids for the construction of a brick
barracks building: at Fort Baker were
opened at the quartermaster's offlce
yesterday. On account of usual
complication of specifications the
propositions vary more than 130,000.
It Is probable that the building will
be constructed at a cost of about
$45,000.
"ELIJAH" DOWIE MUST PAT
AX ANCIENT DEBT
Jndge Mum-sky Awards Verdict to
Hugh Craig, Who Formerly Fin
anced the Zionist.
An echo of "Elijah" Dowie's visit
to San Francisco in 1888 in Quest of
early converts to the cause of Zion
ism came up yesterday in Judge Mu
rasky's court, when John Alexander
Dowie was ordered to pay to Hugh
Craig the sum of $2727 36.
Craig alleged that the money was
due him for many services rendered
to Dowie during his first lecture tour
to the coast. Craig at that time ad
vanced the money to Dowie to cover
the expenses of his tour and consid
ered it as lost when the tour failed.
A few years later Dowie made a
success of his proselyting, whereupon
Craig brought suit to recover the sum.
Dowie's defense was that Craisr gava
the money to the cause and that
therefore when it failed the flrst time
the money was regarded as a contri
bution and not as a debt-
Seeks to End His Life.
Francis Skidmore, who gave thÂ«
name of Francis Anthony at the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital, tried to end
his life by cutting: his throat and an
artery in his wrist in a lodg-ing-houM
at 104 Ellis street yesterday morning.
He is not in a serious condition. Skid
more resides with his folks in Oak
land and is employed by the Equitable
Life Insurance Company. He quar
reled with several women in "the lodgr
ing-house and while Dr. Millar was
dressing his wounds the young man
informed the physician he was a "gen

New Tork Stock Market.
XBW TORK. March 8. â Prices recovered In
tt-d*i's stock market, although there * was j
jjttie improvement in the volume 'of . trad- '
toe ThÂ« tone was by.no means wall assured ',
end hesitation and sluggishness were etlll
apparent in the movement. Trading was large- ;
\J Jr. professional hands and there was no evl- :
i*z-~* of any important revival of public in- ;
Ureet. The snunllest of . the selling orders 1
which resulted JTcm the downward tendency ,
rwterday served as an encouragement to hold
er* cf ' stocks and as a warning to bearish \
pjc.'**BÂ»or.aJi not to extend their short con
tracts unduly. After the extent of the specu- j
lation Jcr the advance and toe height to which <
prloes have been lifted, the small pressure <o
UQuidate on the reaction Is regarded as : re- :
Bankable. The whole character of the mar- !
ket, in faot, is better defined as a waiting j
Â«ise than as either strong or reactionary. 1
With the ICorthera Securities case decided, j
the absence of large selling Is regarded as in
dicating a reeling of ooofldence in future de
velopments having a favorable bearing on
values. But more explicit information is
awaited regarding the developments. The
postponement of announcement* has proved â 
trying to Che patience of those holding stocks i
In explanation of the plans which were sup- j
posed to be contingent upon tbe settlement \
it the Northern Securities case having to do i
with -â¢ redistribution, not only of the prop- j
erties Included in that merger, but of others |
indirectly concerned In the railroad policy
Involved In that combination. Large attention :
f ,â¦ gives to the subject in the current discue- :
tlon in "Wall street, but evidently more con- !
crete results are desired to revive any active i
â¢peculation in the market. The offset of the
ni-w.e on the local transit companies was less j
marked in diminishing the attendance at the I
ftock Exchange, to-day, and the sentimental I
pba*Â«Â« of the strike were taken less account j
of. The :rcst . conspicuous buying I .-(1; was !
In the coaJers, and the special prominence of
Reading was attributed to the activity of a t
pool in. tbat' stock. The review of the trade j
conditions by the recognized organ was very j
cheerful, however, and doubt was expressed
whether the usual spring reduction in : the
price eÂ».a'p would be adopted this year, at any i
eveut at the usue.l time. Amalgamated Copper j
also v/aÂ» a -responsive stock to enthusiastic
trade reigns, and a speculative party was
eaid to - t he active in that M;ock. The sharp
recovery^ in New lork Central had a good j
effect on settle iaÂ« nt. The movement in West- '
Â«m stocks connected with the merger rumors
wÂ«.f mere moderate The crisis In the war
m the Far East, and the threatened catas
trci he to the Russian army had the effect of i
â¢ becking activity rather than oÂ£ promoting any j
tefi:;!te jicslUon in the market. In Paris the
rumor of another Russian Icon seemed to have
s. strengthening effect and to neutralise " the
influence of the .war news.,. The Ixmdon mar
ket rojTected some doubt in Its - operations
pending the action of the Bank of. England '

Hay and Feedstuffs.
Unchanged Quotations rule for all Feed
stuffs. Hay continues weak. The circular of
Somers & Co. says:
"The past week's shipments have amounted
to 2710 tons, about the same amount as has
been received each week fof aoms little time,
and is ample to fill all demand. Buyers are
still holding off and purchase sparingly, to*
they realize the large amount of Hay that will
be marketed before the new crop is offered.
Occasionally on a day of light reoeipts a
slight nrmnesa may be noted for some cer
tain grade* of Hay; thU is but momentary,
however, so we can report no change in the
general tone of the market.
"It is unfortunate that the large foreign
shipments, which onoe looked so promising aa
an outlet for considerable Hay. should have
ceased entirely. It is reported, however, that
forage supplies in Eastern Siberia are very
short, and. snouM there be a oessatlon of hos
tilities before the new crops are harvested
there shipments would again commence,
"At present Southern California is drawing
but lightly on our stock, and from present
indications it would seem that but little more
would go in that direction during the balance
of the season." â¢

readily at firm prices, while the cheaper sorts
of table Burbanks from the river districts are

Five carloads came in from Oregon yesterday.
Receipts of Asparagus continued heavy and
prices were slightly lower. One canning con
cern was in the market and purchased about
400 boxes, paying 3c per pound for No. 2 and
4c for No. 1 stock. Rhubarb arrived freely
and sold off well at good prices. Choice of
ferings of other vegetables were firm. Most
of the Tomatoes from Southern California
were of poor quality and prices had a wide
range.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter was lower yesterday, with creameries
freely offered along the street at 28c. with
some dealers offering to sell at 27c. Fear of
what might happen in a day or two rather
than any overplus of supplies caused the de
cline. In other words, the trade crossed the
bridge before they got to it.
Cheese was also weak, with some housea
â hading the quotations Stocks showed
no particular increase, however.
Eggs continued to advance under the free
movement into storage, and 170 was generally
quoted for the best ranch. The demand for
store Eggs continued and none could be ob

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The market was still overburdened with
Oranges of poor quality, which were being
pressed for sale at low and irregular prices.
The cheap rates stimulated the demand among
peddlers, but trade was not of sufficient vol
ume to relieve the market much. Despite the
weakness in low-grade fruit, there was con
tinued firmness in sound offerings, supplies of
such stock being limited. Business in the
auction rooms reflected the conditions which
prevailed in the open market. Elg-ht carloads,
chiefly poor fruit, were disposed of as follows:
Fancy. $1 65Â©1 76; choice, $I@l TO; standard,
60c(?J.$i 05. The other Citrus varieties stood
about as previously quoted, with a fair amount
of business reported. There was nothing new

STOCK. MARKET.
Business Continues to Quiet Down on
All the Exchanges.
Yesterday was another flat day all around.
There was nothing of any consequence doing
on, the Bond Exchange and tha only fluctua
tion worthy of notice was an advance In Contra
Costa Water from ?43 to $45 75.
The mining shares were alia dull, even the
Tonopahs showing a marked falling off In
sales. The Comstocks were lower, with Ophir
sc-lling off to $6 37%, Con. Cal. & Va. to $1 70.
Hale and Norcross to *1 15. Mexican to Â«1 75
an.l so on. Some of the Tonopahs were also
lower. There was hardly anything doing In
the oil snares.
The directors of Copper Range have de
clared an initial quarterly dividend of $1 per
share on 385,000 shares capital, payable
Airil 1.
The Yellow Jacket Mining Company haa
levied an assessment of 10c per share.
The California-Street Cable Railroad Com
pany paid a regular monthly dividend of 900
pei share yesterday.

SCORNED WIFE
RESENTS SLUR
She Dislikes Beer
riGUE flrtD DESIRE TO fIPPEfISE
LED HER TO PROPOSE STEAM.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
With ostensible intent to effect
reconciliation with her spouse, from
whom she had been separated about
six months, Mrs. Gertie Corkey
donned her best coat and hat last
Tuesday evening and hied herself to
his apartment in a lodging-house at
Sixth and Folsom streets. Her heart
was brimful of kindness, she informed
Police Judge Cabanies, and the faint
est indication of acquiescence to her
mood by the party of the second part,
baptized William, would have suf-
n>*>d to restore the entente cordiale.
But there was no gentleness in Wil
liam's manner when she extended to
him the oiive branch. He surlily
commanded her to vacate his pres
ir.il because she was unable to
â¢h<^ command with alacrity, being
led by her walk, he deliberately
'iat and hat aforementioned
then with mu<-h roughness ex
pelled her from the room. The ma
terial damage inflicted, though irre
pgrable. v. Â«s ; , trifle when compared
tn the laceration of her feelings by
his rejection of her peace overture.
If she had been dirt under his feet,
insiead of a forgiving suppliant for
forgiveness, she could not have been
more thoroughly spurned. While the
court <.-ould â and she hoped it would
â compel him to replace her ruined
wrap and headgear, no temporal
power could effect a healing ot the
blow administered to her pride.
In defense of his alleged violent
conduct Mr. Corkey denied that the
injury to the complainant's mantle
and millinery was deliberately com
mitted. It was unavoidably incidental
to her expulsion, he said, which she
provoked by her behavior. Instead of
proposing an interment of the
hatchet, he further averred, she sug
gested a rushing of the growler by
him and expressed a preference for
steam, supplementing the suggestion
with a hint that it would be advis
able for him to hurry back with the
laden can, as the more froth the bev
erape was capped with the better she
likÂ«rd it. His refusal to fetch . and
carry aroused her ire, and as she
was threatening to transform his
chamber into a "rough house" he for
cibly transferred her to the corridor. i
The complainant requested the
bench to defer passing judgment un
til sh' 1 had cleared her character of
the slur attached to it by the defend
ant's malicious insinuation that she
Mas given to beer-bibbing. Her re
quest having been complied with she
said her pedestrianism and her hus
band's cavalierly demeanor had com
bined to make her thirsty, and .she
thought a foaming can might soften
his temper anud thus aid her in
bringing about a resumption of friend
ship But .as for her being, addicted
to the consumption of steam-; an im
pression which he had attempted to
topvey^-nothliig ; could - be further
from fact." That was all.
Th'- art ordered Mr. (.'jrkey
the complainant a sum of
$!0 to make good the damage to her
Mid hat, which he promised to do
s? t-ooii as he can spare the amount
from the wages he earns as a laborer
in the U. S. A. transport service
Earl Oxford, a civil engineer resid
ing at SI 6 California street, disclosed
his British birth and breeding as he
warmly inveighed against the chauf
feur who cause dhis arrest. for refus
ing to pay a $25 bill. He engaged an
automobile for the purpose of show
ing Golden Gate Park and the Cliff
House to a lady and two gentlemen,
friends of his, and also to regale his
own vision with those famous places.

James Lakd was toying with the
cash box of a telephone in a Market- ;

ing when the bartender, R. K. Fox.

burglarizing the box, whereupon the

Witnesses Testify at Hi 3
Trial for the Murder of
Policeman E. C. Kobinson
FOUKTEEX EXAMINED
Important Evidence Given
by Mrs. Elizabeth Broeske.
Also by Mrs. A. Hansford
The trial of Allen Goucher, charged
with the murder of Policeman Eugene
C. Kobinson at Sixteenth and Valencia
streets on the morning of January 21,
1902, was continual before a Jury in
Judge Cook's court yesterday. Many
witnesses were examined, but their
evidence was the same as at previous
trials of the defendants alleged fellow
conspirators.
The witnesses examined were Dr. J.
F. Sullivan. Lieutenant William Price,
Policeman T. Connell, Mrs. Elizabeth
Broeske. Mrs. A. Hansford, William
Ritchie, Alfred Benning, A. Fredericks,
Attorney Stephen B. Costello, William
Condrin, Frank J. Egan, Patrick S.
HigginÃ, John G. Weise and Ferdinand
C. Apel.
The most important testimony was
that given by Mrs. Broeske and Mrs.
Hansford. At the time of the murder
Mrs. Broeske had a lodging house at 203
Turk street, where Goucher, Henderson
and a cripple named O'Brien had
rooms. They left the lodging in a
hurry on the morning of the murder.
After they left Mrs. Broeske found por
tions of clothing in the stove which
they had been burning. Mrs. Hans
ford lived in the house. She gave
similar testimony.
Ritchie, Benning and Fredericks are
carmen who testified to six men com
ing into the city from Cypress Lawn
Cemetery on the last car on the night
of January 20. They had previously
identified Kaufmann, Henderson, Ken
nedy and Coulter, and they thought
Ocucher resembled one of the other
two.
Attorney Costello testified to passing
three men about 1 o'clock in the morn
ing of January 21 on Valencia street
near Eighteenth, and one of them, a
smooth faced youth, calling to him to
come back. He walked on and soon
heard the terrified yells of a man. He
looked round and saw a man who look
ed like a Japanese running toward him
and disappearing in a Japanese store
near Eighteenth street. Two blocks
farther on Robinson was murdered.
The police say that a large number
of the spectators in court are what I
are known as "yegg men" or "hoboes" I
who are deeply interested in the result
of the trial. The case will go on this
morning.

Christopher Columbus, accused of

"And if any man is entitled to kind

It was to examine the ordinances

was why he struck Whaley. He said

SUPREME COURT FINDS
IT HAS BROKEN LAW
Modoc Lynching Case Shows
Judges Are in Fault
Justices Lose Three Years'
Salaries by Delays.
The Supreme Court made the start
ling discovery yesterday that Superior
! Judge John E. Raker of Modoc County
was holding office while under sen
tence for contempt, and that the Jus
tices of the State's highest tribunal
had been collecting their salaries ille
| gaily for more than three years be
cause they had not decided the appeal
from contempt proceedings within the
three months prescribed. Consterna
| tion reigned on the seventh floor of the
I Parrott building for several hours and
j at closing time last night the jurists
I were in a dilemma as to what should
ibe done about the matter. It is ex
pected that some order which will
solve the perplexing problem will be
made to-day.
This legal difficulty Is a direct result
of the historic lynching of flve, people
near Lookout, Modoc County, on May
| 31, 1901. The victims were Calvin,
| Frank, James and Martin Hall and B.
:D. Yantis. Their offenses amounted
I to nothing more than nocturnal raids
I upon clotheslines and woodsheds. But
the residents of Lookout and its vi
cinity became enraged. There seemed
no absolute proof that the suspected
Hall family was guilty of the petty
crimes and yet there was no one in
the neighborhood but that believed
them responsible. When the suspicion
i grew to be a moral certainty the male
jopulation organized to put a stop to
the evil.
After some argument by night rash
counsel prevailed and it was decided
to lynch the suspects. The father of
the family had married a squaw and
the progeny was of the half-breed
type. Yantis was not a blood relation,
but had joined his fortunes with those
of the Halls. It was never disputed
that the whole outfit was of no use
to itself and a positive detriment to
the community.
HANG FIVE ON BRIDGE.
At midnight the ranchers gathered
at the grocery store owned by the Jus
tice of the Peace. Every man covered
I hLs face with a mask. With rope In
i hnnd the crowd marched on the Hall
abode. The five disreputable members
of the family were found at home.
They were summarily dragged from
their beds, half clothed, and hurried
; out into the night. The younger vlc-
I timÃ pleaded plteously for their
I escape from what they thought was to
be merely a beating or a coat of tar
and feathers. Until the last they fail
ed to realize the grim purpose of their
captors.
The crowd hurried away from the
town, dragging the fear-stricken vic
tims or urging them on with curses
and blows. Down the shaded road
the strange assemblage disappeared
from the sight of the few women bold
enough to venture out into the night
and of the men who dared not take
part in the dastardly crime.
When a bridge over a gorge had
been reached the party halted. A
noose, previously prepared, was
placed around the neck of Calvin Hall,
72 years of age, the other end of the
rope was strung around a stringer of
the bridge and the old man, tottering
with his years and fright, was pushed
off to his death. Frank and James
Hall and Yantis were murdered, one
by one. It is related that one of the
Kail boys, seeing the awful fate of his
associates and knowing that death im
pended, made a heroic fight for life.
His skull was smashed in by one of
the lynchers and the lifeless bo/iy was
then dangled at the end of a rope.
BOY GETS NO MERCY.
The last of the family to be sent into
eternity was Martin Hall, thirteen
years of age. One or two of the mask
ed criminals suggested that the child's
life be spared, but the others were in
exorable. While the little fellow pray
ed for mercy, the strong-armed ranch
ers of Lookout twisted the hemp about
his neck and kicked his frail body
from the bridge. The work was done
and the murderers returned to their
homes contented.
Next day the strange spectacle of
five bodies swinging from the bridge
told to the world the story of an awful
crime. Modoc County was aroused
from one end to the other. Some said
the deed was justified, others demand
ed an investigation and the punish
ment of the murderers. After several
weeks the authorities arrested nineteen
suspects. Whether these men were
guilty or not has never been settled.
Attorney General Ford sent a deputy
to assist the prosecution. Detective
Thomas Gibson of the municipal police
force was also at Alturas- and at Look
out to aid the peace officers. Ex-Su
perlor Judge G. F. Harris and John
Raker, the present Superior Judge,
were engaged by the defendants as
counsel.
LAWYERS ARE SENTENCED.
The attorneys for the prisoners pre
| pared petitions for writs of habeag
corpus which Judge Harrington de
cided were contemptuous. He senten
ced them to pay fines of $500 each, with
the alternative of five days in Jail.
Harris spent three days behind the
I bars, while Raker hastened to San
I Francisco to ask the Supreme Court
j for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf
iof his colleague. An alternative writ
I was issued and dates were set for the
: filing of briefs. There the matter end
. Ed so far as was Â«ho\vn by the records
; up to yesterday.
Forgetful of the proceedings before
! the Justices once a temporary stay had
I been granted. Judge Harrington enter
| ed upon the hearing of the lynching
I cases. A few days after th,e trial had
! begun, two of the suspects made what
â¢ were alleged by the Attorney General
, to be bona fide, and by Attorneys Ra
ker and Harris to be fraudulent, con
fessions. The trial resulted In a dis
agreement, and as no new jurors could
be obtained in Modoc County, the case j
was dropped and the prisoners were
, released. The two men who had con
fessed disappeared. It Is reported that
one died and that the other went crazy.
Judge Harrington, who tried the
case, disappeared from sight when his
term of office expired. Attorney Raker,
in the face of tremendous opposition,
was elected Superior Judge. One of the
important witnesses in the trial was
subsequently shot on a lonely road, and
another died from the effects of poison.
WANTS Tt) CLEAR RECORD.
A few weeks ago. Judge Raker ac
cidentally discovered that he was hold
ing office while under the old sentence
"for contempt. He felt that it was his
duty to clear his record or execute the
judgment" of his predecessor on the
bench. Accordingly he came to San
Francisco a week ago to investigate the
matter. He learned that the case had
, legal standing in the Supreme Court ia
spite of the lapse of time. For some
unaccountable reason, the proceeding
had been lost in the court record, but
it was found yesterday.
Judge Raker immediately filed a pe
tition asking that the case be disposed
of. The Justices were thunderstruck.
The statutes of California provide that
the members of the Supreme Court
cannot collect their salaries when any
case is pending for a period of more
than three months. The Raker and
Harris contempt case has been on the
files for more than three years. Mean
while the Justices have unknowingly
been collecting their salaries in viola
tion of the law. Judge Raker is con
fident that Judge Harrington exceeded
his jurisdiction in making the orders
of contempt and that the Supreme
Court will set him and Attorney Harris
free. The case was taken under ad
visement yesterday and it Is expected
that a decision in the matter will be
rendered to-day.
Judge Raker says the lynching Inci
dent has been almost forgotten in
Modoc. The county Is more prosperous
than ever before, and the people of the
section are expecting great benefits
from the Congressional appropriation
for the Klamath irrigation project.
The Supreme Court records show that
there has never been a single appeal
from one of Judge Raker's decisions
since he has been in office.
PLUNDER IN CAVF FOUND
BY RAILROAD DETECTIVES
Three Members of a Gang Known aa
the Forty Thieves Are Arrested
for Bnrclary.
Three members of a gang known
as the "forty thieves" were arrested
on Tuesday by Detectives Lewin and
Madden of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. They wer* charged with petty
larceny, but to-day the charge will be
changed to burglary.
The gang has been breaking into
the Southern Pacific shops at Six
teenth street and stealing brass jour
nal bearings and other articles, which
they carried to a cave at Alameda and
Potrero avenues. The officers went
to the cave on Tuesday, but were seen
by two lookouts who gave the alarm
and the three defendants ran out of
the cave. The officers chased them
and fired shots in the air to intimi
date them, but they escaped. They
were subsequently arrested.
The officers went back to the cave
and found about 400 pounds of brass
journal bearings and several sledge
hammers which had been stolen from
the shops. They took possession of
the property. The police say the same
gang has been terrorizing people in
the neighborhood of the cave. Several
were arrested about a month ego by
Detectives Regan and O'Connell. but
as nothing could be proved against
them they were discharged.
HIS MOTHER DECLARES THAT
SHE WILL ANNUL MARRL4GK
Emil E. McCartney. Son of the Well-
Known Club Woman, Marries
Miss Edith Knox.
Emil E. McCartney was married to
Edith Knox at Berkeley by Justice of
the Peace Edgar. That does not sound
exactly like a spring idyl, but it is
one.
Emil is 20, Edith is 19. Emil waa
engaged to some one whom hia
mother, Mrs. Samuel McCartney, the
well-known club woman, considered a
desirable match for her young hope
ful.
Emil met Miss Edith Knox and
mamma's plans went wrong, as the
best laid plans will. It was love at
first sight â it always is in the spring
time.
So they stole away to Berkeley and
were married on Tuesday. Now there
ia trouble. Mrs. McCartney Sr. is
shocked and the bride's father, Harry
Knox, president of the State Fed
eration of Labor, is fumtng.
The young husband cannot see why
all the fuss is raised, neither can the
pretty little bride. But nevertheless
Mrs. McCartney declares that the mar
riage will be annulled.
Mrs. McCartney is a member of the
California Whist League, the Forum
Club and other exclusive organiza
tions.

MAKES THREAT
TO KILL WIFE
Frank Daulton, Mad Because
She Obtained a Divorce,
Talks of Shooting Family
Following: close on the Bee Taylor
excitement in Judge Troutts court
room, Frank Daulton yesterday threat
ened to kill his wife and children and
to whip Attorney W. W. Davidson, who
got the wife's divorce. Mrs. Daulton,
followed by her children, rushed into
Judge Troutt's presence, and, with
scared face, appealed to the court for
protection from her husband.
She was followed by her daughters,
who were hysterical, and for an instant
the cause of the disturbance was unin
telligible. When Bailiff Sullivan calmed
the trembling women and escorted
them from the courtroom the mother
informed him that her husband threat
ened to kill her because she had got a
divorce.
Mrs. Daulton said that he had threat
ened to shoot her and her children with
a revolver he said he was carrying.
Prior to entering the courtroom the
Daultons were in the corridor outside.'
Daulton had his coat off and was
threatening Attorney Davidson with a
thrashing. When they rushed Into
court Daulton disappeared.
Bailiff Sullivan escorted the divorcee
to the car and during that time Daul
ton failed to appear to make good his
threat to shoot. Mrs. Daulton's two
girls, Effle and Gertrude, were still agi
tated as the party boarded the car.
The Daultons were married at St. Jo
seph, Mo., in 1882, and have been living
in this city at 510 Carlton street. In
the complaint for divorce many acts of
cruelty were recited. On the stand the
wife described how her husband beat
her and threw a heavy coffee cup at
her and struck her with a chair. She
said that Daulton had choked his
daughter Effie and dragged Gertrude
around the room by the hair, making
threats against the lives of all of them.
She was granted a divorce and custody
of the children and allowed $20 a month
for their support.
