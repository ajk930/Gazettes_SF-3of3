Japan dealt another blow at
.Russia yesterday when, near

TOKIO, Feb. 11. -Japan has formally declared war against
Russia and has so notified her Ministers abroad.
TOKIO, Feb. 10. â The Japanese have captured at least
five Russian commercial steamships, including the Ekaterino
slav, Mukden, Russia, Argun and the Alexander. They were
captttred by the Japanese in Korean and adjacent waters at vari
ous-times since Saturday,' by small cruisers. Some of the steam
ships are rich prizes. The small steamship Kotik is detained at
Yokohama, its status not being clear. The Ekaterinoslav be
longed to the volunteer fleet.
A formal declaration of war is expected to-night. The
proclamation has been prepared and approved by the Cabinet.
Foreign Minister Komura has gone to the palace to obtain the
Emperor's approval.
Japan seized Masampho on Sunday and dispatched a heavy
force thither. Japan will fortify the port and establish a naval
and military. base, there. Masampho is an exceedingly import
ant point, as it controls the Korean channel and is an excellent
base for future operations.
Undaunted by the absence of official confirmation, Japan
is rejoicing over the great naval victory at Port Arthur on
Tuesday. The newspapers here published extra editions con
taining news of the battle, which produced the first popular
demonstration of the war. Flags were raised everywhere and
excited crowds thronged the streets.
The' news was accepted in official circles and transmitted
to the palace. This, combined with the bottling and destruction
of two ships at Chemulpo on Tuesday, , stirred . the populace to
the highest enthusiasm and gave additional confidence as to the
outcome of the war. Up to nightfall the Navy Department hati
not received any report from Admiral Togo or other direct
source and. was inclined to accept unofficial statements, but was
keenly anxious to learn the details of the result of the main en
gagement, although confident that Admiral Togo scored a
sweeping victory.
If the Russian fleet is crippled or destroyed an order to ad
vance the army will be given promptly.
The Mikado is personally superintending affairs and the
Cabinet holds daily sessions. The Government has issued or
ders for the protection of all Russian subjects residing in Japan.
Baron Kanako and Baron Sukematsu have been sent to the
United States and Great Britain to explain Japan's position and
attitude in the present conflict.

CANAL DRAFTS
TO BE GRADUAL
NEW YORK. Feb. 10. â Secretary
of the Treasury Shaw .was in confer
ence to-day with a number Of bankers
at the Sub-Treasury regarding, the
Government's payments 'of Panama
canal moneys.' Definite arrangements
have been .completed, ., the Secretary
said, to the end that' there may be no
disturbance of the local financial condi
tions. - :
After the conference with Secretary
Shaw the banks sent $12,000,000 In bonds
to the Sub-Treasury which will be
pledged temporarily to secure deposits
made with them of Government funds
by out-of-town banks. TheSe funds
will be held only a few days, , but the
additional deposits of collateral have
to be made in accordance with the law.
The Secretary made clear to-day the
point that the banks would n'ot be com
pelled to lose the use of the money
through the transfer to the Sub-Treas
ury. He said that the warrants for the
payment would be drawn on the Sub-
Treasury here, and that the demand
for the withdrawals from the banks
would be made simultaneously with
the presentation of the warrants for
payments.

Insurance Underwriters Organ

Will Pay Fifty Per Cent

CONTENTS OF BANK
"' VAULTS ARE INTACT
Mayor McLane Says the City
May Not Need Outside As
sistance and Money Already
Received Will Not Be Used
BALTIMORE, Feb. 10. â The open-
Ing to-day of the boardroom by the
Chamber of Commerce and the receipt
of quotations, the uninterrupted ship
ments of grain cargoes, the certainty
of State aid and the. notification by
some of the large insurance companies
of their readiness to pay 50 per cent
on losses and the action of the Legis
lature in asking for Federal troops in
stitute a chain of incidents which have
contributed materially to the restora
tion of public cdnfidence and cheerful
ness.
Mayor McLane has reconsidered
his previous determination to an
nounce that he would accept outside
a!d. On this subject he said:
"The situation here does not justify
such action. There is no destitution
ns yet.- I cannot tell what may fol
low. We have a Board of Charities,
which looks after the city's destitute.
This board is in close touch with all
the organized charities. An appro
priation is made annually for the pur
pose of taking care of cases of desti
tution. There are some funds on hand
now, and it may be that the State ap
propriation will be enough to take
care of those who require assistance.
In the course of the next few days I
will be in a better position to definitely
decide on this matter. We have re
ceived by contribution from various
cities about $7000 and additional of
fers of thousands* of dollars have been
made. The money already received
will be put aside until we can' deter
mine whether to ask for outside assist
ance."
The grain trade of the city has not
suffered to any extent. The fire did
not touch the elevators or railroad ter
minals and steamships are being load
ed as usual.
A number of large vaults and safes
were opened to-day and in each of
them the contents were found to be in
good condition. The $400,000 in coin
and legal tender notes was taken from
the vaults of the Third National Bank
and sent to the vaults of a bank out
side the fire district.
Telegrams, letters and resolutions
offering aid or sympathy are stiir be
ing, received at the Mayor's office.
Among them was a cablegram from
Liverpool announcing Ahat, at a. rep
resentative meeting \or, the % tradesmen
ofÂ« that city, a resolution was unani
mously passed tendering the sympathy
of that city to the citizens of Balti
more. A letter from the local Ger
man Consul was also received, . In
which he stated that he had been di
rected by Baron. von Rheinbaben, im
perial Secretary of State of Germany,
to extend the sympathy of the German
empire.
The fire insurance underwriters put
in a very busy day, perfecting their
organization and preparing to get at
the work of adjusting; the losses. The
agents of the seventy-five companies,
who organized yesterday, moved into
permanent headquarters at the rooms
of the Royal Arcanum.
A dozen "loss committees" were ap
pointed, and to-morrow these will be
gin adjusting the insurance.
The insurance companies are co
operating with the bank people in
their efforts to relieve the financial sit
uation. Some of the largest companies
and some of the smaller ones have de
cided to pay immediately 50 per cent
of the claims presented to them, where
the loss was total or nearly. so, leav
ing the remainder to be paid after the
insurance has been finally adjusted. A
few small claims were paid by some
companies to-day.

HANNA PASSES
A QUIET DAY
Doctors Say the General Con
ditions Are Unchanged, but
Stomach Shows Improvement
HEART ACTION SPLENDID
The Physicians Are Guarding
Ag-ainst Complications, as
the Crisis Is Yet to Come
WASHINGTON, Feb." 10. â Senator
Hanna's condition remains practically
unchanged. The restlessness which
fatigued him last night has been - fol
lowed by periods of comparative quiet
and sleep during the day, and the ir
ritability of the stomach has . again
partially yielded to treatment. It 's
this feature of the case that the phy
cians are guarding, zealously, against,
as they realize .that if any complica
tions develop in the Senator's distress
ingly weak condition the result may
be fatal quickly. The doctors are not
yet able to predict with any certainty
when the crisis in the case will oc
cur. All they know for certain is that
the Senator now has had the fever
continuously for eleven days, and
the disease, they say, generally runs
its course in three or four weeks. The
doctors say they are satisfied with the
progress of the case, although they do
not conceal their apprehension that
unforeseen complications may arise
at any time.
Dr. Osier, the Baltimore diagnosti
cian, made a very thorough examina
tion o{ the Senator during this after
noon, and. at its conclusion remarked
to one of those at his bedside that his
heart's action was splendid. The Sen
ator's other vital organs also are
working well, with the exception of
the stomach. #
A new kind of nourishment was
given the Senator during the day in
addition to the milk diet, and it is
said he retained most of it. During
the afternoon he slept about three
hours. He is always rational and
seems anxious to converse, although
every effort is made to keep him as
quiet as possible. The Senator's
brother, H. 'M. Hanna, who spent a
good part of the day in the sick room,
said to-night it was the best day the
Senator had passed since Sunday.
Shortly after 7 o'clock the doctors
issued the following bulletin on Sena
tor Hanna's condition:
"Mr. / Hanna's temperature at 6
o'clock was 100 2-10. pulse 92, respi
ration 24. There has been some irri
tability of the stomach. Otherwise the
symptoms are favorable and there are
no complications. (Signed),

MACHEN GOES
INTO DETAILS
Explains His Connection With
Oil Ventures and as to Busi
ness Dealings AVith Lorenz
ON THE STAND ALL DAT
Counsel Wrangle Over Matter
of Questioning the Defendant
Concerning'His Bank Account
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â In the pos
tal trial to-day August W. Machen oc
cupied the stand the entire day, for
the most part being under examination.
As yesterday, he was thoroughly com
posed and gave his testimony in con
versational style, often putting ques
tions to Attorney Conrad designed to
assist him in bringing out some partic
ular point. He went over hi3 connec
tion with the oil venture in great detail,
and in many instances did not require
documents to refresh his memory, say
ing he could give the facts "by heart."
He reiterated the statement that he
recommended the Groff fastener be
cause of its merits, and not through the
influence either of the Groffs or Lorenz.
He explained that when he came to
Washington to assume his duties he
owed $20,000, and at the present time
owes but $2000 of that debt. It was
brought out by the Government that
since 1899 Machen had deposited in a
Westminster, Md., bank more than $77,
000, and the Government sought to
show that it was impossible for him
from the various sources mentioned by
him to have received this amount of
money. A wrangle of counsel lasting
half an hour followed over the pro
priety of a question bearing on the
point, the court reserving its decision
after requesting the question to be
withdrawn temporarily.

ance for the year of $8,964,431, a de

MUST PAY CREDITORS
OR GO TO PRISON-
Clothing Merchants Make False Re
tarns In Bankruptcy Case and
Are Arrested.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 10. â This
nfternoon Federal Judge Hanford in
the bankruptcy proceedings against
Samuel Isaacs, a clothing merchant of
Seattle, and Alexander Isaacs, a cloth
ing merchant of San Francisco, ad
judged them guilty of contempt in dis
obeying a court order and remanded
them to jail until they pay certain
moneys to their creditors. Neither of
the Isaacs brothers was present and
warrants were issued.
ThÂ«Â» ca5e dates back two years, at
the time when the Isaacs made an as
signment here for the benefit of their
creditors. A large number of credit
ors refused to accept their settlement
and filed an involuntary petition in
bankruptcy. The referee reported to
the creditors that Samuel Isaacs had
goods and chattels to the amount of
$7000 that he had made no report of
nnd that Alexander Isaacs likewise
had $7000 in goods and $1000 cash.
Referee Worden ordered them to
pay to the creditors $15,000. They re
fused and appealed to Judge Hanford.
H? confirmed the decision of the
referee. In his opinion to-day Judge
Hanford stated that there had been a
â¢ *Â»rtain amount of property unaccount
ed for; that the Isaacs were asked to
account for it and had refused to do
so and had refused to make an ex
planation. The court held that the
books kept by the Isaacs did not
clearly show their financial standing.
In conclusion he ordered both men to
be errested and placed in the Tacoma
Jail until they pay over the money as
ordered.

DEATH DARKENS
CHICO MYSTERY
Miss Eva 3IoakÂ» Young Woman
.Who AVas Shot by Unknown
Man, Succumbs to Injuries
NO CLEW TO MURDERER
Victim Protests That She Was
Not Warned and That She
Did Not Know Her Assailant
Special Dispatch to The Call
CHICO, Feb. 10.â Miss Eva Moak, the
5'oung lady who was shot down in cold
blood at her mother's ranch, seven
miles from this city, died to-day at
noon. The shock and loss of blood from
the severad artery in her right arm are
given as the immediate cause of her
death.
The entire tragedy is shrouded in the
deepest mystery. The young lady de
clared positively time and again that
ehe did not see the party who shot
her, and had no idea who her assailant
was. She had been in the barn for
Eome minutes when the shots were
fired. It was some time after ehe had
ran fainting into the house before any
one approached the barn, thus a party
secreted there would have had ample
time to escape unseen.
To-day officers found the marks of
three bullets in the roof of the side of
the barn, and Constable Handman
found a bullet very much flattened on
the ground beneath these marks. It
was that of a 38-caliber revolver. To
day a blood stain was found on the
side of the barn opposite which the
wounded girl made her escape. It was
on the side of one of the small win
dows, and looked as though some one
with a blood-stained hand had clam
bered through this window.
As it is not within the range of vision
of parties at or about the houses, the
theory is advanced that the murderer
made his escape through this window.
As to the blood, two theories are worth
consideringâ either her murderer shot
himself accidentally in his hurry to
pocket his weapon and escape, or he
struggled with the girl after she was
wounded. The last is contradicted by
the young lady's own testimony, as
well as by the fact that no blood was
seen upon the hay, such as would have
been the case had she remained many
seconds after being shot.
Sheriff Wilson and District Attorney
Sexton came over to-day and remained
in Chico. An inquest will be held on the
remains at 10 o'clock to-morrow, but it
is not believed that any new evidence
will be produced.
WESTERN* PACIFIC BUYS

STOCKTON. Feb. 10. â A deed con
veying to the Western Pacific Railroad
Company the property of the Alameda
and San Joaquin Railway Company,
commonly called the Tesla coal road,
running between Stockton and Tesla,
a distance of about thirty miles, was
filed with the Recorder of San Joaquin
County this afternoon. The considera
tion is given as $10. First mortgage
bonds of the Western Pacific Railroad
Company to the Bowling Green Trust
Company of New York for $50,000,000

way has one of the finest roadbeds in
the West and has quite an equipment
of rolling stock. It taps a belt having
an inexhaustible supply of gravel, coal,
clay, glass sand, magnesia ore and
lime rock. In addition to the railway
interests the Tesla people have a
briquette factory, a cement works,
brick and pottery works, pipe works
and lime kilns, and the town of Tesla
at the southern terminus of the road
is practically the property of the same
interests, of which W. J. Bartnett.
president of the Western Pacific Rail

stood that the property mentioned will
become the property of the Western
Pacific road, which will pass through

DIES FOR LOVE
OF IN ACTRESS
George A. Yielding Shoots
Himself at the Door of
Florence Boberts' Eoom
WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR
Young Man Had Been Given
a Trial in Some Minor Parts
in the Company, but Failed
SPOKANE, Wash., Feb. 10.â In a fit
of despondency because he could not
secure an engagement with the Flor
ence Roberts theatrical company, now
playing in Spokane, George A. Yield
ing, an actor recently with the Paul
Gilmore company, stood before the
door of the actress' room at the Hotel
Spokane this afternoon and blew out
his brains with a revolver. . He fell
against the door, expiring instantly,
while the actress went into a swoon.
Yielding was formerly an engraver
and is said to have a divorced wife in
Rochester, N.^Y. He followed the
Roberts company for some time, ap
parently infatuated with the star, and
was given some minor parts, but failed
in them. Miss Roberts discharged him
and he joined the Gilmore show in
Portland..
He appeared in Spokane to-day and
was most importune in his pleading to
be given another trial. He threatened
to kill himself unless taken on again.
A detective was assigned to watch him
as it was feared he might do harm to
the actress, owing to his wrought up
state of mind. This afternoon Yielding
walked rapidly down the little hall
leading to Miss Roberts' room, while
the detective Avas standing in the par
lor near by, and committed his rash
deed before the officer could reach him.
Yielding was about 31 years of age
and 'was of a strangely morose disposi
tion for an actor. .He had been paying
considerable attention to Miss Roberts
whenever opportunity offered while a
member of the company, and it is said
he was discharged aa much on account
of his unwelcome attentions as because
he was not a good actor.
SHOWS A GREAT GAIN*
IX ASSETS AND SURPLUS
Statement of the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company Gives Evidence
of General Prosperity of Country.
NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â In the face of
the general depression in financial cir
cles and the shrinkage in industrial
and other securities no better evidence
of the general prosperity of the coun
try and the thrift of the people could
be given than is contained in the re
cently published statement of the Met
ropolitan Life Insurance Company.
This company shows a great gain in
assets and, notwithstanding market de
pression, a handsome gain in surplus.
It issued in 1903 5398.8S9.074 of new in
surances, a larger amount than that
issued by any company in the world.
It has done this for the last ten years,
it has 7,523,915 policies in force, which
is a larger number than is held by all the
other regular life insurance companies
in American put together lees one;
equivalent to policies on one-tenth of
the total of "*the, United
States; greater than the combined pop
ulation of twenty-nine States and Ter
ritories, or, as the reports put it, great
er than the combined population of
Greater New York, Chicago, Philadel
phia, Boston and St. Louis. When one
realizes ,that an average of one out of
every* te'n human beings â men, women
and children â one passes on the street
is insured in the Metropolitan Life the
widespread beneficence vt this great
company can be appreciated.
The income of the Metropolitan Life
in 1903 was $49,887,804 11. and it paid
out to policy holders and added to Its
reserve fund $98,582 76 every business
day of the past year. The company
now holds assets of $105,056,311 60 for
the benefit pf its policy holders and a
reserve fund consisting of capital and
surplus over and above every liability
of $10,691,872.
The success of the Metropolitan has
been so great that it recently an
nounced a special dividend, which will
amount to about $600,000 (in addition
to over four and a half millions paid
in the past seven years), for certain
classes of policy hc-lders who had con
tinued with the company, a dividend
not nominated in the" insurance con
tract, and which is a windfall to the

VANDALS WORK
IN SEATTLE
SEATTLE, Feb. 10.â Lives of passen
gers and train men on the Interurban
electric line between Seattle and Ta
coma. were endangered^ Sunday and
Monday nights by several attempts to
wreck trains. Planks, ties, rocks and
tree limbs were lashed across the rails,
but by strange good fortune and be
cause of the watchfulness of the mo
tormen a disaster was averted.
Sunday night a Renton Incoming car
struck a three-inch plan tied to the
rails. The heavy wheels cut this in
two and the car passed on without in
jury. Later the same evening three ties
with a large bowlder were lashed
across the track. The motorman of the
outgoing Interurban train caught sight
of the obstruction ahead of him and
brought the train to a stop within a
few feet of the timbers.
Monday night the attempts were re
peated. A heavy tree limb was tied to
the track. It was seen in time and was
removed by the trainmen. A stone was
suspended by a large cord from the
trolley wire on the South Seattle line.
This hung directly over the center of
the track. When the motorman of an
incoming Georgetown car saw the rock
it was too late to stop his car. He shut
off the power and turned on the brakes,
then sprang back just as the crashing
of glass came. The big window in
front of the vestibule was splintered,
but no further harm was done. The
.wheel of the trolley- burned the cords
and the stone fell on ton of the car.
A lookout for the train wreckers Is
being kept by officers. .

SAN JOSE, Feb. 10.â Mrs. Giacinta

her hand in marriage to-day to settle
a $1000 breach of promise suit. A few

Mrs. Grassi's husband died, leaving her
a small fortune. Besides cash, she has
a home in this city and a ranch In Ven

brother-in-law was as good as his dead
brother and would make her an ideal
husband. She at once wrote to New
York and asked him to come and
marry her. He responded at once. Mrs.
Grassi was not pleased with his looks
and when she learned he had no money
she refused to marry him.
Michele Grassi at once brought a
breach of promise suit demanding
$1000 for his damaged affections. The
widow concluded she would rather wed

JAPANESE FORCES WILL ATTEMPT INVESTMENT OF PORT ARTHUR BY LAND AND SEA
Russian Populace Fears Full Extent of the Far East
Disasters Has Not Been Revealed.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 10.â Viceroy
AlexiefT began to-day the tmobilization
of the army corns in East Asia.
The publication of extra editions of
the newspapers containing accounts of
the reported injuries to Japanese ships
during the Port Arthur engagements
and the sinking of the Japanese bat
tieship Shikishima led to a demand
upon the editors for the source of their
information. They replied. "It came
from the British embassy."
Those reports were received every
where with manifestations of joy, but
nothing confirming them has come
from Viceroy Alexieff.
SCOTT'S EMULSION.

N o r t h-woodsman eats
lots of fat' pork and
the Norwegian fisherman
takes lots of cod liver oil.
They are all heat-produc-
ing foods.
Scott's Emulsion is the
best protection against
colds, grippe and pneu-
monia, because it is a
heat ' and fat producing
food of the highest
quality.
The only additional information the
Viceroy has sent up to this hour Is the
names of the wounded officers, among
whom were Lieutenant Colonel Zai
ontchkovsky of the artillery corps, who
v.as on board the transport Angora,
and a midshipman on board the battle
ship Sevastopol.
Some of the newspapers here printed
extras claiming a Russian victory at
Port Arthur. Three Japanese warships
and fourtorpedo-boats are reported to
have been seriously crippled. One re
pcrt says the Japanese battleship Shi
kishima was sunk. The people are
demonstrating, but there is no official
oonflrmation of the report and the an
nouncement Is discredited.
ItESEKVKS WILL " BE SENT.
All of the members of the reserves
have bean commanded to remain at
their present abodes, so that they can
be found ready when it istlecided to call
them out. One company of every regi
ment of guard troops of St. Petersburg
and Moscow Is to be sent to the Far
East.
There was a great demonstration at
the Naval Academy to-day when the
Czar personally advanced the senior
class to the rank of officers. The Czar,
who wore an admiral's uniform, in
addressing the cadets, said:
"You are aware, gentlemen, that
two days ago war was declared upon
us. The insolent foe came by night
and attacked our stronghold and fleet.
Russia now needs her navy as well as
her army. I have come to-day to pro
mote you to the rank of midshipmen.
I am confident that, like your revered
predecessors. Admirals Chicagof,
Lazaref. Nakhimof. Karnllof and Is
tomin, you will work for the welfare
and glory of our fatherland and de
vote all your energies to the fleet over
which flies the flag of St. Andrew."
EAGER TO SEE FIGHTING.
After his Majesty's departure the
newly promoted officers hired sleighs
and drove up arid down the quay

in their black tunica, unmindful of
the bitter cold. - Grave visaged gen

was that their service uniforms were

egrams from abroad concerning the
attack have been received. All news
paper dispatches over the Siberian
lines have been stopped and . the tel
egraph office refuses to accept tele
grams for the Far East, except over
the Persian line. â 
Skepticism is expressed in certain
quarters that the full extent of the
Russian losses. has not been given out,
but in Government circles the official
bulletins are accepted as accurately
representing the extent of the disaster,
the general expression being that the
Russian authorities did not expect early
success, especially at sea. , . .. , .-â 
The whole city waited anxiously last
night for official news. Extraordinary
scenes were witnessed in and around
the newspaper offices, and a crowd of
people literally besieged the Ministry
of the Interior, where the Official Mes
senger is â  published, smart carriages
driving in quick succession and the
highest and lowest of the Inhabitants
waiting in- the anteroom or in the
snow-covered street patiently far Into
the morning for* official bulletins. The
text of these communications' had
leaked out among the newspaper men,
but as the law forbids publication of
such comments until they, have ap
peared in the Official Messenger the
editors had to wait until the Govern
ment organ printed the news before
starting their own presses.
EAGER FOR NEWS FROM FRONT.
A press representative calling upon a
well-known editor found him surround
ed by a throng of prominent citizens,
who were imploring him to read to
them the telegrams he had. Just re
ceived. The editor, pale with emotion,
recited the narrative of the bombard
ment of Port Arthur. Many people kept
coming In and the editor ' was â  com
pelled to read it over and over again.
The crowds expressed ' serious impa
tience at the fact that nothing was
said about injuries inflicted . upon the
Japanese warships. " â¢'â¢
This morning the city was. placarded
with the imperial ' manifesto. . The in
tense indignation with which the news
of the "stab in the back" inflicted by
Japan . was -. received â¢ here " seems , to be
general throughout Russia. The whole

ACCUSE JAPAN OF TREACHERY.
The newspapers in general denounce
the action of Japan as being treacher
ous, declaring that it is "truly Asiatic,"
but insisting that the issue of the con
flict' will not be decided by the naval
engagements, as the Japanese will have
to meet Russia on dry land, when the
score will be wiped aut. The Novoe
Vreroya says it is quite possible that
the whole of Korea has been overrun
by Japanese soldiers in, disguise and
that Russia may first have to assume
the aggressive, r but when her forces
In Southern Manchuria and Korea are
increased the Japanese will realize
what they have to meet.
"God, right and international law are
on our side," the Russ says. "One hun
dred and thirty million Russian hearts
are beating in unison In the desire to
expunge the traitorous slight on Rus
sian honor. Enough of defensive tac
tics; let us drive out the foe."
The Bourse Gazette says: "Yesterday
we longed for. peace. Now we think
only of war. The world soon will be
startled by Russia's heroic work. Japan
has. placed herself beyond the pale of
civilization. The upstart, pigmy Jap
anese would not have dared to attack
the Government of Russia without the
encouragement of England and Ameri
ca."-. . -
In this connection the Russ claims to
have authority, for saying that the two
new Japanese .warships (the Nlsshin
and Kasaga) were saved from certain
capture by the Russian squadron bound
for the Far East under Admiral Wireua

LONDON, Feb. 10. â Baron Hayashl.
the Japanese Minister here, has re
ceived official confirmation from Tokio
of the destruction at Chemulpo of the
Russian first class cruiser Variag and
the gunboat Korutz.
The text of the official dispatch re
ceived by Baron Hayashl Is as follows:
"On Monday a Japanese squadron
escorting transports met on the way
to Chemulpo, Korea, the Russian gun
boat Korutz, as the latter was coming
out of port. The Korutz took up aÂ»
offensive attitude toward the Japanese
vessels, and fired upon the Japanese
torpedo boats. The latter discharged
two torpedoes Ineffectively and then
the Korutz returned to her anchorage
In the port.
"Early in the morning of Tuesday
Admiral Urik, commandhg the Japan
ese squadron, formally called upon the
Russian warships to leave Chemulpo
before noon. The Admiral added that
if his demand was not complied with
he would be compelled to attack them
in the harbor. The two Russian war
ships left the port at 11:30 o'clock and
a battle ensued outside the Polynesian
Islands. After an hour's engagement
the Russian warships sought refuge
among the islands, Toward evening
the Russian cruiser Variag sank and at
4 o'clock this morning. February 10.
the Korutz was also reported to have
sunk, having been blown up. The of
ficers and men of the two sunken ves
sels sought refuge on the French cruis
er Pascal. There were no casualties
on the Japanese side.'*
TO ATTACK '^RT ARTHUR.
"We were slow .in negotiating, so
we are making- u_* for lost time by
quickness in action." said Baron Hay
ashi this morning. "The engage
ments at Port Arthur and Chemulpo
were merely in accordance with plans
long matured. As soon as our forces
are landed in Korea I look for an im
portant fleet action at Port Arthur.
"The Russian vessels are not likely
to give up the advantage they gained
by being under the cover of their land
batteries. By going to the Chinese
side, however, the Japanese fleet, by
high angle fire, can drop in shells
which should make it very uncom
fortable for the Russian ships lying
moored close to one another. Thereby
it is hoped to drive out Viceroy Alex
ieft's forces. Possibly, like Admiral
Cervera. he may anticipate fate and
come intq the open of his own ac
cord. At present events merely go to
show the ' utter uselessness of Port
Arthur from a strategic viewpoint."

rector general of the military intelli

A. ' J. Haldale of the Gordon High

Herald. Coryrirht. i$oj # by the New York
I: â : -. 1 Publishing Company.
CHEFU, Feb. 10. 1:45 p. m.. eastern
time. â I have just interviewed the Jap
enese Consul in Chefu. He says that
when he was informed by his Govern
ment that the Japanese Minister in St.
Petersburg was withdrawn on the 6th
inst. he chartered a British vessel and
went to Port Arthur and Dalny to take
off refugees. He was afforded every fa
tility by the Russian Government of
ficials in Port Arthur. The quarantine
was removed and the Consul entered
the town in his official dress. He was
saluted by eoldlers and invited to din
ner hy a high official, where a toast
was drunk that peace might be re
stored.
After leaving Dalny he encountered
the Japanese fleet about eighteen miles
from Port Arthur. A high naval Japa
nese commander traveled as a menial
in the Consul's train to Port Arthur
and noted the exact position of the
Russian ships, and also that they had
rot pot steam up and were not keeping
& sharp lookout.
As soon as the Japanese fleet was
flighted signals were interchanged and
the Japanese naval officer was taken
aboard the flagship. There he made a
detailed report of his observations to
Admiral Togo.
I saw this commander, who wishes
his name withheld, and he explained
to me with marvelous accuracy the
course of the fight, though he had not
eeen it. He said the Russians were in
four lines. In the first line, next to the
entrance, were the Boyarin and Novik.
In the second were the Petropolavsk,
the Pobieda and tho Poltava; in the
third the Peresviet. the Retvizan. the
Sevastopol and the Cesarevltch. and In
the fourth the Naverin. the Diana, the
Pallada and the Askold.
In front of all was the Angara, the
only ghip which used searchlights.
The torpedoed battleships were the
C**sarevitch and the Poltava, The tor
pedoed cruisor was the Boyarin.
It will thus be seen that the Japanese
torpedo-boats carried out an exceed
ingly bold venture.
There is no Illumination In the oil of
hypocrisy.

Secretary Hay's Note Brings Enough Favorable Replies to Insure Concurrent
Action by the World's Powers to Localize the War.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 10.â Secretary
Hay to-night sent the draft of the dec
laration of American neutrality to the
President for his signature and it will
be issued from the State Department
to-morrow. - % /
Having received enough favorable re
plies to insure the concurrent action
of European powers in his endeavor
to- localize within as small an area as
possible the hostilities in the Far East
and to insure over as much of China
as possible her neutrality. Secretary
Hay to-night addressed notes to Rus
sia and Japan, Inviting their co-opera
tion in this endeavor, and announcing
that the United States stood stalwartly
for this principle. It was known in
advance that both the combatants de
sired the localization of the war. ,
In the present period of the negotia
tions State Department officials find it
inexpedient to discuss the various steps
which led up to the Issuance of the
note, but from a diplomat whose gov
ernment, while entirely neutral, is con
versant with the progress of events,
this statement was obtained to-night:
"To Secretary Hay undoubtedly be
longs the full credit for the' initiation
of this policy, which is the boldest step
yet taken by any country for the pres
ervation of the Integrity of China. The
Washington Government, however,
awaited the suggestion from another
power before issuing the circular note.
Germany called the attention of the
United States to the desirability of
limiting the hostilities to the two com
batant powers. Among the confreres
the belief Is general' that Germany
acted with the knowledge of Russia,
but of this I am not certain. In this
connection it should be remembered
that both Russia and Japan are most
anxious to confine hostilities to them
selves, and in this they undoubtedly
have the support of .my government
and all the powers. It was impossible
for Great Britain to make the sugges
tion and hope for Its serious consider
ation -by Russia. France would have
been disposed to regard with suspicion
any Buch proposition coming from Ger
many and Japan would have hesitated
to acquiesce In a like suggestion ema
nating from France. The United States
was the only power that could take the
initiative.
"Not only, however, has the Secre
tary suggested the limiting of the zone
of hostilities, but he has Improved the
opportunity to make another step to
ward preserving China's Integrity. Ex
amination of his note will show no
reference whatsoever to the Integrity
of China, but certainly the neutraliza
tion of that country must contribute
powerfully to the preservation of
China's Integrity and the maintenance
of Its administrative control. The note
is general In character and therein lies
its greatest strength. Germany was
the first to respond . favorably. In the
case of France It was necessary for
that Government to assure itself that
THE SAN â¢ FRANCISCO CALD, THURSDAY/FEBRUARY 11. ,1901.
there was nothing in the suggestion to
which Russia might take exception."
On the authority of a high adminis
tration official It can be stated that
this Government has no intention of
suggesting anything about Korea. It
is recognized that Korea is the natural
battle ground, and it is useless to dis
cuss the neutralization of that country.
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS
DISTRUST THE PURPOSE
OF UNITED STATES
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 10. â The
statement that Secretary Hay had is
sued a note to the powers asking them
to join in insisting on the recognition
of the Integrity of China and Korea
during, and after hostilities created
much comment in diplomatic circles
here, where any action taken with the
view of localizing the theater of war
is welcomed. . There seemed to be
great doubt, however, of the propriety
of. adhering to the latter clauses of
H^y's note, pending more definite ad
vices.
At the Foreign Office, where there Is
some disposition fo distrust the pur
poses of the United States, an authori
tative expression was not given.
Foreign Minister Lamsdorff, talking
to the diplomats at his reception this
afternoon, spoke feelingly of Japan's
action and declared the Czar had done
all In his power to avoid a conflict, but
the events of the past few days had
proved Japan to- be bent upon war
and that no concessions Russia could
offered would have restrained her.
FRANCE NOT IN ACCORD
WITH HAY'S PROPOSAL
FOR CHINA'S INTEGRITY
PARIS, Feb. 10.â The overtures of
the United States Government to the
powers for preserving the neutrality
and integrity of China during .and' after
the .hostilities, are -attracting -wide
spread attention. - .Â«
United States Embassador ' Porter
conferred with Foreign Minister Del
casse yesterday and again to-day. The
results have not been made public, but
the general situation is as follows: It
does not appear possible that an ac
cord of the powers can be . arrived at
at the present time, owing to the dif
ferences of views. It Is practically cer
tain that France will not take' any
action which could ..possibly be- con- :
strued â¢ as embarrassing Russia or as
seeking to coerce her concerning, the
integrity of China. .The Fcench author
ities appear quite. willing and even anx
ious to have China' declare her neutral
ity.-They desire to have. the least pos-
sible Interruption in international ship
ping in Far Eastern ports, and also
will seek, individually and collectively,
to confine the area of hostilities so as
to reduce the chance of a general spread
of the conflagration. But relative to
the Integrity of China it Is not likely
that any steps will be taken. If the
terni "China" is â  intended to Include
Manchuria, It is held that this is con
sistent with the past French attitude
concerning the-' integrity of China,
which was construed to be entirely dis
tinct from the provinces of- the Chi
nese empire, including Manchuria, Thi
bet and Mongolia.
However, the foregoing is only the
general .tendency, the negotiations be
ing still open, with the prospect of their
rather lengthy continuance.
It Is expected that Foreign Minister
Delcaeae will issue a circular denning
the views of the Government upon Sec
retary Hay's propositions..
Motono, the Japanese Minister here,
gave out an official communication to-*
day, reciting the history of the nego # - ;
tiatlons with Russia and maintaining
Japan's adherence throughout to the
Integrity of China and Korea. "

HAYASHI ANNOUNCES
THAT JAPANESE WILL
INVADE MANCHURIA
. LONDON, Feb. 10.â Dealing with
Secretary Hay's note to the powers oh
the subject of preserving the integrity
of China, â¢ Baron Hayashi, . the > Japan
ese Minister,' said to-day., - \
'] "The'; neutrality of : China was â  first
suggested \by} my, Government and we
received assurances that L Chinese," neu
trality would "be observed. , Japan will
certainly agree most heartily ;to Sec
retary I '.. Hay's :. proposition,' which'.ap
pears chiefly, to : be due to the suspicion
that ; Russia ' might \ find a pretext â¢ for
military action against China. If; how-
ever, the United States and other pow
ers contemplate the neutrality of Man
churia, the case becomes very compli
cated. So long as there are Russian
troops in Manchuria, Japan cannot re-
Bard it as neutral territory. I scarcely
think the United States. Great Britain
or any other power would be willing to
drive the Russians out of Manchuria,
however much they might insist that
Manchuria is part of neutral China.
So while we are anxious to assist in
assuring the neutrality of China proper
we have every intention of waging an
aggressive land campaign In Man
churia itself. Having resorted to arms,
we shall probably go farther than our
modest demands made during the ne
gotiations."
BEARS INSTRUCTIONS

WASHINGTON, Feb. 10. â J. M.

PRESS OF BERLIN
BITTER IN ATTACKS
UPON THIS NATION
Special â  Cable to The â  Call and New Tork
. Herald. Copyright. 1004. by the New York
Herald Publishing Company.
f BERLIN, Feb. 10.â Despite the fa
vorable attitude of the Government, the
Berlin -press is very bitter in its com
ment. ;on ". the action of v the United
States;: which is . accused of secretly
backing " up Japan. , It Is pointed out
ihat at first America asked only for
an >" open. door," and then extended this
to demanding guarantees of the integ-
rity of China. Now. it is declared, Mr.
Hay intends proposing that the powers
should take measures to limit the area
of hostilities. t ,
According to the Vosslsche Zeltung
Hay's proposals amount to an unmis
takable "hands off" on the part of the
United States. The success of Japanese
haste made a deep impression in Ber
lin In spite of German sympathy for
Russia. The courage, audacity and re
source shown by the Japanese forces
aroused admiration in military and
naval circles. Most newspapers reprint
with credit the Call-Herald's account
of the Japanese attack on Port Arthur,
which up to the present is the only ac
count from an eye-witness.
To-day I paid a visit to the Russian
embassy and found great ! bitterness
there on account of the behavior of
Japan. It was declared to be contrary
to all International law that she should
thus assume the aggressive without a
declaration of war.
POPE'S INFLUENCE
MIGHT HAVE STAYED
OUTBREAK OF WAR
ROME, Feb. 10.â The Voce Delia Ve
ritai the Vatican organ, to-day, refer
ring to the war in the Far East, says
that "illegitimate interference" pre
vented the late, Pope Leo participating
in the peace conference at The Hague,
adding: -
"The absence of a papal representa
tive has brought no good fortune to .the
conceiver of the conference, as the Czar
is the first. to fight with a foreign coun
try, and Europe has separated* herself
from the questions in dispute. If the
late Pope had participated in The
Hague conference perhaps the influence
of the present Pope might have resulted
in avoiding a conflict, the consequences
of which are immeasurable."
The Vatican authorities are most pre
occupied \ with the condition of the
Catholic. missions in Korea, Manchuria
and Japan, which are intrusted to Bish
ops belonging to the foreign mission of
Paris, who -have spiritual control over
90,000 Catholics in Japan, 4200 in Korea
and 3800 in Manchuria, it being predict
ed that ithe Catholics will suffer in the
eventv of either a victory or defeat of
Japan. .

LONXKDN. Feb. 10.â The Peklnr cor
respondent of the Times ascribes the
habitual over-estimation of the Rus
sian forces In the Far East to the
claim (arising from the Boxer troubles)
put forward by M. de Giers (then Rus
sian Minister at Peking) during the
peace negotiations at Peking in 1900
for an indemnity of Â£17.900,000. on the
ground that Russia had put 179.000
men In the field. It is now known,
however, that the real number of these
men will be under 100.000.
Continuing, the correspondent says
an American military officer who has
Just returned to Peking from a trip
through Manchuria, made for the pur
pose of reporting the situation, de
clares that all the Russian officers he
met in Manchuria professed to believe
war would be averted. While he was
at Port Arthur on January 31 the Rus

but in getting out two vessels stuck
fast in the mud of the shallow basin
and were compelled to remain behind.

PARIS, Feb. 10.â The Foreign Office
discredits the reports from Tientsin
yesterday of the French occupation of
Shanhalkwan, on the Gulf of LJaotung.
The officials here say the negotiations
on this subject occurred six months

RUSSIAN WARSHIPS AT CHEMULPO SUNK WHILE ATTEMPTING TO RUN THE GAUNTLET
Japanese Make Short Work of the
Variag and Korutz.
HIROSHIMA, Feb. lO.-The following
graphic story of the blowing up of the
Russian warships in. Chemulpo harbor
is given by a correspondent:
Admiral Uriu of the Japanese fleet,
who was a graduate of Aunapolis
Naval Academy in the class of 1S82, was
on Monday Â«5cortihg six transports
with 6000 soldiers from Tsushima to
Chemulpo, in which harbor the Russian
ships Variag and Korutz were lying.
Captian Rudnev, who was in com
mand of the Variag. pave notice of the
approach of the small Japanese squad
ron. As Uriu drew near he saw that
the . Russians were attempting to
escape. He signaled lo Captain Rud
nev to stop and ordered two torpedo
boats to cross .the bows qf the Russian
vessels at full speed. Rudnev held on.
opening fire on the torpedo-boats,
which then discharged two torpedoes
vlthout result.
Th*Â» Russian vessels then turned tail
and sought refuge in the harbor. The
Japanese vessels anchored trutside for
the night. Early on Tuesday morning
Admiral Uriu sent word that if the
Russian vessels remained there he
would attack thera in the harbor.
The captain of the Variag resolved
to run the gauntlet. He steamed out
and made for the shelter of the islands
off the Korean coast..
A running fight followed, in which
the Japanese did far better shooting
than the Russians.
Several versions are current .as. to
the exact result of the fight so far as
the Variag is concerned,, but I am re
liably Informed that she/was set on
fire and is now. a hopeless wreck.
Others say she was -sunk.
The fate of the Korutz .is more cer
tain. Late in the evening she caught
fire and* the flames .spreading to the
magazine an explosion sent : her to the
bottom. ~
Boats were lowered immediately from
the ; Japanese- vessels, and the> French
cruiser. Pascal, which witnessed the

POSITIONS OF RUSSIAN AND JAPANESE FORCES
The above map shows the positions of the naval and military forces of Russia and
Japan, as indicated by advices received up to 2 o'clock this morning 1 . Japan has been pour
ing troops into Korea since the breaking- off of diplomatic negotiations, Fusan, Masampho,
Chemulpo and Pingyang being the principal points of debarkation. The troops landed at
Chemulpo have proceeded -to Seoul, the Korean capital. Those that have disembarked at
the northern Korean ports will combine for an advance upon Manchuria, it being the in
tention of the Japanese to invest Port Arthur by land and sea:
v The Japanese fleet which defeated the' Russians at Port Arthur is believed to be hov
ering near the scene of the victory or to have withdrawn to one of the near-by Korean
ports. Other Japanese warships are stationed in the Straits of Korea, and still others
have goiie^soutliAvard to intercept Russian ships.
Russia is massing her troops along the Yalu River to oppose the Japanese advance
from Korea. The Czar's main fleet is bottled up at Port Arthur, and the squadron at Vladi
vostok is believed- to be ice-bound.
the ships must have been
wrought by means of mines.
It Was stated to-day on authority of
Captain Buckman, marine superintend
ent of the Cramp yards, that the Jap
anese have beeen secretly experiment
ing with submarine vessels. The view
held by Captain Buckman- that it .was
vessels "of this type that did damage
to the Russian ships - at Port /Arthur
Is subscribed to by Mr. Cramp. He
holds that Captain Buckman's views
furnish the most plausible explanation
of the remarkable victory achieved by
the Japanese. (
Captain Buekman declares that as
long, as; two -years ago he saw a-Jap-
anese built submarine vessel In the slip
of the navy yard . at Yokosuka, near
Yokohama.
â¢ : "My knowledge of the Japanese char
acter," he said to-day, "leads me to
the belief that the Mikado's nation has
been v quietly working with submarine
boats. : I think it, is not at all unlikely
that, we .will hear that boats of this
type-were used at Port Arthur.";.
â When he was last ; In Japan Captain
Buckman ' commanded the Pacific Mail
steamship City of Peking. About
Christmas time, 1901, the "steamship
.was in quarantine at Yokosuka,, where
the. indefatigable Japanese'. have built
a* f ort , in â  twenty-eight * fathoms - of wa-
ter. It was at this time that the cap
tain saw what he believes was the first
submarine: boat to be built by the Jap
anese Government, but he was warned

Russian Embassador Informs Wash
ington of War Declaration.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â Count Cas
sini, the Russian Embassador. called
upon Secretary Hay at noon to-day
and left with him the announcement
of the Czar declaring war on Japan.
The Count's communication -with the
Department was In writing. It was
a dispatch from*the Russian Foreign
Office to the Embassador, and was sub
stantialy as follows:
''During the night of February 8 a
detachment of Japanese torpedo boats
unexpectedly attacked the Russian
squadron lying at anchor in the -outer
roadstead of Port Arthur. This attack,
being the beginning of military opera
tions, obliged. the Imperial Government
to take Immediate measures to reply
by armed force to the challenge issued
against Russia. Be good enough -to
inform the Government of the United
States."
The UnitÂ»d States legation in Tokio
made two reports to-day to the â  State
Department upon the battles. Strange
ly enough Â» the news of the engagement
at Chemulpo ( was known at Tokie some
time before news came of the preced
ing Port Arthur affair. The first reads:
"A naval engagement was begun to
day at noon (9th) outside . thief harbor
of Chemulpo. The Japanese squadron

Russian gunboats 'firing upon a Jap

â¢ A later dispatch from the ' Japanese
Consular Chefu, just across" the strait
from Port Arthur, reports:
"Entire Japanese fleet engaged Rus
sian fleet outside Port Arthur at 11 p.
m. on the 8th. Two Russian battle
ships were sunk by torpedoes. The
Russian ships outside the harbor were
unable to enter. No damage to Japan
ese fleet."
â Another dispatch from Tokio stated
that no Japanese lives were lost in the
engagement at Chemulpo.
-Naval interest in the fighting con
tinues at the highest point. One of
the highest officer of the navy, com
menting upon the press accounts of the
engagements, says that the lesson to
be drawn is the absolute necessity of
maintaining a navy In continuous ser
vice. Instead of following the old plan .
of laying up ships in reserve, as has
been practiced by Russia. Japan, like
the United States, has for the last two
years kept In commission almost every
navy ship that would float and every
warship maneuvering so as to produce
the actual conditions of war as nearly
as possible.
Another demonstration of the Port
Arthur and Chemulpo affairs was the
perfection of the Japanese Information
division, as their naval commanders
seemed to be at every moment in pos
session of full information of the Rus
sian movements and the disposition of
the Russian ships:

PAW-PAW
Cured a Bright Young
Man of the
DRINK HABIT
Drunkenness, Nervousness and
Sleeplessness Caused by
DYSPEPSIA
Munyon's Paw-Paw Positively
Cures All Stomach
Ailments.
A mother writing to Professor Mun-
yon from a nearby city. Fays: "My son,
through bad associations, became addict-
ed to strong drink, and we had almost de-
spaired of savinc him from a drunkard's
crave. His stomach and nerves had be-
come totally wrecked. Two weeks ago
my sister, who lives in San Francisco,
Â«Â«*nt me a bottle, of Paw-Paw for him,
end. strarpe to say, it not only cured his
stomach trouble, but has taken away all
desire for alcoholic drinks. He has
cained 11 pounds in fleslu and now eats
well and sleeps w<y. May God bless you
for Rivinc the world this wonderful
medicine."
Surely this mother has reason to feel
grateful, and it is my opinion, previously
Â« xpf^sed. that the clerjjymen in this
Â« oiintry could do no greater service to
the cause of temperance than to advo-
cate the general use of my Paw-Paw, for
by its use drunkenness would be les-
B^nrd and the morals and health of the
community greatly improved.
A wife whose husband is addicted to
drinking can do nothing bitter for her-
srif or family than to cet a bottle of this
Paw-Paw, and whenever her husband
frris the need of a tonic give him a ta-
blcppoonful of Paw-Paw. She will find
thnt he will soon lose all cravings for
strong drinks â that his appetite will
f"on become natural, that his nervous-
iif-ss and longing for excitements will
disappear, and he will be perfectly sat-
isfied without alcoholic stimulants and
harmful beverages.
Almost every human being some time
require* a stimulant. NOT AN ALCO-
HOLIC STIMl'LAXT. not a stimulant
that will buoy up for a moment and then
â¢ â ast down to lower depths of depression,
but a stimulant that will give an abiding
strr-njrtli and lasting force.
My Paw-Paw aids the stomach to di-
Â£<-Ft heariy foods and to make good, rich
fclood, which again in turn strengthens
th<> nerves, vitalizing all the tissues, and
fcoon produces muscles, tissues and bone.
MUNYON.
Paw-Paw does away with the desire
for strong drink by satisfying and
strengthening the stomach and nerves.
It gives exhilaration without intoxica-

Paw- Paw gives you a good appetite
and secures for the body every benefit
which food is designed to bring.
Take a bottle home with you to-day,
and if that home contains a weak or re-
bellfcras stomach, a set of disordered

At a meeting of the Xaval League

JACK WILSON CLAIMS HIS FAIR BRIDE
AND LIEUTENANT MITCHELL WEDS
Brilliant Scene in
Maple Room
at Palace.
By Sally Sharp.
Has there been a more lovely bride

IN THIS CITY YESTERDAY THAT ARE OF UNUSUAL INTER
EST TO SOCIETY AND NAVAL CIRCLES.
this winter' than Miss Cluff? If so, It
has been my misfortune to have missed
her. Tall. dark, bright of eye and quick
of smile, in her nuptial robe of shim
mery satin and exquisite rose point, she
was the poet's picture of a bride. She
were a misty veil, fastened in her dark
hair, and a sunburst on her breast, this
the gift of the groom. Jack Wilson.
Without the Palace the scene last night
suggested opera night; within, a pass
ing picture of San Francisco's fairest
women and their devoted men folk. At
9 o'clock the lugubrious strains of
"Lohengrin" (why is it that it always
sobs so?) announced the coming of the
bride. Down the south staircase came
the ushers. John D. Spreckels Jr.,
George Field, Edward M. Greenway and
Edgar Mizner, followed by the matron
of honor, Mrs. John D. Spreckels Jr.,
who was gowned in an exquisite robe
of point, with a garland of pink roses
trailing from her white shoulder. Then
came the four maids â attendants on the
brideâ Mips Pearl Landers, Miss de
Young, Miss Constance de Young and
Miss California Cluff, all arrayed in
gowns suggestive of the petals of a
pink rose. About the low corsage tiny
pink buds finished the frocks, while on
their arms they bore leis of pink roses
held in bondage by pink ribbons.
Dr. Guthrie met the party in the bow
er of apple blossoms in the Marble
room, where the solemn service was
read. The ceremony over, the radiant
couple repaired to the reception bower,
â where 200 Invited guests sought them
to present their felicitations.
The decorations in the nuptial hall
were of those of the harbingers of
springâ sweet-smelling fruit blossoms.
Supper was served In the Maple room,
where ferns of the forest lent their
beauty. Pink shades lent the glow that
made the | picture. What with the
gowns, the flowers and the bonhomie,
the event will long be remembered.
Last evening at the angelus hour Miss
Mabel Quatman became the bride of
Lieutenant Alexander Neely Mitchell.
U. S. N., at the borne of the bride's
mother. Mrs. Hannah Quatman, the
Rev. Jerome Hannigan officiating.
The bride, a Junoesque brunette, was
gowned in a regal robe of chiffon vel

exquisite old lace, the bridal veil falling
from crown to hem. The attendants
upon the bride were Miss Kate Bying
ton. maid of honor, and the nieces and
little nephew of the bride, children of
George C. Perkins Jr., while the groom
was served by Lieutenant David C.
Hanrihan, a classmate at Annapolis.
After a supper, to which only the rela
tives were bidden, a reception was held,
when over 200 guests paid their com
pliments to the happy pair. A short
trip is planned by the young people, to
be supplemented later by a trip to San
Diego, whither the Albatross (to which
the groom is attached) will soon pro
ceed. â¢ â 
PROFESSIONAL MATIXEE
BY PAUL, GEHSOX SCHOOL
Frederick Warde Will Make Address
and Students Will Present Pro
gramme of Interest.
The Paul Gerson school of acting will
give the fourth of a series of profes
sional matinee performances at the
California Theater to-morrow after
noon, at 2 o'clock sharp.
The programme will embrace a scene
from Ibsen's "A Doll House," with
Miss Mabel Duffey as Nora; a new
comedy, entitled "The Jade"; Howell's
comedy, "The Mouse Trap"; a scene
from Lord Lytton's play, "The Right
ful Heir," and a fantasy by Ada Lee
Bascom, entitled "Bacchante."
Frederick Warde will also add to the
interest of the occasion by giving one
of his scholarly, intellectual and inter
esting addresses, which will largely add
to the already brilliant programme
that Mr. Gerson has. arranged.
The Gerson school has produced pu
pils who have shown great merit, and
it has been compared in a most com
plimentary way with the work that
has been done in the New York schools.
Will Appear in Repertoire.
From a dramatic standpoint the most
important announcement of the season
will be the repertoire offered at the Co
lumbia Theater next week by the emi
nent players Louis James and Fred
erick Warde. Their efforts will "be con
centrated upon masterly, renditions of
"Julius Caesar," "Othello" and "Mac
beth," the former holding the boards
c-n Monday and Sunday nights and Sat
urday matinee, and on Tuesday and
Friday nights Shakespeare's Immortal
play "Othello," in which both stars
ehine at their best, will be offered. On
Wednesday night "Macbeth," with Mr.
Warde In the title role and Mr. James
as Macduff and Miss Kruger as Lady
Macbeth, will be the bill, and on Bat
urday night the same offering, with
Mr. James In the title role instead of
Mr. Warde. For Thursday night "Al
exander the Great" will be again pre
sented.
Hates to Give Up Office.
Notwithstanding that former Public
Administrator JohnFarnham has pend
ing two suits to prevent M. J. Hynes,
the recently elected Public Administra
tor, from taking office, his attorney,
Carleton M. Green, has instituted other
actions. Yesterday he filed petitions
for the revocation of letters of admin
istration granted Hynes on the estates
of Minnie McCullom, John Dresch and
J. B. Groupp. He claims that Hynes
should be removed because he has not
properly qualified.
Laura Bennett's Will.
An authenticated copy of .the will" of
the late Laura . Bennett was filed for
probate yesterday. It leaves her $200,
000 estate to her two sons, C. R. Ben
nett and Gordon P. Bennett of 26 Cal
ifornia street, and provides that her
sister, Mrs. B. A. Blakeney of. Beverly,

INSTRUCTIVE STUDIES

'About 'Advertising.
BT DANIEL M. LORD.
[Veteran ricneer of t<JvertHir.g. who has Just
retired from the Presidency of the Lord &
TboTat* Advertising Agency.]
iCopyrisht, ISKH. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
I know of no occupation that offers
better opportunities for the bright
young man at the present time than
the advertising business. Much train
ing of a special sort, however, is need
ed by the young man who wishes to
succeed in this calling. The best
schooling he can get will be that ac
quired by working his way up through
the various departments maintained
In a well established, advertising
agency.
The "checking" department offers
the best place in which to learn the
first essentials of the business, and
here Is where he would in all prob
ability be put to work if he had no
previous experience. His principal
duties in this depnrtment would be to
look over the various magazines and
newspapers to see that they had filled
their contracts with the agency prop
erly. In doing this work he would
gain a fair general knowledge of pub
lications and the different kinds of ad
vertising in vogue.
From the checking department he
â would be promoted to the "rating" de
partment or the "order" department.
He should become familiar with the
work of both. In the rating depart
ment he would learn the advertising
rates of different publications. With
this knowledge he should in time be
able to prepare what are known as
rate lists and furnish estimates on
"space."
In the "order" department his work
would be to take over orders as made
out by solicitors and see that they got
to their respective publications on
lime. It is very essential that he
should know how to prepare copy for
"ads" and have a knowledge of the
general arrangement of advertising
matter. This would be grained in the
"copy" department- The men who
do this work, however, are often those
who have received special training in
newspaper and other editorial work.
After a reasonable length of time
the work thus far done ought to give
him the knowledge to enable him to go
out and solicit business. The man who
can work up and control the adver
tising of firms who seek publicity for
their wares is assured of success. Be
fore potting out to g-et business the
rolicitcrr or advertising agent, as he is
frequently called, must be thoroughly
posted in regard to the different
mediums through which his firm oper
atr-s. It is essential that he have a
good talking knowledge as to the size,
quality and territorial distribution of
newsp.iper and magazine circulation.
He must also be able to estimate the
v.ilue of a given amount of space in
one publication as against the given
amount of space In another publica
tion. For the sake of future relations
with his clients he would do well to
remember never to play favors.
In me?ting men an easy, earnest ad
dress that will impress them that he
knows what he is talking, about and
has ability to accomplish' things. Is
necessary. As a general thing, when
a man first starts out to solicit adver
tising: lie will find that he has a hard
road to travel, but lot him persevere
and he will surely win in the end.
But lPt us sav that out of the first
half dozen possibilities he has worked
up there is a new concern manufactur
ing a line of merchandise which it has
never advertised. Before approaching
the representative of such a house he
should not only have become familiar
with the products nf this particular es
tablishment, but should have acquired
all the information possible concerning
the output and selling methods and tha
success or nonsuccess of competing
firms. With this knowledge he would
be able with ordinary Judgment to
draft a skeleton plan, tangible and
definite, to meet the publicity needs of
his prospective clients. -'7
It is more than likely he will find
that the representative of the firm with
whom he deals will take issue with
him on a variety of points. While ho
should be prepared to Insist on such
of these as Feem vital, still he should
take care not to antagonize the ideas
of bis man too strongly, as he wMl
probably discover, as the conference
procec-ds, th^re are many things for
him to learn in regard to the proposi
tion in hand. Such of those ideas as
are impracticable will be weeded out
in the progress of the campaign should
a business connection be successfully
established.
Originality is an important factor In
the success of an advertising man, but
above all a young man should not go
to business men. with an incoherent de
mand that money be spent on a lot of
visionary projects. , One of the chief
obstacles an advertising man encount
ers early in his career is the Inherent
dlEliko most men have of spending
raoney on a commodity seemingly so
Intangible as advertising. Hence, he
must have that feeling about his work
which will enable him. ably and con-
Fcientiously, to draw a picture of the
reality of his caHinff. He must come
to realize that intelligent publicity Is
quite as. demonstrable a proposition as
most any other line of business.
The personality of the agent will al
ways play an important part in thÂ«
advertising field, consequently It be
hooves our young man to cultivate his
clients assiduously. When a man is
placing advertising it is doubtful If he
ever considers that he is getting too
much personal attention.
Business connections established, an
agent should visit his clients "early and
often"; call on them a good many times
when it cannot possibly mean any
rfr.ancial gain to himself to do so. He
should keep thoroughly posted on all
th? developments in the line of busi
ness in which his client is interested.
After a short course of this treatment
it will be found that "you have fastened
him to you with hooks of steel."
"Pulling Double"
BY CHARLES FREDERIC GOSS, PJX
(Author of "The Redemption of David Cor
eon." etc.)
<Copyrfeht. 1JKW. by Joseph B. Bowlea.)
When two streams of water meet they
flow to the sea together. Whether both
are of the same volume or one is large
enough to swallow the other whole,
their direction is always identical.
Hand in hand, heart to heart, they
move amicably between the same
banks toward the same goal.
But it is not often so with two hu
man lives. At rare intervals it hap
pens that their aims and hopes are so
nearly identical that they melt into a
single stream of tendencies and glide
along like a meadow brook among the
grasses. More often they suddenly dis
cover that their motives, habits and
purposes are dissimilar if not antag
onistic. One tries to flow this way and
the other that, and so the waters rave
and fret.
It is at this critical point of the mar
ried life that the stern lesson of this
brief essay needs to be brought home.
Two people who do not pull together
will soon begin to pull apart, and it is
necessary for them to learn how to
make concessions.
Take, for example, their "tastes."
How seldom you find two people in
whom they are similar. ' One likes to
read and the other to play games. One
Is fc-nd of the seashore and the other
of the mountjnns. One likes to go to
parties and the other to stay at home.
These differences seem the merest
trifles before marriage and are sub
jects of good humored Jests. But if
a wife insists on dragging her husband
out to receptions and card parties when
he is tired out with business soon
enough there will be trouble in the
camp. Or if a woman likes to read
good books, and her husband will never
listen to anything but the suicides,
murders and embezzlements in the yel
low journals â a breach will spring up
that will widen till their death. More
homes than the statisticians have ever
counted have been broken up or ren
dered permanently wretched by differ
ences of taste as trifling as these.
What a selfish thing it is in a man
not to conform to his wife's love for
little things which do not interest him.
Of course, you don't like fancy work,
but is that any reason why you should
not learn to? Lay down your paper
or your book and take up that pretty
tidy or napkin that your Mary is em
broidering. Show your appreciation of
her right to be interested In whatever
strikes her fancy. Come out of your
self and see things from a woman's
point of view.. She is a woman â and
this basal fact must be reckoned with.
Or perhaps the shoe is on the other foot
and it is the man who has an Incur
able love for hunting and fishing. Berth
pastimes are distasteful to his 'wife,
and with the imperious will of a little
tyrant she tries to uproot his natural
instincts. But who gave her the right
to dictate in such matters? He is a
man and has the privilege of his Bex
for the rÂ«ugh life of the out-of-door
world. Haw much better It would be
for her to don her short skirts and take
to the woods. with' him!
But there are more serious differ
ences than those of "tastes." There
are differences of principle. They do
not reveal themselves before the mar
riage vows are taken. Each of the in
fatuated lovers has softened or con
cealed those traits and ideas that ex
cited the antagonism of another. It
was easy to put them out of sight dur
ing courtship. But now that the hon
eymoon Is over and they have Â«et
tled down to the daily srrind of life
nature begins to reassert itself. It ap
pears that the man has a deepseated
antipathy to religion, while the woman
is a devoted Christian. She begs him
to go to church, but he refuses and
Insists on her taking rides into the
country or visiting beer gardens. First
come the sharp surprises; then the
deep heart sorrows, and finally the
open quarrels. Two wills have set
themselves in v'olent antagonism.
Two lives are pulling apart. "It Is
the rift within the lute that by and
by will make the music mute and ever,
widening slowly silence all."
Somebody must give way!- Can any
one tell us who? My answer is this â
sharp, sincere and earnestâ the one
with whom the auestion Is not a mat
ter of conscience. This present ques
tion is not that fundamental one of
the truth or falsity of religion. It is
simply the question as to whether
a man has the right to ' de
spise and trample on the deepest
sensibility of the soul of that person
whose claims upon his respect and
reverence are the holiest things in
life! Suppose that religion were the
mere superstition that some men
think it is â what right has he who re
fuses to let his wife interfere with his
smoking or drinking or gambling to
deny her the privilege of going to
church on Sunday and listening to the
advocacy of ideas which are dearer
to her than life Itself? Nothing was
ever more unjust; nothing was ever
more contemptible than such tyr
anny. When I recall the brutal sel
fishness that I have seen men show In
such denials of the right of private
judgment and personal preference to
their wives it makes my blood boil.

SECRETARY HAY'S NOTE.
TWO incidents have occurred within the last week
which disclose the presence of high statesman
ship in the most Important collaterals of the war
between Japan and Russia. Just before the outbreak of
hostilities, Wu Ting Fang advised the Empress Dow-:
ager to decree Manchuria open, in all ports and parts,
to the commerce of all nations.. From what followed it
is evident that this advice was taken, because Tsi An at
once promoted Wu to a Ministerial position with the
duty of handling all matters between China, the United
States, Great Britain and Japan.
It will be observed that the action counseled by Wu
was at a time when China's sovereignty of Manchuria
was undisputed. Notwithstanding Russia's continued
occupation of that province, in defiance of her repeated
promise to the Western nations to evacuate it, as
agreed with them at the close of the Boxer war, she had
no sovereignty there, any more than the United States
had in Peking when our troops occupied and policed the
inner city.
. Keeping this fact of China's unbroken sovereignty
over Manchuria in view, the vast importance of Secre
tary Hay's identical note to the European powers is dis
closed. By it he sought, and it Seems now has secured
their agreement, that Japan and Russia must respect
both the neutrality and the territorial integrity of China,
and that means the whole of China before Japan -struck
Russia at Port Arthur.
According to the principles of this note, it is doubtful
whether Chinese territory can even become a battle
ground between Russia and Japan, but, if such terri
tory be used for that purpose, the victor can take noth
ing except victory as a result of the action. It is prob
able, however, that the, note confines the war to the
water and to Korean territory. If this be a distinct
advantage to Japan, that is merely an incident. She
has shown herself the better on the. water.
Denied the right to acquire Chinese territory, Rus
sia's exertions will be barren of results, even if her land
forces overcome those of Japan in Korea. Port Arthur
and the Korean ports which the Czar has sought to
make Russian will be a barren possession with Japan.the
ruler of Pechili Bay and the Sea of Japan, as she is \o*
day. Instead of realizing her selfish ambition to close
Manchuria and Korea to other countries, she will
be as effectually shut in in Eastern Asia as she is on the
Black Sea. Even her own port at Vladivostok is use
less to her. and all her craft and expense will go for
nothing, with a Japanese navy closing her harbors and
standing guard over her railway terminal.
In the present view Secretary Hay's note is likely to
be a promoter of peace, while limiting the theater of
war. If the Japanese win a land battle, as they may,
Russia will have the chance to consent to another con
ference like that at Berlin, because it will limit the re
sults pf victory which Japan might claim.
Passing from the effect of the Secretary's note upon
the combatants and the field of combat, American pride
is stimulated b"y his action. It is a confident assertion
of the influence of the United States in the high affairs
of the world. It is not the timorous protest nor incon
sequential suggestion of a nation that follows, but the
bold initiative of one that leads. Above all, it is not a
policy that makes for war, trouble and injustice in the
world, but for peace, justice and tranquillity. No other
nation could have taken such a position. We have no
territorial ambitions in Eastern Asia. Our worst enemy
cannot accuse us of sinister designs in that hemisphere.
We want progress in China and the uplifting of her peo
ple in line with their racial qualities and philosophy.
We want the Chinese to benefit by Japan's example
without submitting to her sovereignty, and we want
Japan to have the full benefit, in prestige, influence and
progress, of her remarkable transformation, in which
our friendship and example have been the chief factors.
Europe wants peace. Secretary Hay's note is its
guarantee. Eastern Asia wants justice and the note re
sponds to its aspiration. The world wants trade on
equal terms with the millions on that side of the Pa
cific. Secretary Hay's note invites . the nations* to the
peaceful competition of commerce, in which their ener
gies and genius will be developed and will get their re
ward.
The lot of King Peter of Servia appears. not to be a
happy one. Added to his foreign troubles he now has a
domestic annoyance in the resignation of his Cabinet
officers. If the past conduct of these worthies be any
indication of their present opinions Peter'is to be con
gratulated on refusing to share them. Not to agree with
them is at least an earnest of good behavior.

to await the outcome of the clash of arms, the women
of California will not be out of mind for a minute. No
event in the history of- the times would be sufficient to
dim their brilliancy or to make interest in their doings
a whit less.
There are thousands of women in California who
could not personally be. present at .the Sacramento con
vention. Very likely they have some curiosity as to the
themes that their sisters of the California Fede?ation
of Women's Clubs selected to discuss during three days.
It must, with fairness, be admitted that the women did
not elect to do "all the talking. ; As they had the sole
direction of affairs and could just as well have monopo
lized the entire programme and as no one doubts their
ability to speak on any possible topic, a rebuke and les
son to the- sterner sex were at once quietly admin
istered> It is conceded that when men have a conven
tion they are not equally magnanimous, "but insist, ' in
nearly every instance, in filling in all the time them
selves, leaving it to their fairer sisters to set them an
example that they may well emulate.
It appears from the official programme of the con
vention of the California Federation of -Women's Clubs
that several men were honored, by having themes al
lotted to them to discuss. ; .One", is a lawyer, one a
clergyman and one a librarian.; What they said does not
matter much at this time^ They talked about libraries,
parks, and "the reign of the common people," etc.
The topics set for women were much more, entertaining.
Here are some of them: "The Saving of the Calaveras
Big Trees," "The National Park on Mount Tamalpais,"
''Art Education in the Schools," "The Culture Demanded
by Modern Civilisation," -"The .Bible in the Schools,"
"The Humanizing Influence of Good Literature,"
"House Problems," "Juvenile Courts," "Los Angeles'
Beginning," "California History and Landmarks." "Cali
fornia Poets," "Commercial History of California,"
"Unity of Effort," and "The Mormon Question." There
is in this list sufficient evidence of the versatility of the
fair daughters of California and of their earnestness.
What they had to talk about was just as interesting as
politics, and probably the result will be more lasting
than that of any political convention that has been re
cently held in this State. or elsewhere.
\ Mixed in with fhe discussions and consideration of
papers that dealt with live themes there has been an
abundance of song. The 'players of instruments also
figured in entertaining visitors from the various parts
of the State. Among the authors represented in the
musical selections were Chopin, the poet of -the piano;
McFarren, a noted song writer; Arditti. the author of
the languishing song of "Non e Ver"; Pinsuti, the ven
erable Abbe Liszt, Saint-Saens, and a home musician,
Albert I. Elkus of Sacramento. The finer musical con
sciousness was in evidence.
The women's convention picked out the Assembly
Chamber in the State Capitol for holding their delibera
tions and for singing their songs. Possibly they
startled the ghjosts of dullness and utter inappreciation
of the esthetic side of life that have often characterized
the more prosaic proceedings of California legislators.
At any rate, the proceedings have been suggestive and
profitable and -have done much "to drive dull care
away."
France has indicated her wish that we reduce our
tariff on her champagne. Dms the s French Govern
ment desire to clos*e to our gilded youth one of the few
remaining avenues in which they can show what gay
blades and good fellows they are? To make champagne
cheap is to remove its seduction. When plebeians drink
it then it' will have lost its vogue.
THE ATTACK ON PORT ARTHUR.
IT is with gratification that The Call records another
triumph of its news. service in the Orient. On Tues
day morning this paper gave the people of San
Francisco exclusive, information of the first clash of
arms between Russia and Japan, the daring and highly
successful night attack of the Japanese torpedo-boats
upon the unsuspecting and unprepared Russian fleet in
the outer harbor of * Port Arthur*. News of this con
summate strategy has been the theme of earnest dis
cussion for the world.
Yesterday morning The Call published exclusively
the details of this attack upon the fighting ships and
Mahchurian stronghold of. the Czar, and pf the desperate
sea fight that followed between the contending navies.
What else there was of progress in the tragic events
of the Eastern war was merged in the haze of rumor.
This initial clash, this test of arms, this tremendous act
that created a state of war between two great nations,
was the incident of primary importance for the world,
j'et The Call was the only newspaper in San Francisco
that was able to place before its readers the story of the
fight, witnessed by a correspondent in the very midst
of the crashing shells, and told in brilliant description
from the firing of the first torpedo until the last thun
der of the attacking guns.
A correspondent of The Call was on board the Indo-
China steamship Columbia between the entrance to the
harbor of Port Arthur and the Russian fleet when the
night attack, aroused the Russians from neglectful se
curity to the horror of sudden death. The Call corre
spondent saw everything, and in terse, dramatic and
brilliant description told, the story of the midnight as
sault. Other newspapers received their stories as they
dripped grudgingly from biased sources.
The Call correspondent watched the progress of the
sea fight that followed the next morning and described
it with the dash and simple directness of ah actual ob
server. Other correspondents gave their meager hews
in the garbled versions of one or the other of the in
volved partisans. For The Call there was accuracy,
directness and truth. For others there was the exag
geration of rumor and the untruth of biased sources. In
view of the vast importance of the events recorded it
seems proper that this paper should note its second
journalistic triumph in connection with the war.
EARLY IMPORTANCE OF THE ISTHMUS.
THE politicians who are trying to obstruct the Pres
ident, and are encouraging the Bogota govern
ment to recover 'dominion of the isthmus, in
order to apply to it. that policy of Eastern isolation
which Lewis Cass said we "must not permit," seem to
have closed their eyes to history and their patriotism- to
all the promptings of American aspiration.
In 1827 the chairman of the Naval Committee of the
House in the Nineteenth Congress, Mr. Storrs, made a
report on "communication across the Isthmus of
Panama." It recommended an appropriation to build
two schooners and to rebuild the Nonesuch, for
the purpose of conveying mails and keeping us in touch
with our naval forces. Mr. Storrs said: "The increas
ing importance of the bordering upon the Pa
cific Ocean and our increased commerce with those na
tions are c highly interesting to every portion of the
,Union. Our trade on the Northwest coast, our exten
sive whale fishery, all demand the vigilance of this Gov
ernment, and the Government, duly estimating the in
terests of the country, has wisely stationed a portion- of
our navy to protect our property and preserve bur
rights." In those days the passage from the United
States to Valparaiso, around the Horn, was 120 days,
and it took from six to eight months to send a letter
I and get an answer. ,
: Adams was President. California and Texas were
Mexican. The boundary of Oregon was unsettled. Lun
alilo was king of r Hawaii.. Perry had not opened Japan.
Yet our trade ' in the _ Pacific was so important that it
called for rapid transit across the isthmus, and the pro
tection of our rights by warships.^ If deserving the cafe
of the Government thru, how much more deserving
now!
.Yet there are men who are willing to hold fep progress
while they, feelwith their mouths for a political issuej
and let all of our vast' interests wait. andttnark .tirae.i-'V '
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
Nonplused the Judge.
Judge D. J. Murphy when on the
bench was noted for the .severity of
his lectures when sentencing convicted
criminals. A "great many of the most
hariened thieves were known to squirm
be ft re his Honor when told to stand up
for sentence. But the Judge met his
match on one occasion, when a noted
burglar was convicted of the crime of
entering a store. It was an open issue
whether this man had been guilty of
burglary in the first or second degree,
as the store had been entered on a Sun
day afternoon Just about sunset. The
jury, however, gave him the benefit of
the doubt and brought in a verdict of
burglary in the second degree. "When
the prisoner was called upon to "take
his medicine" the Judge was prepared
to give him the usual verbose lecture.
The__ prisoner, anticipating what was
coming, took the initiative.
"Say, Murphy," said he, "prick the
gas bag and get down to business. Just
say seven years in the penitentiary
with hard labor. This, with good con
duct, means just four years and six
months, all of which is coming to me,
and bv the time I am out you will be
a plain American citizen."
Judge Â» Murphy looked dumfounded.
He cut out the oration and sent the fel
low to prison for seven years â the full
limit.
His Majesty the Tramp.
Even the wandering Williams have be
come impregnated with the spirit of in
dependence that comes from a long
season of prosperity unalloyed by even
a suggestion of hard times. The tramps
have become mighty particular. They
are refusing to accept cast-off garments
that show too much evidence of wear,
and their appetites rebel at the plain
and homely food offerings which from
time immemorial have stood as the
housewife's standard for the satisfac
tion of the vagrant caller.
In evidence whereof this tale of a ver
itable occurrence at the back door of a
Western Addition household:'
The tramp's knock was answered by
the young domestic, whose instructions
in such cases were always to furnish
applicants with a wholesome meal.
"Just wait a minute," replied the girl
to the request, "and I'll get you some
thing to eat."
Hurriedly she made up three big, gen
erous meat sandwiches, and supple
mented the allowance with a pitcher of
aromatic coffee, hot and refreshing in
its delightful odor. These she handed
to the vagrant.
He nibbled at one of the sandwiches
and sniffed at the coffee.
"You don't seem very hungry," . said
the girl.
"Hungry?" was the impudent ejacu
lation. "Hungry? You just pass me
but a good, thick porterhouse steak
and I'll show you whether I'm hungry.
Save this trash for the dog."
With that the tramp stalked out, and
the girl was so dumfounded she didn't
think to call the police.
*At the Eleventh Hour.
"I do not know whether it was fate
or just common ordinary luck that
came to the rescue of a young fellow
here this morning," said Cupid Dun
forth the other day after he got
through courtting up the day's receipts
of the marriage^ license office. "What
ever it was that saved him certainly
did so in the nick of tlme r
"It was just after I had opened the
office for the day that he- came in.
He appeared to be about twenty-eight
or thirty years of age. The woman
who was with him and whom I correct
ly judged to be the lady of his choice
was certainly five years his senior, if
not more. Her face was built along
the lines that would entitle her to be
called a woman of great will by sdme
people; a regular old maid by others,
or perhaps a virago. The young fel
low's face was not lacking in strength
by any means, in fact It was Just the
reverse; a physiognomist would prob
ably say that he was a stubborn indi
vidual; one likely to make up his mind
to do a thing and do it no matter what
the cost. \"V â '."-
"Well, to make a long story short,
he got a license to marry his compan
ion. He paid the fee and they started
to walk out. When near the door the
woman said something to him. He re
sponded in a curt tone and {then. Judg
ing by his expression, asked her to do
something. 'No I won't.' I heard her
say. Then he repeated his request, this
time a little coaxlngly. 'I tell you no,'
said the woman, with a stamp of her
foot, and a look that would have scared
an ordinary man. Again he asked her,
and I thought I heard something about
last chance.'
"This time the woman did not even
answer him. She nearly shook her
head off her shoulders in her efforts to
make plain to. him that she would not
do as he asked.
" 'All right,' said the young fellow,
turning away from her and coming
over to my desk. He laid the license
in front of me, and though she followed
him and stood right beside him, there
was not a tremor in his voice when he
said, 'Cancel this, please.' The woman
only said 'Humph.* "
A Strange Attachment.
Decidedly friendly relations have
been established between Brutus, the
largest lion in captivity, and a com
mon screech owl that found its way
into the cage of the king of beasts in
the Zoo Carnivore., according to the
Cincinnati Enquirer. This happened a
few nights ago and throughout that
night the Zoo .watchman was non
plused by the weird sound that pro
ceeded from the Carnlvora.
â¢ At daylight an investigation was
made. Sedately sitting in a far cor
ner, of the cage occupied by Brutus
was a screech owl. Without moving
an eye she was receiving the gallant
attentions of Brutus, who, soft of
heartj but rather hard of hand, was
patting with his huge paw the little
screech owl, who^ took 4 his well meant
but somewhat rough attentions with
the well known careless Indifference of
the owl family. All day the bird sits
in the darkest corner of the cage, sel-
dom moving, even when the friendly
attentions of the lion become too pro
fuse.
Brutus, engrossed in his attentions
toward his new-found friend, seldom
rises to pace the floor as was his cus
tom, but sits near the corner occupied
by the owl. At night, when the bird
takes wing and flies about the cage, he
sleeps undisturbed in the same corner.
Zoo attendants recall many in
stances of curious attachments in ths
animal world, but none so remarkable
as that between tne lion and the
screech owl.
National Electricity.
A project is J3eing prepared for util
izing the non/iavlgable water courses
of France as sources of electric power
on something like a national basis.
These water courses are spread over
the greater part of France, and are
already beginning to- be turned to ac
count in a minor way by individuals
in the revival of local Industries, which
steam and rapid railway transit had
ruined. In some of these instances-'
electric motive power has been carried
from a source ten miles distant. As a
first step toward national reorganiza
tion, the Minister of Agriculture has
commissioned M. H. Bresson to make a
systematic study and to report upon
the sources of power available in eight
different departments.
One for The Call.
The Modesto Herard^ Is kind enough
to give us a pat on the back. It says:
"The San Francisco Call Is forging
ahead as a bright, live, newsy sheet
at a pace which Is disconcerting to the
other dallies of the city. In every de
partment and in its general tone and
make-up The Call is rapidly growing
into favor as a home paper, this fact
especially noticeably in the rural
districts, where The Call has a con
stantly growing circulation. Their new
policy of special writing, devoted to
the Interior portions of the State, tell
ing of. the various industries of these
sections, their growth and development,
and illustrating these articles with well
selected views, is especially pleasins
and productive of much good in the
work of development. The new Call ia
receiving many most favorable notices
from the rural press of the State, and
we are glad to record its progress."

quarts of New England rum and one
quart of bay ram. The hair having

THE OCEAN â Subscriber. City.
The following from "The Ocean." by
Elisee Reclus, is an answer to the
question "Is the Pacific Ocean higher
at Panama than the Atlantic at Colon,
formerly Aspinwall?": "The diversity
of clirnates, of winds and of currents is
such' that certain sea*, separated by
a narrow Isthmus, present unequal
levels. â¢ * * A difference occurs
between the Bay of Colon and the Gulf
of Panama, and there also. It is a mass
of water in which the fullest swells,
that is to say the Pacific Ocean, have
the highest level. But the measure
ments made on the always unstable
level of the sea are very delicate op
erations, as one can so easily make a
mistake at starting through the oscil
lation of the ebb and flow. At all
events it is certain that^he surface of
the sea, unceasingly traversed an<J
perturbed by winds, currents and
tides. Is not perfectly horizontal, at
any point of the Klobe." There is a
great difference in the tides at the
two points named in the letter of In
quiry. The spring rise in Colon Is
1.10. while at Panama it is 16 feet ac
cording to the latest observations.
This la the mean between high and
low tide.

day by Baldwin & Howell, owned by Mrs.
Alvlnza Hay ward, is attracting much at
tention from down-town buyers. Adjoin
ing the "Strathmoco" apartments, within
half a block of the City Hall on one side
ajid within two blocks of Market street
on the other, this property affords a
splendid opportunity to investors who
are looking for choice inside locations at
their own figure. The desirability of this
â¢ection of the city â¢will be materially in
creased by the completion of the pro
jected Catholic Library and the erection
of the Public Library, both of which arc
to occupy fHcs directly adjacent to these
lots. The property is to be sold on terms
that are sufficiently liberal to afford all
a chance to liny; 4Â« per cent of the pur
chase price cash and the. balance on
mortgages. which the Hibernia Bant

INDICTMENT IS
DECIDED VOID
Chinese Substitute Escapes
Because of an Informality
in the Official Complaint
United States District Judge de Ha
ven yesterday decided that an indict
ment against "John Doe, whose truÂ«
name as to the grand Jurors aforesaid
unknown," is void. The opinion was
in the case of one of the six Chinese
coolies that had been substituted by
Deputy United States Marshal Gamble
for six coolies whom he allowed to es
cape. This Chinaman was indicted Un
der the name of John Doe. As the de
cision is of great interest and impor
tance the following extracts from the
opinion are given:
It is a fundamental rule that a defendant
must be bo described in an indictment that he
tan be identified, and he must be charged by
his true name, or if riot, by the name by
which he is gener&lly known, and It neither
his trae name nor the name by which he is
generally called is known, then hÂ» muÂ«t be
OtberVlM vo described that It shall appear
\\ hat particular person is charged with the
commission of the offense named. Â» â¢ â¢
Theâ indictment shews upon Its face that
the name John Doe is used only as a fictitious
designation. â¢ â¢ *
- To <JaÂ»cribÂ« the defendant as "John Doe.
a Chines*? person whose true name U to the
trrand jurors aforesaid unknown," is Just as
indefinite as If he had* been described as "a
Chinese person whose name Is to the
grand jurors unknown." V.'ith no other de
scription of the defendant than this. It is not
possible to say what particular Chinese per
son thff Grand Jury intended to indict, and
for this reason the indictment is clearly !n
sufflcient. â¢ â¢ â¢
In my opinion an indictment like this which
is to defective in Its de?criutlon of tho de
fendant that a warrant for his arrest contain
ing th? same description would be void, must
also he h<"ld \cid; and ae this defect appear*
Upon the face of the indictment, I fee no rea
run why the Mime car.nr.t be taken advantaje
of by demurrer. The demurrer is sustained
anÂ«J Jactracnt thprcon will be entered In
favor ot the defendant.

was deceived by the latter when he
signed a contract agreeing to pur
chase the property of the Yreka Min

County. He says he was given to un
derstand by Ball that the property
was a paying investment. The price
fixed was $300,000. He paid a de
posit of $10,000, he says, and signed
a contract agreeing to pay the bal
ance of the- purchase price before

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 11. 1901.
MAKES CHARGE
OF CORRUPTION
Florists' Retail Association Says
Some One Is Paid for Privi
leges Enjoyed by Venders
FILES A STRONG PROTEST
Declares It Knows Who Gives
Protection and Asks the Board
of Works to Take 4 ct iÂ° n
The Retail Florists' Association, com
prising twenty-eight of the florist stores
in this city, petitioned the Board of
Works yesterday to remove the street
vendera of flowers. The petition says:
Th* fl^ver venders occupy the crowded thor
oughfares with their large ungainly baskets,
and in front of the Chronicle building their
baskets have not been moved for months. At
night they are loaded with cobblestones to hold
them In nlace and a man Is employed to
watch oxil for them throughout the night.'
Now this Is strictly against our new charter,
and If bootblack stands and fruit wagons can
be made to move on out of the way, why not
these people who are occupying the most valu
able ground in the city? This assoclntlon will
pay $2000 per year to the city for the use of
the sidewalks In front of the Chronicle build
ing: now occupied by the venders, providing
the city furnish the same police protection that
the venders are having at the present time.
The venders are selling the flowers for three
different companies Theee companies control
nearly the entire crop of violets that If brought
Into this city and they charge the ret.il! 6tore*
the same price aa they sell on the street.
When a storekeeper objects they inform him
that If they don't want the violets at that
price that they will put more men on the
street to sell, and If a storekeeper should put
a man out In front of the Chronicle building
to sell their left-over flowers they are abused,
threatened and life made so disagreeable that
It is impossible to ri tain a man there who Is
not In the employ of these companies.
While we don't know that any one Is re
ceiving money for the use of that corner, con
sentient opinion Is that there Is "graft" and
that some one Is drawing down a monthly
stipend. Who that some one }Â« we know not.
We only know who objects when an effort. Is
made to remove the venders.
The board decided to investigate the
complaint at once, and if it finds that
the street venders are pursuing their
trade without authority of law they will
be ordered off the streets.
The board detailed Inspector John P.
Horgan to report on the condition of all
hotels, hospitals, lodging-houses and
boarding-houses with respect to their
safety against danger from fire. Hor
gan is to ascertain the dates of the
erection of all such buildings.
J. G. Moriarity was appointed en
gineer of the Fourth street bridge, vice
W. J. Renwlck, removed, and Peter
Sheehan and J. R. Mathewson to be as
sistant engineers of the Fourth street
bridge, vice M. Kelly and D. Carroll, re
moved.
WATER COMPANY GAINS
POINT IN DAMAGE SUIT
Supreme Court Decides Affalnst the
Claims of Officials of Uklah
City.
The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that Uklah City was not entitled to
damages from the Ukiah Water and
Improvement Company by reason of
the losses sustained by the former at
a fire where the water supply did not
prove adequate. The municipal author
ities maintained that the corporation
was under contract to furnish a suffi
cient supply of water fsr fire-fighting
purposes.
The Supreme Court holds that there
was no express covenant in the contract
providing for any special quantity or
pressure of water. Numerous authori
ties are cited to show that in cases like
the one at bar no damages may be ob
tained unless the terms bt the contract
specifically provide for services which
are not given in the emergencies where
losses are sustained.
A Jury in the lower court rendered a
verdict in favor of the town. The Judge
granted the motion for a new trial and
an appeal was taken from hia order by
the plaintiff. The Supreme Court sus
tains the decision of the Judge of the
lower court.
Chaired With Burglary.
Two men entered the room of G. Q.
Ryal in a rooming-house at 408 Post
street yesterday afternoon and stole
an overcoat valued at $50. An alarm
was given and they were chased by
Policemen Hurd and Murphy. The one
that had the overcoat ran inter Slack's
grocery on the corner of Post and Ma
son streets, where he was arrested in
a rear room. He gave the name Mich
ael J. Sullivan, but papers were found
in his pocket showing that his name
was Michael J. Regan and that he was
discharged from Alcatraz Island on
January 15, having been a member of
the Eleventh Cavalry. He was booked
at the City Prison on a charge of bur
glary.
Geary-Street Road's Receipts.
The Geary Street Railroad Company
yesterday deposited with the City
Treasurer a check for $682 80, being 5

OMAHA SPORT ARRESTED
FOR GOING A FAST PACE
Chauffeurs a Chug-Chug Wagon at an Unlawful
j Speed Through Ignorance of the LawâSterl
ing, Bad Man, Heavily Bonded to Answer
J. C. Riley comes from Omaha, where
the laws provide that a man may go
as fast as he wlsheB, provided he pays
the bills. There trolley cars shoot down
the hill like falling stars and out on
the plains to the west men are per
mitted to ride horses until they fall
from exhaustion.
Mr. Riley, who is thought of so high
ly In Omaha, came to San Francisco
on a holiday trip. He found an abode
at the Palace Hotel and after he had
located the soap and towels in the
bathroom he telephoned for an auto
mobile. When it arrived he discharged
the chauffeur and drove the ch'u-chu
machine himself. The gearing of the
automobile must have been wrong, be
cause when he passed Third street his
machine was making 84& miles to the
hour. He was going so fast that Po
iiceman Jordan had only a memory t of
a Mash of red that sped by him.
When Riley returned from his way
ward couise he was put under arrest
and came before Judge Mogafo yester
day. The Judge listened to the plea
made by the defendant that they go
"some" in Omaha without being haul
ed up for violating a speed ordinance
and took. into consideration the ignor
ance of the law, which ordinarily will
excuse nobody. On this excuse Riley
was allowed to go free, with a warning
to observe more closely the ordinances
of the municipality regarding a speedy
trip in San Francisco.
' s â¢ m â 
George Sterling, the real Honolulu
sugar can,e in the way of a bad man,
was bound over to trial in the Superior
Court yesterday by Judge Conlan on
charges of robbery and assault to kill.
His bonds were fixed at $5000 on each
charge.
He is the man that invaded the room
of George Evans on Third street and
robbed him. The following morning
Detective Ed. O'Dea placed him under
arrest for the crime. Evans identified
him and held a pistol close to the pris
oner's face while the detective started
to handcuff Sterling. Suddenly Ster
ling grasped the pistol from Evans'
hand and tried to kill Detective O'Dta
with it. In defense O'Dea struck Ster
ling with the handcuffs and knocked
him down a flight of stairs. As soon
as he fell into the street and found his
feet, he made a get-away as far as
San Bernardino, where he was cap
tured. .
There he did an all-star performance
by beating a turnkey, dashing his
breakfast into a visitor's face and mak
ing a desperate attempt to escape
from his durance. In Judge Conlan's
court when he appeared first, he con
fided to Bailiff Mike Walsh that if he
was equipped with two guns he would
kill the Judge and clean out the court
room. Mike took him by the ear and
wrung him out a little bit and Ster
ling forgot the fighting mood entirely.
* â¢ *
Marie Faulkner is badly wanted in
Judge Conlan's court. She preferred a
charge of subornation of perjury
against Mrs. Sarah Rogers, the widow
of "Duxie" Rosenbeum. who killed
himself at the Lurline Baths some
years ago.
The' arrest of Mrs. Rogers grew out
of an assault alleged to have been
made upon. , fier^.hy George and Ed.
Marshall, the two well known race
track men.
Mrs. Rogers was present in court to
answer the charge, but the complain
ing witness could not be found. If she
Is -still in the city the police will ex
orcise their efforts to find and produce
her in court.
Mrs. Gertie Kaplan has been discov
ered. She is the woman arrested by
Policeman Bruce for donning unseem
ly raiment, contrary to the 3tatutes in
such cases made and provided. When
she was picked up it was a serious
question whether she was "Aphrodite
Arising from the Sea," or merely a re
production of "Night," with all the
scintillations c-f the stars about her.
To Judge Conlan yesterday she ex
plained the situation in a satisfactory
manner, and she was dismissed. She
said that she intended to attend a
mask ball at B'nai B'rith Hall, where
large rewards were offered for the best
costume. "I dressed as the flag of
Jerusalem," she told the Judge, "and
I was certain of gaining the first prize.
When the rÂ»oliceman arrested me I
cried and blew* my make-up."
"The flag of Jerusalem?" queried the
INSANITY PLEA
WILL BE MADE
Attorneys for Edmond De La
brousse, Accused of Murder,
Indicate Defense at Trial
The Impaneling of a jury to try the
case of Edmond de Labrousse, charged
with murder, was commenced in Judge
Dunne's court yesterday. Only seven
were selected when the venire was ex
hausted and a special' venire was Is
sued, returnable to-morrow morning.
The seven are: Henry T. Bray,- M.
Ahem, Franklin White, J. Stamper, C.
P. Wright, F. W. Swan and John M.
Loane. The defendant is represented
by Attorneys Koach and Alford and
tho people by District Attorney By
ington and Assistant District Attorney
Whiting. From the questions asked
the jurors by the defendant's counsel
it is evident that a. plea of temporary
insanity will be put forward.
Labrousse had been paying his ad
dresses to Miss Marie Jordan, a sales
woman in a store on Kearny street,
but owing to an objection to his habits
he had been asked to stop calling at
hei* -mother's house, 1459 Sacramento
street. On September 29, when she
went homo to her- lunch, Labrousse
was waiting for her aa she stepped off
the car at Sacramento and Hyde
streets. He spoke to her and walked
beside her till they , reached her
mother's house. When they got inside
the front gate Labrousse quickly pull
ed a revolver out of his pocket and
fired two shots into her body. As Bhe
lay on the ground he flred another shot
at her, then placed the revolver to his
left ear and pulled the trigger twice,
but each time the cartridge failed to
explode. He coolly looked into the
muzzle, and, pointing the weapon
downward, fired a bullet Into the
ground. Then he again placed the
muzzle to his left ear and succeeded in
wounding himself In the head. . The
girl died almost . immediately from tho
effect of the wounds. v
In court yesterday Labrousse kept
his head' buried. in his hands and tears
rolled down his cheeks.
WASHINGTON. Keb. 10.â The Senate to-ilay
confirmed Thomas N.;Jrtml*8cn as naval officer
of/CU4tomÂ« In the district of Chlcaco. .
Judge. "What does that look like?"
Julius Kahn, the ex-Congressman who
is fighting Livernash for a seat in the
coming: House of Representatives, was
called upon. by the court as an amicua
curiae. there were a few whispered
words in Hebrew and Kahn told the
Judge that Mrs. Keplan was merely
trying to represent "The Star of Da
vid." When the policeman arrested me
for wearing scanty attire," said Mrs.
Keplan. "I showed him my cap and
told him that I had a star larger than
the one he wore on his coat."
Mrs. Ella Walsh, who "was arrested
on a charge of grand larceny, was dis
missed by Judge Cabaniss yesterday.
The complaining witness was Cornelius
Deasley. One day in a meat shop far
out on the Mission Deasley discovered
that he and Mrs. Walsh had both lived
at the foot of the Wicklow Mountains
and had drunk of the copper laden wa
ters. Thereafter they became friends
and when . Deasley was drunk he vis
ited the house of Mrs. Walsh and her
husband and was given tender care.
Last Sunday night, lie said, he femnd
himself loser to the extern of $15, which
he claimed was not in his purse after
Walsh and his wife rocked him to sleep.
Deasley admitted that for several days
he had been on a debauch and on the
night of the alleged larceny he was
in such an incompetent condition that
he didn't know whether he was sleep
ing on the hay wharf or at the Palace
Hotel.
John Roach is a war time drunkard.
When he imbibes sufficient booze he
makes speeches on the street corners.
Judge Mogan asked him yesterday
about the tenor of the glowing words
he spread about the streets in his ex
hilarated condition. \
"All I said," explained the defendant,
"was that they were freeing Cuba,
Porto Rico, Snmoa and the Philippines,
and I was asking why they didn't free
dear old Ireland."
"On a Question of this kind." said
the Judge, "I shall be obliged to pass
the buck to Tammany Hall. My juris
diction is limited to the city and coun
ty of San Francisco, although my sym
pathies are as wide as your desires.
Get hence, but bottle up your trouble
about Ireland. In the dim trail of des
tiny we may reach the goal you desire,
but talking about it on the street cor
ners of San Francisco- will not help the
cause."

Bay Cities Water Company
Declines to Submit Further
Proposition to the City
AWAITS THE ARBITRATION
Another Tender Will Not Be
Made Unless Negotiations
With the Contra Costa Fail
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Feb. 10.
The Bay Cities Water Company has
decided to withhold all propositions
touching the sale of a municipal water
supply to the city of Oakland pending
the result of negotiations between the
city and the Contra Costa Water Com
pany along the lines of the special
water committee's report.
This announcement was made to-day
by Mayor Warren ,Olney. who supple
mented it with the explanation that the
Bay Citios Water Company was still in
the market, and in the event of a fail
ure of the plan of arbitration with the
i'ontra Costa Water Company would
perhaps submit a modification of its
originaUproposals.
After the Ray Cities Water Company
had been notified about the unfavor
able report of Expert Desmond Fitzger
ald on the onKrineerir.g and watershed
scheme of the projert the corporation
withdrew its proposition, which had
been submitted to Mayor Olney. After
the City Council had received the com
mittee's report that body by resolution
requested the Bay Cities people to sub
mit a second proposal. It is the declina
tion of the company to accede to that
request at this time which Mayor Ol
n*y has announced.
Concerning the situation Mayor Ol
nev said:
â¢â¢The Bay Cities Water Company has
no proposition to make at this time.
Though the company is ready to sell
water, it declines to make any further
trnders to thÂ» city while the city is ne
gotiating with the Contra Costa Water
Company. If there should be a failure,
then the Bay Cities Company would
consider that it is still in the field.
"Engineer Fitzgerald rejected the
proposition on the ground that the
â watrrrhed was not large enough and
that the kind of dam the company pro
posed to construct had never been
given a practical test. As an engineer
expert Fitzgerald was not willing to
give his sanction to the untried
theory."
LITTLE WILLIAM MASSIE
IS rOIND IN ANTIOCH
Boy Is Placed Temporarily In Hands
of a Society by Judse
Hall.
OAKLAND. Feb. 10.â Little Wil
liam Marsie, the adopted son of Mr.
â¢ind Mrs. John Missie, whom the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children endeavored to get possession
of last week through a process in the
courts, was located at Antloch with
Mrs. â¢ Margie this morning by Under
Sheriff Hanafin, who took the child
and produced both the little fellow
Â«nd his foster mother before Judge
Hall this afternoon. The Judge made
?n order temporarily placing the
< hild in the custody of Miss C. Anita
Whitney of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children pend
ing the hearing of the case.
In explanation of her husband's
etatement that she was in Oregon she
Bald phe had gone there and remained
one day and came back to Antioch.
She said she had not notified her hus
band of the Fudden change in her
p'.ans. She said, however, that she
was willing to produce the child in
court any time the Judge might say,
but the Judge said he would not take
any more chancps and made an order
giving the child into the care of Miss
Whitney until the hearing of the case.
The society claims that the child
has been ill treated. The mother of
the lad shot his father and her where
abouts is unknown. At the age of
one year the boy fell into the hands
of Mas?ie, who claims to be the little
fellow's cousin. Mossfe lives at 1015

STUDENTS HAZE THEIR
OWN ADVERTISEMENT
Import "Majah Waters" From Oak
land and Then Worry Him Until
He Takes to His Heels.
BERKELEY, Feb. 10.â The sopho
mores at the University of California
introduced a new mode of advertising
on the college campus this morning.
It was "Majah Waters" of Oakland,
tall and black and regaled like Uncle
Sam. He carried a shield that bore
a legend announcing the time and
day of the minstrel show. A number
of junior plug hats were stolen from
the "Majah" while he was perambu
lating around the campus. This after
noon the "sophs" surrounded him and
escorted him around the grounds.
Occasionally the "Majah" would
lose a piece of his clothes or be sent
sprawling on the sward. He was Jos
tled about so much that he even lost
some of his teeth. It became so
strenuous for the advertisement after
a while that he decided to leave for
Oakland. The "Majah" protested as
he went that he had seen enough of
higher education.

"Civic pride and cohesion is the ad
vantage that Los Angeles has over
Oakland," declared Mayor Warren Ol
ney to-day on his return from the
Southern* California trip made by the
Oakland Board of Trade.
"The people in Los Angeles pull to
gether. Their pride in their city is
tremendous. Their enthusiasm for Los
Angeles is marvelous." continued the
Mayor. "But in nothing else does the
Southern California city compare with
Oakland. Our city has better streets,
cleaner and more inviting. But the
Los Angelenos have built artificial
lakes and surrounded them with parks.
Eliminate the great tourist travel and
Los Angeles would not stand compari
son with Oakland. Our natural advan
tages are so far ahead of theirs that
the lead is too great for contrast."
Mayor Olney declared that the gar
bage incinerating plant in Los Angeles
was odorless, though primitive as com
pared with the plant in Oakland. His
Honor complimented the Angelenos for
their hospitality and the efforts of offi

DRINKS POISON
AFTER QUARREL
Girl, Despondent Because of
Tiff With Her Lover, Ends
Life With Carbolic Acid
BODY , FOUND BY SISTER
For the Third Time the Coro
ner Takes Body Away From
a Home in lower Districts
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 10.
Magdalena Fella, 18 years-, old, an
operative at the California Cotton
Mills, committed suicide to-day by
swallowing carbolic acid in the base
ment of her home, 660 Madison street.
The body, with an empty Vial marked
"poison" near it, was found this even
ing by Lizzie Fella, 1G years old, a sis
ter of the dead girl.
A lovers' quarrel was the cause of the
suicide, according to the sister's ex
planation to Deputy Coroner Henry
Quellen. Miss 'Fella had been keeping
company for some time with John An
derson, a painter, residing at Twenty
second street and San Pablo ave
nue. Anderson called Sunday night
at the Fella home and the young
woman went to the theater with her
friend, returning late that night. Last
night Anderson was at the house and
the pair went out. When the girl re
turned home she was crying and told
her sister that she had quarreled with
Anderson, and did not care to see him
any more.
As usual, Miss Fella took her lunch
basket this morning and left the house,
apparently to go to work. Instead of
following her customary route to the
local train at Seventh and Oak streets,
the girl went into the basement so
quietly that she attracted no one's at
tention. There she arranged herself on
a pile of stove wood and drank the vial
of caustic fluid. The body was cold in
death when the sister found it.
Three times has the Coroner been
called to the Fella home. The first
death there that demanded the official's
attention was that of Charles Fella, the
father, who died August 14, 1900, from
ptomaine poisoning. The trouble was
traced to bad fish eaten by the man.
Next came Charles Fella Jr., who died
October 17, 1901, from injuries sus
tained by being struck by a Southern
Pacific Company's train. The third
case is that of the despondent girl who
ended her life to-day.
Besides a sister the decedent is sur
vived by her mother.
Coroner Mehrmann will hold an in
quest to-morrow.

Child Canse of Legal Action.
John C. Applewhite, who was granted
a divorce from Edith L. Applewhite in
Oregon a few years ago, filed a suit
yesterday to determine to whom shall
belong the custody of their one child,
no disposition of the child having been
made in the divorce decree. He says
he Is perfectly willing to allow the little
one to remain in the custody of its
mother and to pay the cost of its main
tenance, but wants it understood that
he does not forfeit any of a father's
rights by consenting that the child
shall remain with the mother.

{ THE SW/FT SPECIFIC CO., ATLANTA, GA-
KENILWORTH RUNS SECOND TO STUYVE
IN THE DISTANCE EVENT AT INGLESIDE
Mr. Farnum, Pilot
ed by Bonner, a
Long Shot. -
It begins to look as if Harry* Stover's
brotvn horse Keailworth is doomed
never to win another handicap. The
"bird"* carried toj> weight, 115 pounds,
in the J1CQ<} event, over one and a six
teenth miles, at Ingieside yesterday,
and finished second to Stuyve, â¢which
was piloted by Hildebrand and picked
up 110 pounds. The latter was held an
eien money chance in the ring, and Jit
that figure was heavily played. Grafter
and Joe Lesser were both backed, â¢while
Kenilworth, a 13 to 1 shot, had few
friends. Stover's horse made all the
running, with the favorite trailing.
About the time the paddock was
reached Keniltrorth was all in, and
Stuyve won handily.
Joe Lesser, Major Tenny and Grafter
could not stir up a respectable gallop,
the show going to iL J. Daly's Judge.
TRACK IS MUDDY.
The track was still in a muddy con
dition, but the horses ran fairly well to
form. Et Tu Brute, Stuyve and Sad
Sam were the winning favorites.
Nf> wonder the smart ones unloaded
on Et Tu Brute, sending the Moran
entry to the post favorite for the open
in?; sprint. Jack Martin had the mount
on Huiford. the 7 to 5 second choice,
which went o%-er to the post and got
left- Johnny Daly piloted Et Tu Brute
and the gelding went cmt and won by
himself. Jack Little, a 30 to 1 shot.
was second, and Doris ran third.
Solomon Bonner, the colored chap,
ms.de his first appearance of the season
on Mr. Famum. a 13 to 1 shot, in the
five and a half furlong event and came
through. The talent played Hilde
brand, who h,ad the mount an- Subur
ban Queen, the even money favorite.
The mare made a lamentable showing
for such a short priced one, finishing
third. Mr. Farnum stood a long drive,
downing Solinus, a 50 to 1 shot, less
than a length.
Another outsider, Polonius. nearly
landed the Futurity course number fcrl
iowing. Twenty to one was chalked
about the Burns & YTaterhouse cast
off and, well ridden by Johnny Daly.
he was only led out* half a length by
Lansdowne, one of the second choices,
with Roach on his back.
THE PRIDE TIRES BADLY.
The Pride, the 11 to 5 favorite, look
ed a winner at the head of the stretch
but became tired, running a close
third. Quiz â was badly handled.
For Eome unexplained reason every
body seemed to think that Sad Sam
was going to be beaten for the six
furlong selling fixture. The books laid
S to 5 until the barrier was sprung.
The chestnut led from start to finish.
Hainault was a troublesome factor
throughout and at the wire only lost
by a neck. The Don secured show hon
ors from Colonel Van.
Joe Yeager made a circuit of the ring :
playin? Mr. Dingle to win the last, a j
mile and fifty yard run, and he finished i
third. Roach, with First Chip, a 12 !
to 1 shotC tried to steal the race and \
nearly succeeded. The outsider opened
up a big gap of daylight over his com
pany, but weakened some the last six
teenth and was nipped out a head by
Pierce J with Willie Pee in the saddle.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Hildebrand rode but one winner.
Bonner made his first appearance
of the season on the back of Mr. Far
num and put up a vigorous finish. In
the race following he piloted Quiz, a
3 to 1 chance that drifted back in the
batting, and his effort this time was an
exceedingly mild one.
Jack Martin was fined S25 be
sides a two-day suspension for getting
left at the post with Huiford.
Jay Ransch was in the city yester
day on his way back to France,
where he will again sport the Van
derbilt colors. Jay has been paying a
visit to the home of his parents In

HORSEMEN MAKE
MANY CHANGES
Yonnsrer Element Gains Desired
Representation in the Na
tional Trotting Association
NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â Important
changes were made in the directorate
of the National Trotting Association
at the twenty-second annual congress
of the association held to-day at the
Murray Hill Hotel. Interest centered
in the efforts of wealthy owners of
light harness horses and trotting
tracks, constituting the "so-called
younger element in the sport, to obtain
control of the organization.
Representatives of this class have
been in -session for several days pre
paring for the contest before the con
gress. It became known to-day that
they had decided to incorporate the
grand circuit under the laws of the
State of Michigan. It was decided at
the same time that the new grand cir
cuit should appoint stewards of racing
meetings who should be competent to
make findings independent of the
board of review. This raised the ques
tion of Jurisdiction between the Na
tional Association and the new .Grand
Circuit, which was settled by a ccm
pronise reached at a conference held
between President Johnston and
Messrs. Campau. Butler and Taylor,
which was ratified at the congress to
day. , â¢ â¢
The following officers were unani
mously elected: President. P.. P. Johns
ton, Lexington, Ky.; first vice presi
dent. Morgan G. Bulkley. Connecticut;
second vice president, N. T. Smith, San
Francisco; treasurer. Lewis J. Powers,
Springfield, Mass.; secretary, W/ H.
Cochern, Hartford. For the Western
district, John C. McKerron of San
Francisco succeeded E. P. Heald of
the same city. A. B. Spreckels and
John C. Kirkpatrick of San Francisco
were also continued.
On the question of matinee perform
ances it was decided that a horse shall
not take his mark from any perform
ance of this sort. Such contests are.
to be regarded as "contests of speed."
After discussion of the amendment
of the rules providing for the announce
ment of the sale of a horse previous
to a race in which it was entered it
was decided that the owner must give
notice to the secretary of the track
and through him to the judges of the
changing hands of any horse or the
leasing of him after 7 o'clock on the
evening preceding any race in which
the animal had been entered. The con
gress then adjourned.
Alleges He Was FaLtely Imprisontftl.
SANTA CRUZ, , Feb. 10.â H. Rich
has filed suit against the Bis Creek
Power Company to recover $10,005
damAffes, claiming that the company
had him arrested on December K,
190J, \rithout probable cause. He
was imprisoned for eight hours before
he secured bail. -.
Presents Altar to Clinrch.
SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 10. â St Mich
ael's Church at Boulder Creek has
been presented with, a /beautiful altar
by H. L. Middletdn. The altar is of
Gothic design and constructed of Bcl
lingham Bay pine, ornamented with
pillars of Boulder Creek curly ami
wavy redwood.
AMATEUR CLUBS
STILL DEFIANT
Promoters Announce That They
'Will Conduct Their Affairs
Independent of the P. A. A.
C0M3riTTEE WARNS BOXERS
Alex Greg-^ains Will^Xot Al
low His Sonthside Organi
zation "to Desert the Fold
The war is still on between the Pa
cific Athletic Association aod the ama
teur boxing clubs of this city and Oak
land. The promoters of the fighting
game are defiant and announce that
they have taken a decisive stand and
will stay by it. The association - is
awaiting results and the big bomb < may
explode at any time. _
The registration committee of the
association, made up of George James,
Herbert Hauser and Thomas Harris,
met last night and waited in vain for
the boxing promoters and for the fight
ers who took part in the last exhibi
tion of tha Lincoln Club to materialize-
However, the expected parties did not
put in an appearance, so the conference
could not take place.
So far the San Francisco Athletic
Club has not joined forces with the
others'. Just what this club will do re
mains to be seen, though it was tipped
around yesterday that Manager Alex
Greggains would stand by the. associa
tion. The other club promoters say
they do not care whether the San
Francisco Club comes in or not.
It was announced last night that
Paul Martin, \the champion feather
weight, will not meet Joe Carroll at the
monthly exhibition of the Lincoln Club
as advertised. It is also stated that
the Occidental Club will not allow
Carroll to go on.
The association officials say if the
Lincoln Club gives its show it -will be
barred from the association and will be
heavily fined before being admitted
again." It is understood that the man
agement of the Lincoln Club has al
ready secured a permit from the Board
of Supervisors to hold the boxing ex
hibition. They announce the fights will
take place under their auspices and
that, all the boxers billed to fight will
appear.

All of the Californlan's playing was not
high "class as he missed a number of
easy strokes, but bis average playing
was excellent- He scored half of the
ten goals made in the game by both
teams.
He missed an easy stroke for a goal
in the first period, the ball being just
outside the posts. Before the end of
the period Ezra made amends for this
misplay on the part of his teammate
by scoring for their side.
The second period was full of fast
work, although neither side scored.
The Reds drove the ball just outside
the goal posts after a great scrimmage.
The Reds nearly scored again early
in the third period, but luck seemed
against them. Walter McCreery of
the Whites suddenly picked the ball
out of a scrimmage and ran it down
the field, placing it for Walter Hobart.
who scored a goal. Ezra repeated this
a moment later, making the score 3
goals to 0 in favor of the Whites.
The Reds missed still another
chance of scoring- early In the fourth
period. Walter Hobart secured pos
session of the ball and ran It down
the field, scoring for the Whites.
Walter McCreeiy performed a like ser
vice shortly after. John Lawson then
broke the Ice for the Red3, scoring
their first goal.
Walter Hobart added another goal
to the score of his side in the fifth
period. He was followed by Garland,
who made a brilliant shot at a dif
ficult angle. The Reds soon had the
ball outside their opponents* goal, but
the fates were against them and the
ball did not roll over the line.
The Whites scored two more goals
in the last period, winning by a score
of 8 goals to 2. The teams were made

Government.
Among the Gaelic's passengers were
several war correspondents. One of
these, H. T. Whickham, represents the
London Morning Post. Another, F.
A. Brandt, formerly on the editorial
staff of the New York Sun, Is going
to the Far East as a free lance. Sir
Bryan Leighton of Great Britain, who
has been spending some months in
California, also sailed on the liner.
He is going out "to see the fun, you
know," and anticipates "a rather jolly
good time of It."
Mrs. W. F. Hancock, wife of Cap
tain Hancock of the Seventh Infantry,
sailed on the Gaelic and is going to
the Philippines to join her husband.
E. J. Bates and A. F. Thane, well
known in the local commercial world,
were also passengers.
The Gaelic carried but twenty-seven
Japanese passengers, fewer than
usual, and of these only seven were
returning for the purpose of bearing
arms. What the patriots lacked in
numbers, however, was made up in
the enthusiasm and numerical
strength of the Japanese friends who
escorted them to the Gaelic and
cheered along the gallant seven by
singing "Onward, Christian Soldier!"
and giving voice to a series of Japan
ese warwhoops. The seven viewed the
patriotic enthusiasm of their fellow
countrymen . in sober silence and al
lowed those who were remaining in
the land of the free to make all the
demonstration.
John Fowler, United States Consul
General at Chefu, left for his post.
The liner's passengers included the
following named:

OX PANAMA CANAIi
President Roosevelt and Secretary
Shaw Discuss Finances and Per
sonnel of Commission.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â^.s it seems
certain now that the Panama canal
treaty will be ratified soon by the Sen
ate, President Roosevelt has taken up
with Secretary Shaw the arrangements
necessary to be made by the Govern
ment for the payment of the $40,000,000
for the canal property and the $10,000,
000 to the republic of Panama. He also
is giving particular attention to the
personnel of the Isthmian Canal Com
mission which is to have charge of the
construction of the great waterway.
Attorney General Knox has under con
sideration the Spooner act of the last
Congress with a view of determining
whether It affords the President ample
authority to provide for the issuance of
bonds to raise the money immediately
needed and to appoint the commission.
If It should be decided that the Spoon
ed act does not confer that authority no
doubt Is expressed that Congress will
enact promptly the necessary legisla
tion.
As regards the composition of the
Canal Commission, It is thought that
Rear Admiral "Walker, president of the
present commission, will be a member
and probably will head it. Isham Ran
dolph, chief engineer of the Chicago
drainage canal, and General George W.
Davis, U. S. A., retired, also It is be
lieved have been decided upon as mem
bers of the commission.

The Money Market and the War.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says,
â¢ under date of the Cth :
"It is. of course, impossible to predict what
demands war between Russia and Japan will
make upon the world's money markets. The
uncertainties of war are proverbial. Yet the
chance* are that thej^ demands will not be
crious. Both countries have thus far made
very ext^nfive r>reiÂ«raUons without unusual
outside liorrowincs: both countries have far
from exhausted their own monetary resources,
an 1 !, uhile the last Russian budget was a
poor one, both Russia and Japan could, if nec
essary, carry on hostilities for a considerable
period without heavy borrowings. In all prob
ability, however, one If not both of the con
testants would put out a loan to relieve the
pressure of taxation at home, the amount of
which would J>e largely governed by the exi
gencies and length of the struggle. Experts
grntrally agree that the war will be of short
duration, and that a decisive victory at sea
would brinr It quickly to an end. There are
tomf, trhofce opinion is entitled to much
wf.ih!. who Â«xj>ect peace considerably within
a year after the outbreak, but, as already Bald,
rredlrticns as to war are notoriously unre-
Ratle; for example, the late Boer War, which
everybody exacted would prove only a matter
of a few weeks, lasted over two years. The
conclusion to be derived, however, from such
â ::.;:.â¢ s r.fc is that no heavy demands from
either Russia or Japan are in immediate pros
pect, and the chances of a ehort struggle ma
terially diminish the probability cf serious dis
turbance in the international money markets.
A further fall on the declaration of war
might be expected in foreign security values
which would be partially reflected here;
though, on the other hand. It might develop
that the situation had been partly discounted
la advance.

Nezu York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. Feb. 10.â The average level
of prices in the stock market got back about
where It was Monday nightâ th^t Is to say.
the recovery of yesterday was lost. There
were no new developments to account for the
reaction, but thera was some recurrent force
to the considerations which weakened the mar
ket on Monday. The principal factor in check
ing the advance wae the distrust felt as . to
the consideration of the operations which car
ried prices upward yesterday. This was em
phasized by the very patent profit -taking In
the United States Steel preferred on the part
of a prominent trader and the very obvious"
manipulation by whiQh it was sought to offset
this by bidding up a few specialties here and
there. There was a suspicious feeling also
that the marking up of prices yesferay had
been more or less artificial and designed to
afford a basis for some of the selling, which
it Is believed will be necessary to cover losses
In Baltimore, although it is possible that It
may be deferred. The action of yesterday's
market Rave voice to a surmise among the
speculative element that the financial markets
might be expected to sympathize with Jap
anese successes in the course of the war. but
to-day's market failed to bear out that sur
mise as prices receded on the additional news
of Russian losses. ThÂ« presence in the city
of the Secretary of the Treasury to discuss
the method of effecting the Panama canal
payment directed attention anew to that sub
ject although the Secretary's opinion was
quoted that the operation could be concluded
without disturbance to the market, as with
the further addition to resources ot Â«uch
portion of the canal payment as is v.ithdrawn
directly from the sub-treasury. The real re
pressive influence ec-ems to be the fear of tx
cessive corporation borrowing* and the extra
requirements involved in the Baltimore fire
losses, the consequent necessary extension of
credits and the Panama canal payments. The
i-harp rise In Brooklyn Rapid Transit and in
Amalgamated Copper divided influence with
the weaknt*Â« of United States Steel preferred
for a time, but weakness gained on the whole
market and the closing was at nearly the
lowest.
An important banking failure In Bremen
was a contributing factor to the weakness,
and rumors were circulated several times
during the day of the death of Senator Hanua. I
The Ftatemcnt of exports of domestic products
for January fell so far short of the recent
level of increase in previous years as to cause
some disappointment.
Bonds were ea9y. Total sales (par value),
$1,70Â«J,000. United State* bonds were un%
changed on call. '

NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â The cotton market
opened .23 to 20 points lower on old and 10 to
15 points lower on the new crop months, under
liquidation and bear pressure, following a
sharp break in Liverpool and ugly rumors con
necting the New Orleans bulls with the fail
ures in Bremen and Berlin. Rumors and news
started covering here and prices worked quite
steadily upward until shortly after midday.
March was selling at 13.13c ; May, 13. 45c. and
July at 13.54c, a net advance of 45 ,to 49
points. The rally attracted fresh selling by
the local bear element and prices sagged off
severaj points, but rallied again later, closing
steady at practically the best for the day. a
net advance of 25 to 50 points. Sales were
estimated at 500,000 bales. * -

Buyers and sellers apart: nothing doing.
The cotton market to-day was steady with
nervousness apparent only at times. Fluctua

took readily, indicating that the danger of
further wide breaks was over. At the open- '
inp the market declined from 30 to 45 points
under the closevof yesterday. From these lev
els prices rose until they were at the close
from Hi to 49 points higher than the close of
yesterday and from 74 to 84 points higher than

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Feb. 10.â An â  increased foreign
demand incident to war movements, combined
with the congested local situation, caused an
erratic . wheat market to-day. At one stage
in the trading May showedTi gain of 2Vic from
the low point of the day. The close was firm
and l%c higher than yesterday's closing figure.
Coarse grains were weak and heavy on liquid
ation May corn closing %c lower and oats
down l%c. â¢ Provisions were 6c higher to 10c
lower. .. ..-.,-.. :

to actual war. caused a strong opening in
wheat. May was .Vi@%c to !4@lc higher at

higher at 80%c. to 87%c. Large quantities
were for sale at the advance, however, and
the market quickly lost its early strength.
Before the end of the first half hour May had
declined to 94%c.and July to 8G%c. An urgent
demand for July developed Â«Â»from commission
houses and shorts were fair buyers of both
May and July. The market turned-, strong
again, July steadily advancing until It reached
SS%c while May went up to 67c. a new high
record mark. The strong cash situation in
the Northwest was an important factor in
forcing prices upward. Stocks- at Minneapolis
were considerably decreased and receipts there
were Email. An improved export demand also
was a bull factor late in the day. There was
liberal profit- taking the last hour and the
market lost much of its strength, although
May closed l%e higher at JÂ»(5>g(300%c. and
July ' %a higher at 87%c. - â ' .. ..-

Hay and Feedstuff s.
Dealers continue to report a firm market for
Hay and the gossip about Japanese inquiries
in this city for supplies continues, -but if such
negotiations are in progress they are being
kept very quiet. There is nothing nÂ«w in
Feedrtuffs. ' '.' â¢ ' 11
The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"Shipments of -Hay show a total consider
ably under that of last week, 2700 tons In com
parison with 3500. Very little of Interest can
be reported at this time, for the rainy weather
has interfered materially with trading, and
practically all arrivals have been taken off the
market without being offered to the trade.
Now that the entire State has had rain some
few small lots of Hay will be released, and In
all probability quite a bit of this will find its
way to the San Francisco. market. We will
need It, tor, had, the rain not come, the situa
tion would have become very serious with us.
Very few new orders have come from the out
lying districts since the rain commenced, al
though we will hear from many of these places
later. We get It from good authority that In
Los Angeles County there Is hardly enough
Hay to last them more than a month. This is
true in other districts, and now that they have
had rain to encourage them to continue busi
ness there will surely be a scrambling- around
for Hay before the advent of the new crop.
"With the San Francisco market nothing
new has developed. Now that there Is a
certainty of war in the Orient all markets will
probably brighten vp somewhat. Whether Hay
will bo affected to any great extent or not re
mains to be seen. If, as Is generally expected,
either nation in thÂ« Conflict comes to thin
coast for fodder within the next two or three
months It is hard to predict the limit to
which Hay prices may foar."

of Eggs and the trade reported that brokers
were around again inquiring at what figure
they could make up another possible car for the

be materially lower than they are now. As It

further outside buying, but there was quite a
good deal of realizing, particularly In Lard, in
those, quarters which have been buying heavily
of late. Receipts of Hogs wÂ«re large. The
whole situation is one which depends upon the

THE SAN FRANCISCO, CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1904.
WOULD REDUCE
PLANT'S VALUE
Special Engineer Thinks Ap
praisement of Spring Valley
Company Should Be Lessened
CUTS OFF FIVE MILLIONS
Files Report With the Board of
Works and Eliminates Prop
erty Not Used to Supply Water
Russell L. Dunn, special assistant en
gineer appointed by the Board of Pub
lic Works to represent it at the inves
tigation of the Board of Supervisors
for the fixing of water rates, filed a re
port yesterday relative to the appraise
ment of properties of the Spring Valley
Water Company.
Dunn's report covers â¢ twenty-one
closely type-written pages, in which he
explains voluminously why â¢ certain
properties of the corporation should be
excluded from former valuations of
the plant as a basis for fixing water
rates. The amount by which he re
duces the valuation of approximately
$25,000,000 as fixed by City Engineer
Grunsky aggregates $5,372,346, being for
property claimed by Dunn not to be in
actual use. On this reasoning Dunn's
valuation of the plant would be less
than $20,000,000. Dunn does not attempt
to make an appraisement of the prop
erty in cold figures, contenting himself
with specifying the properties which he
thinks should not enter into the total
valuation upon which the Spring Val
ley Water Company is allowed an in
come. The report continues:
PROPERTIES EXCLUDED.
Of properties -Included and of valuations
made in tHese appraisements of 1901, 1902 and
1903 there would be exclude^ from the proper
appraisement-: 1 â Franchise, (excluded because
It has no value); a suggested valuation of $2.
500.000. 2 â Value due to fact that business Is
established; (excluded because if it be a tan
gible property it is still not the property of
the Spring Valley Water Company); $1,400,
000. 3â Office lot and building at corner of
Stockton and Geary streets, San Francisco:
(excluded because not property ueed; there
would in its place properly be allowed office
rent as an administrative expense) ;
4â Calaveras reservoir site lands; (excluded
because not property used In the supply of
water to San Francisco); these lands are in
the 1901 appraisement at $621,360, in 1002 at
$791,010, and in 1903 at 5419,346. 6â San An
tonio reservoir site lands; (excluded because
not property used); the particular tracts ara
not segregated, but are included in the item
of "Land and rights of Suburban Water Com
pany transferred in 10C2 â "; possibly as much
as 1200,000. 6â Vallejo Mills tract of land
near Miles, former situs of diversion of Ala
meda Creek water right, now removed to
Sunol; (excluded because not property used);
somewhere in the appraisements I have noted
this appraised at about $49,000. 7âWater
works plant on Vallejo Mills tract of land and
old diversion plant including bridge, etc.; (ex
cluded because not property used now); $54.-
OOO. 8 â Construction accounts of incomplete
works on Calaveras reservoir site, on San An
t nlo reservoir site, and on Arroyo Valle Creek;
(excluded because not property now used);
amounts not segregated from other construc
tion accounts of works which are in service.
9â Exclusive of the preceding there are other
lesser properties which would be excluded as
property not used, the valuation items of
these being included in aggregates with values
of properties which are actually used. Total
sum of entirely excluded values it certainly in
excess of $5,372,346. r
On the other hand the appraisements would
be increased by: 10â The difference between
the estimated cost of constructing duplicate
structures of waterworks as stated in the ap
praisemenUj and tho actual Investment cost

praisements of valuaUons of land which Is ac
tually i*ed as the sites of reservoirs.

twelve on the other cannot be Indicated now.
The available data do not Indicate numerical
conclusions.
Recapitulating my examination of the ap
praisements of 1901, 1W>2 and 1903, I beg you
to note that:
1. So account Is taken of the known use ot
eome of the properties for water supply busi
ness outside of San Francisco County. The de.
duction of value for partial service, even
though small, should be accounted.
2. The water rights are not described prop
erly, are not defined correctly, are not ap
praised by any uniform rule of valuation, and
the valuations which have been made have been
inadvertently duplicated in land valuations, im
properly made. *
3. Tracts of land which axe the sites of
structures of water works are not defined and
described as such, and there is no proper rule
of valuation applied. The nature of use as it
is a function of land is eo misunderstood that
uncertain facts and unsound theories have
been inextricably employed In classifying the
lands and in making the valuations.
XO VEHIFIED COSTS.
4. No verified investment costs of struc
tures of water works are used as values In
the appraisements and no verified statements
of depreciation accounts are noted.
5. The franchise is incorrectly defined as
several different things, none of which Is em
ployed in making the suggested valuation of
$2,500,000. The franchise has no value
6. The Item declared to be the valuation
due to the fact that the business is an estab
lished one is baeed, accordlnging to one ex
planation, on the cost of duplication of the
service pipe connections with customers. But
the tangible property in these is the property
of the customers who have paid for these- con
nections. I am unable to see how the Spring
Valley Water Company is entitled to have
counted as an interest earning asset $1,400 000
which, if It be property at all. Is the property
of the water consumers. . .
I beg to advise you that with the proper veri
fied statements of accounts from the company's
books I can make the appraisement asked. by
the resolution of the Board of Supervisors in
about ten days, possibly In less time, and but
for the fact that it is necessary to go over
many statements of Investment accounts and to
ascertain a valuation for the unit quantity of
water of a water right, I could maka the ap
praisement in a day.

ASK THE COURT
TO INTERVENE
Wealthy Stockholders of a Big
Mining Concern Make Serious
Charges Against F. W.Bradley
ALLEGATION OF TRICKERY
Aver That Their Manager Has
, Attempted to Gain Control
of Company by Illegal Means
A suit bristling with serious charges
against Fred W. Bradley, one of the
most prominent of California mining
men, was filed yesterday afternoon. It
ie an action brought by John Hays
Hammond, Cyrus H. McCormick, E. L.
Ryerson, James L. Houghteling, E. A.
Wiltsee, A. Cass Canfield, A- Chester
Beatty, J. E. Doolittle and F. B. Pea
body, all more or less prominently Iden
tified with big mining and commercial
enterprises in the West, to enjoin Brad
ley, as secretary and director, and W.
R. Berry, Edwin Schwab, A. Granger
and W. C. Webb, the other members of
the board of directors of the OroVille
Gold Dredging and Exploration Com
pany, from voting 40,000 shares of stock
of the corporation at its annual meet
ing on February 15. The plaintiffs
charge that these 40,000 shares were re
cently secured by the defendant, Brad
ley, through fraudulent means and for
the apparent purpose of. gaining control
of the company for himself and several
associates, among them Banker W. E.
Crocker, who, with Luther J. Holton
and J. W. Goodwin, are joined with the
defendants in the suit.
RETURNS UNSATISFACTORY.
In the complaint, which was filed by
Attorney Jesse W. Lillenthal, it is al
leged that the Oroville Gold Dredging
and Exploration Company was incor
porated under the laws of Arizona With
a nominal capital of 500,000 shares, of
which, up to February 3, there were is
sued 362,251 shares, and that the major
ity" of these were and are now held by
Hammond, McCormick, Ryerson, Wilt
see, Houghteling, Canfield, Beatly, Doo
little and Peabody. Since the company
was formed, in 1901, Bradley has acted
as its manager, Hi position he holds
through the infjuence of Hammond, of
whom he was a protege in the mining
world. The company purchased large
holdings near Oroville, but owing to
mismanagement by Bradjey, so it is
charged, the properties have not given
profitable results for the development
work done upon them, and it is further
charged that Bradley, in order to jus
tify the failure of the management,
has from time to time publicly de
clared that the company was of no
value by reason of the fact that it had
been Imposed upon by the vendors of
the properties It had acquired. Bradley
Is further accused of having published
a pamphlet of 200 pages, in which he
elaborated on the alleged manner in
which the company had been swindled,
and when the stockholders suggested
the purchase , of additional property
with a view to improving their holdings
he rejected their proposition.
CHARGES AGAINST BRADLEY.
About this time the . stockholders
named as plaintiffs in the suit and
holding the control of the company de
cided on an investigation with a view
to a possible change In the management,
and learning of this move, it is charged,
Bradley late in the afternoon of Febru
ary 4 hurriedly called a meeting of the
directors of the company and by con
nivance with four directors obtained
authority to sell 40,000 shares of unis
sued stock. On the following. morning,
the complaint alleges, Bradley called a
special meeting, at which he announced
that the shares had been disposed of
and that 20,000 had been taken by him
self and the balance equally by Holton
and Goodwin at a rate of $1 per share.
These acts, which the plaintiffs claim
were iregular, following closely upon
Bradley's published statements that the
company's properties were of little or
no value, are cited as evidence of his
illegal plans to secure control of the
company and perpetuate his objection
able management at the annual meet
ing to be held next Monday, and it is
to prevent the voting of these particu
lar 40,000 shares, which would give
Bradley a majority at the meeting, that
the injunction was asked from the
court.
In their prayer the plaintiffs ask that
Bradley, Crockfer, Holton and Goodwin
be restrained from using the stock in
any manner and that they be ordered
to return it to the company and receive
the amount they paid for it. The mat
ter was presented to Judge Kerrigan
yesterday afternoon and an order was
issued citing the defendants to appear
and make answer within ten days. The
parties to the suit have for many years
been closely associated in mining and
other enterprises, and their sudden fall
ing out will attract widespread Interest.

FRANK FRENCH
LANDS AT LAST
Commissioners Appoint Hold
! over State Senator Superin
tendent of Tugs and Dredgers
TWO COLLECTORS NAMED
Board Declines to Give Foster
.& Orear the News Stand
Privilegeifor $1500 a Month
The State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners at a regular session yesterday
afternoon appointed Frank French to
succeed Captain P. T. Brown as super
intendent of tugs and dredgers on
March 1 next. The appointment caused
some surprise In local political circles.
Mr. French is a holdover State Senator,
representing the Twentieth Senatorial
District, composed of the Thirty-third
and Thirty-fourth Assembly districts.
Captain Brown was appointed super
intendent January 13, 1896. The com
pensation attaching to the office is $2400
per annum. There is gossip in political
camps to- the effect that the chief law
yer, of the Southern Pacific advised the
appointment of Senator French.^
A. D. Davidson of Stockton was ap
pointed collector, vice L. A. Henry, re
signed. Louis Strohle, San Francisco,
was appointed collector, vice Fred
Smythe, term expired. The salary of
a collector on the . water front is $100
per month. The foregoing changes
were made without dissent or discus
sion in the open session of the Com
missioners. If any differences of opin
ion existed they were adjusted at an
executive session or conference of the
board.
The following resolution framed by
President Spear was Introduced by
Commissioner Kirkpatrlck and unani
mously adopted by the board:
"Resolved, . That the rules and regu
lations of the board be amended by
adding a new section thereto to be
numbered 44^, which section shall read
as follows:
"Holders of permits to sell perish
able products on the wharves and other
State property under the jurisdiction
of the board must on demand sell to
purchasers on such wharves and other
State, property potatoes in lots as small
as ten sacks and onions in lots as small
as five sacks."
. Chief Engineer Norton submitted a
report on bids for preserving piles. The
commission awarded the contract to H.
R. Rood & Co. at 40 cents per lineal
foot. The amount involved Is $5000.
NORTH SHORE LINE.
The overhead incline for the North
Shore ferry slip having been completed,
the company henceforth will pay a
rental of $600 a month, an amount equal
to the sum paid by the California
Northwestern. Â»
General N. P. Chipman. heading a
delegation from the State Board of
Trade, waited on the commission and
requested that a change should be made
which would enable visitors tp reach
the Board of Trade exhibit direct from
the grand nave. Architect Wright, who
was with the delegation, estimated that
the direct stairway could be provided
at a cost not exceeding $2500. It was
asserted, moreover, that the proposed
new entrance would enhance the archi
tectural beauty of the nave.

000 people visited the Board of Trade
exhibit every month. Last month there
were 2500 registrations. It was noted
that about. 25 per cent of the visitors
registered. The Board of Trade as ten
ant of the commision asked for the im
provement.
President Spear fancied that $2500
could not be expended to better ad
vantage for the State. Architect
Wright was requested to present de
tailed plans, on which the commission
could advertise for bids. It was indi
cated that the request of the delega
tion would be granted if the lowest bid
approximated $2500.
Colonel Samuel Taylor, speaking for
the Key Route, requested the commis
sion to provide additional facilities in
the depot for travel on that route. The
Commissioners thanked him for the
visit and promised to take the request
under advisement.
NEWS STAND PRIVILEGE.
The commission was on the point of
adjourning when W. C. Van Fleet came
forward with a suggestion that final
action be taken on the news stand
privilege. He remarked that the bid of
Foster & Orear of $1500 a month was
still under advisement. He said: "Feb
ruary 14 is the time fixed for the firm
to vacate. Is the board ready to act on
our bid? I would like some action."
"What is the pleasure of the board?"
asked President Spear.
All the members of the commission
freely participated in the long silence
which followed the president's inquiry.
The tension was relieved by Commis
sioner Kirkpatrick, who remarked: "Is
it not about time to advertise for bids,
with a view of ascertaining definitely
what this privilege Is worth to the
State? Is it not our duty to advertise?
The matter has drifted into an unfor
tunate condition. The rental is from
month to month, but no one can do
business unless ; there is some perma
nanency. We cannot go along giving
A the privilege one month and
allowing B to come in with an
other bid. There should be a definite
settlement. I have been asked if a
higher bid than $1500 would be accept
ed.,. Perhaps we have not been offered
the amount the State ought to receive.
I understand that a large sum of money
i3 paid for a similar privilege on railway
trains."
President Spear said the commission,
â¢onder the law, could only grant the
permit from month to month. Adver
tising for bids would not settle the
question.
Commisioner Mackenzie fancied that
1 it would be . a good plan to let Rooney
have the privilege for a time at $1200
a month, and thereafter the true value
! of the concession might be ascertained.
Mr. Van Fleet said the State gave
the board power to let the privilege
from month to month only, and It was
the board's power and duty to award
the privilege to the highest bidder.
This allusion to the board's duty net
tled President Spear, who facetiously
remarked that every Commissioner
ought to have a brother-in-law to dis
cover the real value of the privilege.
Mr. Van Fleet admitted that the
value was uncovered by a brother-in
law and quoted the saying: "Scratch
a Russian and you will find a Tartar."
The board adjourned without taking
further action. It is the sense of the
majority of the board that the privilege
is awarded to Rooney for $1200 a month,
and that Foster & Â©rear's offer of $1500
is on file.
