IT was on a bitterly cold and frosty
morning, toward the end of the
winter of 1597, that I was awak
ened by a tugging at my shoulder.
It was Holmes. The candle in his
hand shone upon his eager, - stooping
face and told me at a glance that
something was amiss:
"Come, Watson, come!" he cried.
"The game is afoot. ?Cot a word I- Into
your clothes and come!"
Ten minutes later we. we're both in a
cab and rattling through xhe silent
streets on our way to. Charing. Cross
station. The first faint winter's dawn
was beginning to appear and we. could
dimly see the occasional figure of an,
early workman as he jtassed us.~blu.rr4d
and indistinct in the opalescent : Lost
don reek. Holmes nestled in silence,;
into his heavy, coat and I. was glad: tcr
do the same, for. the .air was most!bitr.

It was not until we had consumed:
some hot tea at the station: and taken
our places in the Kentish train that
we were sufficiently- thawed, he i to"
speak and 1 to listen. Holmes drew â¢
c note from his pocket and read -it â¢:
aloud; 'V ' I ":' ' â¢* -'

"Hopkins has called \u25a0me
in seven times and on each
occasion his summons has
been entirely justified." said
Holmes. "I fancy that every
one of his cases ha.s found its
way into . your collection, and I â¢
must admit, Watson, that you
have some power .of selection t[.
which atones for much which I de- :
plcre in your narratives. Your fatal ,
habit of looking at- everything from
the point of view of a story instead of
as a scientific exercise has ruined what
might have been an instructive and
even classical series of demonstrations.
You slur over, work ef the utmost
finesse and delicacy, in order to dwell
upon sensational details â¢ which . may
excite, but cannot possibly instruct,
the reader." ....
"Why do you not write them your-
Belf?" I said, with some bitterness.
"I will, my. dear Watson, I will. At
present I An, as you know, fairly busy,
but & propose to devote my declining
years to the composition .of a . text
book, which shall focus the whole art
of detection into one volume. Our pres
ent research appears to be a case of
murder." f -

1 1 T I>S a P er^ ect shame. XÂ»ook at
â¢â¢ I that lawn! Cut right straight
I across from the lilacs to the
** sidewalk, as if we kept a little
chain gang of elephants trotting
over it. I wouldn't have it, Nell! I'll
turn the hose on those boys." '\u25a0 ,v'
'T>on't Jabber over it, Kit You'll
only -get all red and warm and fussy
and. some one may hear you."
Kit scowled defiantly at the broad
bay window of the. house- next door.
The shades were ..lowered arid the
blinds half closed. On one window
sill a plump 'tortoise-shell cat dozed
comfortably. Peace evidently reigned
within and It was the habitation of-the
enemy.
; "I don't care who hears me. - Who
ever hears- 1 â " Kit raised her voice,
ever so little, Just enough to carry
.over the tortoise-shell cat "They must
know all about it anyway. How would
they like it if we trampled paths all
over their lawn day and night?" \u0084
" '"There comes one of them." Nell
paused ln",her. sweeping on the little
vine-covered porch and waited anx
iously. "Nowdon't be huffy, sis."
Kit sat immovable In the dandelion
starred I grass and"; watched the com
ing boy with .'disapproving, menacing*
eyes. He was rather a nice boy to
look at, too,* somewhere around 15,
and he whistled as he came along the
sidewalk in .front of the â¢ Norton cot
tage.-There-was a break In the low
box hedge made by. vandals, but this
vandal disdained it and added insult
to Injury by r Jumping over the hedge
and bbldly'starting across the path; . v">
"How'do, Miss Norton?" he called'
cheerily. "Pretty hot to-day, isn't
It?"- it \u25a0 -:: \u25a0 ' .v. -, }J _,' .
"Say, Dick, McLean, we don't want
you .three boys* tramping â¢ over 4 our
lawn." Kit spoke with dignity and
severity. "It. makes a regular \u25a0 beaten 1
path -all the^way to your lilacs and a
think you could use your own lawn if
you want to make; a checkerboard on ,
the grass." \u0084- \u0084 .:
Dick halted midway, on the "forbid-
den.way and looked at its. undeviating : :"
course of barrenness, .with";* lnterest. V ..
"It does" look queer," :.'. he said.>;."l'm
awfully sorry- we": did it. When old,
Mrs. Tisdale lived here -she .didn't
give a rap about it. It .wasn't a, lawn
then. She just .hung up her ; wash ;
here and she kept chickens, too."
"Well,, we"; don't,"* retorted Kit most "
ungraciously." "Ever Â» since , we moved ;
here I've' been -trying' to coax a real
croquet lawn out of a wilderness of ' ;
chickweed and plantain. We only had
the hedge put in as a gentle hint to

"Yes,:i do,"? granted. Klt.>. "Because

and you don't- care. Y&u even Jump

Blaquiere stood beside Teresa in
the windowed chamber which had
been set apart for her, overlooking
the courtyard.
All in that Grecian port knew of her
love and the purpose that had upheld
her In her JoUrney. To the forlorn
town her wordless grief seemed â¢ a
tender Intimate token of a loss still

rounded her with an unvarying
thoughtfulness that; had fallen gently
across her anguish: She had glistened
to the muffled rumble of 'cannon "that
the wind brought across the marshes
from the stronghold of Patras, where
the Turks rejoiced. ' She had seen the

Springs quickened, summers sped
their hurrying, blooms, autumns huns
scarf et flags, in the' coppice, winters fell
and. mantled glebe and moor. Yet the
world did â¢ not forget.
There came an April day .when the
circumstance of a sudden shower set
down from an open carriage at the
-porch of Newstead Abbey, a slender
girl of seventeen, who had been visit
ing at near-by Annesley. y.
Waiting in the library the passing of
the rain, the visitor picked up a book
from the table. It was "Childe Har
old's Pilgrimage."
. For a time she read with tranquil in
terestâthen suddenly startled:
Is thy face like thy mother's, my fair child!
Ada! sole daughter of my hou3Â« and heart?
When last I saw thy young blue Â«yÂ«a they,

And then we partedâ not as no w we part.
But with a hope. . â¢ \u25a0
She looked for the name of its au
thor and paled. Thereafter she sat
with t parted lips and tremulous, lone
breathing. The master of the house
entered ; to t find an unknown guest
reading in a singular rapt absorption.
- Her youth and Interest beckoned his
. favorite topic. He had been one of the
strangers -who, year by year. in In
creasing, numbers, ' visited the little
town- of Hucknall â travelers who.
speaking the.. tongue in iwhich Georse
Gordon had written, trod the pave of
the quiet church with veneration. He
had purchased Newstead and had taken
delight in gathering about him in those
halls mementoes of the man whose
youth had been spent within them. â
While the girl listened with wide eyes
on his face, he told her of the life and
death of the man who had written the
book. He marveled while he . talked,
for it appeared that she had been
reared in utter ignorance of his writ
ings, did not know that he had lived
beneath that very roof, nor that he lay
buried in the church whose spire could
be seen from the mole. He ..waxed elo
quent as he told her how the gilded
rank and fashion of London had found
comfort "in silence â how Tom Moore,
long since become one of its complacent
satellites, had read its wishes well:
how ;he - had stood in a locked room
and given the smug seal of his appro
bation Awhile secret flame destroyed
the self -Justification of a dead man's
'name." the Memoirs which had been a
last bequest to a living daughter.
The shower passed, the sun came
out rejoicingâ still the master of - the
Abbey talked. When he had finished
he \u25a0 showed his listener a ' portrait,
painted by the American, Benjamin
West. When she turned *,; from this,
her face was oddly white; she was
thinking of another. portrait hidden by
a curtain, which had been;, one of .the
unsolved; mysteries of her childhood.
,* On her departure her host drove with
her ' to Hucknall Church,' and standing
in the " empty, chancel she read taa
marble , tablet set Into the wall : Tf
â¢In its course it passed a noble
country-seat, thef hermitage of a wom
an who had once burned an effigy be

Rooms. Lady Caroline Lamb, diseased
In mind as In body, discerned the pro
cession from the terrace. As the hearsÂ©
came opposite she saw the crest upon
the pall. She fainted and never again
left her bed.
The \u25a0 cortege . halted at Hucknall
Church, near Newstead' Abbey, and,
there the earthly part of George Gor
don was laid. Just' a year from the hour
he had bidden farewell to Teresa in the
Pisan garden, where now a lonely
woman garnered her deathless mem
ories.
At the close of the service, the two
friends who had shared that last
Journeyâ Dallas, now grown feeble, and
Hobhouse, recently knighted ajid risen
to political prominence â stood together
in the lantern-lighted porch.
- "What of the Westminster chapter?"
asked Dallas. "Will they, grant the
permission?". -\
A shadow crossed the other's coun
tenance. Popular feeling had under
gone a great â¢\u25a0 revulsion. : but clerical
enmity was outspoken and undying.
Heihought of a bitter philippic he had
heard- in the House of Lords from the
Bishop of London. His voice was re
sentful as he answered:
â¢.'The-dean has refused. The greatest
poet of the age . and country, is denied
even a- tablet on the- -wall of West
minster Abbey!"

"brows saddened. Dallas ' looked out

les of rooks.
"The greatest poet of his acre and
country!" he repeated slowly. "After
all/ we can be satisfied with that." \u25a0
The words fell faintly from the
wan lips," scarce a murmur in
the stlrless room. Gordon's form,
in Teresa's clasp, seemed sud
denly ...to grow chill. She did
not see , the illumination that trans
formed the friar's face, nor hear the
door open to- her. brother and Mavro
cordato. She was, deaf to all save
the moan of her stricken . love, blind
to all save that face that was slipping:
from life and her.
Gordon's hand fumbled In his breast
and drew; something ;forth" that/ fell
from his nerveless fingers . on" to the
The words seemed to stril > through
the delirium of the revered fantasies
and calm them. The dying man's eyes
fastened on the speaker with a vague
Inquiry. There was silence for a mo
ment, while outside the chamber a griz
zled servant knelt by a group of offi
cers, his seamed face wet with tears,
and from the courtyard rose the plaint
ive howl of a dog.
Through the deepening abyss of Gor
don's senses the crumbling memory
was groping for an old recollection that
stirred at the question. Out of the
maze grew sentences which a voice like
that had once said: "Every man bears
a. cross of despair to his Calvary. He
â¢who bore the heaviest saw beyond.
What did he cay?â " - -
The failing brain struggled to recall.
What did he say? He saw dimly the
emblem, which the friar's, hand held â
an emblem that had hung always
somewhere, somewhere In a fading
Paradise of his. It expanded, a . sad,
dark Calvary i against olive foliage
gray as the ashes of the Gethsemane
agony â the picture of the ternal suffer
lag of the Prince of Peace. I
"Not â my will, but thine."
The day was declining and the air
filled with shadows. The storm that
had hung In the sky had begun to mut
ter In rolling far-off thunder, and the
sun, near to setting, made a lurid flame
at the horizon-bars. Gordon stirred
and muttered, and at length opened his
eyes upon the red glare- He heard the
echoes of the clouds, like distant artil
lery.
With the energy of delirium he sat
up. He began to talk wildly, in a sin
gular jumble of languages: "Forward!
Forward! Courageâ strike for Greece!
It is victory!" /
The hallucination of weakness had
given him his supreme desire. He was
leading the assault on Lepanto.
"My son" â the friar's voice spoke â
"there are other victories than of war.
There Is that, of the agony and the
cross."

his weakness all else sank away beside
the thought that he had tried â and
failed. Even the one blow he mlcht
not strike. The nation was in straits,
the loan delayed, the campaign un
opened. He caught the murmurs of the
crowds in the courtyard. His lips
framed words: "My poor Greece! Who
shall lead you now?"
Yet he had done his best, given his
nil, even his love. Sh'c, Teresa, would
know and hold his effort dear because
she loved him. . But there was another
woman â in England â who had bated
and despised him. He had piled upon
her the mountain of his curse, and that
curse had been forgiveness. Must her
memory of him be always bitterness?
In the fraying fringe of life past re
sentments were worn pitifully small.
Should he go without one n tenderer
word to Annabel?
He tried to lift himself. "Fletcher!"
he said aloud.
The old valet, shaken with emotion,
came forward as the others turned
away.
"Listen, Fletcher. You will co back
to England. Go to my wife â you will
see Ada â tell my sisterâ say â "
His voice had become Indistinct and
the phrases ran together. Only frag
mentary words could be distinguished:
"Ada"â "my child" â "my sister" â
"Hobhouse." His speech flashed into
coherence at last as he ended: "Now
1 have told you all."
"My dear lord." sobbed the valet. "I
have not understood a word!"
Pitiful distress overspread Gordon's
features. "Xot understood?" he said
with ar. effort. "Then it is too late!"
He sank back. Fletcher, blind with
grief, left the room.
A subdued commotion rose unwonted
ly beneath the windows. Mavrocordato
spoke hurriedly to an orderly who had
Just come to the door. "Have they not
l>een told?" he whispered. "What is
the matter?"
Through the closing darkness Gor- j
dons ear caught a part of the low re- ,
ply. "What did he say?" he asked.
Mavrocordato approached the couch.
â¢"Some one\has come in a vessel brine- ,
ing a vast fortune for Greece."
The dimming eyes flared *up with '
joyful exultation. The cause was not
lost then. The armament could co on
âthe fleet be strengthened, the forces
held together till the loan cameâ till
another might take his place.
A sound of footsteps fell on the stair
âthere was a soft knock. The orderly's
voice demanded the password.
If there was reply, none of the watch
ers heard it- Gordon had lifted him
self on his elbow, his head turned with
a sudden, strange expectancy. "The
password?" he Â«aid distinctly.â "it is
here!" He laid his hand upon his
heart.
A sobbing cry answered and a wo
man crossed swiftly to the couch and
knelt beside it.
A great light came to Gordon's coun
tenance. "Teresa* he gasped. "Te
resa â my love!"
The effort had brought exhaustion.
He sank back, feeling his head pillowed
upon her breast. He smiled and closed
his eyes.
A friar had followed her into the
room. Mavrocordato beckoned the won
dering surgeons to the door. They pass
ed out. and young Gamba, after one
glance at his sister, followed. The friar
drew near the couch, crucifix in Hand,
his lips moving silently. The door
closed.
After the one cry which had voiced
that beloved name, Teresa had made no
sound. She cradled Gordon's head In
her arms, watching his face with a
fcarlul tenderness. From the court
came the hushed hum* of many people,
from the stair low murmur of voices; ,
behind her she heard Padre Somalian's*
breathed prayer. Her heart was bleed
ing with a bitter pain. Now and again
she touched the damp brow, like blue
veined marble, and warmed the cold
hands between her own as she had
done in that direful ride when her arms
had held that body, breeding from a
ki its.

reverently, for the treasure' it contain

his shop.
Elgnor Domenico,. a little stoop
shouldered Italian, who lived like a
beggar ; and had the manners ot a
prince. Is remembered :by â¢ the resi
dents of Little Italy as 11 hermito.
He lived nuite alone, making a busi
ness and a pastime of polishing his
brasses. The curios were scarcely suf
ficient in number to give his shop its
title â but, diavolo, they were rare!
They were treasures he had brought
from Italy In palmier days.
But Signor Domenico was not a
tradesman. He polished his brasses,
he dusted his books, he labeled his
wares; but' he made no sales.
He etood behind his counter, hands
outstretched; he claimed your atten
tion. Here he showed you a picture
of an old Italian tower, in which a
cleverly contrived clock of Swiss work
manship tolled out the hour in chime
like tones; there he showed a silver
candelabrum with a monarch's crest;
from a drawer he drew forty-six small.
daggers, and proceeded to give the
history of each. -' â¢.
Tne prices? He will tell them; but
he will not sell. He shakes his head
tat each entreaty. "It is sold now." he
will say, or "I buy this myself for my

A stranger does not stare at the
mention of a woman about the place,
but a neighbor taps his head, and ex
plains later...:.
"His \u25a0 wife, Juliaâ eh* Is notâ she
never was."
Back of the shop Is a small room
furnished with table and chairs. It

pensed wine â rare stuff of his own

that he regaled the stranger who had

But the 6tranger. were he wise, had

"I drink to your fame, Signor Domen
ico. You will play for me, perhaps?"
It was then that Signor Domenico

ere about the windows and the floor
of the little shop Is thick with dust.
An air of desolation overhangs the
place. It has been vacant only a
month, but already the rats play
hide-and-seek in the tiny wine cellar
beneath the steps.
Above the shop Is a room musty
from lack of air. A bed of rough
wood occupies one corner; in the win
dow space an upturned box serves as a
table and on it rests a vase in which
spiders have made a nest. Scrape
away a bit of the dust; the vase Is
of cut glass, exquisite in design. It
contains the remnants of a withered
rose, placed there a silent tribute to
a pictured face. The picture Is tacked
above the vase. It is an old-fashioned
miniature painted by a master hand.
It is the face of a woman, whose
beauty held a court spellbound half a
century ago.

FABLES FOR THE FOOLISH
THIS greatest truths of life are
mere platitudes until we come
face to face with them In our very
own personal experience.
I have known ever eince I first
sat on a pew cushion in a spirit of awe
and my starched and crackling Sunday
btst that "the way or the transgressor
Is hard," but It was an abstract truth
to me until I met Tax Collector
Smith on Monday afternoon, some fif
teen hours^ after the prison door had
closed upon him.
Now â now that I have seen himâ
the simple words of that direct, un
qualified, unmitigated Biblical state
ment have taken on the vividness of a
writing In flre across a midnight skj*.
What Tax Collector Edward J. Smith
was like in bis halcyon days I know
not, but what he is like now, on this/
Cay of his shameful homecoming, is not
a good nor a pleasurable thing to see.
Ho was In the bands of the prison
barber when I sent in my name, and
he had said "No!" to every same re
quest of my fraternity all day long,
petulantly determined, I was told, that
he would talk to no one from the news
papers. But he is a man of strange
tnd wayward impulse, and the word
came back, "Yes, he will see you If
you will wait uni.il he is through with
the barber."
But it should not be in a cell. , nor in
the outer lobby, where the ordinary
prisoners come to meet their friends or
attorneys or callers on the wooden
benches. Externals, it seems, mean
much to Mr. Smith, and so we met In
the captain's office, in which, if you
keep your back to the windows, you
can make believe you are in an ordi
nary office room on an ordinary errand.
Mr. Smith, fresh-groomed, neat, fleck
3 ess of dust, in a somewhat jaunty suit
of blue, with a faint chalk line in it
and a breast pocket that buttons â a
*uit that spoke in mocking echo of the
debonair spirit of gayety departed, not
your ordinary, sober, tailor-made of the
business world â sat drooping in a chair
awaiting me, his hands together be
tween his knees, his arms limp and list
loss, his head down, a picture of brood
ing melancholy.
He turned his head a little and raised
the heavy lids of his large, prominent
eyes, and with the mechanical courtesy
of habit, rose and extended his hand, a
soft, small, plump, well-kept hand,
feverishly hot â the hand typical of
luxurious self-indulgence.
Before me I saw standing a man
broken, bereft, ashamed, stripped of his
honor and his pride â and yet at bay.
Like a light within, the suffering
spirit shone through.
Perhaps events and emotions had
crowded upon him too fast In the past
few hours and he had not had time nor
strength to recover his mask.
The mere physical evidence of suffering
was shocking. He looked , shrunken,
j
cowering, and he has been, I should haz
ard, rather a handsome man of the boule
vardier type.
His appearance in the captain's offlce_
of the City Prison spoke of a change
sharp Â°and sudden.
In his face it seemed as though the
substance bad been drained * from be
neath the skin to ma-e that sagging
contour. His neck withered away- from
his collar like that of a convalescent
who after long sickness comes back to.
his outdoor garb; his dark bair lay weak
and lifeless and clinging above the pallid,
drawn brow. I wondered if his clean
shaven cheeks could possibly have looked
more haggard when they were stubble
bearded. His mouthâ the loose, weak,
grcES mouth of unrestraint â was drawn
and to a certain degreo refined by grief
and bitterness. His heavy eyelids were
reddenedâ who may know except him-
eelf whether by scalding tears or long
night-vigils?â and in his eyes there was
a look of settled pain so poignant that It
froze the words on my tongue.
How could Iâ the question caught my
heartstrings like a detaining handâ how
could I proceed with my mission and
interview a fellow-being at such a pass?
For a passing moment it seemed like
vivisection, and I wavered toward re
treat.
But Mr. Smith was speaking In a
strained, pained voice that struggled for
composure and nonchalanceâ and I per
force must listen. So does custom and
convention bind us all by hand :jid foot.
"You are the only one from any news
paper, the only reporterâ writer," Mr.
Smith was saying, searching for the ap
propriate word,. "that I have censented to
tee, or that I have epoken to since that
day I left here. All the interviews that
have been printedâ that were sent out
from St. Louis areâ not Interviews. I
have nothing to say about my case. What
Is there to be said? There Is nothing to
be said that will make it betterâ or
worse."
After all, I reassured myself, he had
chosen to see me," and I wonder yet
whether that short half-hour in the cap
tain's office was harder for him or for me.
Even cick in body and In mind as he
\u25a0was, there was a certain manliness in his
attituder-nct a manliness of fine fiber and
high standard, but the harsrrT resentful
defiance of one who has done wrong and
will pay the penalty if he must, without
wnlning; who will offer no denial or de
fense; no palliation or excuse. \
It is not the martyr spirit of high im
molation. Far from 1L
It is merely the grim determination . to
â¢â¢take his medicine," If he must, "without
equeallng," and it is a mood that may
last even up to the great iron gate of
Ban Quentin,* or that may not, for -the
city's defaulting Tax Collector Is a man'
of strange, uncertain Impulses.- that
epnnp, v from strong currents in an un
disciplined nature..
It was not of the.Jacts in the caseâ the

to him, "the wife and children.""
"Yes," he said, \'it is the innocent who
suffer most."
There 13 Jack Chretienâ "Happy" Jack
Chretienâ save the mark!â the man
whose. warped principles were a byword,
whose name stands still a symbol of
jovial, impudent dishonor. No onÂ© at&
more freely or more openly of the for
bidden fruit of life: no man was more
ostentatiously and riotously a "good fel

price, too.
There is Peter McGladc. deputy in the
County Clerk's office, who resorted to
his facility with pen and ink to Increase
his income because he wanted, more- of
what he looked on as the good things
of life than his salary could supply. Ha
was a "good fellow." too. The loudest
laughing, the deepest drinking, the most
lavish-spending of good fellows.
He, too, is paying the priceâ there's
a monotonous repetition of the price in
cases like these. They all seem to como
to the same thins 1 .
There's Senator Bunkers, tooâ not a
very large frog in the puddle, to be sure,
yet still the pricÂ« he must pay Is a heavy
one..
They, allâ these "good fellows"â seem to
live the same story and come to the
same end. â¢ s

Smith, " worth the candle?"
He sat. with clasped hands and bowed

past, went on his bond, and he ran away,
forfeiting his bonds. Then he came back,
a private soldier In a volunteer regiment
under a false name, and hoped to pass
unobserved to the Philippines, but the
;' sharp eyes of a negro employe at his dis
covered him, and for tfce sake of the pal
try reward \u25a0 upon hl3 head deliv
ered him to justice.. There are
.-. many loopholes in - the law, some
made by ingenuity, some by forgetful
ness, and through one, of taese he slipped
and missed San Quentlri. He went to the
water front instead, to take up life again
in his loneliness and old age and poverty
and disgrace as a longshoreman.
\u0084 This, was the price that Welburn paidâ
and he was a rare good fellow, so those
who come out when the sun sinks low
and the electricity Cashes high will tell
you.
There was Dimmlck of the Mint. His
\modest, v - frugal, suburban life left nothing
to suspect ' until -another, a luxurious
phase, was uncovered. He. too, had been

discreeter wayâ and he is paying * the
usual price.

was caughVln the maelstrom of the mid

" the Government money, some $65,009,*.' and
he* lost ~ his) office (and bis liberty. His'
friends," misled by the clear' record of hi 3*
"At peace?" The pain In. hiseyes
deepened until ; their. look was' that of
a dumb .animal': in mortal ' agony.) He
wasn't talkint? foV'Cffect nowâ if ever
"But \u25a0 now,", I eald, "that you are
backâ -that the suspense is . over and

"A clear conscienceâ -the thing I
would like, to - have most of . all , In this

"What do >ou desire most, of sailâ

question with; my own thoughts on a
speedy 'trial/-. 'i prompt sentence, a
short term of punishmentâ the settling
of the, whole unhappy, affair as, soon
as possible. But my. question did not
touch that., answering, point -Jn his
mind. It. cut farther and ; deeper, â¢ and
he said: '\u25a0\u25a0 V . \u25a0 \u25a0]\u0084 '/
The flash of folly died out, and he sank
again into -the apathy of his graver
"And what." I went on, " would â¢ you
have done if you had not been caught
In St. Louis?"
"I would have come back here." â¢
"I would have gone homeâ first of *all."
"To your wife?"
"Yes, to my wife."
"Do you think, you. would have been
received with kindness?"
"Yes," and he ; turned his big eyes on
me, red-lidded, unseeing,-' dimmed with
tears, "Yes â I ..think â I- would." â¢,* *:;.
"And now. that you have come backâ "
"I. can't tell you what It has meant;
to meâ what I have gone throughâ to
come back. like thisâ to have my friends
(I'm surprised ' that ; there have - been so
many of I them) come to . me and shake
hands and say -How d'ye do, .Ed V and
try to act as If there '- was . nothing the
matter, to' treat me the same asâ Oh, I
don't want to talk about that." .
He flung out an impatient hand. ;
"But â your, wife?"
"Yes?" ' J
"You will. see her soon?"
"Yesâ l will.".
"Will she come here to-morrow?- I
tee .the afternoon papers say-|â ".
"Come HERE?"
Something of the violence of his
undisciplined nature broke loose.
. "Como here! \u25a0 Noâ not if I never.se*.
her ! Do â¢ you think I would \u25a0 let her see
me hereâ like this â in prison?".
"Butâ how elseâ "> â¢ â¢
"I haven't committed a murder* have
I? I have the right to- â " -.'')
"Why, '! yes â to bail, of course. I
hadn't thought of that." Nor Indeed
had I.
"Wfll," h* asked, with "a heavy sigh:
of reaction, "do you think I'd let her
come HERE to see meâ then?"
"And you will go home to her?"- .:
"Of course."- ' . . â¢ ..
"Yes; I'd read it in the morning paper
but I had made up my mind to - come
back before I knew that. I thought I
might as well come back . and pay the
penaltyâ and have It done with." r
"Because you couldn't get away?"
"Oh, I could have got away. I have no
doubt about that. But there was no
use â " v'Vi^'
"It seems hardly possible to me; you're
not an Inconspicuous man, nor one likely
to be overlookedâ"
There was a. quick flash of the eyes,
a quick, pleased, gratified flash. The old
Smith of the gay days, the flattered, vain,
debonair Smith, lived again for a brier,
momentâ the frivolous succeptible Smith
who spent his money with both hands for
the sake of adulation, for the sake of be
ing called a "good fellow."
I had not meant it. that way at all,
notâ heaven forefendâ ln flattery. I; had
only meant he seemed a man easily
marked, not easily forgotten, and so, like
ly to be traced to the uttermost ends of
the earth.
Perhaps in the desolation of â¢ his flight,
in the hapnting fear of that tapping fin
ger on his shoulder and' of .the words in
his ear, "Smith, I want you"â perhaps in
the futility of- flying from his own con
science he did yearn for home, he did
have sdme wild, half-formed desire to
hurry back and lay his head in '\u25a0\u25a0' his
wronged wife's lap and implore forgive
ness and comfort.. .
Who can tell? ' _â¢\u0084_'
In such wayward natures as his there
is always the dramatic instinct.
"Did you know that your wife was
sick?"
"Why?" lie looked at me "with that'
poignant pain in his eyes that had noth
ing to do with me norfwlrh my question,
only with his' own corroding thoughts.
"I was homesick. I wanted to come back.
Oh, I knew very well what would happen
when I got back; but I was \u25a0â¢homesick.
You see, I'd always been home to, dinner
and to lunchâ l was used to going- homeâ '
I missed my. friends and the people I
knewâ the /whole thing. You know how 1
felt, don't you? You've been homesick,
haven't you? I wanted to come home.*'.
It is ver>\ hard to understand men, to
unravel their motives. I wouldn't venture
an opinion on whether; he , was talking to
me for effect or merely talking to ' him
self. Smith, it seems to meals' a weak,
vain, fleshly man, willful without, being
will strong, to be easily beguiled by' flat-*
tery, to be lightly' swerved by the : deslra
or impulse of the moment. --. T."
"But," I asked him, "why 'did you buy
that ticket to return to California after
you had gone away?" " â¢ \u25a0 ..'
"I didn't make up my mind to leave
here," h*e told me, "until noon of the day
on which I went away. Until that time
1 still had hopes of making good, but at
last I saw t^at I couldn'tâ that I had to
get out.- It wds in a way a relief to, get
away then, for no one can know: what I
suffered going around shaking hands with
people who believed -I -was â what "I .was
net. That \ thing . hurt meâ the knowledge
of what I'd done. I was glad to get .away
from it. among strangers. It was a ter
rible strain." . : )'V:Y> ; ; .
dovetailed details of' his' wrongdoingâ
that he spoke to me. His attorney, Arch
ibald Barnard, had warned him not to "do
this. The subject was tabooed, and so far
as my interest in it goes 1 was satisfied.
There's the process of law to draw that
out in ita own good time. \u25a0 v
But of the struggle that went on in his
mindâ the 'warfare between the good and
the evil in the manâ he was willing to
speak.' jerkily, spasmodically, in invol
untary phrases like the ejaculations of
pain.

-friends chanced to be a little late. As
we reached the corner they were al
ready half .way across the street, and
Billy Wigg, < with: all the strength, of
terror,' was, striving to haul Solomon
John backward. / ' ,
"What's * the matter with Billy ?"
said : Harvey, for , from the sidewalk
we coulf^ not then see the cause of
his excitement. :
A second \u25a0 later the question was
answered as there : plunged into. view,
from behind a car the galloping horse
'of a derelict 'delivery: wagon/ .. â¢.
"Good heavens! Look at the old
man," I eried 1 , and in the same breath,/
"Look at the â¢ dog,'.'- gasped Harvey.
With one mighty \Jerk Billy Wigg'
had torn . the â¢ leash from his 1 master's
'hand. Bereft of his sole guidance in
the thunder and * rush, of traffic the
blind' man . stretched ; out** piteous
hands, warding the /death 'he could
not sea. .
"Where are .you, Billy? Billy,'\he
quavered, : "Come back to . me. , Billy
dog." . ,
For once: BUly/Wigrg, was deaf ;to his;
master's \u25a0 voice. , He was obeying a
. more imperious call, that unf athomed
nobility of dog-nature that responds i
so swiftly to; the ; summons." ; He, was
casting his own life in the balance ,to
save another's. . ; Straight/ . : at V. the f.
horse's throat he launched himself, a.:
\u25a0forlorn hqpe,' \lt was ; a very-bigj
horse, and Billy.' was -a very little , dog. I
The un.strike of the knee, caught- him '
full ?l he was . flung, whirling,* fell : aj- '
most under the wheels of a cab, rolled"
; into the 'gutter and . lay there/quiet.
The horse had swerved v a little, ' hot
quite enough". There was a scream
and the blind man /went /down, from ;
the. glancing, impact of the ' shoulder.
Harvey and I were beside him almost
as soon as the crosswalk ' policeman. 'â¢\u25a0
The three of : us carried him. to 'the
sidewalk.
, "No need to call an ambulance, offl- .
,cer," said Harvey.; "I'm a" physician
and the. man is /aj friend/of .; mine."
"Bedad, thin, the* dawg^ Is a f rind tof
mine,"., said the big/ fellow. "Couldn't;
ye take; him along, .'.too, /sir?" "-. '. S
"Well^rrathef,". said Harvey heartily. ;
"Where Is he?" 'He 'turned to look' for,
the dog." *
, Billy /Wigg came crawling toward us.
Never tell, me /that dogs /have no** souls.

IN all the trade of the city you
might not find such another quaint
business firm as Solomon John and
Billy Wigg. The senior partner
was a-sentle old giant; the junior
a brisk and shaggy little dog. It was
Solomon John's business to stand on a i
roaring corner and sell papers;' it was
Billy Wigg's business to take care of
him while he did it, for he was blind.
It was our buslness^ â Dr. Harvey's
and mme â to pay for our papers and
pass on, but we seldom strictly minded
It. Instead we would stop to talk to
Solomon John, to the detriment of
trade, and to be patronized by Billy
Wlgg, who was much puffed up with
etlf -importance, conceiving himself to
be principal owner of the earth and
Â«ole proprietor of Solomon John.' In,
the half of which he was correct.'
I wai very fond of Billy Wigg, de
spite his airs of superiority. Harvey
preferred old Solomon; but this was a
Beml-professlonal interest, for my med
ical friend had contracted the pamphlet
habit, which he Indulged before /sci
entific bodies made up of gentlemen
with weak eyes who knew more about
ophthalmology than can be found in
many fat tomes. Solomon 'John was a
remarkable case of something quite un
pronounceable, and Harvey used to
gaze into his ej-es with rapt intensity
vhUe Billy Wigg fidgeted and strug
gled against the temptation to gnaw
such portions of him as were within
reach; for Billy Wigg didn't.'under
stand, and what he didn't understand
he disapproved of on principle. ' In the
light of subsequent events I believe
Billy's uneasiness to have been an in
stance of animal prevision.
To see Billy Wigg conduct his master
across that millrace . of traffic that
swirled between curb and curb, as he
did every morning in time for business,
.vras an artistic pleasure. Something
nsore than a mere pilot was the dog;
rather the rudder to whose accurate
direction old Solomon responded with'
precise and prompt fidelity. A" tug of
the trouser leg from behind would
bring the ancient newsboy to a halt. A
gentle Jerk forward would start him
\u25a0aram, and in obedience to a Bteady
pnll to one side or the other he would
trustingly suffer himself to be con
ducted around a checked wagon or a
halted came car. All the time Billy
Wi^sr would keep up a running con
versation made up of admonition,
warning and encouragement
"Come on. now"â r in a series of
sharp yaps, . as they started Â« from - the
curb. ".'Push right ahead: Hold hard.
KU.rry, I said. Will you do^ as \u25a0 I tell
yon ?" Then," to a too-pressing- cabby,
tn an angry, bark,' "What's; the matter
with you, anyway?.. Trying to "run
folks down ? Hey ? Well"â-apolo
getically. . In response to fa';< jerk on his^
stringâ -"these fool drivers do. stir me

Billy -Wigg ; seemed pleased because
Harvey kicked me. No doubt he. would
have been equally pleased if I had
kicked Harvey. But it happened to be
I who laughed. Harvey covered it up
by soberly telling Solomon John that the
sign was sure to be a grand success.
. * It was | a grand : success; ' quite stu
pendous, in fact. \u25a0 Old, Sol , did a busi
ness on the strength of ; it that would
have made his eyes pop out Jf he hadn't
kept them tight shut out of to
Billy's prejudices.' Reporters found his
simplicity and naive honesty a mine
of "good stuff." and, the picture of the
firm was in all the papers. . Billy Wigg
began to" suffer from a swelled head;
became haughty, not to say snobbish.
But, the fierce. light of publicity ; wore
upon the simple soul of Solomon John.
He discarded the extraordinary placard
and was , glad when he faded away
from fame. ' Billy wasn't. . He liked
notoriety as well as authority. *
Billy continued to exercise his au
thority. Perhaps tyranny would be
nearer, th)e mark. But even so meek a
soul as that of Solomon John has limits
of endurance beyond which it is not
well to press. Only the other day it
was that' the old man said to Harvey,
while Billy " Wlgg was otherwise en
gaged :Â§^@BÂ§pSfe
"I'd been thinking of a bit of a sign,"
proceeded Solomon John. "A friend of
mine printed it for me. but the idea's
my own."
After some fumbling under his coat
he produced a placard artfully designed
in large and flourishing letters. This
was the order. of it:
_ I Am NOT Blind, but the
* Dog Thinks I Am.
put on the old shade, that I hadn't ever
thought to use a gain, thanks to you.
sir. and tap- tapped across the floor to
Billy Wigg. 'Come on, Billy/ says 1: 1
wast you to take me out for a walk.*
Billy jumped ur> with a kind of choky
; bark, and * I hugged Billy and Billy
hugged me, and â we've" been , doing
business on the corner ever since."
There was a long pause. Harvey**
expression was queer. I felt a little
queer myself. It was a queer story,
you know. Finally I asked the old man
If business was good. Not that I par
ticularly yearned to know, but Vit
seemed to be time t* say something.
"Nicely, sir, thank - you," said Solo
mon John. "But I want to ask you. Is
it a dishonesty, think you, for me to be
wearing my shade like a blind man.
and me able to see a flea on the end of
Billy Wigg's tail the length of the block
away? The Lord's been mighty good
to me, sir â you * and the Lordâ giving
me back my sight." said Solomon John
simply, turning to Harvey, "and I
wouldn't want to do anything * that
wasn't just square."
"I wouldn't let it weigh on my mind,**
said Harvey.

amuse' a '\u25a0; few , 'people.; who. .had'r been'
mysteriously over;thevtele

proved to tbe ; of . the -very \u25a0 Jolllest -and
the. ; good-natured ;man\ of .figures Vsaid
as he : . bade ,- hi3 ; unexpected | guests
cooped in some country, house, but to:
the gala weeks with their almost hour
ly succession of crazy diversions which -
are so popular,: in: many;' of the Jolllest ',
homes.lh England, India and; the East V
America is a delightful place in which
to entertain, for the simple reason that ;
Americans are . so | partial to any j form v >: |
of humorous diversipn.^ In- no "country;
is. there so general ah > appreciation of '
the "josh." From the; richest to -the ,
pooregt; all enter into a.', good natured '
spirit of jollity. ;;.:'?.;\u25a0: '
In a less mercuriar country, many of-;
the best of the "joshes" one hears; of
would be fiercely resented by the peo- '
pleupon" whom they 'were played, but J
this - happy knack of entering: Into, aH>i,
kinds of ' queer*; and-, harmless /-jokes jjf
makes America a paradise for the i orfg- "\u25a0
inal entertainer. ; - \i ; V ';'*
It is an easy thing to secure a repu
tation for originalityâ and as easy to
lose it Again, to quote {Londonâ so
conveniently ; remoteâ there is there a
lady with, a' magnificent" mansion, who
was the first to buy a phonograph. \u25a0 She
got it into her head, and, I believe still
has it there, that the art of entertain
ing consisted of turning on this; old
sound 'disorder for an hour or so, and
then sumptuously feeding her friends.
The joke of her set, when her cards aro
out, isâ ,
Not even the feed in the latter half
Can makÂ« up for the darned old phonograph.
Some things, of course, never ; lose
their charm as means of entertainment
âsimply because they yield to so many
varieties of presentation. .There is mu
sic, dancing and fortune Jellingâ the
latter as entertaining to the unbeliever
as to the most confirmed follower of its
psychic charms.
In fact, fortune telling, particularly
by some novel method, is especially ac
ceptable in such a cosmopolitan cky as
San Francisco. One is struck .with the
let's-hear-what-he-has-to-say : air that
pervades all branches of society when
a fortune Heller appears. .
This city is like Paris, where a person
who has not looked into some form of
the mysticâ either' with 'the' purpose of
disproving or accrediting: the- sameâ is
considered "weird." In Paris and many
of the leading pleasure-loving centers
most, hostesses are themselves clever
amateur psychics.
But to return to the subject of music,
although, the remarkable attendances
at the grand opera shows that there is
quite a percentage of real music lov
ers in this city, there is a tragic .Or-*,
pheum worship which is unaccountably
general, and the few really good con
certs which for some \u25a0 reason do not
receive society's sanction are usually
presented to very sparse audiences. One
misses the fortnightly performances by
the strong amateur Philharmonic and
other musical societies which abound
in every other city of equal importance
and culture m the world. As a matter
of fact, In the months I have spent In
this up-to-date town, I do not recollect
having heard the word oratorio uttered.
There are so many excellent musicians
in this city that hostesses could give
regular musical feasts at their "at
homes." ,
Again, 'considering the number of
brilliant functions given, dancing" is
also almost unknown. At various times
I have been professionally in touch'
with social matters in nearly all the
English speaking countries of the
world, but I cannot recall a; season tin
which there have beÂ«h so few dancesâ '
that is for the. number. of other,func
tions given â as the one'almost- over in
San Franciscp. *
I. am informed, however, that most of
; .--r-- \u25a0 w ;.;\u25a0\u25a0..> â¢.-:...\u25a0.:\u25a0.- \u25a0\u25a0*\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 .- ;
Jl YOVELTT. novelti'. novelty Is
/\ I the cry of those who move daily
I yin the gay whirl of society. Not
VÂ» only in San Francisco, but all
the world over, from the wilds of
Australia to the smartest set in New
York, there is the same call for variety
of entertainment
It is manifestly not possible, with
the number of entertainments given
by any one set in a season, to arrange
absolutely unique affairs on each oc
casion, therefore the chief art of en
tertaining Is to vary the popular forms
of amusement in some way in order at
least to give the semblance of novelty.
The slightest change is. often sufficient
to eatslfy the most blase.
The art of entertaining Is taken
qdte seriously by the most successful
hostesses in London, and a ' regular
school, which many of them attend for
a eotxrse In. the subject Is flourishing.
Every branch of the subject Is care
fully considered and taught and the
students receive a number of notes, of
entertainments which may
be used twenty years later.
What can be more monotonous to
the Intellectual woman whose life sur
rounds her with a large circle of
acquaintances than such a constant
reiteration of card parties as has been
the custom of late? Day after day
from 2 to 6. a couple of hundred
ladles crowd Into a small room, slav
ishly checking tricks, while the ideal
California sunshine is gleaming invit
ingly without
"I have been to twenty-two card
parties this month and I hate cards."
eaid a pretty matron the other after
noon. "I hate to be obliged to con
centrate all my poor faculties on the
tiresome game because my highly
strung:, angry partner is anxious, by
hook or by crook, to become possessed
of the celery dish. You may wonder
why I go. Well, you , : see all those
ladies came to my affairs and I had to
accept their return courtesies in what
ever form they came."
Of course this criticism may be said
to apply more to card parties than to
any oiher form of entertainment for
at musicales, dances and such affairs
the guest is not chained for hours to
the one unvarying pastime and is free
to wander among his friends and to
go home when he pleases.
With regard fo social novelties San
Francisco ,is singrularly progressive,
because fortunately many of her lead
ers insist on novelty in entertaining
every gathering under their roof.
There is one lady in this city who
expresses very neatly her ideas of the
duties of the hostess.
"I consider." ehe says, "that any
function at my house has been a dead
failure unless I have for at least, a
moment caught a glimpse of the white
in my sruests* eyes. I love to see the
flush of pleasure and to hear the gen
uine expression of 'Oh, what a lovely
surprise! Where did you get it dear?'
ICow the reason I never give dinners
Is that young people really hate them.
They dislike the long drawn heavy
meals, with often a chilly neighbor â
and one never knows how one's
friends are going to take each other
â and they find after the usual re
mrak of 'Aren't the decorations sweet?
Mrs. Blank is a charming hostess.
Isn't she?' and 'Did you see "Parsi
fal ?" ' thinking up conversation is as
painful as replying. to the queries at
a scriptural examination. You know
my husband allows me to keep a fair
ly full larder and I don't see the force
of eating every night in somebody
else's house when my own things are
spoiling on the fire. Another thing 1 ,
it is positively impossible to vary a
dinner, unless one serves the soup in
the finger bowls."
Although these remarks may not be
strictly true, there is doubtless much
truth in them. For what of the freak
and zoological dinners and the many
amusing diversions which the modern
hostess of a versatile turn of mind in
troduces between the courses of the
dinner?
I know one lady who has a collec
tion of wonderfully trained white
mice which do a remarkable circus
like performance half way through
her dinners.

gERKELEr is sitting up in high
glee and enthusiastically shak
ing hands with herself. In fact,
she is doing more than that, for
she is proclaiming at the tip top
of her lungs that Berkeley beautiful is
Indeed to be Berkeley beautiful. That
is, of course, if money, energy, brains
and skill can make her so.
Somewhere back in the .vicinity 'of
1896 the board of regents of the Uni
versity of California got a bee in their
bonnets that their dignity and the dig
nity of the college demanded perma
nent buildings and extensive grounds.
Other great seats' of learning were so
equipped and, pray tell, why not Berke
ley?
Once the idea had taken root it
grew and flourished and, expanded at
an alarming rate until their peace of
asked to record his conception 'of an
s Ideal home 'for a university, 'assuming
time and resources to be* unlimited- He
Is to plan for centuries to come. There
\u25a0will doubtless be developments
of, science in the future that will im
pose new duties on the university and
require alterations in the detailed ar
rangement of its buildings, but It is
believed to be possible/ to secure a
comprehensive plan so in harmony with
the universal principles of architect
ural art that there wili.be no more ne
*ccssity of remodeling its' broad-out
lines a thousand years hence than there
would"' be of remodeling the Parthenon
had it come down to us complete. and
uninjured.
"In the great works of antiquity the
designer came first and it was the busi
ness of the financier to 'find the money
-to carry out his plans. In the new
building scheme of the University of
California it is the intention to restore
the artist and the art idea. to their old
pre-eminence.' The architect will sim
ply design; . others must provide the
cost." ",.. ,
Such was the first circular and it was
. sent out as a bait to lure the wily com
petitor oh. v In" addition ,tcVthi3 It was
understood that the object of the' strug
gle was not all glory and . that a snug
. little check of $10,000 would incidentally
change from . one pocketbook to an
other. -
The second circular was issued at the
end of '97. and it provided for a double
competition, the first to be decided at
. Antwerp, Belgium, and the second and
final at home in San Francisco. Tho
Jury, by the way, waa to be lnterna
. tional.
The outcome of this circular was an
avalanche of plans, but by a process of
successive eliminations the jury finally
awarded prizes to eleven authors who
were entitled to admission to the final
competition. n^jj
. Even . then -the regents and those
. most interested In the university were
not satisfied. They wanted , the best
the* world had to offer and they were
willing to go to any lengths to get it.
So instead of . waiting for the â¢ final
plans and accepting the one that near
, est 'filled the requirements, they In
vited all prize-winners to pack up, bag
â¢ and baggage, and visit the site of the
university in order that they might
' study the problem on the ground. And
this all free of expense, mind you.
Needless to say, the Invitations were
accepted, and in this way the object
of the competition was finally attained.
Monsieur Benard, a Franch architect,
was awarded "first prize, and It is his
artistic and appropriate conception that '
.is now keening Galen Howard, â¢ home
. architectof the university, more than
busy.
. So is It any wonder that Berkeley is
feeling mighty proud of herself ? All
that has been said and done In past
years has been more like a myth, than
anything else, but now she sees \u25a0 with
her very own : eyes plan after plan
signed and ssnt away, and she knows
at last that her day of triumph has
come.,.- ,

a deprecatory wave of his hand,
"butâ"
"All the latest popular novels!
Last chance, to get your reading.mat

Amy Curtis' ear \u25a0 and she lost all the
ycung man said except the words .
"can't climb those beastly steps."
Not that she cared!' She was quite
able to climb the little ladder v to*. the
upper berth. Her lip curled scorn
fully.
"Oh, it doesn't matter in the least,
you know. It was the .conductor's

himself down the sleeper to the Smok
ing compartment.. "Well, I do 'think \u25a0
ehe's a bit harsh!" He pulled; out a
paper and tried to forget the scorn in
the eyes but . recently lifted <to meet
his.
In the meantime the girl in section

/^r INCE dawn the Clouds ha.d been
gathering, and it was still early
t^J when there set in an, all day's
4~ rain. Man and beast turned to
ward shelter, and the muffled bird sat
on the limb close against the protect
ing body of the tree. Along the road
the traveler had no need to urge his*
\u25a0willing horse, for onward the animal
splashed, eager to reach a dry place
protected from the surly clouds, where
with eyes shut he might stand to
dream. It was on a Saturday. Toward
this day of promise, of happiness, in
the free woods along the creek, the
children had fondly looked; but now
bright hope had been drenched with
water and bedraggled. The door of
the old log schoolhouse had never
known a lock. The leather latchstring
hung without, jewel-tipped with a drop
of water. Within the hated books lay
scattered about, things of loathing now
but in years to come, in the drizzling
days of murky age, to be looked back
upon as angel wings that sweetly
fanned the perfumed hours away.
"With finger dipped in ink a grammar
hating boy had written on the^wall
his name, destined perhar>s in future
years to give authority to many a doc-*
ument of state.'
Several men coming from different
directions approached the house, hast
ening to get under cover; and soon
within there were gathered old Limuel
and some of his friends. - v";^
"About as motet a day as I've seen
in some time," said he, spreading his
dripping -shawl on the back of a bench.
"And it's groin* to interfere with
spring plowin'," Brizintime replied, sit
ting down with a sigh.
"That sigh, Briz, comes from the fact
that you ain't a doin' of the plowin'
yourself," said Lim. â¢ .
"Why, what difference . does that
make, Lim?*'
"A good deal, I tell you. The man
that does the plowin' risn't likely to
ci gh over the fact that rain drives him
to the house for a few hours* rest."
"I'm not that lazy," Briz replied.
"Oh, no; youain't lazy at all; but
lots of men that are not lazy are willin*
enough to see it rain when we - don't
particularly need the.: moisture, if ' it:
gives them an opportunity to sit down.
Now the only real enjoyment that * a
person has in this life is in thinkin'.
Pleasure is in the mind, you know, and
the rain there comes ' a" certain ;
ntmospherir condition that somehow
fetchew a man closer up to his* mind."
Thought is more creative on' a.-: rainy,'
day. Great poetry don't come -out { off
the sunshine, but out of -the mist and
the riiin." " . ." -;
"Well, I don't' know about *, that,"
sspcike uo- a fellow named Talbert.
'"There was Jim Horn Pike, - that lived
down in m.v neighborhood. "^HeT : set

might have outlived the use of his

as she was in the habit of doing; but
there was at least a glimmer of good
sense in what she said. If it is true

are 40 or 60 or even SO.
Here comes a youth down the
street, hardly out of his teens. He is
faultlessly dressed, has the entree of
the best clubs and social â¢'circles, has
been abroad several times. You would
judge from a casual glance at him
that he was in the heyday of his
youth. But wait until you know him
better. You will find that the adjec
tive blase fits him exactly. He ; has
been surfeited with the sweets of life;
lie has dipped into. everything that is

much knowledge of the seamy side of

other. In that way they not only last
much lo'nger,_but' keep their shape bet
ter, especially if shoe trees are used/
when the shoes are "resting." .The
"trees" keep the -shoes from wrinkling
and also 'from the resultant small
cracks that eventually widen arid spoil
the shoe. ;It is the work of- but a
moment and no trouble at all to insert-;
the trees, and I consider it advisable,
both on account of 'the appearance and
the preservation of the shoe. . Shoe
trees are very inexpensive, and pay. for
themselves many times over in a short

'time tan shoes seem to "me to be the
prettiest color. One style that, ap
pears' to be :very popular just now is
called the '_' sJi PP e Â»* .shoe," or some
times the "walking pump." An illus
tration of it is glven-.here, as seen. in',
figure 1. This particular shoe :is so
, much the fashion at^present that it is
made in, all colors/and in'; all kinds/of
â¢ kid. It can be worrifwith/ a flat bow,
with a bow made of inch-wide; gros
grain* ribbon; and <tled : :ln ! the usual
manner. For a large'fbbt the flat bow.
Is somewhat trying, -because it -seems
to accentuate the. length of the foot,
i while the tied bow has the opposite
â¢ effect. This pump can 'be" fashioned ~
in many! way?, although this yeart|je/

IT would be useless to try to give
any hints about shoes for woman's
wear without at the same time dis
cussing the stockings that go with
them. In fact, the stockings are
certainly more important than the
shoes. It has always been said of men
that if their hat and shoes were good
the rest of their attire did not sp much
matter, and the same is true, at least .
as to the shoes, with women. An'ill
fitting, badly shaped, slovenly or dam
aged shoe cannot be tolerated on any
woman's foot. But nowadays - Dame
Fashion goes much farther than that.
She assumes, as a basic fact, that the
shoes must fit properly and be in good
condition, but after that she orders
certain kinds of shoes for different oc
casions and suggests colors as well as
styles in accordance with certain har
monies which are now considered to be
established. It was not so very many
years aso that one did not have to
consider the shoes in their relation
to the costume, but now shoes and
etockings have to be reckoned as an
essential element in one's attire. All
of which serves to emphasize the fact
â¢which I have already repeated many
times, that at present all things must
match in order to make up a "harmo
nious apparel." With a blue dress, for
example, there must be blue shoes and
pretty blue stockings. And there' are
chocs to be had of all the colors' in the
spectrum, even for street wear. The
stockings arc, of course, capable /of
modification, that is, the .color being
cc/rrectly adapted to the costuriie, they
may be figured or ornamented with
other colors. Â»
A very pretty combination Is a suit
of zolden brown and undressed kid
shoes of the same color, with stock-,
ings that match, but relieved by dots
of dark blu4 Â«or ' orange. A very
Jarge bill for shoes is" certainly not to.
be desired, but economy is possible in
this direction by adopting the general
color that seems most -becoming " fo.
both walking or street. dress and for
calling dress. In that way the shoes
and stockings v.-ill serve,, for either
suit. Ar.d on the other hand, it is
great economy, at least after the first
outlay, to be provided with a good
many pairs of shoes, to be worn at dif
ferent times, and alternately with each

fcpnsidered;|.the : half-shoe or tie seems

These? shoes' are made, in two styles,
lace -and. button. There is also, a very
goodjsty le "called , the button ) tie, which
can* be seen In the illustration, figure 3.
ItVis usually made .Xof; soft "black
leather, cut eff at. the; ankle and but
toned with-good-sized- shoe buttons,, and â¢

sole '; Is .a : little extended" "and .' of me

dressy "â¢ tie, which is ':. made ? qf soft kid,
bronze or patent leather, has no ex
tfnsion-so-le, and is laced up with a
wjdegros grain ribbon. Figure 5 il
lustrates a > shoe that will be of im
pcirtance to the summer girl... It is
made of white canvas and should be
only with linen or duck skirts.
The canvas shoes are ; no doubt: satis
ft)ctory. y because, they can" be easily
cleaned, but the kid pump, ' which is
vi;.ry much in vogue in New York, is
tKe daintier.; . High boots are. of course^
riijt 'much" worn". in summer, but if ;they
ai'e preferred, buttoned boots are more
stVlishj than ; laced . boots, and the high
military^ heel and the pointed toe form
the proper style. Alow shoe is, how
ever, much prettier,, and. it -.-, is - also
cooler, and then there is the" chance
to display the pretty and appropriatt
stockings.
,;In evening slippers fascinating ef
fects can be produced, vlt seems.to nte
that it would have been a gbod subject
for ' Lady Duff Gordon to interest her
self in, .if indeed she has not* already
done so. With emotional gowns' there
surely ought to be' coquettish' or
"twinkling" slippers. They, should be
not only but piquant and
suggestive.
It is in the evening slippers ; that the
French excel.,-, although' the French
shoes do not ofiensult us. "And there
are many people who will hot "wear any
slippers but those of French^ manufac
ture. The strap beaded slipper shown
in the illustration marked Figure, 10
gives unmistakable evidence . of. beini
of: French make. ; Nowhere* but in
France would .a slipper be made but
toned up like a boot, but at the same
time* so open as to display all the
beauty of a smart stocking. This slip
per is made in *' soft shiny black or
bronze kid, and should be worn only
with a light colored fancy stocking.
The. bronze slippers are particularly
pretty, as the bronze beading,is bright
and attractive. The; illustration mark
ed Figure' ll shows a very. good' style
of low slipper in black beaded kid. It
can be worn -with' a ribbon bow or not.
as, desired. It is also made with;, a
cross strap that goes over the .-instep
and buttons at the back on the' top .of.
the slipper. - Another style of slipper,
which is very>attractive, - is shown in
the illustration marked Figure 12,'
called the "Florodora" slipper. It â¢' is
made in . black, white or red satin and
has the merit of the foot look
very short, which -is accomplished ;^by
the i combination of a very high heel
and a very short vamp.' Occasionally
small tulle, pompons are pufqh these
slippers, ; producing a somewhat , moije
dressy effect, besides apparently'dim
inishing .the \i breadth of the "foot; ; '
1 The colonial slipper, is not much Worn
this *year. . Indeed it seems r. to have
gone out of date entirely, except those
made in black or tan suede. These arÂ»
not only pretty and becoming, but they
are exceedingly easy and comfortable.
They may. be worn on the street in the
afternoon for calling or to teas.
To . keep slippers in good condition,
the shoe-trees should be kept in them,
and they should be wrapped in soft
flannel. Patent leather sho*s or slip
pers can be kept from cracking by be
ing wrapped In flannel and protected
from the air. . HM
STOCKINGS.
This is not only an important subject,
but is one of such wide range, both
as to style, taste and cost, that U Is a
little difficult to deal with it satisfac
torily. .When one considers the differ
ent materials of which stockings are
made.- woolen, cotton, thread and silk.
arid ;the wlde^difference In their cost,
from, fifty cents to twenty dollars a
.pair, the difficulty can be appreciated.
Then again, there are tr-s different
-styles, heavy, light, open-work, em
broidered, plain, fancy : antV art stock
ings. To those who prefer, silk stock
ings : and can ' afford them,; I can only
say, that Paris Is the place'lo buy them
âboth for their, variety anÂ£ price. My
recollection Is that in Paris:! could buy
: heavy, silk* and embroidered stockings
for nine francs a pairâ or /a. little less
than. ; ,two . dollars. I I saw* there some
wonderful spangled stockings that
caught my '.\u25a0 fancy, but they price was
prohibitory. Still they werÂ«t so attrac
tive that -I .was unwilling tÂ«> give them
up altogether, and finally that
with /a, little "ingenuity I couldmanu
facture them myself. I- purchased a
pair of plain black silk ' stockings 'and
had a \u25a0'pattern marked on them. v and
sewed spangles on " the stamped
'pattern, and^the, result was Very; satis
factory.^. 1 .. saw in the Bon Maxche In
Paris ; a ;*pair of spangled . c tocklngs la
the design of a snake twisting '\u25a0 up the
leg. Itlsjieedless to say] that the effect
was, very~ : striking.
t T . a ? : shoes require tan-colored stock
ings," of /whatever kind the taste of the
wearer may dictate". Lisle "thread open
stockings are always pretty, and
the new ./'Lisle Met." although not very
durable, is now considered very attrac
tive. They are so thin that they re
semble gauze. ;You see these^ stock
ings in white, tan and black* colors.
They were much worn In the East last
summer in the hot 7 weather,. in spite of
the fact that it presents a somewhat
bare .-appearance. Stockings with
clocks, ithough old as time Itself/ are
always and pretty.* The silk

Through the influence of Mrs. Spender
Clay, the Countess of Suffolk has become
a stanch supporter of the Indigent Blind
School in London. The American Countess
was (surprised to discover that the in

. cially delighted- with the work of the
women, and ordered a large quantity of
embroidery for her ~wn use. She also
cave an order for many pairs of socks
and stockings, which, it is supposed, she
means to distribute among the poor in
the neighborhood of Maimesbury, the
Earl's seat in Wiltshire.
She also discovered: that a former pu
pU of the school was carrying on a small
brushmaking business in a village close to
Malratsbury, and she immediately gave
instruction to the head steward on the es
tate that everything in the way of
brushes the blind man was able to supply
should be obtained from him so long as
he was able to' compete in price with
tradesmen more favoraWy situated.
It is somewhat significant that at the
present time there are no less than eight
bouses to let in Park laneâ London's
famous millionaire rowâ and during the
coming season at least three others will
remain unoccupied. Residence in this
street is supposed to imply the possession
of great wealth. In the past not a- few
persons have lived t~ere just to acquire
. that reputation. But it has never . been
particularly favored by American pluto

LONDON, May 20.â Motoring is
steadily growing in popularity and gar
ase managers are busy answering in
quiries of American tourists, now here
or en route, for motor cars for use in
England. As a rule these cars are en
jrajred for a month or so and it has be
come a custom to order one by cable to
meet the incoming passenger at Liver
pool, Plymouth or Southampton. This
method is now more popular with
Americas visitors than the bringing of
their own cars over, with all', the'con
sequent bother. . v ; '
Some practical Americans have, dis
covered that they can save money by
buying a car outright in the early sum
mer and selling it at the end of the
season, the difference between the
price at -which they buy and the price
at which they sell â¢ being less than the
cost of hiring a car for the time in
volved. . '

"One thing is now demonstrated. Plays
from our countryâ l mean by that, real
playsâ are welcome in England. American
actors of individuality and distinctive

actors.
"I had then in view the production of
five American plays. I- have produced
two of themâ bftth - with great success,
though they are so widely different.
"The strong drama of Mr. McLellan
('Leah Kleschna'). with, ita< -human
touches, made its effect in London, just

'"The typical American character por

The result of his . experiment of bring

there are no waiters, so each goes to the
kitchen, where home cooked articles are
served to them on a salver according to
what each desires, and the one receiving
it takes the articles to one of the tables
and partakes of lunch, and when it la
over returns the salver and dishes to the
kitchen. In other words each member
is her own waiter. The lunch r hour is
passed quietly and those who have satis
fied the cravings of hunger retire to the
adjoining room, where they can pass the
time until it is necessary to return to the
store, office or counting room, in reading,
friendly chat, playing on the piano or
(singing, just as fancy moves the mdi T
vidual. In this way the members enjoy
a privacy denied them in other lunch
placf s from which after the noon day
meal they must walk the streets and en
gage in window shopping until it is time
to return to duty. The fees, comparative
ly small, maintain the organization in
good style. In addition to the officers of
$he dob one of the most active members,
one who is well known in the fraternal
world, is Mrs. G. A. Hubbell, . who has
devoted a great deal of time and energy
to building up the association.

The promoters of the. dub have from
the outset sought to encourage this spirit
of self help until now the club is self
governing and stands as a co-laborer
with other fraternities that are \u25a0tr*>c*,iT,g
the same lesson.
There are many fraternities in this city
that are operated for the benefit of the
members, but there axe but few thai are
doing more good than the association of
women that is known as the Business
Woman's Club of San Francisco, it is
an organization that helps women to help
themselves, by providing for those who
are engaged in office, store and counting
house, a place where at noon they find
a home where they can enjoy lunch with
the same privacy that they could in the
home. The club was organized hi No
vember, 1902, by business women who con
cluded that the time had come when the
class of women that makes up the mem
bership could have a retired p-ace in
which to have lunch and spend the re
mainder of the noon- hour. The dub got
rooms in the Academy of Sciences build
hig w and from a charter membership of
ten it has grown to one of more than one
hundred. The object of the club as laid
down in the manual of government is "to
demonstrate the advantages of co-opera
tive effort in organization and to fur
nish by mutual aid many of the comforts
and needs of the women in the business
world."

ECHOES FROM THE LODGE ROOM
E. C. STOCKLONDON, May 20.â A1l military records
have so 'far, been broken by the present
war. No general m history ever dreamed
of battles on the scale : of those which
have 'been - fought in - Manchuria during
the-past year. :M. de Eloch, -the famous
peace apostle, contemplated, the magni
tude cf : these operations only to use the
prospect as an â¢ argument against the
possibility:' of -.war. '\u25a0â¢ He. counted without
the infinite resources of .the human, mind.'
The !\u25a0 . stupendous " naval operations. "oÂ£
which '.we * are", now witnessing the dra
matic unfolding/-, are similar to the ; land
operations, : both*- in the ' unexampled scale
on which : they,afe being carried out, and
in the dementi ' they off er to all the horo
scopes of -the military seers. The im
possibility, of a fleet like; that of Admiral
.Rojestvenskyr being taken? from -the Bal
tic to the\China t seas in a condition fit
to ; meet -the \u25a0 Japanese has . been insisted
upon by scores of experts.
i> If this view . has ! lately been modified,
it'is* only 'because "the equally positive
opinion - has , taken its place that even If
tbe enterprise ; were , possible , it was so
fqredc<>med' to. failure that to attempt It
were- madness. ".On, both these points the
world ' has been J made , ;to . change *â¢ its
mmd. 'The enterprise is now seen to have

So," as this was absolutely the best he
would do, the estates .were bolstered up
with repairs and new cottages and a
dozen of other requirements and then
they, were carefully let. ' An American

actual charge of 'the properties, though
nominally the Duke's estate agent is sup
posed to be in charge. Some of the houses

Society would have none of Helena of
Cincinnati, and Helena In turn wanted
none of society. Her ambitions were the
true German ones of being a good houst
vlfe and a good mother. The maternal
part of her ambitions was soon fulfilled.
And later, when a son and heir appeared,
Consuelo secured Queen Alexandra for
godmotherd. .
.In the meantime Consuelo bad appealed
to Mr. Zimmerman when she got him
over here on a visit to his daughter. She
read tbe riot 'act to him, and finally put
the estates in front of him purely as a
business matter. Mr. Zimmerman found
that his son-in-law had 28,000 acres, three
castles, a country 'seat in Huntington
shire and ' a town house In Portman
square. He agreed to "invest" a little
money in this property for his daughter
and her son-He agreed to give, dollar
for dollar with Consuelo.
For a time all went -welL Society
is always glad to welcome Americans,
for they are classed as amusing and
possess both chic and dollars in abund
ance. But the Americans must really
have . money . to throw away and must
be' well Introduced.. Consuelo was in
despair. She gave dinner parties, lit
t!e dances and a ball;; she got up a
house party for the" shooting; at Tan
deragee'and had a great.. list of big;
people, including a royal highness, the
Duke of Connaught, but it was ho use.
Consuelo was very angry, and " half
out of downright spite she financed the
young couple to the extent of getting
both Tanderagee and Kimbolton castle
back â¢â¢ into ducal use. She . gave them
the use of her town house and flung
them at society in a way which only
a Duchess and une chere arnie de le
rol could posiWy do.
LONDON. May 20.--Society has been
gossiping considerably over the an
nouncement from Detroit that the
Duke of Manchester,may return to stay
in the United States and work up in
the railway business. The Duke, be
fore his marriage, was never in society,
and after winning Helena of Cincinnati
and the slowly produced Zimmerman
dollars, made rather a failure when in
troduced with his bride inside thÂ« sacred
portals.
His mother. Consuelo, Duchess of
Manchester, did a great deal for the
young people. Mr. Zimmerman, it ap
pears, allowed his daughter a Very ex
cellent sum of money for herself and
her clothes, but when it came to deal

KNOCKER OF FELLOW-ARTISTS BUSY AGAIN
The artists are at it againâ knocking. ,
knockir.jr, knocking! â¢
To be cure, the â¢'artistic temperament," i
that safe asylum for the vagaries\>f ere- j
ativc folk, permits much of criticism of ;
others, but how about the â¢ egotism and '
jealousy that defiles it? I)oes "artistic 1

minutive 6ouls?
For a time it seemed that a generous
spirit was spreading its benignant wings !
over the studios, but lo! let a stranger j
or two come among us,. or a wanderer j
stray home to his native heath, exhibit
his pictures and invite purchase. And I
then the fat's in" the fireâ the knortcer j
brigade gets busy and reveals to the. iri^ l
cipient purchaser just where the pictures '
are wrongâ all wrongâ according to his
preconceived and utterly infallible and in
<tiÂ£pctable notions. Such asnzmn tion of
specific authority is but a revelation -. of
a \u25a0"diminutive- mind .and an" ungenerous
soul, and wholly; unworthy the great
teachers of , the worldâ which worthy
artists are..
.Honest; and kindly ; criticism is another

to talk of his instrument and music- gen

It seemed almost comical to think of
the tiny fiddle resting on that huge
shoulder, shyiy whispering under those
massive hands. For Ysaye Is a great
man in every way. He stands by three

and displaces considerably more space
from all sides. The short, womanish

a polar bearâ with all respectâ that Ysaye
makes one thinkâ huge, massive and
royal. He is a royal kind of person al
together, dominates wherever, you place
him. You think of him in tbe royal
termâ perhaps it. was that that made me
begin:
"1 asaa. not going, to ask you what you
think, of Emperor William's musical qual

Some Pittsburg person had, and sab
eeqtuontly headlined the resultant story:
"Ysaye says German â¢ Emperor â â â

"2ZoT" and Ysaye smiled back. "Well,
It doesn't matter what I think of him
or what he thinks of me. But, of course,
I never said that."
"Does your own king care for
\u25a0music?" I asked.
"Ifo," Ysaye returned, "he told me
himself that he did not care for it.
\u25a0Cbaeira a son metier,' he . said, "you to
your, violin, me- to this.' The queen on
tbe contrary takes much interest. She
is always in the conservatoire and gen

"Do you think that it hits much effect

"Taste? No." Ysaye shrugged his
big shoulders, fit is g-ood for business,
for acknowledgroent. I doubt If it has
any effect on the people's taste. May

We know little about ; the condition Â©f
his'fleet, but it is certain that' lt could not
have done what it has done unless it were
well disciplined and unless ; it were com
manded by . a sailor of very exceptional
genius. If Admiral Rojestvensky can
fight as well as he can organize, then it Is
beyond . question ' that Admiral Togo* has
at last met his match. The question
whether ' the enterprise was worth "at
tempting: is really governed by its prac
ticability.
The possibility that thÂ« fleet may be de
stroyed, has nothing to do -with It. Fleets,
UXe armies, are made to fight. Â»â¢^ whUa
there Is a chanes of employing them sno-
cumstar.ces, necessary. It Is, Indeed, dif
ficulty to maintain any longer that" it was
a reckless adventure. , True, Admiral
Rojestvensky has been very materially
helped -by \ the singularly elastic concep
tion'of neutrahty. which prevails at the
Qual d'Orsay; but even when allowance
is j made for the advantages he has en
joyed in this respect it must be admitted
that fhe has accomplished a . great, in

But men are so queerâ they always want
to follow the lines of least resistance
when they're at home, and thus they de

Lowe writes that the best gun-fighters
in Mexico would not dare to travel alone
through the Indian country as he has
done, even if they were well armed. At
one point in his^ journey the Indians stole
his coat while he . was asleep, and |he
thereby lost valuable - papars. , Lowe .is
possessed with the idea that no harm
can come to him while he Is searching
for the golden treasure which lured him
to Mexico. He has. been resting for, the
last two weeks, and in; advices received
here states .that he will again take up
the hazardous- search for the mine which
he located in a clairvoyant dream. ; ;
Local backers, of Lowe raised funds
to-day to send to him so that he can.fur
ther pursue his search for. wealth.
' SELMA, May 20.â J.M. Lowe, a young
mining man/of this city,- who' subjected
himself :^o .'the hypnotic influence 'of :\u25a0\u25a0 &
local Svengali andjjthen ;werit to! Mexico
to discover a ' mine; revealed in a vision,'
has reached Culiacan,' capital of the state
of Sinaloa, â¢ footsore ! and | weary from* pri
vations â¢ enduring "in.- a' 6oo- mile -Journey
overland in v quest :of ; the ; gold of . his
dreams. For . \u25a0 several j the '\u25a0". young
man was a<.watiderer among the. hostile
Yaqui Indians, and his escape from death
or capture is ascribed. to his : daring/ and
fearlessness; -In his journey; ihlfc: the In
dian country . he carried jno weapons,' as
he believed that , such actlonjJwould be
more likely .to inspire the confidence ; of
the red men than 1 f he < was well ] arnied.' '\u25a0/_
A number^.of Indians surrounded "him
at one point, he ' writee, and \u25a0 he , was
warned to retrace his - steps from their
country. Lowe refused to turn back on
the trail and one big Indian was/dele
gated to ; dissuade him from; further per
sistence. The Indian attacked Lowe with
a- big bowie knife, asMf intending to fin
ish his' career right there, but the young
miner grabbed the Indian's arm' withjone
hand and' delivered a stunning blow with
{he. other. ' This convinced "the assembled
savages that they were dealing ' with a
"crazy" man,' and they took to their
heels, with , Lowe in .full chase. It is be
lieved that owing to Lowe's peculiarities
the Indians regarded hinv as demented,
and for this reason allowed him to pass
through the country with only slight mo
lestation.- -" : \u25a0 " -\u25a0 \u25a0
>Early ; in . the winter [ plans were ; drawn

The .plan-adopted calls for "an'expendi

MEXICO'S new financial plan, which recently went into effect,
is an experiment in paternalism and a novelty in Govern
ment regulation of money. The Government offers to re
ceive silver bars at its mints and to advance 90 per cent of their
value and to assume charge of the remittance of the bars and their
sale in London. In the final settlement with the depositors 2 1-2
per cent is taken by the Government in the form of a .stamp "tax;'
This practically puts the executive of Mexico in the position of; a
commission merchant for the people. In addition to giving the
mine owners this ready means of raising money it is intended by
the plan to provide facilities for the sale of bars on the best possible
terms, and to this end to make suitable contracts at home and
abroad.
Other parts of the financial plan are of great importance, but
are not so novel in their nature. To limit the multiplicity of silver
dollars and to reach a gold basis is one of the main objects in view.
The domestic volume is limited to ioo,ocx),ooo of new silver dol
lars, and their value is fixed at 50 cents in gold. Importations of
silver dollars of Mexican issue older than April last are prohibited/
Thus is transferred into merchandise all the silver of Mexico except
the new silver dollars, and these are strictly limited in- number to
what the Government can, by its gold reserve, keep up to the de
termined value of 50 cents. The plan is an excellent one to prevent
wide fluctuations in the "worth of what is* practically Mexico's only
money, silver dollars. There is no explanation given for the prefer
ence of shipping the silver bars for* sale in London instead of
ing them into dollars for use in the Far East. It is noticeable that
Mexico deliberately calculates that the fluctuations in the- price .of
bar silver will not exceed 10 per cent when she agrees to make;un
limited advances of 90 -per cent on all deposits.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
In many of the first-class restau
rants i the proprietors , make a special
point of serving hygienic luncheons.
They are ' prepared with a considera
tion of the digestive organs, and not
the palate. Things that are cooked
without the aid of fats, vegetable
roasts, strange-looking cereals and
fruit in every shape and form are set
forth. , Americans are accused of an
inordinate love of richl foods, but the
tide is turning, and the votaries of the
hygienic are growing in number.
The hygienic luncheon is the thing.
It used to be that the pretty society
girl or the tired-out shopper went to
the .restaurants to. order _ chocolate
eclairs and cherry sundaes; but now
there is a different . tale to teiL The
cult of the hygienic is flourishing. An
Interested spectator watched the. wom
en who came to a fashionable -lunch
place the other, day and counted seven
in fifteen minutes who ordered raw
eggs beaten up in glasses of milk. The
up-to-date girl takes her eggs and
milk' with - a few dry crackers and
needs no other nourishment.
HYGIENIC LUNCHEONS.
the solid parts are converted into "sludge" for fertilizing, and the
liquids are filtered arid disinfected until they may be safely dis
charged into the river without polluting it. :
It is scarcely less revolting to discharge sewage into the ocean
or its bays and estuaries. V The salt water disinfects it, but the
solid parts either gradually shoal the water or are carried : to the
beach by the- tide. Modern cities should do better than pollute
either streams or the ocean with their waste. There is no mystery
about the better way of disposing of it. True, it costs more money,
but it cannot be.s pent for a better' purpose.
The State Board of Health deserves praise and support in its
effort to stop" trie pollution of streams. The Governor, being a med
ical man himself, is naturally much interested in -this work, and if
he succeed in keeping all sewage out of California streams, his ad
ministration will be remembered to be blessed by; the people.
After the streams are saved, attention should be turned tothc
ocean and bays of California. \ : Out of these-come- our fish food. It
is known that typhoid fever, is caused by the sewage poison \u25a0 that ; is
eaten, especially with ''shell fish and /crustaceans.-' Public sanitation
requires that this source of food supply shall be made safe. :
California can set the pace for; other States in this matter. .We
are appalled by the tales of the filth that is foiind on the surface
in the large cities of Asia: But; after all, though its I presence .there
is offensive to the senses,,it is less; dangerous to man^ than the filth

It appears that the publication of
banns was habitual in many places
long before there was any general law
on the subject, since Greeorr IV
(119S-1216) speaks of the bannsTbeln
given out In church, according to cus"
torn. The practice was introduced Into
France about the ninth century, and
In 11 < 6 was enforced in the diocese of
Paris.
The earliest enactment of the sub
ject In England wa3 an order made In
the synod of Westminster in l*oO to
the effect that no marriage should be
celebrated till the banns had been pub
lished in the church on three several
Sundays or feast days. This rule was
made obligatory throughout the church

f~S EMARKABLE recoveries occur and
L>/ wonderful cures are sometimes ef
fected in ways unsuspected by med
ical science and its students. A Pittsburg
man standing high in steel and iron In
dustries has recently undergone a mar
velous â¢ cure for cancer. For some years
what physicians and surgeons pronounced
a cancerous growfh had been slowly but
surely eating away part of his right
cheek, close to : the nose. He had con
sulted eminent surgeons In this country
and Europe, he had visited innumerable
baths famous for the cure of blood dis
eases and at last had been given up to
die slowly but surely of the dread dis
"?ise. During a recent visit to New York
lie consulted a young but promising den
tist regarding a tooth wn:ch had _ been
bothering him. ; ; The troublesome haolar
was located In the lower Jaw and the
pain = was | soon stopped, -but * the young
dentist begged permission to examine his
new patient's mouth thoroughly : and was
especially Interested in ' ; the man's calm
resignation to death from cancer. At the
conclusion of the operation he offered
ay his diagnosis that the disease was not
cancer." but trouble with a molar in the
upper 'jaw. At 'first the Plttsburger was
inclined' to be , skeptical, but the dentist
urged that the loss of one molar was
small compared with ; the risk of other
operations â¢ through which he had passed,
and S llnally I the sufferer consented and
was- placed- under the influence of. ether.
The operation was far from simple, last
ing more .than an hour, but ,th<j result
justified the dentist's | predictions. With
the tooth came away a tiny blade of
steel which had been driven up Into the
jaw by a Â» careless : dentist years before.
It had festered and the pus had forced a
passage : out through . the cheek, giving
the - appearance of . a cancerous growth.
After ; weeks of treatment the cavity
healed up perfectly, and the ' Pittsbufger
ha 3 j decided that a cancerous I death is

r "pHE Supervisors will soon finish consideration of the budget for
I the coming year, will determine the just needs of the various
* departments of the city government, and will make the tax levy
to raise the aggregate sum' that is agreed upon as necessary to keep
the municipal government going.
All of the city departments are in the same position that they
occupied when the last levy was made, except one. They* need only
such support as enables them to respond to the growth of the city,
and as their needs, that growth and increase in assessable valua
tions go together, they present no emergencies and are suffering
no crisis. Their needs may be far less than their demands, or they
may only equal the sums asked for. But one department is excepted
from this condition. Its needs are great and its condition is emer
gent. This is the school department. It has to respond to increase
in population, and to the laws making school attendance compulsory.
It must see that equal facilities are put within reach of every child
of school age.
Increase in population makes its first demand upon the schools.
-The police and fire departments may not hear from an increased
population for a long time, but the schools hear of it at once in
the form of a demand for more school room, more teachers and gen
eral expansion of facilities. Hence it is that if no change occur in
the means of support of the schools and no revenue is withdrawn;
the needs of the schools are normally greater than, those of any
other department of government in a large and growing city. The
percentage of increase in the school appropriation should always
be greater,than for any other purpose, provided the city is growing
and its population is' becoming more dense. If that percentage
decline, then it is certain that the city is slowing up. If no increase
is required, then the city has stopped in its tracks and is standing
still. If the school appropriation decline, then it is sure either that
parsimony controls the department or that the city is stumbling
backward down hill.
The Supervisors had a right, then, to expect a large increase in
the school appropriation, and the people had a right to, expect that
it would be granted. But an emergency has occurred that intensifies
the situation. The Legislature by law changed the basis of distri
bution of the State school fund, so as to deprive the schools of this
city of a large sum of money annually. We believe that San Fran
cisco under this new law will pay more State school tax than it
receives in revenue for the maintenance of its schools. It is useless
now to discuss this law. It seemed to be taking something from
the large cities to give it to the country counties, and the tempta
tion proved too much perhaps for the sense of justice of the country
members. It has forced deplorable conditions upon the San Fran
cisco schools. The taxpayers must not "only pay their State school
tax. but must pay in addition enough to meet the normal expansion
of the city schools and enough to make good the amount of revenue
taken from the schools by this untimely law. The Supervisors are
expected not to flinch in the presence of this emergency. The people
are willing to do without a good many other things in government,
but they do demand efficient support of the schools and are willing
to pay for it.
The law makes education compulsory. This is now reinforced
by the child labor law which penalizes a child for doing any useful
labor if under 14 years of age. These two laws, with the truancy
act, are intended to force into the schools all of the population of
school age. They are taken out of the hands of their parents and
the State assumes parental authority over them.
To reveal the increased responsibility which these laws put
upon the school department, let the facts be disclosed. There is
not school room enough to accommodate, under decent and sanitary
conditions, the school population of this city. There are not teachers
enough to teach them properly when the compelling hand of the law
has driven or led them to school. The Board of Health has in
spected the seventy-three schoolhouses in San Francisco and finds
forty-eight of them in an. unsanitary condition and dangerous to
the health of pupils and teachers. The Board of Health goes further.
It finds that these unsanitary school buildings are a menace to
the health of the neighborhoods where they are located. We appeal
to the Board of Supervisors to consider these things. The law takes
children away from their parents and compels them to go to school,
and in forty-eight of seventy-three schoolhouses exposes them to
disease and death. Such things cannot be without serious moral re
sponsibility resting somewhere. The people look to the Super
visors for a remedy and will cheerfully submit to taxation to pay
the cost.
There can be no more serious reproach to a city than such con
ditions in its school buildings, intensified as they are by overcrowd
ing. The pupils and their parents have a right to expect, yes, to
demand, not only sanitary conditions in school buildings, but the
best opportunity for the teachers to impart and the children to ac
quire knowledge. It is not a bit short of a public crime to deny
these things. Every child that sickens and dies as a result df un
sanitary school buildings is murdered by somebody.
Again we appeal to the Supervisors to avoid such, an appalling
responsibility by making sufficient appropriation for school purposes.
The people will applaud economy >in every other branch of the city
government, but they will not permit parsimony to trifle with the
lives of their children.
THE NEEDS OF THE SCHOOLS.
And when any nfother ' attempt- to
control her children by terrifying- them
into submission she is making an open
confession of a deficient character.
It Is reported that the mother, in or
der to compel her children, when
naughty, to "be good," was accustomed
to mix a dose of sugar and water and
swallow it-in their presence, pretending
it was poison. â¢ .
' Of coarse, the illness she afterward
I feigned invariably had the effect of
plunging her terrified offspring Into the
': depths of penitent grief. Then came
: the blunder whereby a real poison was
taken by the mother instead of the
; usual harmless potion, and pretense be
came dread reality.
This unfortunate woman represents a
; much larger class of mothers than we
! in this advanced age would wish to ad
mit, i It seems almost incredible that in
a land that boasts such enlightenment
we have thousands of mothers who ac
tually believe they are "training" their
children when they are simply scaring
; them into submission. \u25a0
The wonder is not that Ignorant, stu
pid-women employ such methods, but
that mothers of supposed intelligence
; and . education resort to them â mothers
who know better, but who from sbeÂ«r
selfishness or laziness, or lack of will
power, fail to put forth the rignt sort
of effort in rearing their progeny.
When a mother 'follows the line of
least resistance in governing hex child,
she is unquestionably exhibiting selfish
ness, t laziness or lack of will power.
How can she hope to command obedi
ence or respect from her children when
she has not the strength of character
to govern herself?
Any woman who cannot cultivate the
patience, the self-control and the poise
to be firm, honest and persistent in the
training of her children is not fit to be
a mother. Â§ -
Tet there are many such among us. I
have frequently been shocked and
amazed to hear the threats made by
such parents in their attempts to quiet
children or make them "mind.**
It Is not only heathenish, but cruel.
to tell a sensitive, imaginative child
that if it isn't good some horrible fate
â which the parent knows is Impossible
â will overtake it.
Childl3h imaginations are lively
enough and their tendency is to exag
gerate the pictures presented to them.
, What right has any parent to fill the
mind of a child with hideous, distorted
shapes of bogy men. devils and mythi
cal monsters?
What right has any parent, by any
method whatsoever, to terrify a child
| into obedience? How can any mother
be so shortsighted that she cannot see
the futility of such a course and her
own folly in pursuing it? Sooner or
later she must lose the confidence of
her children. "When they learn the emp
tiness of her threats and see for them
selves her weakness of will, can they
have anything but contempt for her.
hard as they may try to respect her?
It is useless for any mother to at
tempt to evade the responsibility that
rests upon her In governing her chil
dren. It Is useless for her to believe
she can train them if she cannot govern
herself.

ACCORDING to an official of the De
partment of- Commerce and Labor,
almost all the buttons made In the
United States^ whether called Ivory, pearl,
rubber, horn or bone buttons, are manu
factured from' the ivory plant, says toe
Chicago Chrcn!c!e. The cultivation or
this plan rewards its growers with no In
considerable returns. * '
- The best ivory nut for commercial pur
poses is found on the banks of the Magda
lena River, In Colombia, where it 13 cabled
the Tagua palm. The fruit forms a gloo
ular head about twice the size of. a maa s
cranium and weighs from Â» to^STpounds.
The head forms what might be called a
cluster of bulbs, containing from 50 to W
seeds. The seeds are allowed to dry ana
are harvested several times each year by
the natives.
The ivory plant also grows in California,
but the nut there found is of an Inferior
quality to the Colombia variety and win
not make up as well into buttons. It is.
however.' believed that with cultivation
the California nut may b* made as valu
able as the South American. c Â»-tâ
The nuts exported to the Lnited StaÂ«Â»
are shipped by way. of the Pacific Coast
and thence across the continent to the bl?
button factories, from which they come
forth in every conceivable design, color,
grate and classification of button-
Although the ivory plant Is used almost
exclusively for the manufacture of but
tons, yet -some factories use It for the
making of poker chips- The nut has not,

Thompson Buchanan, who made a hit
with . "Castle '. Comedy," his flrst^ effort,
which ran through Harpers, i 3 $he au
thor of "Judith Triumphant." The book
deals with the aiege of Bethulia by Holo
fernes and the descent of the beautiful
Hebrew woman, Judith, into the camp
of the invaders that she might offer her
self as a sacrifice for the safety of her
imperiled city and people. The story cov
ers the period of five days, at the begin
ning of which she presents herself at the
tent of the" dread Holofernes and at the
â¢end of which,' unsullied," she again enters
Bethulia, > which has been "delivered
through her efforts, there to become the
wife of the Ammonite chieftain Achior,
who has been her champion - during her
stay ; in the camp of the enemy.
The five days are filled with thrilling
.incident,^ the author having a remarkable
'genius , for keeping - all his characters
moving and also keeping the readers' ex
pectancy at the top notch. The style "is
generally excellent and much of it is
beautiful. .'.'jÃjjJffllHrfwl
â¢ There is the fault that at '\u25a0 times the
writer drops Into the method of describ
ing incidents as he would record them for
his paper and at: times situations are ar
rived at too abruptly. There Is every evi
dence, though, of that Btyle which lm
pnsses the fact by lmpiession rather than
blunt", statement, which is the high art of
composition, and there is little doubt that
this ; young author will develop it by prac
tice to" an .extent that will give him a
place among", the word -painters of* the
day. "Judith ' Triumphant" is a book
worth reading.
"1 wasted my time.' I dreamed. I
tried to <io things too big for me, and
threw them up at the first failure; I
diligently pursued every false god; I
uoii': thn.i; 1 was very happj'. and. I
a.in sure l was very cisigreeableÂ»"
It was during a tour abroad after
a spell of ilinefs tiiat the idea ot en
tering the literarj field came with
earnestness to him. Many readers will
thank fate tor sÂ»endii.jr that sickness
upon him.
The most important of the four sto
ries in the new book i 3 called "Tlic
Love Cbase." It is the chase of' three
lovers for a fair slip of a girl, and
each ore of them once tastes the bliss
of the promise of her. One of the
lovers is the warrior, Simone. the
Black LÂ»og of Cittadella; another is a
goldcii-hafred young poet, scholar and
secretary, Nello Nelli. and a "more un
happy young man than, Nello Nelll the
history of Favla has not yet revealed."
The other lo\er was his Eminence - the
Cardinal Gonzaga, and such were the
manners in those old Italian days that
it seems only a half-way dreadful
thing that the nominally celibate
churchman should expect to have tho
beautiful girl, ami sht\ albeit the
sweet heroine of the tale, once intend
ed to become the mistress of this, the
highest in rank of her lovers.
She writes of her purpose to her war
rior lover, but in language so discreetly
veiled that the stern wooer only learns
that be is about to lose her. When her
poet lover, Nello Neili, tells Simone of
the Cardinal's designs, the poet mingles
with the bitterness of losing Uie girl, who
once had promised herself to him, the joy
of seeing her saved from the disnonor of
giving herself upMo the Cardinal's love.
This final encounter of .the three men and
the girl furnishes the opportunity for
Hewlett to show his literary power, and
he does it.
Another^ strong scene Is where Nello
Nelli bears a letter to this girl whom he
loves, and the youth, who Is secretary to
the Cardinal, knows that the message is
from the churchman, and that it is an
answer to a letter from the girl In which
she had consented to become Gonzaga's
love. Under the sting of the youth's out
spoken j reproach the girt changes - j her
mind and pledges her faith to Nello Nelli.
So she is in the position, of - having
pledged herself to three men. Hewlett's
art, however, holds her aloft above, all
the men, and as love-worthy through it
all, an embarrassed and puzzled woman,"
rather than a false arid calculating j one.
She seems merely the victim of the chase,
and at last , passes to the possession, not
of the man she loves, but of the man who
was strong enougu to lake her. Into the
strength of this man's taking she -yields
herself happily, and feels no regret for
either poet or- Cardinal.
Nello Nelli afterward marries a mag
dalen whose repentance dated from '\u25a0 a
song the poet ] sang lor her onee .' at : a
voluptuous feast. It- was the one pure
thing in a mass of ribaldry, and the wom
an, being , in just the mood to appreciate
Its beauty, from that day forth; put away
wickedness' from her. life. ' Perhaps that
scene Is: the .best one In ' Hewlett's ; new
book. Nello Nelli tells ':\u25a0", the . ; repentant
woman:' "Adieu, be your: owij_ poet; your
own poem," live your.' m'uslc*"before sthe5 the
world." And so she did, : unwavering.

Four Italia?i Stories

What this of Mrs. Browning's may wish

ing of that inward silence, which is will

that as true courtiers to the I King we

Lilian. v;ho is diligently cultivating mag
nanimity and teaching it to--, others, can
perhaps, afford 'to laugh at this fling,
for reviewers must have some fun oc
casionally, else were their outlook never
beautiful.
It cannot be denied that many readers
like Lilian Whiting's writing, and to
them this new outlook beautiful will be
welcome. It is about such things as
these: The delusion or death; realizing
tfce ideal: friendship as a divine relation;
the ethereal world;" the supreme purpose
of Jesus; the inward stillness; the mir
acle moment may dawn at a-y hour.
Evidently it is the thougii: of her
friends that : makes her wish ;o think
and teach that death, as the n-.aterlalist,
conceives it, is a delusion. From the book
of Corinthians she culls the passage be
ginning: \"With what body shall they
come?" Speaking of what she calls the
inward stillness, by which she means the
willingness to accept the supreme will,
she quotes this: >_
That perfect Eilence when the lips and heart
Are still, and we no longer entertain
Our own imperfect thoughts and vain opinions.
The old query of why should we. be so
foolish ns to commune with "that bar
ren voice," she puts in her own words
thus: "Why, indeed, should one live in
dark and discord rather than in loveli
ness and all magic and music and en
chantment?" Nearing the end of what
ehe has to say about this "inward still
ness," illustrating what she deems ideal
friendship, and in friendship's name, she
uses that poem of love which begins:
If Love were Jester at the court of Death,
And Death the king of all. Etill would I pray.
For me the motley and the bauble, yea,
Though all be vanity aa the preached eaith.
The mirth of love be mine" for one brief breath!
Then -would I kneel the monarch to obey.

the hills away, far off from the gates
of gold," hers was the best voice in the
congregation, and the sympathy she felt
passed ' into her tones and so reached him
with a message that began the change
in his life. *
The imploring tenderness of the ap
peal caused the meaning of the -parable
to come to him "with all its grave sig
nificance, and the music had reached him
where the sermon had failed. After that,
when he closed his eyes he saw "as
through a mist the vision of a radiant
face turned toward him. and the glint
of braided black hair flecked with gold
In the sunshine under a crimson bonnet."
It was to the reality of that inspiring
vision he came back after he had fought
his Inward battle and won. Not to marry
her though, for he decides to be a
Dunkard preacher, ' "bearer o' the un
bought â¢word," and as the early- faith
of the sect's, founder believed that he
who preaches" the word should remain
single, he lives up to that ideal. So the
last chapter is platonic, and is entitled
"Love is Enough."

Young Author Shows
Promise in New Book
Among the new books is one entitled
"Judith Triumphant." that Immediately
arouses more than a passing interest
and gives rise to the thought that per
haps there has appeared a new .Uerary
star that, instead of twinkling briefly,
will grow in effulgence'untn it becomes
one |of the recognized among .the ga
laxy. When one learns. that this book,
full. of fine passages and* replete with
dramatic, action, is by a mere youth in
the New York. newspaper field, there is
created almost a, certainty that an au
thor whom the years will ripe.n Into
one of the larger figures of American
literature has entered the field of fic
tion. " . - -- -
into Jorn Uhl's soul the feelinj,- vi tii*
Insufficiency of mortals' strength. And
that was a mighty step for this Jorn
Uhl, who had hitherto been so self
oonCdent, to take. For, as a wise man
has rightly said, it is to the humble
alone that God's grace is given. Only
to those who seek earnestly and ask
â¢questions, many and serious â only to
those who admire and wonder and
humbly worship, do the gates open that
lead to a. fair, wide humanity. To the
heights and depths of human life, in
all their wonder and beauty, only tbe
simple and the- ignorant attain."
<Dana Estes & Co., Boston; Jl 50.)
At one period of his life Jorn, who
was then a fanner, tried to study phil
osophy with his pastor. "And many a
time they looked at each other in sheer
helplessness. And many a time it
seemed as though the farmer under
stood more than the pastor." He also
studied astronomy. "In this way did
men and stars help Jorn Ãbl to . tide
over the years of evil and loneliness."
The story of Jorn's first sin is told
with great skill and a fine reserve. It
seemed to have come about from what
we call accidents â just tb.e delay in a
farmers' Job of sand carting:,
"But for the sand cartingr Jorn Uhi
would have been able to say when he
came to die. The sins of youth?. What
are they? Work and Want . have I
Jcnown in my youth, but never Sin." But
as if It were a thing inevitable, as if
every mortal, even the best, must needs
get dust on his boots and spots ,on his
coat, this sand carting came, and Jorn's
fair robe of honesty got a mighty rent
in it-
Then to explain how that could hap
pen to a man as strong and soberly
etern with himself as Jorn it is neces
sary for the author to give us an in
sight into the character and fate of the
pure-hearted girl who caused that rent
in the young, farmer's honor. And so
the' novel gx>es; stories within stories,
and all well : done.
Jn this novel , writing the pastor

Allied to this thought is a truth
which this author, with all the advan
tages which the space of novel writing
gives, brings out to our realization
most cleverly, namely, that a man has
adventures not for himself alone. Some
things we do with utter unconsciousness
that they in any way influence other
lives, may, even by the slight sug
gestion -of the instant, serve as turn
ing points in destiny to people who are
strangers to us.
GUSTAV. FREXSSEN, the
author who wrote the most
successful novel ever com
posed by a German, repre
sents Jcrn Uhl, the char
acter whose name gives title
to that remarkable story, as talk

I'fe to his friend lie.m, who propose.l
â¢rrtUns the life of Jorn. !n a few swift
m* rter.ees Hcim summed up Jorn Uhl's
career. He understood hue help had ccrne
at the right lime. How the wonderful,
kind, seif-sacnik-in?, fairy-story -telling
old maid, Wletcn, had mothered Jorn in
his motherless chiJdhcoJ. How his little
sons laughter had Founded in the farm

rJe g'j-1 who walked beside him. Then,
aftÂ«*r the Jor.jj, bittor and sweet experi
ences of life, came the time of his stud
ies, and a fresh breeze blew into his life.
Jorn said to him, "You know every
thing.'" Heira asked what title he shall
give to the book.
"Well."* said Jorn, "if the title I sug-

another good old German name, and say
\.hcn you've finished your book, 'Al
though his path ied through gloom and
tribulation, be was still a happy man, be
cause he was humble and had faith. But
don't say too rr.any wise things, Heim.
We cant unriddle it after all." "
This expressui the type of character
whose delineation by a Lutheran pastor
. has Jaid such deep hold of the German
r. heart.- Owr 20i.00Â» copies of the German
edition were sold within eighteen months
cf issue, a record never equated before
by any novel in Germany. The book dis
pleased the orthodox church party, and
Frer.ssen gave up his pastorate and re
tired to the Holstein village of his youth
to devote hiicself to literature. The au
thor's countrymen who appreciate the
work say that Jorn Uhl, tbe peasant
hero, might stand for a great part of
modern Germany.
A good translation of this wonderfully
successful novel has just been published
by Dana Estes & Co. To help the dialect
and the provincial and rustic atmosphere ;
of the story many Scotch expressions
have been used. The work is a very mas
terful one, and even in ,the inevitable
losses of translation and transference to
a land of foreign thought and feeling will
probably find in our country its abundant
uses in making wise and tender the
hearts of the great multitude of people
\u25a0who toil on through the averages of for
tune and find some consolations and
hints of deeper than apparent meanings
to all life's sufferings and mistakes.
A thought which once came to Jorn
Uhl about his contemplation of the
lives of men around him is a sugges
tion as to the value of reading this
story of his development and of the
study of all good novels.
"In the course of years his mind had
grown maturer and clearer. He now
stood on his own feet and calmly re
garded other men 'who now and then
fall into the pit.' And a dim con
sciousness in him said, 'Your path,
Jorn Uhl, has by Fate's dispensation
been different from theirs so far and
shall by your own will always continue
to be different. Nothing in life schools
character like the sight of our fellow
mortals' destiny.' **
The London Bookman strikes a new
note in the clamor of discussion now
raging about the "reconstructed
ghosts" who sCte said to figure in Mrs.
Ward's latest novel. "The Marriage of
William Ashe." Lady Kitty, according
to the Bookman, is Mrs. HumDhry

knows anything of French Dlays."

POPULAR BOOK
ON THE STAGE
"The Masquerader" Draws
Big Houses, but Is Said to
Be Not: Much of a \ Play
GREETING FOR IRVING
Veteran Accorded a Splendid
/Reception Upon His '-Return
to the Boards in London
Special Dispatch to The Call.
- LONDON, May 20.â The most Important
tfV'entofah uncommonly interesting jthe-^
atrical ; week has - been the production 'of
Temple _ Thurston's f dramatization - of -his
wife's famous' novel,' "The Masquefad
er." This stage-version of the Romance
is not entirely,; satisfactory, but then it
was a foregone conclusion 'that, no stage
version of "The Masquerader" would-be
entirely satisfactory. ":. The '; chief difficul
ty, .""of ; ; course,-; is the- double. "Double,;
double, toir and trouble," might yerjflwell
be the plaint < of ; George i Alexander,! who
produces- Thurston's play. v --^^
It is one thin* for an authoress to as
sert; that >her; two leading characters are
so much â¢ alike that not even the : wif a of
one \ can ; tell;. therru apart, but iflls quite
another for. a popular actor to find some
body who: resembles ; him ' sufficiently to
make the thing convincing on the ; stage.
In /'The Masquerader," of \u25a0}, course," Chll
cote and Loder meet- frequently. Ameri
can readers have'been told 'already of
Alexander's long hunt fof \u25a0his alter ego
and of his final discovery of W. I F. Tho
rold, London editor of the Smart : Set.
It is to be hoped, though it is not like
ly, that whoever produces "The- Mas
querader". in . the United States may be
more fortunate, for although. Thorold
does j resemble Alexander decidedly, once
the -two | men ; are . seen together ; differ:
ences in height and In feature become ap
parent instantly- and 'so at the Si 'James
the ; illusion is : seriously impaired at the
outset. :
HOW THE PLAY -MOVES.'
However, the day is saved to a great
extent by the exceptional acting of Alex-"
ander, who doubles the' part of Loder and*
Chilcote â¢ throughout,'* except, of '\u25a0 course,
when the action brings both men on the
stage. ; This is :at the beginning, when
the deception Is , arranged between the
two, and at the end, when Chilcote die's
in the presence of his wife and Loder.
â¢In his , adaptation Temple Thurston,
who already has successful stage work
to his. credit, follows his wife's / story
closely. The .action opens in Loder's
chambers, , where It is planned that he
shall :take Chilcote's place. \u25a0 Then the
scene changes to the home of the member
of Parliament, and we see first the ha
rassed, V drug-maddened statesman, \ and
then his clear-headed -Substitute impos
ing on . Chilcote's servants, his secretary
arhd finally upon his wife. jf
The third act brings us to the great
reception, where the masquerading Loder
meets the' woman who has known him in
Italy and expdses the scar on his finger
to her .while \ acting as her subject at
"cr>'stal gazing." -Because of Loder hav
ing: been behind a screen she. does not
know who It is that she has "read," and
it ' is not \u25a0 until \ the \u25a0 next scene, J: when i the
i double calls her, as^Chllcoto, . and
she discovers j that the statesman sud
denly has taken to .wearing \; rings* that
she realizes what is going on. j 'As . in the
novel, too, Loder is betrayed to Chilcote's
wife by the woman's, discovery "of a tele
gram addressed, to the; substitute: by her
husband. : , ,
' Truth to tell, it is not especially thrill
ing as a play, but | the London produc
tion is being well patronized : by folk who
have "read the book."
PLAUDITS FOR IRVING.
It was one of the great nights of stage
historyâ the night of the reappearance of
Sir â¢: Henry Irving . at - old 1 Drury : ; Lane
/Theater. No one present is' likely, to.forg
et the great^roar from stalls, pit.";balco
nies and gallery when . the - fine, dignified
figure of Becket appeared j in : the . opening
scene. It. was a welcome '\u25a0-> home ; after
travels abroad and after a \u25a0 dangerous [ ill
ness, such as no other actor could/com
mand in London. : It seemed : to last; ten
minutes, but it really was less than; two.
At the close -of each act .the roar ' went
up again, and at the final curtain it be
came'deafening. ..'..\u25a0\u25a0 ;
- It was not the grave," gracious and : elo-,
quent ]i presentaiion of,- "Becket" . that
aroused ;. so much . enthusiasm -and '\u25a0 it ; cer-,
tainly was not ' the> play,, i for Becket
scarcely could be called a play, at all; but
it \ was the g veteran Z actor/ himself 5 for
whom all these thunders -were raised. ; i \u25a0\u25a0_\u25a0
'. ."The very blood in; my veins speaks for
me,", he .told the i audience^ ;, r ;" :
v The part of Fair Rosamund- was given
to Maud Fealy, the very ; young American
girl, who was first introduced ,to \ London
audiences by Gillette In Sherlock Holmes.
She was; a sweet and pretty. Rosamund.'
She gives -but the promise o* dramatic
power;. without the fulfillment.', ;;; t; ' .

Rheumatism.
If you are suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for you to be-
come absolutely /cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
will lay aside your prejudice and skep-
ticism. .
,' Every San Francisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee* a cure.
Uricsol cures rheumatism" in the
only possible .way it. can be cured.
Uric 'Acid and Urates are the cause
of ; Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of the; body.
â¢ These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is'; a solvent of these and
tones up the system, stimulates the
kidneyj, liver and bowels and thus
drives them from the system.
Uriciol is harmles J; and no . injuri-
ous results can possibly come to any
part of your body.

LOCAL MARKETS.
The weather of the past week, although cool
for tÂ«e lime of j-ear. was in funeral very fa
vore.bie to crot**. on account of frecueat and
copious rair.t in racst localities. Winter and
sfirir.jer wheat, as well as barlty, were greatly
benefited by airssle showers 'in the eastern
oounties. which thoroughly eoaked the goil. The
uheat tt"stoCled~out fine!*, crowns^ vigorously, '
end haÂ« a good color. The outlook- is a very
promising one. Oata heve received benefit
frojÃ tbe rains on low lands, but on high clay
lands more rain Is needed. Pastures and
rn*ado~Â«iE have been greatly improved; grass is
grr-wlr.g sj:!cndldly.
Garden and field potatoes are in good con
dition, but r.ot made very rapid growth,
owing to tbe cool weather. Hens have been
trained to pcles in meet yards. Alfalfa cutting
ha? berun in the southern counties. Straw
berries are ripe, and shipping has begun In the
southern counties. The frcsts of the first part
of this month are found to have badly injured
fruit In kdc localities. In the northwest
counties there has been too little rain for the
crops to mske rapid 'croirres!".

The New York wires ot E. r". Hutton A Co.
yesterday said:
COFFEEâ Market has been Cull and heavy '.
this week, with nrlces showing a decline of
&bout 10 to :5 ;>otnts. Thi? has been due prin
r'.paJiy to scattered liquidation and chort eell
'.rg. It is believed that later on we shall have
a tx>:TÂ«T market, heavier consumption and de
cresslrg visible supplies being factors.
COTTONâ Trading was light and of an
evening-up character over Sunday. Reporto of
rain in the Southwest checked aggressive sell
inp. The outlook for this crop is certainly very
gioomy. We still advise the purchase ot cot

Franklin Pierce Wlngard, who plead

years in Folsom. He entered the room
of Dora Lukov ; In the,. Cosmopolitan
Hotel on March .14. When the Judge
was passing sentence he remarked that
it would be light, because? Chief Dlnan
had told him that Win gard 1 had been
of much use to him in his official duties.
Wingard said: "Hold on, Judge, I won't
stand for that. I have -never been of
any. service to any policeman." He was
afraid that if it became known to his
fellow convicts that he; had been -a
"stool pigeon" for; the police it would
go hard with him in the penitentiary.

to hide behind the portieres. "What are

Shed Dustpanful of Scales Every
Night Startling Story
of Suffering.
CURED BY CUTICURA
After Doctors and Hospitals Pronounced Case Incur-
ableâPrayed for Deathâ Body a Mass of Dis-
ease, Skin Cracked, Nails Fell Off, Hair Dead
and Lifelessâ Blessed Relief from First Appli-
cation of Cuticura â Cured in Six Weeks.
I have been afflicted .for twenty years with an obstinate skin disease,
called by some M. Ds. Psoriasis, and others Leprosy, commencing on my
scalp: and in spite of all I could do, with the help of the most skillful doctors,
it slowly but surely extended until .1 year ago this winter it covered my en-
. tire person in the form of dry scales. For the last three years I have been
unable to do any labor, and suffering intensely all the time. Every morn-
ing there would be nearly a dustpanful of scales taken* from the sheet on
my bed. some of them half as large as the envelope containing this letter.
In l';e latter part of winter my skin commenced cracking open. I tried
everything, almost, that could be thought of, without any relief. The 12th
of June I started West, in hopes I could reach the Hot Springs. I
reached Detroit and was so low I thought I should have to go to the
hospital, but finally got as far as Lansing, Mich., where I had a sister liv-
ing. One Dr. treated me about two weeks, but did me no good. All
thought I had but a short time to live. I earnestly prayed to die. Cracked
through the skin all over my back, across my ribs, arms, hands, limbs;
feet badly swollen; toe-nails came off; finger-nails dead and hard as a
bone; hair dead, dry and lifeless as old rtraw. O my God! how I 'did
suffer.
My sister, Mrs. E. H. Davis, had a small part of a box of Cuticura in
the house. She wouldn't give up; said, "We will try Cuticura." Some was
applied on one hand and arm. Eureka! There was relief; stopped the
terrible burning sensation from the word go. They immediately got Cuti-
cura Resolvent, Ointment and Soap. I commenced by taking one table-
spoonful of Cuticura Resolvent three times a day after meals; had a bath
once a -day, water about blood heat; used Cuticura Soap freely; applied
Cuticura Ointment morning and evening. Result: Returned to my home
in just six weeks from the time I left, and my skin as smooth as this sheet
of paper. HIRAM E. CARPENTER. .

Cure Permanent, March 20, '05
The above testimonial was given us in 1880. twenty-rive years ago, and
is published at this time to show that the. cure was permanent, as Mr. Car-
penter himself states in the following letter, written March 20, 1905: "I
have never suffered with the disease tince. The ' Cuticura remedies should
come to the knowledge of every one troubled with skin diseases. They
have genuine merit. If my own case had been the only one itwould # be
different, but several cases have come to my knowledge* just as, wonderful
as my own. lam now in my seventy-fourth . .ar and in pretty good health.
â¢(Signed), HIRAM E. CARPENTER, Henderson, N. V., March 20, 1905."
The above is only one of many marvelous, cures made by the Cuti-
cura remedies. In this case the cure not only meant escape from terrible
suffering and freedom from disfiguration, but undoubtedly prolonged his
life, as it is not probable that he could have lived in the condition he was
before cured by Cuticura, after trying all known remedies without any ben-
efit, and after having been pronounced incurable by Doctors and Hospitals.

. TACOMA, May 20.â Alarmed to the
point of vigorous action by many recent
hold-ups and by the presence of many
desperate characters, the leading citizens
of Fairbanks have decided to organize
themselves Into a ' vigilance committee.
The committee will consist of 100 mem
bers.. They will sign a call and then hold
a secret meeting for the 'purpose of
adopting a code of signals for action. â¢"
Dispatches .from Fairbanks ;say it is
now as much as a man's life is worth to
travel the creek . roads with gold dust,
now that the rivers are open so that the
bandits can get-away with their booty.
Hold-ups are of almost daily frequency.
Thoroughly cognizant of the conditions
which . threaten, . the committee^ proposes
to run all suspicious characters : out ; of
the Tasana country. Much gold Is being
held on creeks because the miners are
afraid to risk an attempt to bring it into
Fairbanks. , . ?

dresses are not only In leading dallies of
the United States, but he has invaded
the advertising columns of London and
Continental dailies with characteristic
poster-size advertising In an effort to
scare European holders of American
fctorks to throw them overboard.
In this country Lawson Is trlllns by
advertiNemrnt, the telegraph and the
.magazine what he Is jrtilnc to do to the
â¢ .'Mem. In London be Is tclllne the
public that the American people are
organized for a financial revolution and
that on a certain date they will with
draw at his behest their entire, deposits
trom the saving:* banks of the country.
He tells the British . and Continental
public that there is not enough money
in the banks to meet this sudden with
drawal, as forty billions of the United
States' wealth is mere paper wealth.
,; In the meantime London has been sell
ing heavily, and will keep on selling un
til its speculators realize that they are
playing into the hands of a giant bear
syndicate by disposing of their stocks,
â¢R hich the bears have been wanting badly
to cover short contracts.
Lawson himself is said to be short fully
IP .OOO shares of Amalgamated stock,: as
well as Utah, Steel and. other metal
Btocks. He eeems to seize uoonHhe psy
chological moment for his advertlse'nients
and has engineered three big raids 'in six
fnonths, calling upon the public to cell its
stock to the "system" and .to make it
stagger under the load of indigestible se
curities. Each time he has reaped a
profit of millions, and his backers in the
enterprise reap profits of more millions.
The "system," by which Lawson means
the Rockefellers, J. P. " Morgan, James
Stillman and other millionaires, has
bought the stocks thus offered, as It al
ways does when bargains are kicking
around. But Lawson has bought and
bis backers have bought, while the public,
hasn't much to show for its money ex
cept experience.

LONDON, May 20. â Among the fads
of titled dames that of Lady Blount is
unique. She believes in a flat, im
movable earth and devotes most of her
t'me to writing and lecturing against
the modern scientific conception -of the
universe. This excess of â¢ zeal, mis
guided zeal many consider it, has won
for her the presidency of the Universal
Zetetic Society. "Flattists" the world
over do homage to her. Not a few of
then make pilgrimages from America
to visit her and absorb wisdom at her
feet. - \u25a0 \u25a0 . ,-.....

cording to Biblical-, science, ebneernnig
the earth . and the heavens.- Here are
some extracts from it:
"Did God create the earth- movable? ;
"No. He laid its 'foundations' that, It
should not be moved forever, s or until the
ages. 'The world also is established that
it cannot be moved.' Psa xcill. 1. - -.)
"To what may we liken the earth? r
"We may liken it to a ; vast flat "and
floating vessel, : fastened by. its founda-"
tions like an anchor. .'For He hath
founded It upon the seas and established
it upon the floods.' Psa. xxiv. 2f2 f
"What did God make . on the fourth
day?
"The sun and moon and the stars, to
divide the night. These are 'lights' only
and are all intended for this world. God
said: 'Let there be lights in the firma
ment of the heavens, to give light upon
the earth, and it was so.' " Gen. i. 15. : .
"Do not the theories of modern astron
omy contradict this account of creation?
"Yes, they contradict the teachings of
Moses (which the Christ Indorsed) in say
ing that the stars \u25a0 are worlds, etc. The
Bible never speaks of 'but one world or
cosmos, and It calls the, stars mere
'lights' and the sun' a 'greater light,', and
the moon another and independent light.
Now it is absurd to make a j 'light' or
lamp 1,400,009 times the size *of the place
to be lighted. Astronomy also contradicts;
the word of God in calling the- moon* an'
opaque, dark body in itseir," for" the" Bible"
clearly states that God made two- great
lights, the sun and the - moon, while as
tronomy affirms that the moon â¢is only
a reflector. But no sphere, would reflect
light over a full disk, as the moon does, :
hence she cannot be a reflector.
"How should \u25a0we look' upon . human
wisdom when it conflicts with divine?
"With distrust, for;, theoretical sci
enco is mere, speculation.- The creator
Is surely wiser than the creature; and
the 'wisdom of this world Is foolishness
with God.'"/
â¢ Rejecting, therefore, as "foolishness"
the teachings of astronomy wherever
they conflict with: the affirmations of
Holy Writ, "-Lady Blount accepts with
out reservation Job's description of the
firmament us "strong- and as a molten
looking slass." *
"Even as the \u25a0\u25a0 dome of St. Paul's
Cathedral is j made of solid material,"
shu.! says, "so the firmament is a solid
expanse above our heads. : If it; were
not solid it would riot be able to - sup
port the great weight of water above
the . firmament.' The '; dome of -the
heavens, .which Is -made:' of solid mat
ter, -is concave 1 toward â¢\u25a0; us, so that the
sun, stars. and moon can move around
She hopes some day to visit the Unit
ed States and convince people that Mo
ses was better posted on the construe
, tlon and working of the universe than
Herschel and all the rest of the "as
tronomical novelists of 'the globular
\ school," as she calls them.
Compared .with* the boundless dimen
sions which modern scientists have
ascribed to it, the universe as â¢ pictured*
by. Lady Blpunt is dwarfed to the size
of a mere celestial â¢ potato patch. The
sun and moon, which she credits with
being by far the largest of. the heavenly
bodies, she says, are not more . than about
thirty miles in diameter. The most dis
tant of the stars she places "probably
not more than some six or . seven thou
sand miles-h igh." \u25a0' .. - \u25a0 . \u25a0
|In the form ; of a catechism, with, ques
tions and answers, she tells \u25a0 faithful
Zetetlcs what they ought to. believe, ac-
,untenable. If the Bible is the word
of God, it is absolutely true. We must
accept it as a whole or else have none
of it We cannot divorce the religion
of . the Bible from the science of the
Bible; hence the globists cannot be
Bible Christiansâ nor can Bible' Chris
tians be followers of Newton's phil
osophy.'*
Lady Blounfs letter was written In
reply to some queries apropos of a lec
ture on the earth's alleged flatness
which her ladyship delivered In Lon
don the other" day. Pinning her faith
to what she calls nhe divine system of
cosmogony as revealed by the Creator,"
she boldly declares all the teachings of
astronomy since the days of Galileo
false and pernicious, leading to pagan
ism and perdition. She asserts that
the earth. Instead of being a ball,
whirling through space at the rate of
something like nineteen miles a sec
ond, as scientists have taught us to
believe, is a fixed, flat and. immovable
plain.

is conditional on the collets raisins a Hke sum.
The artist was appealed to to settle
this burning question. He did so in a
letter which has been published in which
he states: "The lady standing up is re
marking to the lady sitting down that
rhe must really decline to play . any
Jpnger with a person who has such sin
gular nick at cardsâ and' the lady sit

left another puzzle to solve, how did

APPEAL TO THE ARTIST.
LONDON, May 20. â TVhether or not
he has achieved a great artistic success,
it is certain that the Hon. John Col
lier's striking painting, "The Cheat,"
at this year's Royal Academy exhibi
tion has become the most talked of
picture in London. At all the clubs
\u25a0wnere bridge Is played it is a staple
topic of conversation, and at afternoon
teas, sacred to femininity, it has pro
voked much acrimonious discussion.
Some time ago an article was written*
in a popular magazine accusing women
bridge players of being much addicted
to cheating. It evoked a storm of in
dignant protests. In Collier's picture
the cheat is a woman. But nobody has
arisen to denounce it as an unwar
ranted aspersion on the sex. From
which it may be inferred society now
concedes that \u25a0womenâ some women at
least â do cheat at bridge when they
eet the chance.
The picture shows two men and two
women engaged in the sedoctive game at
â¢which so much pulpit denunciation has
been hurled. One of the women has
arisen from her seat and Is looking dag
gers at the other woman and is obviously
engaged in raying ugly things to her.
The expression on the other woman's
face indicates ! that she may have some
disagreeable things to say, too, when she
gets a chance. Each of the two men
seems to be glad that it is not up to him
to explain anything. But the picture
makes It by no means clear which of
the two women has done the \ cheating.
Epeclal Dispatch to TbÂ« CalL
"They all said; they didn't cheat," said
Collier, "but they all told me of others
who did, and so I got together a really
choice collection of methods of cheating,
but, unfortunately for me, all the meth
ods, or nearly all, necessitated collusion
between two partners, . and it was neces
sary for the purpose of my picture that
the cheat should be alone in her wrong
doing.
"I found one way, and I believe the
only way in which connivance was not
necessary. I am not going to give 'it
away, but the clew is to be looked for
In the card which lies face downward
in front of the lady who has arisen." "
Guessing was easy after that and the
mystery has been solved. The dealer
had nicked a tiny corner "out of a card
and the woman to whom;sue dealt the
card had detected the nickC and de
nounced the cheat.
Envious rivals are saying that the
Hon. John Collierâ who, by the way,"
derives the "Hon." prefix from the fact
that he is a brother of Lord Monkswell
â set himself deliberately to. work. to
paint a puzzle picture that would set
people guessing. Anyhow he has'ob
tained a great advertisement out of it.
PICTURE IS A PUZZLEII.
her feet been the culprit," says one ex
pert who was interviewed on the ques
tion, "the method would have been pb
viQus. But it is the woman .who is
seated who is the cheat, and she is the
dealer, and her partner, being a dum
my, has of course exposed his band.
It is evident from the number of cards
still in the hand that at least four
tricks have been - played, and if the
cheat had signaled for trumps â the
most usual method of cheating at
bridge â she would have been found
out at once and not at a later stage of
the game. How the dealer playing a
dummy's band can cheat is a mystery
which only the artist can solve."
This naturally led to another demand
upon the artist for an explanation. | He
admitted that he did not know much
about bridge himself, but had asked '\u25a0 va
rious friends 'of; his who were : expert
players how they cheated.
STRIKING PAINTINO ON EXHIBITION AT THBROTAL ACADEMY, WHICH |
HAS PROVOKED THE ANGER OP THE WOMEN FOLKS, WHO DECLARE* IT
TO BE A LIBEL ON THEIR SEX.
Strange to say, Prince Mestchersky.
editor of the Grashdanin and political
defender of the autocracy; gloats over
the downfall of his religious rival.
"While admitting the procurator gen
eral's passionate : love and veneration
for the church, Prince Mestchersky de
scribes him as the incarnation of nega
tion, not only with regard to foreign
ideas, but toward-anything new.
"If Christ himself should appear be
fore Pobycdonostseff," Prince Mestcher
sky says, "he would fall down upon
his knees ,and worship " him, but ho
would deny" the'living word. ..Pobye
donostseff will brook no opposition:; He
"Ten years ago one â¢of the Em
peror's subjects would have been exiled
to Siberia" for what the Empercr: now
proclaims in his imperial manifesto." ..
In the council of the empire* for a
quarter of a century none of the Em
peror's Ministers could hold his own
against Pobyedonostseff. With all his
might he struggled, in spite of failing
health,- against . the new reform move-,
men t, and in recent months, when he
was unable to win outright, he = man
aged at least to secure .the appearance
of a draw by inspiring his imperial
master to balance the reform- rescript
with the reactionary manifesto. His
last signal triumph was the blocking
of the scheme of Metropolitan Antonius
for a church council and restoration of
the patriarchiate, and in having, the sat
isfaction of seeing its author practical
ly banished to the Caucasus. -
But the crowning defeat of Pobye
donostseff came with the imperial
ukase striking the shackles, from re
ligion, the blow being all the*, harder
because it was delivered on the:anni
versary of his* jubilee as procurator of
the Holy Synod. ;
.. ..JTo^intimates who are admitted to his
bedroom, Pobyedonostseff talks bitterly.
He ' says he . has lost hope and washes
his hands of everything. He sees only
ruin ahead for church and state. * The
Government, he declares, has gone mad,
and to allow the people to \u25a0 play with
questions of state as they would ; with'
new toys, is ; - deplorable. The crisis he
attributes â¢to the lack of. a strong and
commanding statesman, and ; he severe
ly blames the Emperor for his weak
ness in yielding to the importunities of
the Liberals. On Friday: he said s to a
friend: \u25a0 ;-. ... -r-^y- : \u25a0/; -\u0084. : \u25a0 V.. \u0084
Figuratively, Pobyedonostseff spat upon
the civilization of the West. Democ
racy to him was irresponsible despot
ism and liberty was license and" he was
especially hostile to a free press; .for
irresponsible editors, passing judgment
upon any and every thing and foment
ing trouble and internal strife for which
a monarch would be dethroned and re
sponsible officials disgraced, were to
him an abomination.
Pobyedonostseff has been denominated
the "fanatic of the West 1 ' The secret
of his -wonderful sway over the minds
of two Emperors . has been ; his un
shaken * belief ( in / and devotion to the
principles of ; autocracy 'and orthodoxy
as the twin cornerstones of Russia's fu
ture greatness. Holy Russia, he be
lieved with all the Intensity of his soul,
was destined to dominate the globe,
and he was ever fond of asserting, as
he did -to Senator Beveridge of Indiana:
"Russia is not a state; Russia is a
world." â¢ ,r:,.-:
ST. PETERSBURG, May 20.â The
power of ' Pobyedonostseff, procurator
general of the Holy ' Synod, who, for
twenty-five years, since he induced Em
peror Alexander II to overthrow Lorls
Melikoff and abandon his whole reform
policy, has been dominating- the re "
actionary influence of < the gg Russian
state, seems shattered fat last. He \u25a0; is
more than 80 years of 'age, is confined
to his bed "practically continuously, be
lieves he sees everything for which he
fought* slipping away and is dying an
embittered * old man.' Yet, : with the
threads of life slipping, he still pro
tests with all the fire of his remarkable
mentality.

VICTIM OF MURDERER
FORMERLY LIVED HERE
NEW* YORK. May 33.â The Financier
pays: Last week's official statement of
the New Tork Associated Banks was
much more- unfavorable than was ex
pected, chiefly for the reason that there
was a large expansion instead of the
looked-for contraction in loans. Because
of such increase in this item, the loss of
cash and the augmentation of rcerve
requirements through increased deposits
the surplus reserve was cut nearly in
half, carrying it to within about $3,000,000
of the lowest of the year, which was re
corded March 18. The increase in loans
can be accounted for in no other way
than that it was due to syndicate opera
tions, for there was almost continuous
liquidation in the stock market during
the week, which should have resulted in
a large contraction in loans. Cash re
serves increased a sum smaller than that
which was estimated upon the basis of
the traceable movements or. money dur
ing the week, the difference between the
estimates that the actual loss in this item
being possibly due to the system of bank
averages. The increase of deposits was
!1,GX5,300, less than the sum of the in
crease in loans less the loss of cash,
therefore the staement was technically
out of proof. The surrender of public de
posits, which was in progress through
the New York banks during the week
on their own account and from their
correspondents and which amounted to
about 55,000,000, was not fully reflected in
the staetment, there having been a re
duction of only 52,rÂ»53,C00 in this item com
pared with the previous week, which re
duction represents about the amount of
surrenders . of public funds by the city
banks for themselves alone. The required
reserve against general deposits was
augmented by $3,733,000, which, added to
the loss of cash as above stated, makes
SM32.&W as the reduction in the surplus
reserve. Computed upon the basis of de
posits, less those of $13,150.â¬00 public
furds. the surplus is $11,507,625. One of
the features was an increase of $609,600 in
circulation, the most important gain
since the beginning of the month.

Judge Mogan that he sprung the claim

Having clutched the tooth firmly with
his forceps, the story goes, Charley would
address Its owner in the vernacular:
"Well it 1b that you came to me with
this raging tooth, for if you had gone to
a white devil he would have attempted
to pull it like this." And he would
wrench and twist the tooth so fiercely as
to make the patient squirm. "Or," he
would then resume, "If you had gone to
Dr. Fooey Sing he would have treated
you ln this way." Another wrench ln the
opposite direction would tear the tooth
from Its bed. Then, gently lifting It out.
Charley would conclude, "But you wisely
came to me. and I remove the tooth
without causing you tha least pain, Just

> Miss Lottie Gonzales railed bitterly
against the policeman who arrested her
exactly five days after her release from
the County Jail, where she had served a
thirty-day term for disturbing the peace
of a Barbary Coast dance hall. And her
indignation was too deep for utterance
when Judge Fritz sentenced her to sixty
days for a similar offense committed on
Kearny street, near Post, and promised
to give her alx months if she ever reap
peared before him as defendant on the
charge of disorderly conduct in a public
place.
As a performer of Spanish* dances Miss
Gonzales, police chroniclers cay, bounded
from obscurity to fame among the Pa
cific street "hurdy-gurdy" habitues
and her popularity lasted until it flgura
tively swelled her head to a size that
swamped whatever sense of discretion
she possessed ere adulation marked her
for its own. That is to say, in her tri
umph she became so arrogant and such a
disturbing element in the temples of
Terpsicliore that the Impresarios who
erstwhile clamored for, her services en
tered into agreement that her suppres
sion was essential to the well-being of
their common industry, and | the result
was not conducive to rehabilitation of
her reasonableness. All along the line
she was confronted by .ostracism tfiat
completely removed the lidLfrojh. her lat
ent ferocity of temper, -*lnKeHied from
grandees extending far backward into
Castile's history. . Tfius she became a
common scold an.d brawler and chronic
fracturer of the Peace laws. No sooner
was che let out of Jail than she did
something to provoke the police to pop
her in again, and for several years she
has spent much more time behind barred
gates than In freedom, j Of the-, many
who once worshiped at her sandaled feet
there is none now bo poor as to do her
reverence.
Edward Maher, accused of violating
the ordinance which makes it a misde
meanor for one person to drive away, an
other person's vehicle without the own
er's consent, pleaded not guilty and
claimed to have a "physical counterpart,
who probably committed the alleged of
fense.
Mr. Maher or his double . drove away
from the Emma Bpreckels building, on

SACRAMENTO, May 20.â 1n a fit of de
moniaral fury Chris Christianson, re
leased on parole from* the Stockton In
sane Asylum last Thursday, killed his
mother, Mrs. Mary v Christianson, at 1409
D street this morning and -a few minutes
later committed suicide.
There were no witnesses to the trag
edy, but some of the neighbors heard the
woman's screams and saw* her run from
the house with blood welling from a cut
in her throat, splashing and staining the
sidewalk as she ran. Despite the mortal
wound the woman traversed a consider
able distance and fell in front of a
neighbor's house. She expired without
uttering a word as to the circumstances
leading to her death.
Twenty minutes later it revolver shot
was heard in the house, where Christian
son had barricaded himself. When the
officers entered Christianson was found
dead on the floor of the storeroom with
his throat cut from ear to ear. At* the
Morgue it was found that he had also
shot himself.
Charley Fong is one of several persons
now before the Police Courts on the
charge of. practicing dentistry without
a license. His workshop was in- that sec
tion of Sacramento street embraced by
Chinatown and his patrons were exclu
sively Aciatlcs. Where he learned to pull
and nil and crown and do other things
pertaining to the art dental has not been
ascertained from the proceedings against
him in court thus far, but next Saturday
he is scheduled for trial before Judge
Mogan. and then particulars of his ap
prenticeship may develop.
It has been stated of Charley Fong,
however, that he was enjoying an ex
tensive and lucrative -practice when the
police brought it to a halt. His com
patriots are especially afflicted with tooth
ailments, and his widely advertised claim
of ability to treat all molars and incisors
both painlessly and effectivelyâ money
returned if patient dissatisfiedâ could not
have failed to appeal with force to a peo
ple whose native method of relieving
toothache was that of removing the
cause by means of a chisel and hammer
and without the application of anes
thetics. So they flocked to Charley Fong's
well-equipped parlor, and not one of
those who passed through his hands had
complaint of him to utter.
But certain Caucasian rivals of Charley
Fong, with apparent Intent to injure his
trade and help their own, placed in cir-.
culation a narrative to the effect that his

Brief at the proceeding was, it fore
shadowed the intention of the prosecu
tion to claim that Conn attempted to
blackmail O'Brien by demanding $500 as
compensation for the latter's alleged
alienation of Mrs. Cohn's affections, and
that the shooting was really prompted
by Cohn's wrath over the miscarriage of
his plan. What the defense will be was
not exposed. i:^.V

TUCSON. May 20.â The body of James
B. Stetson, one of the leading mining en
gineers of Arizona, was this afternoon
picked up on the sidewalk in front of the
Santa Rita Hotel and under a window of
a room in the third story which he had
taken an hour before on coming in from
the mines. Stetson had been dead sev
eral minutes and his body' had been badly
mangled by the fall on the hard side
walk. No one witnessed the accident.
Stetson had a wife, who is living in
Baltimore, his former home. A Coroner's
jury found that the windows of the room
were very near the floor, and rendered
a verdict of accidental death.

problem which confronts the American

considers as alarming the report. of five

health problems will be met success

I am going- to Bogota and hope to
accomplish something to establish most
cordial relations betwen Colombia and

full re-establishment of cordial rela

enmity caused by the revolution has
disappeared. My personal relations

"The sanitation problem is i new and

of yellow fever in Colon. It Is alarm

"'My Dear Colleagueâ On returning to

"What has pleased' me most is the num
ber of letters I have received from per
sons in affliction either from doubt as to
their, own immortality^or as to near rel
atives or dear friends whom they have
lost. They write ; that they have found
consolation in the argument I have ad
vanced in favor of an after life, and to
me this testimony , of human hearts, is
more precious than the approval of crit
ics."
my attitude. Here is an interesting let
ter I have received on this subject from
Camille Flammarion: â¢ ::'il
"The physical scientist on perceiving
the light ray believes in ether, which he
does not see. Experiments in demonstra
tions of energy, of the colloidal state, of
the odic fluid, of spontaneous or experi
mental telepathy, etc.. all tend to prove
the existence of a soul. The experiments
conducted in Paris by Colonel de Rochas
the noted scientist, have been particu
larly conclusive. The sensitiveness of the
odic fluid radiating from the human body
has been shown upon screens, and these
last have been seen to! become suddenly
illuminated at the very moment of death.
Furthermore, sleep, anaesthesia and tori
ture are accompanied by a complete sep
aration of the odic fluid and the astral
oody. -
"In what condition do^yo'u then believe
the soul to exist?" was asked. .
"That science is powerless to prove
Just as we find the positive proof that
future life must: exists we -find the nega
tive proof that science Is checked in
seeking to establish particulars. But the
soul appears to bo a : force, and' for this
very' fact it must be:. lmmortal." i in na
ture no force, is created and none lost- it
ls_ only transformed : " and preserved.
Therefore j the soul .must . be permanent
like all other 1 forces. '-,v, v \ : ~. *r y,-^ '
; "Such are a\u25a0- few of the . many argu
ments which I advance in detail to recon
cile science with religion. $I â¢ realize f that
if religion is to live it must have science
on its side. , What , I â¢ hare , sought â¢ to ! es- I
tablish > without appeal :: to dogma or I
prejudice is that science is ! In accordance
with the broad lines of religion." â¢- ='
\ CRITICS ARE 3 FRIENBLT. ,
. "Then no theologians have objected to
yoor treatment of the snbjectr** ;<-Â«'â¢ ri
\u25a0; âI have been surprised and gratified by
the friendly sentiments expressed in most

Borne i? objections ; win k be '; raised }by i those

ligious Btandpoint.:but evidently there are
others,? and thoroughly orthodox ChriÂ»
t tians, _ who \u25a0 find r nothing \ blameworthy la
EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL.
"In addition to these drawbacks. I
appreciated another, which is found in
the works of all theologians, tbe fact
tnat they write from the purely re
ligious point of view, and their state
ments consequently have no weight
with non-believers. The general ques
tion of the immortality of the soul
seemed worth treating in its" broad
aspect as referring to all men, .what
ever their personal beliefs, and , his
torical and scientific reasons appeared
to me in the support of the theory of
an after-life."
"So this is what you prove in your
book?" was asked.
"I do not like to say I prove it," said
Bade, "but I have certainly found much
interesting evidence. Take the historical
consideration, to which I devote the first
part of my work. Without exception, all
the primitive races who have left on
monuments traces of their thought be
lieved in the immortality of the soul.
Could this uniformity be a mere coinci
dence ? Where, -as with the Greeks and
Romans, negation came, < it was . intro
duced as the fruit of culture in a few
peculiarly constituted minds.
"All this is significant, but it would be
disregarded nowadays If experimental
evidence were lacking. However, experi
ments decidedly tend to confirm the ex
istence of the soul. So-called realists op
pose the Christian theory of a soul, yet
it has as much probability as other sci
entific facts. .
HIMORTALITY OP THE SOUL.
; : r :'The necessity foj-jjirepqncillng sci
ence and religion has long. been in my
mind," said Bade recently, . "but I
may consider that the genesis' of my
present work lies in .Henry Drum
mond's book, 'Natural' Law in the
Spiritual World,' which I read when
it was first translated into French. As
everyone knows, it had a popularity
almost unprecedented and started a
wave of religious feeling the world
over. The idea was in a sense a con
tinuation of Darwin's survival of the
flttiest and migrnt be expressed as con
ditional immortality. But there were
weak points in the line of argument,
notably the principle of limiting im
mortality on a purely religious ground;
and, furthermore, the book sometimes
lacked method.
PARIS, May 20. â Louis Lucien Bade
is one of the foremost mining en
gineers in France, and his books on
his specialty are held in the highest
esteem by experts. ( But when public
attention was attracted the other day
by the appearance of a book entitled
"The Future Life," by Lonis Elbe, it
occurred to no one to suspect Louis
Bade of the authorship. The names
of all theologians and scientists were
suggested, since every one was con
vinced that Louis Elbe must be a
nom-de-plume, no inexperienced man
being capable of writing such a vol
ume. And when it was discovered that
the author of "The Future Life" was
none other than the- Paris representa
tive of the Loire Iron Works and man
ager of the Franco-Russian Manufac
tories' Society, it is hard to say which
expressed the most amazementâscien
tists, theologians or engineers.

CHICAGO, May 20.â The strike of the
teamsters, instead of being declared off,
will be spread to greater proportions.
This was decided to-night by the mem
bers of the Teamsters' Joint Council,
which was in session until midnight. â¢ :
The council ' met at 8 o'clock :to hear
the report on the . negotiations that had
been ip- progress ' with -the- employers
throughout the day. They ; agreed "to "all
the" stipulations of the employers with the
exception of that* which declared that the
drivers of the express companies should
not. be taken back. This "was the rock
upon which the peace programme was
wrecked and, after several hours of de
bate, it was decided that the Teamsters'
Uniou could not leave ,the express drivers
to make a lone fight, but must stand by
them. It was decided to call off all the
negotiations and prepare for a further
fight.
The sense of the meeting was expressed
in the following statement, which was
given out as defining the position of the
teamsters:
"It is due to the public and members
of the teamsters' organization that a
statement be issued relative to our posi
tion in refusing to accept the proposition
submitted by the Employers' Association.
The Employers". , Association offered a
proposition which "might have received f a T
vorablc consideration from the strikers
and their committee, providing that it
carried with it no proviso that would act
as a detriment lo any part of our organi
zation. , \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 â¢ "--
"Their proposition, however, carried
with it that the strike against the rail
way express companies be declared off
\u25a0without those companies agreeing to the
proposition made by the employers, -or
any other proposition/they having made
the statement- that-. they: i had - : - held ;< a
meeting and decided that no strikers
would ever again be re-employed as work
men'for 1 the .railway^ express cdmpariiesâ
in fact, to establish a blacklist against
all of their former employes. -This - the
teamsters' organization or its officials
could not accept., -r ;V; V , *
"WÂ© believe that thÂ©. railway express
companies . are not justified in their re
fusal to /reinstate any of their . former
employes, and believe that the best inter
ests of ' all would be 'served had they
agreed to the same proposition, or a
somewhat sdmHar one, to that which the
Employers' Association suggested. Un
der these conditions It Is incumbent upon
the members of the teamsters' organiza
tion- to . continue i the strike until such
time as the express companies will agree
to the same conditions as those offered
by the Employers' . Association." fâ¢â¢
The methods of the unions will not dH
for from. those which they have pursued
thus far in the strike. They^will con
tinue the ' boycott against the . houses
where the strikes ' have been held during
the last month and if any of their mem
bers are ; discharged i for refusing to maEe
deliveries all of the drivers employed By
that house will ,be called on strike at
once.'

To Whom It may Concern: ATter treat-

far the past six years I called on Dr.
Wang Him. He made a simple examina-
tion by feelias the pulse and explained my
case felly. I aeked him If he could cure
it. He f lid yes. In from etz to eight weeks,
which I can truthfully say be did. Tbe
phyeiciane here think him a wonder. Any
one writing: me I will be only too clad and
thankful to answer. I can cbeerfnlly rec-
orr.rnend him In the very worst case* of
eczema, as my case was known to be one
of the meet stubborn on record. Tbe
X-ray was eJs* a failure. I think Dr.
Wong Him enÂ« of tbe best doctors In the
United States and owe my future health to
him. Very truly.

The Cure of Consumption Will Be
Accomplished by tlectro-Chem-
istrj. Eleclro-Cheniistrf Is a
6ermicii!e That Destroys Dis-
ease Germs Without Harm to
the Patient. Electro-Chemistry
Destroys the Germ of Consump-
tion and Cures Serious Gases as
no Other Known Treatment Can
Do. Safety of Course Lies in
Beginning the Treatment as Early
as Possible, but no Case Is so
Bad but I here is Great Hope
â¢ From the Application of This
Wonderful Ktw Treatment.
. Everybody-, lnclndirg the medic&l profession,
â¢crcei: thai it is absolutely useless to try to
cure consumption by tnedicints. Kresh air and
plenty cf it is about &11 th? medical fraternity
rwÂ» to offrr as a cure. tsoir>e caces are cured
by frnh iir. Why? Htmply because of the
Â« .:\u25a0---.. that is placed into the tyetem by it.
Ox>icen destrc>E the germ. One Electro-
<~hcmie trcatmer.t puts more oxygen into the
Mood than a month's breathing of the purest
nsountain ait, A wonderful illustration of the
curatHo effects of Electro-Chemistry is the
ctfc of Mm. A. G. Iverson, living at 2015 Cen-
ter rtrff't. Kerkeley. Mrs. Iverson had the
leant kind of consumption, commonly called
'\u25a0'g*\ lopinjr censumrtion." In a few months
th* had lost twenty pounds in weight. She had
r.ipht sweiiis so bad that the bed clothing was
t-aturated <>very risrht. She had high fever in
t*iÂ» afternoon and a fearful cough. Her home
jh\t>iria.n Â«-aid that ehc muet. go to Arizona as
quickly as possible and live in the desert and
breathe the pure hot air cf that barren wllder-
tu-es. fhe must do thi*. he said, or die in a
t>Â»c moTiths. Mrs. Iverson has two beautiful
children. Sh*Â» could not think of taking them
f> cue!: a plact-. and she could not think cf
leaving th-Tn behind; co. instead of following
hÂ«r doctprs advice, she took the Electro-
<*hpmic oour?fi at 11 H Orant aye., San Fran-
circv, and was perfectly cured- This wu three
ytani ago, and time has proved that her cure is
pcrni-m-m. --/ .
Hffause of it* germicide and constitutional
effects Electro-ChemiÃtry is also the most euc-
I-Â«t>fui tn'iiimtnt known for the cure cf caÂ»
tarrh, asthma* bronchitis, deafness, ringing
cars, heaj noises, dizziness, cancers, tumors.
Hcenv aid soreÂ«, ecsema, pimples,- eruptions,

dleeasta of men. such as prostatltls, nerve ex-
haustion, stricture and enlarged prostate. In all
<-aseÂ« ccnfultation and examination is free.
The Eleetro-Cbfrnic borne treatment is very
*uct*Â£Â£ful. Patients living at a distance are
loaned a fu!l Electro-Chemic outfit for the
hsme treatment. It is always best, however,
f.ir *uch a pereon to come for a personal exam-
ination when possible. The Elf ctro-Cbemic In-
stituic, the only oae on we Pacific Coast, is
located at 118 Grant avenue, corner of Post
street. Fan Francisco. There are sepcrate and
private apartments for the accommodation of
male and female patients, and the effice hours
are from 3 In the warning until 5 In the after-
noon, and from 7 to S at night daily, and on
Sundays from 10 in the morning until 1 in tbe

The qualities of bodily excellence In
woman are distinctive, and to these
her training: should tend- The games
and exercises which develop Quickness
and accuracy of perception and re
sponse, firmness and gentleness of
hand, steadiness of poise and grace of
movement â that grace which comes
from the application of just enough
power and no more than is needed to
do a certain thing well â these, rather
than the rougher and heavier " sports
which pile up muscle, are the fit pas
times for a girl. Even if she should
miss a little of the training in bold
ness and tenacity which her brother
is supposed to get in the athletic field,
this would be better than to have
her lose the finer touch, â¢ the lighter
step, the easier motion and the sweet
restraint of body that belong 1 to one
jehose senses are delicate and whose
personal preferences \u25a0 are at once nice
and sure. In the work that she has
to do precision and refinement are
likely to count for more . than mere
force. Man builds the house. Wom

Marshal Vollmer believes that profes
sional thieves were responsible for the
depredations. in the churches of Berkeley
a few days ago. as well as for the raid
on the groceries.
BKRKBI.KY. May. 20.â Three stores In
Berkeley were entered by burglars last
night, and the tills and cash registers In
each were . robbed. Evidences indicate
that it was the work of professionals.
The thieves secured from the three estab
lishments about 550. The stores visited
were the Best grocery, at Bancroft way
and Telegraph avenue; S. J. Sill's gro
cery, on Sbattuck avenue and Allston
way, and the Varsity creamery, on Shat
toek avenue, near Center street.
% Marshal Vollmer is chagrined over the
failure of himself and Deupty Policeman
Virgin to capture one of the 'house
breakers when they had him under sur
veillance. Shortly before, midnight Vir
gin sighted a man scurrying along Ban
croft way. The policeman started in pur
suit, but just then Marshal Vollmer, who
was on the other side of the street some
distance in the rear, called to him to ask
"what was doing." Virgin paused to ex
pjain to his chief, and while they talked
the stranger made bis escape.
The burglary In the. Varsity creamery
was discovered by J. Wright, the pro
prietor. Returning from a dance at mid
nJght he found that the till had been
rifled of $14. Policeman Lestrange saw a
man hurry down an alleyway near the
place and followed him, but could not
catch the straggler. It is believed that
the man was one ' of the gang that did
the . work, and probably the same man
â¢who was chased by Virgin. â¢â¢ â¢
From the Best grocery the thieves took
about $30. The till in Sill's . store was
opened, but nothing of value was se-
Eored.
As the wheel broke the four horses
became frightened, -tout Mr. Butters,
who was = driving:, grave all .his-atten
tion to the team arid quickly controlled
the animals.- \u25a0 He made; no attempt to
dismount from the wrecked tally r ho
until the danger of a runaway was
over. As soon |as . possible- the party
secured another vehicle' and the inter
rupted trip was resumed as if \u25a0 nothing
had happened. J. '. t ',

Many of the - local soctetJes have be
come interested in bringing the improve
ment et Washington plans to a focus,
and it is not unlikely that large appro
priations for the Work will soon be made
provided thÂ« outlook in financial quarters
is sood. The carrying, out of the t work
ucder consideration would not be accom
plished without a great outlay of time,
as well cc money . \u25a0 . ' "
OongTt-ss during its corning session may
take up jhe question of hpw much rnQney
shall be spent to beautify Washington.
It is understood that the President Is
heartily in support of the proposition to
spend millions to make the nation's
capita! one of the most beautiful in the
world. There is not a patriotic American
in the Jand who would begrudge tne
sums necessary to convert the home of
hie Gcvernment fato one that among the
national capitals could be termed "more
inspiring than any other."
Several years ago plans were drawn up
for the adornment of Washington, and
much of* the work has been carried to a
successful f.nisb. But it is not generally
known that }n the Government's strong
box are the designs for elaborating upon
the city's boulevards and public build
ings and creating new ones, that will
mean the expenditure of at least $100,
000.000.
TTTI? Government owns and leases to
prfvate concerns much of the land in the
city of Washington. Upon the properly
are standing many old buildings that are
eyesores. Pennsylvania avenue in partic
ular is lined with dilapidated structures.
The Government wishes to be given au
thority by the people to tear down these
rookeries, to completely remodel some of
the pubiU" boildicga -and to extend the
public parks- ;; r *-
In the plins tinder consideration it is
proposed to build a great chain of parks
that will completely envelop the al
ready very beautiful city. The driveway
alcng th# river would be extended so
that It would connect with the roads
leading from parks in the north and
northwert section of the city. At inter
vals in the proposed chain of public
grounds would be erected additional pub
lic buildings of such architectural design
tj would blend with their Â»urroundings.
Where low-lying, dirty streets now ex
lfF would t>e broad, well-esewered boule^
yards, lined with double rows of trees
end broken by circles and squares, each
with its etatti&ry and fountains and pro
fusion cf Cowers and lawn.

WASHINGTON. May Â».-That the
coyote is playing an important part in
Me economic relations to development is
undoubted'}- the case, for be has been
made the subject of an Â«>special study by
David E. Lantz of the biological survey,
United State-* Department of Agriculture.
Our own^particular coyoteâ the same that
figures in the short etory and which
"howls and howls and howls"â has been
classed all by himself and is reputed to
t>e one of the slyest, most intelligent and
most destructive of the animal;* of the
prairie wolf species that still answers the
"cail of the wild."
Our California coyote is most i attribu
ted to the San Joaquin Valley, and hÂ« is
designated "C. Ochropus," in italics. This
means that "C. Ochropus" is of a class
thit has made life miserable for farmers
â¢nd has started sheepmen to devising
means of keeping him from nipping at
the thoats of lambs and even larger, dor
xnestic animals.
There is one gentleman of California
who has succeeded in keeping "C. Ochro
pus" from his flock. His name is J. H.
Clarke and he lives- in Laytonville, Men
flcclno County. Clarke says that he has
found that it is necessary to go to some'
expense in sheep-raising for permanent
fences that are "coyote proof." He built
a fence incA>sing 4000 acres of land, upon
which his flocks of sheep roam, by driv
ing six-foot redwood pickets into the
ground one foot and leaving spaces not :
more than four inches wide between
them. At intervals posts eight feet long
â¢re driven down two feet, leaving them
One foot higher than the post fence. To
these are fastened barbed wire strands,
and at the foot of the fence is stretched
another line of barbed wire to prevent
digging.
This fence costs about $350 per mile.
but is effective. The coyotes have been
noticed traveling around it for miles and
look in vain for an opening. They have
resorted to all sorts of tricks to get in.
and for a while tried to get beneath the
wire where the fence crossed a small
stream. In this they partly succeeded
until Clarke made concrete dams at the
Btreamfe to stop them. He has had no
more trouble sjnee.
D. W. Hildebrand. who has been build
ing coyote feoceÂ» for ranchmen in the
San J-aquin Valley, recommends a three
inch rr.esh-woven wire fence, thirty-sijc
to forty inches high. The biological sur
vey says that tl is. in communication with"
a number of. wool-growers in California,
and -wou!<s welcome from them" any sug- '
gestions for protection against coyotes.' ' !

IF NOT. youVe a little slo>Â¥. Most everybody is talking about her---the fastest boat that
tired, work-worn business men home to their pleasant cottages in the Piedmont hills. She is one of
those yellow Key Route boats that* connect, wit>h the swift, yellow cars that* take you skipping into
Piedmont in about thirty minutes, it takes only twelve minutes to cross the bayâ the San Francisco
CAN moke it in ten. After a bit, the San Francisco will have a trio of dashing, handsome sisters even
swifter than herself, and it'll be a ten minute service from ferry building to pier end. Then everybody
wiD wont to live in Piedmont, where lots are cheap, the climate is seldom anything but beautiful, where
it isn't windy, and where there are rto cobblestones or flying dust. With the new swift boats, Piedmont
will be easier to get to than the Western Addition. Better take five minutes to consider seriously
if it wouldn't be a good thing for YOU to get hold of one of those Piedmont lots while they
are still cheap â installment plan, too â and before they begin to soar â as they surely wDI.

CandldateN For Academy,
BERLIN, May 20. â A special telegrram
to the Vossische Zeitung- from Inns
bruck tells of an exciting incident
which occurred during, a performance
at the local theater. The audience was
suddenly alarmed by .terrible .cries
emanating from the imperlalbox. The
spectators became very excited, believ
ing that an attempt at assassination
had been made on the life of the Prin
cess Mathilda of Coburgr, who was oc
cupying the box. It was found, how
ever, that the Princess was suffering
from a severe attack of cramp of the
heart. She was at once removed to her
house, where she how' lies. seriously ill.

The barrier presented some of the most
baffling engineering problems ever met
with In marine construction. It consists
of a wall of twenty-ton concrete blocks,
backed by an embankment of clay. :It

Engineering works costing more than
$200,000 were begun in 1500. A mighty con
crete barrier, 7000 feet long, was built in
the sea in the form of a bow. Inclosing
170 acres of the bay and rencering It pos
eible to carry the present workings 600
feet farther seaward.
It was fqund In 1693 that the veins of
ore on the land, side were worked out,
but Investigations proved that rich veins
jntted out under the sea. An attempt was
made to work them, but a bed of quick*
s&nd was tapped and the mines were
flooded.
LONDON, May 20.-A great engineering
firm has succeeded where King Canute
failed. It has firiven the sea back at
Hodbarrow, near Mlllom, Cumberland.
The work, vhlch has been executed by
Messrs. John Aird & Co. for the Hod
barrow Iron Mining Company, has en
tailed the alteration of the coast line In
order to allow the miners to extract the

on close steel piles, driven, in some in
stances, forty-two feet Into tho sea bed.
In one place, where the beet consisted al
most entirely, of sand, a "patch" of clay
nearly an acre In extent was laid. I
The barrier was started rrom both ends
and joined In the middle. When it was
completed the sluice gates were opened.
The 170 acres of water flowed out with

The total length of the barrier is 6570
feet. The extreme width at the base Is
210 feet, at the top S3 feet and the ex

BERLIN, May 20.â Count yon Eulen
htrg, marshal of the imperial German
court, Â«njoys the distinction of having
had more orders and decorations con
ferred upon him than any other man in
the world. The Grand Cross of the Bul
garian Order of Merit, wnlch was re
cently bestowed upon him by Prince Fer
dinand, brings his collection up to eeven
ty-five and they have not stopped com
ing in yet. If he holds his position a few
years longer he is reasonably sure of
acquiring a hundred. He does not par
ticularly hanker after such baubles and
he has done nothing that should entitle
him to possess more of them than any
other living man. It is the peculiar office
he holds that brings them in. He is
practically the Kaiser's stage manager.
He runs the Imperial Ehow business. He
arranges all the court functions and cere
monials, big and little, and sees to It
that everything Is subsidiary to the star
part which Is always played by the Em
peror himself.
He is not only the head of the Kaiser's
domestic establishment, but he also has
â¢supervision of all his traveling arrange
ments. He accompanies his Majesty
everywhere. He knows always just what
should be done and how it should be
done. He is the indispensable man of
the imperial retinue. His position brings
him into personal contact with all the
European potentates when they visit his
master. They know that he fixes up
things so as to give them as good a time
as the rigid etiquette of a court will per
mit, and they bestow medals and orders
upon him in much the same fashion and
for much the same reason that one tips
the waiter after a good dinner.
Pretty near every monarch Jn
Europe has given him something In
this way. From some he has received
several decorations. But he is very
modest about showing- them off. He
never wears more than a dozen at one
time. He is a handsome, dignified old
fellow, now well past sixty, but still
Jiale and vigorous and as capable of
running the show as ever. It was the
Emperor Frederick â William H's
fatherâ who nrst put him in charge of
the state ceremonies, and the latter
kept him at it- He found that he could
ret alonp- without Bismarck, but not
without Count yon Eulenberg-.

put the examination over ; until - next

"Sho is not. required to answer, that

event that: the â¢ enterprise was 'a failure
she- was not to return the money." _
"What did you do with the $5000
you secured from Mrs: Clark on a
promissory note on March 8,. 1901?"
asked Hankins.
Mrs. \u25a0 Cords answered "no" to every
question put by Attorney. S. J. Hankins
as to whether she had' any -real estate
or. interest in any real estate or per
sonal property or bank account Han
kins' t purpose was to ascertain what
Mrs. Cords has done . with the $28,000
she is . alleged to have borrowed from
Mrs. Anne Clark, who Is now dead and
was the mother of the two women who
secured the judgment against Mrs.
Cords. ?Both Mrs. Biggs and Mrs. Nor
ton, the plaintiffs in the suit, were
present In court
When . asked as to what disposition
she made of some twelve oil paintings
she formerly owned, Mrs. Cords said
that her- husband bad paid her $1000
for them, the money j going to repay a
loan from Bi er & Regensburger. Mrs.
Cords refused on the advice of her at
torney to '-tell - the ' name of her ; brother,
who had sainted nine of the oil paint
ings. Judge Golden remarked that' he
would terminate tne examination, as

in 121 21 2-5 - seconds. . ; This is one-flf th' of a
second -better . than "his 'own. record: in
these games two years ago. The judges
did not decide that , Schlck's ;perform

Twenty-eight : boys - competed In the
scratch' singles tournament, but the fact
that every match, except the finals, was
won in straight sets, made it possible to
complete the . event : in . one day. ' M<Â£
\u25a0Loughlin won as he pleased until he
reached the finals, where he met a young
player who proved; in his own class.
Getz won the first set much to the sur- t
prise - of McLoughlin, . but' ' the latter,'
when he awoke to the exigencies of the
occasion, experienced no difficulty in pull
ing out the match. The 'score follows:
Miss Vodden and Miss Myer I (owe ' 3-6)

Two interesting tennis tounaments were
played on the park courts yesterday. The
ladies figured in a handicap doubles
event, while the members of the Junior.
Club met in a scratch ..singles tourna
ment. In the boy's event Morris Mc-
Loughlln again carried off the honors.
The winner proved easily the best player
in. the club. This makes his second
straight victory, . and | another, will give
him the handsome trophy' for all time. '>*
The ladies' . event was completed j down
to the finals, the successful' teams ' being
Miss Ida Mearns and Miss Vera Crocker
(scratch) and Miss \u25a0 Wegener \ and \u25a0 Mrs.
Watson (owe 151^6). Of the three matches
actually played, two were exceedingly
close. The closest match occurred in the
semi-tlnals when Miss Vod den and Miss
Meyer met Miss . Mearns and : Miss
Crocker. The latter received owe odds of
3-6 and after the first s*t looked to be
sure losers. Miss Meyer and Miss Vodden,
however, lost the second set, and after
a long close struggle, the third and de
ciding set also went to their opponents.

the water, which is allowed to float
into the creeks from wells at the head

some of the young put in last season
by the State, had suffered by the pres
ence of the oil. He traced the oil to Its
source and warned the oil men In tha
vicinity that they must keep the oil
out of the creeks or suffer the penalty.
Several water companies were also
brought up with a round turn. These
have been in the habit of drawing water
from the trout streams without screen
ing their ditches, the result being that
trout have been drawn out into the
fields in irrigating ditches.

LOS ANGELES. May 20. â To-day's
game was devoid of special features.
Tacbma started out briskly by scoring
a run in the first inning on a single and
a wild throw to first by Hall, but after
that they were unable to hit Hall con
secutively. Although Fitzpatrick was
touched v." for but one more hit than
was his opponent, Los Angeles was for
tunate in getting hits with men on
bases. Both teams fielded well. Score:

the only [ item of news which was of

the loan item, which was expanded up
ward 0f. 520,000,000. ; An addition to de

before -the end -of the two hours* ses

the^closing [was weak at considerable
net losses throughout.
The "force "of the explosion shattered
windows jin * five houses across the street
from the laundry and started something
of a panic -People" rushed into the street
in alarm, but were partly reassured when
they saw the -; descending â¢ showers of
shirts. ;
All . night ;, long gatherings of shirtless
inhabitants cf 'the Western Addition col
lected on the corners in the vicinity and
held post mortem consultations on- the
fragments of; trash as it alighted. At a
late, hour /most '-of the laundry had come
down,; but some lighter pieces of -lingerie
were -still -in cloudland.

Householder walked and Schlafley took
one in the slats, making a full house
with no dead ones to worry about. Me-
Creedie was there with a bingle and
McLean had a long fly, just enough to
make it a deadlock once more.
Corbett commenced to get real bad in
the third when he passed two men. Wil
soa let a ball get through him and Mc-
Lean swung to the fence for a double.
scoring two. A couple more soon fol
lowed, making it five for the Giants.
The score was tied twice and it
seemed either team might get away
wsth the goods. French started in to
twist 'em over for the Giants, but he
lasted only three innings. Garvin was
next paraded and when the Seals had a
glimpse of him they commenced to do
some hammering and soon had two
runs over the pan, which, with the five
they made before brought the grand to
tal up to seven. After that it was good
night for Uncle Hank.
They reached the limit in " baseball
yesterday at Recreation Park. The Gi
ants naally copped out enough runs to
win after brushing with the Seals in a.
mix-up that was a combination of mel
odrarr.a. farce comedy, tragedy and
jok<". The pitchers were bad, the catch
ers worse and the infielders and out
iieiders about the same. Score: Port
land 10, San Francisco 7. The fans
were forced to stick around and look at
the melee for two hours and ten min
utes.

Claremont won the deciding match of
the interclub golt tournament between
teams representing the San Francisco
Golf and Country Club and the Clare
mont Country Club by the narrow mar
gin of 2Vi points yesterday on the San
Rafael links. Play began at 10:30 and
was over thirty-six holes, eighteen in
the morning and eighteen in the after
noon. The score was reckoned by ;
points, the deciding hole counting one ;
point and each successive- hole up.
counting half a point. In the morning's :
play the . San Francisco team had an
advantage of thirteen holes, being 27
up against 14 up of the Claremont
team. ,
At this stage a San Francisco victory j
seemed highly probable, but after
luncheon the Claremont men not only
swept avray the San Francisco lead, but
obtained an advantage themselves. .E.
R. Folger added six holes to his lead of
three over Adamson; Johnson wiped off
three of the nine holes won by Golcher;
Fitzgerald, who was; all square with
Brown, scored five holes against him;
Crooks added three to his advantage
over Lilley. and Stratton scored eight
up against Beaver. On the whole day's
play, the Claremont team scored 18
points and the San Francisco team 15%
points, the balance in favor of Clare
mont being IVi points. H. A. Blackmail
of the San Francisco team being absent,
his opponent, Carlton Curtis, scored 2
holes or IV- points. Six men on each
team won their matches and six lost
them, so that had the contest been de
termined (as "is often the case) by the
number of matches won. a tie would
have resulted. The Happy Valley
course was in good condition, but in the
afternoon a strong wind blew across it.
The details of the play are given in

THE SAX FRANCISCO GALL,- SUNDAY; ;MAY 21, 1905.
MADRID. May 20.â Dispatches from Pnerto
de Santa Maria, on the Bay of Cadiz, annouifr*
that experiments made with an â¢ Invention of
Senor Ealson, an employe of the telegraph de
partment, for directing . torpedoes at sea, by
means of Hertzian waves bay* proved highly
successful. . ' .
Elliott was asked about the Spokane,
T/ash., situation, where higher, rates are
charged than to Puget Sound points, and
replied that It was a very difficult case
and the railroads . were trying to effect
an adjustment. *
': Clements of the Interstate Commerce
Commission was again heard to-day. He
believed that terminal and other abuses
had grown sinee 'the passage of the El
kins law in attempts to evade that law.
Knapp did not regard the courts as the
best. remedy for unreasonable rates.
. Howard Elliott, president of the North
ern Pacific Railroad, told the commission
that he agreed with the President when
he said that the great highways of the
country should be kept open on equal
terms to all and that rebates should
cease. He opposed giving any J Govern
ment commission power to fix rates. He
asserted that t he present laws were suf
ficient to properly regulate the railroads.
Discrimination between localities would
always exist because "\u25a0. of geographical
conditions. He advocated cutting off free
transportation and half-rate tickets to
Government and State officials and oth
ers.
Something should be done, Knapp said,
toward compelling carriers having short
line connection to unite in making
through rates. .
"WASHTXGTOX, May 20.â Before thÂ«
Senate Committee on Interstate Com
merce to-day Russell B. Stevens of Sacra- '
men to, Cal.. a horticulturist, criticized the
Armour car lines. He said he represent
ed 95 per cent of the fruit growers of Cali
fornia. He asserted there was a combina
tion between the shippers and the car Una
company, which resulted in an Injustice
to growers.
Chairman Martin A. Knapp of the In
terstate Commerce Commission was heard
by the committee to-dar. He did not fa
vor r, radical departure from the present
wise and beneficial law, but desired tÂ»*
have its defects corrected and Its weak
points strengthened. Discrimination
against a community on account of a
smaller charge for a lonsr haul tha n for
a shorter haul could be corrected under
the present law ant some Increase of
restraint should be provided.
Commissioner Knapp did not believe ta
the argument that there was danger of,
Inflexibility in rates or of fixed mOeago
rates in case the proposed legislation
\u25a0were adopted, as seemed to be feared by
the railroad men. Notwithstanding the
fluctuations in the price of cotton there
had been no change In the transportation
rates in ten years. Knapp tendered this
as an answer to the assertion ***** the
rates must constantly change to meet
changed conditions.

be hostesses at a fancy dress, or domino
party, when they will entertain all the
good friends they know â and their
friends are legionâ for the benefit of
the Youths' Directory. 1 f
The Lundy home is especially well
adapted to entertaining, as the halls,
drawing-room, dining and living rooms
can be readily converted into- one
splendid apartment.
That the affair of Tuesday evening
may be a social as well as financial
success, Mr. Lundy has arranged to
wire the barn, where supper may be
served to all the guests at once, thus
promoting good fellowship.
Already hundreds of tickets have
been sold, which means just that many
hundred dollars to the cause of good
citizenship.
All- those who are really interested
in the work of Father Crowley, the
citizen-maker, can help him to the ex
tent of a dollar on Tuesday night and
have a beautiful time in the bargain.
The Misses Lundy have arranged a
delightful' programmeâ a little one, but
of exceptional merit â for their good
friends and patrons, after which danc
ing will while away the fleeting hours.

"The Oregon Legislature passed a
mining law which is of general inter
est to miners and mining- supplies
houses on the entire coast. The gen
eral provisions are summarized as fol
lows:
While the new company has been reticent
about Us progress and success the . fact 'is
known that in the past six months the opera
tors bave found greater deposits of tin with
depth, and that th*se exceed the values ' ex
pected. Everything possible is being done to
put in machinery to increase the developing
capacity of the mine, and when this has all
been Dut " in place it Is believed that the in
dustry win be an extensive one. At present
the. company has installed four standard con
centrators, a complete water plant has ' been
installed and everything is in readiness to be
gin smelting. A new smelter has been added
to .the riant and a new engine, cne much
larger than in use during the past year, is to
be added. .
The officers of this company are H. A.
Schlnnerer. president: Dr. W. B. Huff, secre
tary and treasurer, and George D. Leonard
vice president and general manager. Dr. Huff
succeeded F. . J. Schlnnerer as treasurer. The
Schinnerers _re from LO3 Angeles. Dr. Huff
resides in Corona. The lease is for ten years
and Prafid and Monlton are to receive 10 per
c^nt of the gross receipts, and .specifies that
four men shall be employed continually, dur
ing the first eighteen months and six men aft
erward.
According to reports from Riverside County
the tin industry of Southern California wilt
take on new life. That the deposits of tin
have long attracted the attention of scientists
and capital is known, but recent events show
that a more aggressive policy In development
will be inaugurated. This work will be direct
ed upon tne-Temescal tin mines that comprise
a part of the San Jaclnto estate of 2:>,C00 acres
owned by Herbert B. Praed and John F. Moul
ton. residing in England. On January 2, 19C5,
Praed and Moulton leased the tin mines to the
United States Mining Company.
The De Lamar Enterprise estimates
the value of the Bully Hill mining camp
at $10,000,000, figuring the matter out
as follows:
The sale of the Bully Hill mines for $2,500.
00Â© in coin and stocks, and the transfer in
New York on May 1, or any other time, the
exact date being immaterial, gives a basis on
which to estimate the value of the camp; or
what it would be with the same amount of
development done on each of the other prop
erties that has been done on those over which
Captain De Lamar has had control. " .
Large and valuable as are the mines be pos
sessed, others contain large ore bodies and
may be even more valuable. Development of
the Shasta May Blossom, McClure. Ydalpom,
Arps, Grahams. Brusby Canyon. California
Copper, Collins. Tamarack, Sanders. Horse
Mountain, Little Bully Hill and others may
easily disclose a combined value three times
as great as that of Bully Hill. Three times
$2,500,000 is $7,500,000. to which add 52.500.
000 for Bully Hill, and the total is $10,000,000,
the approximate value of the camp in the near
future.
Activity Is increasing in the mines
of Sierra County. The Downieville
Messenger summarizes latest opera
tions as follows:
Messrs. Hurin and Gardner have settled
all the indebtedness of the South Fork and
are pushing the work ahead with a force of
six, men under Superintendent Fred Kuhfleld.
They are advancing the long tunnel that was
driven by Oscar Jones several yeare ago and
feel assured that a rich channel lies ahead.
New York people have bonded the Young
American drift mine, half a mile southwest
of Forest. -
Fifteen men constitute the force i at the
Alleghany's property at Balsam Flat, near
Chlppa. They have run a hard-rock tunnel
900 feet under the channel with two upraises.
The first upraise struck the eastern rim of
the channel, but the second la expected to
find the bottom.
The Rainbow Quartz has struck a rich pros
pect. --'
The Columbia Channel Gold Mining Com
pany near American Hill has its tunnel in
ICOO <eet and expects to find the channel In
side of 200 feet more. The company has about
1300 acres of patented land. The work 13
being done under contract.
Jockey Tod Sloan's mine at Forest, the
Diadem, will probably be worked again this
summer. Tod's financial losses have prevented
the development of the property, although it
was very promising at the time the opera
tions were interrupted three years ago.
The Plumbago is reported to have run into
a rich lot of ore. A wagon road is now being
constructed from the mine to the Middle Yuba
to connect with the Moores Flat road, bring
ing the mine a day nearer the railway and
allowing freight to be taken in two months
earlier than by the Hen ness Pas 9 road.
11. L. Johnson of Alleghany is sinking, a
shaft on the Tijftitner property. Mr. Johnson
Intends to sink the shaft to 300 feet and run
a lower tunnel. The shaft is down forty feet.
The Oriental's upraise to connect- the new
4000-foot tunnel with the old shaft la being
driven as ' rapidly as possible. â¢ â
TIN MEN INTERESTED.
The Los Angeles Herald gives par
ticulars as to expectations concerning
greater activity in the production of
tin. In part, the Herald says:
TEN MILLION CAMP.
Concerning the work to prepare the
way for a dredger on Yreka Creek, the
Yreka Journal reports, in part, as fol
lows:
' The pit for the new dredge at the Foster
place on Yreka Creek, about a mile north
of Treka, lit about completed and the carpen
ters are making arrangements to commence
building the boat The pit is about seven
feet deep, which is deep enough to float the
new boat when the water is turned in. while
the dredge can do the \u25a0 rest in getting down
to bedrock, which is about fifteen feet deeper.
The bedrock averages from twenty to twenty
five feet below the surface along the creek
between Yreka and HawkinsvUle, and the
banks for some distance on each side, as well
as the gulches, will no doubt prove to be prof
itable in mining. A carload of the new elec
tric machinery arrived from the East last
Wednesday and will be hauled to the Foster
place as fast as possible, so that the boat can
be built to accommodate It. More carloads
will arrive In a few days, also several car
loads of lumber from Portland, Ore., of the
quality required. Later on the boat formerly
used above Hawkinsville. a mile north of the
Foster place, will be fixed up and provided
with electric machinery in place of the steam
apparatus removed, so as to have two dredges
at work on the creek. They will be operated
by electric power from the Yreka Electric
Light and Power Company's plant at Shasta.
River.
A new center for the gold dredging
industry of California may soon be
established. Siskiyou County is the
field to be extensively exploited if the
plans now in view are carried to com
pletion. Hls?h expectations are based
upon the diversion of water from the
Klamath River by the Government ir
rigation scheme
Dredgers aro now operating on
Treka Creek, at what is known aa the
Foster place, about one mile north of
Yreka and on the south fork of the
Scott River. A dredger will also soon be
constructed on McAdams Creek. Pre
liminary work, previously mentioned,
is progressing on Yreka Creek, for the
dredger is to be located near Yreka.
The dredging area is widening. The
possibilities are very Interesting. No
one can say with certainty that any
mountain stream in California Is de
void of gold-bearing Bands. Millions in
gold may yet be extracted by dredgers
in the northern counties. A dredger on
the south fork of the Scott River is

One Cause of Divorce.
It Is strange that those who axe en
gagred In a war on Uxe divorce evil have
failed to note among the frequent caus
es of domestic ; trouble the newspaper
communications and magazine articles
on how to live on an Insignificant sum
a week. These are apparently benefi
cent publications, hut In fact they are
to the * last Â« degree mischievous. \u25a0 It- Ja
the more exasperating - because every
experienced ; housewife knows they, are
untrustworthy. " ' , The faithful wives
who deny t* themselves necessaries ta
order to keep .down, the cost t ot living
would contemplate with v. demoniacal
pleasure the . electrocution , of the .mis
chievous authors of these pretended
experiments in economy. .They are : the
helpless victims of their husbands'
trust; in printed figures. If we are to
fight the divorce cMI with laws instead
of public sentiment then a statute for
bidding ' the publication of. articles oa
how ito live on . less should be' an early
enactment.â Philadelphia. Ledger. .

The Animals Seem to Enjoy Coast
ins as 31uch as Human
Beings.
' It seems strange to think that any
fullgrown.- four-footed animal*, should
indulge in play like a child, and yet
this is what the otter does. -\u25a0 His
amusement is tobogganing and hia
playground, is in a slope covered with
ice or snow, that goes down grade into
a pool of water. Here^ he takes his
recreation, and. no , little boy .with a
new sled ever enjoyed a coast down an
iGe-bound hill more than this beauti
ful creature from the frozen "north.; /
The otter is -perhaps* the most inter
esting of the fur-bearing animals. He
is quite large, sometimes weighing aa
much as twenty-five \u25a0 pounds. He re
sembles the seal and' the mink,- being,
however, of heavier build, and is both
supple and strong. Living for the
most part in water, be preys *-Â«n fish
which his swimming and diving ability
enable- him to catch easily. The en
trance to his home, which is a burrow
in the bank of a stream, is under tire
water. .
In the early spring; when the Ice be
gins ; to thaw, these animals ' start "on
their travels from one stream to an
other, : sometimes spending months on
the journey. If tKey . happen to see an
inviting ; hill by the wayside they im
mediately atop their pilgrimage and
prepare for some sport. One of ' the
number leaves the water -and slowly
climbs the slope, making a smooth hol
low in the ice with his body. >â¢-â¢;
When the* slide is prepared he lies
flat on â¢- his stomach, thrusts his nose
forward and, turning his forepaws un
der his soft sides, goes sailing swiftly
\u25a0down. His speed steadily increases un
til she reaches the water. \u25a0 Silently . he
parts the surface and is lost from sight
for a few ' seconds, \- then , his head ap
pears above 'the^"surface and- you can
hear him give a call- which sounds like
a whistle. This is a signaL The next
otter assumes the position and shoots
'. to '\u25a0> the i bottom 'â¢ to - Join bis i companion,
who has- meanwhile crawled out on the
ice. .Then another whistle and the next
in order slides and? plunges, and the
performance is -kept up until each one
has several trips to his credit.
-' -The first" makers of a slide will keep
this 'up for an indefinite-time, speeding
down hill f and' then trudging up again
to their positions at, the, top, where they
wait' for,, the : whistle ' from below, in the
meantime playfully biting each other or
rolling iln' the. snow. Finally though,
when like children they begin to tire ot
their amusement," they go back in. the
water t and 3 fish. Even then If- they
should ''.happen to' spy 'another slide,
abandoned by fa different band ;Of /ot-'
ters,' " they " can not* resist \u25a0 at 1 least one
trip. ;In fact, ; otters ; prefer 'the ready
made ; places ; ; it ' Is only, when : they." are
unable ; to ; find ; any such ' that - they go
through- "the laborious, business of
smoothlnga hollow in 5 the snow.
There: seems s to be no reason for. this
practice -beyond * that % of } pure Jenjoy
ment. ? The otter has " his ; play,~j Just ! as
the" puppy % l or.'; kitten^ * though ;; perhaps
more - : human: in its ' methods.-^-Chicago

The United States cruiser Boston ar
rived yesterday, 8 days 2% henrs from
Honolulu. Captain Niles report* that
slie left Honolulu May 12 at 1:33 p. m.
For the am three days out she expe
rienced rough weather. After that it was
fine until 4 a. m. Saturday, when she
again encountered rough weather, high
seas and wind until she crossed in
througn the Golden Gate.
The Boston's wireless telegraphy in
stallment worked well. At 8:30 o'clock
yesterday mornicg she communicated
with the Fsrallones from a distance of
120 mf.\t^L At. L> o'clock she communi
cated with the station at Terba Buena,
being then 100 miles at sea. In this com
munication she stated that she had twen
ty-five bags of rp^f on board from Hono
lulu azd that the Postmaster at that
port had asked the captain of the Boston
to advise the postal authorities here to
feave wagons at the foot of Folsom street
to receive the packages on their arrival. '
Commander Kossnth Niles reports that
en May 14, at 3:27 p* m^ while In latitude
25-50 north, longitude 150-48 west, he
passed a full-rigged ship standing to
south-west* ard, too distant to exchange
numbers. On May 15. at 1 a. m-, while
in latitude 28-51 north, longitude 145-01
west, he passed * a steamer standing to
the southwestward. The steamer an
swered with two white flare lights.
On May 17, at 5:30 p. m.. while in lati
tude Sl-22 north, longitude 1S&-S9 west, the
Boston passed a steamer standing to the
south westward. She looked like a United
States army transport. Exchanged in
ternational numbers, but could not make
out her number on account of distance.
On May IS. at 1:35 a. m., while in lati
tude 33-06 norux longitude 155-42 west, the
Boston passed the United States navy
transport Solace and exchanged numbers
ar.d wireless messages with her. She re
parted all well.
The British ship Battle Abbey arrived
yesterday. 97 days from Newcastle. Aus
tralia. Her long trip Is accounted for by
* scries of light winds and wim^ inter
misgled with hurricanes and storms.
During the first part of her trip she had
only llcht winds. On April 17, when in
latitude 4-25 north, longitude 125 west,
and while sailing along in a moderate
breeze, she was suddenly struck by a
heavy east-southeast squall. It hit her
with tremendous fury and shook her like
she were a leaf. One heavy gust carried
vaway her fore topgallant mast. The gale
lasted with great fury for several hours.
She then again ran into calms and light
northeast trades until a few days off this
port, when she encountered strong north
northwest i gales.
The Battle Ahtoey brings 2365 tons of
ccaL She was on the reinsurance list at
15 per cent.
Captain Bryant of tee Battle Abbey
reports that on March G, In latitude 47-53
couth, longitude 173 east, he spoke the
French bark Versailles, bound from Syd
ney to Falcjouth. On March 7 he spoke
the British ship Bucdeuch, in latitude
<7-50 south, longitude 171 west, bound
from Port Pierre for the United Kingdom.
On March 10 he spoke the British bark
Ventura, in latitude 43 south, longitude
171 west, bound from Adelaide to Pal

CLEVELAND, May 20.â The fifth an
nual dinner of tne Chamber of Com
merce was held here to-night with 300
persons in attendance.; Leslie M. Shaw,
Secretary of r the Treasury, . spoke on
"Non-Partisan Statesmanship." ' He
spoke in. part , as. follows: .
"1 .. cannot believe that any country
seriously considers putting in operation
a revision of tariffs Imposing new and
severe discriminations against the
people of the United. States. Such ac
tion , would be most unfortunate from
every ; point- of v view to both countries.
Certain it is the United , States has
done nothing ; and \u25a0 will -do nothing to
invite such a course. If. however, at
any time any country . should do this,
and I wish expressly to say that I re
fer to no particular country, for some
"countries already do it, then there re
main \ for the people of the United
States four possible policies. Without
expressing an opinion as to their rela
tive : ; merits. , I will state them as con
cisely as possible. The responsibility .
of determination rests alone with Con
gress.
"First â The United. States could con
tinue ijer,^ present policy .of. reserving
to her own people some advantages la
her own markets and making: no dis
criminations against others. There are
those who advocate this course." â¢
"Secondâ We could. yield to. the de
mand of those countries which threaten
adverse tariff legislation and give to
their' people material advantages over
those which makeÂ»no such discrimina
tions, g There \u25a0 are those in this - coun
try, I am told,, who' favor material re
ductions in present tariffs on merchan
dise coming from certain countries and
the enforcement of present rates as
against others. I think they call this
reciprocity/ . ." :
"Thirdâ "We could materially reduce
all our tariff schedules, leaving It to
the magnanimity of others to emulate
our generosity!. -There are those, and
I am told there are : many, who advo
cate this policy. Without i expressing
an opinion as to the merits of the
proposition. I venture . to , suggest that
even the free trade policy of Great
Britain does not -exempt her from dis
criminations by countries which adopt
the discriminating- policy, nor from the
demand that the United States shall
join in discriminating against her.
"Fourthâ The only remaining course
possible to be pursued is for the United
States to '. make discriminations against
the countries which discriminate against
us. I have heard it intimated that an
amendment to our present tariff laws is
likely to be proposed at the next session
(but with what prospect of passage I
cannot say) substantially as follows:
"'Be it enacted, that whenever any
country grants to the people of any other
country privileges within its \u25a0 markets
which are withheld from the people of
the United States, then, and in all such
instances, the tariff duties on \u25a0 all mer
chandise coming from those countries
showing such preferences shall be â per
cent higher than provided in the sched
ules of existing tariff laws.*
"This would constitute a maximum and
minimum tariff, the maximum to be en
forced only against such countries as
exact a maximum rate against us.
- f* I- understand that those who advocate
tEls course meet the charge>that it means
tariff war with the suggestion that the
United States will not first declare such
a war. Being forced to follow the exam
ple of other -countries is not the. equiva
lent of a declaration of war.- while yield
ing to thÂ« demand that the United States
shall discriminate against those who do
not | discriminate â¢ against her might . in
volve neutral powers in a universal tariff
war. Such a war, would necessarily harm
us, but it would harm more seriously
still those who . drove" us into it.' The
United - States prefers to treat all alike
and fully appreciates like treatment by
others. . " , "

iirmation of Shooting of
Presideiit Cabrera^
It now appears that President Cabrera
was accidentally shot in the thigh. While
in ; his private apartments : in the Presi
dential residence he [ sent a , servant for; a
newspaper and returning with jit the ser
vant passed It through l an" open window,
upon- the sill of which Cabrera had placed
his | pistol, i | When . the servant was j ad
monished for being, slow, he grew nervous
and . hurriedly closed the window/- The
pistol was knocked from the sill \to the
floor and exploded, the ball from one of
the cartridges lodging In the President's
thigh; .\u25a0V , ' r '.. \u25a0.;- -- ,- \u25a0.;,;-. \u25a0
Surgeons were summoned and pro
ceeded to place the President under the
influence of chloroform preparatory .to
removing the ball, ' but Cabrera refused
to inhale the anesthetic and the wound
was finally dressed and the ball allowed
to remain in the President's leg.: \u0084_
j The report that President Cabrera had
been shot " rapidly \ spread through- the
Guatemalan metropolis \u25a0 and ... was I soon
magnified into, a sensational story that
an attempt had been made upon i his j life
by the servant,' who was .said to be .; in

fortunate peon who was . responsible | for
the President's injury was taken , into
custody by the police, but was later re
leased on instructions from President Ca
brera, who publicly I absolved - the fellow
from all criminal intent. . Later the for

mala were officially advised of j the ' facts
and the excited populace was quieted.

of science. Humphry Davy. The tablet
to be unveiled by Marconi will also state
the fact that . two other famous people;
are .'-, connected with the same house-

"Again .in no fewer than four of the
sonnets the pains of sleeplessness are
dwelt on," concludes Mr. Collins.
Meanwhile, another Shakespearean ex
pert; Sidney Lee, who recently, visited the
c nited States, has been voicing :the gen
eral dismay among students in this coun
try at the rate at which early editions
of Shakespeare's plays and % poems are
going to America. In a speech at Dudley
the other cay, Mr. Lee bewailed particu
larly the unique first quarto of "Titus
Andronicus," and the "surpassingly rich
library", of the late Locker Lampson, re
cently -squired by fa | New York 'dealer.
Never in the history of English . book
collecting.* the speaker declared, had
Great Britain lost suddenly and secretly
such a treasure,:,* Before the officers ;of
any public- institution like the British
Museum : or * the * Bodleian library, before
any private English collector had ; any
suspicion of .their- intending fate, these
Rowf ant volumes crossed the Atlantic,
never, in all probability, to return.
"While we admire the superior enter
prise of - the American ' collector,"' said
Lee, ."we cannot but grieve over the in
sensibility of* our own rich men- who
allow these heirlooms to leave our shores
without making any effort to retain them
here."*-./ \u25a0 v.----. .-.-/ : -- - ; - ' â¢-.-*. \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0'\u25a0â¢.:..
Lee also took a shot at George Bernard
Shaw, in reply to some more j than com
monly irreverent things which the au
thor of "Man and Super-Man" has been
saying about the bard of late. Lee de
clared that Shaw's inversions of the com
monplace and portrayals of sentiment
upside down 'were in his own plays most
refreshing. Butwhenhe publicly assert
ed* that "As You Like It" was j romantic
nonsense and _that he had written very
many :, better plays ; himself, the - Shakes
pearean authority, said' one .could r- only
recommend ' Shaw, to ponder Bacon's ;ob-"; ob-"
servatlo'n that j "Vain glorious men are
the scorn of wise 1 men, the admiration of
foois t : the idols of parasites and the
slave's', of their ~< own vaunts." ,
Sir, In my heart there was a kind of fighting

.And good work â¢ they have done, â¢ not
only in relieving suffering, but in spread
ing a knowledge of cleanliness and sani
tation in homes where nurses have been
supplied. This is a missionary work that
makes the conversion of the heathen
look weak and vagne.
Now this humane hospital needs funds,
and this is how it intends to raise them,
and i; will; you may bank upon that,
with such, women at the helm: . \u25a0
On Wednesday night an entertainment
aiTl r^-^ption will be given- in the \u25a0ball
room of the Palace that promises to fill
ihe hospital treasury with a long ton of
silver dollars; if you will only do your
part. . : . \u25a0 *
It was to meet Just such conditions,
which, of course, shouldn't be. but are,
that a number of good women and a few
sympathetic physicians got together and
tstablished a Maternity Hospital where
it- was most needed, in the most prolific
part of town, on Harrison 1 street, near
il'ghth. \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0 . . ,
And since that action was taken, some
two years ago, they've had enough to do
to keep them busy, these kindly physi
cians and Christian women.
.Over on Harrison, street In the , 1300
block is a home where babes of the poor
xaxy open their eyes to the big^ blinky
old world in cleanliness and in comfort.
"Strange." you say. "that babes should
be sent to the wretchedly poor â the poor
that hath .no shelter for the shiverins:
little lambs of heaven that are not needed
bwebelow;â and ofttimes not wanted.' â¢ â¢
"It's all wrong/ you say, "this thrust
ing into the world of a human soul .for
whose reception no provision is made,
Tsor for Us care or future development."
And you may even so so far as to deny
the right of women to bear children- who
bave not a fit and decent place in which
to bear them and rear them. You may
even call this animality.. a blot on our
social conditions, or a personal crime; but
if crane it be, no day goes by but dozens
of. cases come to light where no provi
sion â¢whatever is made -for the coming of
tne litUe stranger, no clothing for its lit
tle pink, body, and no one to tend it' as
it lies, helpless beside its pale and weakly
mother. â¢ Â» . .
Andâ uahappy truthâ cases are reported
so.' often as to* cease to be \u25a0 a novelty
where mothers with hour-old infants are
set upon and beaten in their helplessness
by the male brutes whose \u25a0 names - -they
bear. These women, profiting- by former
experiences, seek shelter other than
"home" when the next unhappy babe is
expected â and there's nearly always one
expected In such households â and herein
lies one of the unsolvable problems of
society. \u25a0
