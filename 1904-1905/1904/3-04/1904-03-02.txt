tfiat, Russia's .share- of this trade
amounts to 50 per cent and Great Brit
-ain's share to 25 per cent of the whole;
but whereas the former takes goods
ffom Persia; annually amounting to
$24,600,000, as against goods supplied
by her amounting to $23,000,000, Great
Britain, supplying Persia .with $20.400,,
000 worth of goods a". year, takes from
her only $3,600,000-. worth/ Consequently,
the; correspondent 'arguÂ»s, Persia's In
terest is obviously in favor of Russia.
He adds that Persia will long remain a
purely agricultural country, which
fact practically secures the dominating

STOCKTON, March 1.â The San Joa
quin River* at -the county bridge regis
texed eleven feet eight 'inches tb-riight,
, a nine-fnch fall in twenty-four hours.
The channels in this city, are falling
.slowly, relieving all' fears of & flood,
.despite the waters that were turned
into thejii by â¢ thie- .Mokelumne
and Ca-laVeras rivers. This Is due
to the fact" that, there has been prac
tically rio rainfall at the'headwaters of.
the San Joaquin, but the other streams
have caught floods similar to. those
.-coming down the Sacramento', and the'
result has been the .most disastrous in
undation of the tributary country beÂ»
low here in twenty years. . It was
thought that the cre'st of the flood -had
.pas'sed when it raced over .the New-
Hope country,- bu.t to-day, it took an-,
other surge forward, covering about
CO.GOO more acres, contained principally
in Staten island and the" great Brack
and Sargent tracts. â¢â¢..â¢Â¦
â¢ The peculiar- feature of the- flood, la
that the tracts inundated to-aay were
.attacked, not from the river, but; .from
the' -higher lands to the .east of theni;
The immense volume' of water that
poured out of the Sacramento River
yesterday morning near Walnut Grove
and swept â¢ across - the country to. the
southward crossed the. ' Mokelumne
Uiver, sweeping the New Hope district,
an'd rushing westward to trie San Joav
quin River, breaking every levee in Jts
path. . " â¢ ' -
CROSS LEVEES YIELD.' .
It should be understood that while
all' .the^reclamation districts have high
leve.es along the hanks- of all bordering
rivers and ploughs, they also* have big
embankments thrown up across them!
to prevent all of the tract being flqoded.1
fn case th*' outside levee -should break
iu anyplace.. Consequently when the
water from- the Sacramento crossed t.he'
Mokelutnne. River and broke into the
New' Hope district -it found itself op
posed on the westward by these for
midable cross-levees." The latter held
the" flood -until late last night, and it
was belie.ved that they would withstand
the pressure. Â¦ * . . . â¢
The water began to pile up deeper
and deeper in the New Hope djstrict
last hight and began to seep through
Into the Brack tract, of about 50O0
acres. Shortly after, .midnight the
cross ', levee gave way and . the lake
quickly covered t-he Brack tract, which
is to" the westward, of .the New Hope
district and lower ' than the latter.
The water grew ' deeper, on tKe . west
side of- this tract" and soon opened
the levee, rushed across the south. fork
.of the Mokelumhe.and burst the east
levee .of. Staten Island. T'hls morhins
Staf'en Island, with its pearly 10,000
: fertile acres,. was all under water,
! From the Brack tract the water*
poured southward, burst in the levees
dn the- Sargent tract and flobde4 abo.iit
.7000' acres there. .The* Sarge"nt .tract
vfas- still : filling at a late â¢ hour \hls
afternoon-. . The Brack â¢ a.nd Sargent
Â¦ tracts can probably.be drained within
â¢a-fc.w monthfl'and plantefl to' potatoes,
beans and orjfQHS. * ...
DANGER AT BOtTimX. ISLAND.;
â¢ .Jt was-reported'.at nopn. to-day that
Bou : ldin island had gone under, but
.al a'late hciur to-nfigh.t the levees had.
resisted the flood'andthere -was a good
- margin to spajre'at. the* worst points.
Grave Â¦ corrce'rn .}s felt, however, and
th'e -danger twill .come" to-night when
â¢ the title come in. .'Considerabre water
is running 'out of Staten Jsland ami

â¢for'; the .other flooded tracts. â¢ -The fact
that both! Staien". and Boutin islands

About a year previous Monan had
killed John Irwin In a pistol duel,
but was acquitted by the Coroner's
Jury. From this a feud began. A
number of small ranchers took sides
with Monan against the Irwins and
Tuttles, who are really cattlemen^ The
whole trouble originated in a quarrel
.over range rights. The proceedings
to-day were confined to arguments on
a motion to quash indictments. No
decision was reached.

Patrolman Elmer J. Rooker's resig
nation, was accepted by the board, his
retirement. from the force;being due to
a' desire to enter into a private business
enterprise.; Three new patrolmen,
Joseph Coleman, Edward G. Pidgeori
and William J. McHUgh, received ap
pointments to places on the force.
At a meeting of the Police Commis
sioners last evening the proposition to
give the membejs of the force a day
off each month was again brought up,
but, action was deferred until the re
ceipt of a formal communication from
the Mayor on the subject. When the
commission met Commissioner Regan
announced, that Mayor Schmltz was
considering a plan for granting the
monthly holiday. The commissioners

j.hat any' proposition made by the Pres

the State committee by the Gov
ernor will be refused. If* however, the
chairmanship of the national commit
tee-.is offered to the Governor f^ee of
an|y- condition.. -so that the State com
inittee is- in" .his hands., it is believed
that- Governor Odeil will consent .to

irnder his direction- the conduct of the
State campaign.- Governor Odell will go
td Washington on Friday of this week.
The hearings had by the committee
in the preparation of the postofflce bill,
it is declared, developed much informa
tion. The sub-ccraimiUee before which
officials of the department made expla
nation of their estimates is to lay the
information before the full committee
in the near future. This information
includes, it is stated, evidence of sev
eral hundred violations of law by mem
bers of the House importuning the in
crease of salaries of rural Postmasters
and the Increase of force in postofflces
of which such increase was not abso
lutely justified by the facts, but which
were granted by officials of the de
partment. Other violations of law in
clude a limited number of cases where
members of the House have leased their
property to the Government for post
office purpose. Hay declared that he
would ask the House to discharge the
committee from consideration of his
resolution for an investigation and
have the same called up In the House
for the consideration of that hody.
Cowherd's resolution provides that a
committee of five members of the
House shall conduct the investigation.
WASHINGTON, March 1.â An inves

States. These travelers, who have had
the opportunity to study the situation
on the spot, are deeply impressed with
the sincerity of this : feeling, not only
on the part of the people of Russia,
but the Government at well. A feel
ing of disappointment swept over Rus
sia when American newspapers have
arrived there attacking the Govern
ment and the people in a bitter man
ner. ', ; . . .
"I have been repeatedly assured by
the officials that it is the earnest wish
of this Government that the old -tradi
tional friendship between Russia and
the United States in the . interests of
the two. peoples should not he dis
turbed.. I have the best assurance
that this Government will observe
complete neutrality in the Far East
ern war. Indeed, its attitude has in
this respect been all that either bel
ligerent could desire, and Russia has
no doubt that it will continue abso
lutely correct.
OXIiY ASKS FOR FAIR PliAY.
"Russia . does not expect, now that
the war is on, that this country shall
be anything more than neutral. My
country does not ask that you should
be pro-Russian and not pro-Japanese,
but that you should be pro-American.
She expectsâ and I can but hope â that
she will receive fair treatment at the
hands of the American press, as you
say In this country, 'a fair showing.'
One of the reasons for the present 'un
fortunate situation has been the large
number of | absolutely false reports
which have been sent to Russia from
the United States about matters affect
ing the Far-Eastern situation. These
reports have contributed much in
arousing sentiment against the United
States. True, they have been corrected,
but unfortunately a correction never
reaches as many people as do the orig
inal reports.
"I have spoken with you frankly, in
the hope that something might be ac
complished toward the clearing of the
situation."
Miss Clara Barton, president of the
American Red Cross Society, called at
the Russian embassy to-day and of

"The tone of Russian newspapers,"
said the Embassador, "a consequence
of the tone of many American news

It is in the interests of both countries
that some measures should be taken to
check this before it is too late.
"Fortunately, the relations of the

I am hopeful that the present un

my belief, furnishes the basis for the

Count Cassini also inquired infor
mally about the report that the Com
mercial Cable Company had . applied
for landing privilege at Guam for a
cable from that island to Japan. . He
was assured by Hay that this Govern
ment at present was considering no
such application. The Embassador did
not give any intimation as to what the
attitude of his Government would be
in this matter. The press dispatches
fronv St. Petersburg, however, stated
that the Russian Government would
view askance the granting of such
privileges by this Government, and it
is assumed that this Government has
declined for the present to consider
such an application.
To a press representative Count
Cassini said that the Russian people
long since had learned to regard the
people of this country as their best
friends and that it had been a bitter
disappointment to them to find Amer
ican newspapers attacking the Rus
sian Government, the Russian people
and Russian policies. He said the
first "feeling of his people had been one
of painful surprise, but that this was
now crystallizing into a deplorable
feeling of unfriendliness.
PRESS AROUSES BITTERNESS.
WASHINGTON, March 1.â An im
portant conference lasting more than
an hour occurred between Secretary
Hay and Count Cassini to-day, i The
growing ill feeling in Russia against
Americans and the continued attacks
of certain portions of the American
press upon Russia were the main sub
jects discussed.- - â¢--â¢*.-.>
"There have been examplesâ and it is
not necessary for me. to specify â where
a nation in. good faith has declared its
intention to evacuate a region and has
been obliged by unforeseen conditions
to postpone the fulfillment of those in
tentions. The Russian people, know'ing
the situation in Manchuriaâ knowing,
furthermore, that the avowed, prime
and sole Interest of the United States
in that province is commercial, and
that the Government of Russia has
given to all the powers, including the
United States, the most positive assur
ances that their commercial rights will
be protected and safeguarded whatever
emergency may arise-^are unable to ex
plain the continued attacks of certain
American newspapers against Russia
because she has been unable .with
safety to effect an evacuation.
"It Is traditional in Russia to feel
friendly toward America. Hundreds
of Americans returning from Russia
have told me of the marked kindliness
with which they have been received in
all parts of my country and of the
found for the latter to reach a better
understanding.".
"What is the cause of the present
unfriendly -policy of the Russian press
toward this country?" the Embassador
was asked. He. responded: â¢ ' .
. "It is the constant unfriendly feeling
expressed â¢ in many American . news?
papers against Russia. I am sure that
when jj these- attacks// which, so -far .aÂ»
Russia can see, are without cause, end
the relations of Kussia and the United
States will no longer be clouded."
"I am convinced of this because a
careful analysis of the criticisms ex-'
pressed in this country fails to show
any real ground for the bad feeling
which evidently prompts them. My peo
ple cannot understand these 'attacks
upon them, and have asked in all se
riousness the reason for them. For ex
ample, one reason which has been ad
vanced is that this country is dis
pleased that Russia was unable to
evacuate Manchuria last October. It
was the earnest hope of my Govern
ment that it would be possible to with
draw its troops from Manchuria at that
time. The necessity of safeguarding
our peculiar and predominant position
thereâ a position which has been recog
nized by all the powersâ made it im
possible for the evacuation to take
place in safety. This, in plain words,
is the reason*' why it has been impossi
ble for the evacuation to take place.

PARIS, -March 1.â M. Jacobson, an

peals, has published a pamphlet on the
sittings of The Hague Arbitration: Tri
bunal in the Venezuelan matter, to
which Professor, de Martens, the Rus
sian member of the tribunal, has con*
tributed a preface, in which he touches
on the Far Eastern; question. ; 
. Professor de Martens says the fact
that Japan was a party to The Hague
convention of 1899 and that she at
tacked Russia without having, made a
declaration of war will make many
persons ask. Of what use is the Arbi
tration Tribunal? He explains that the
first Japanese attack at Port Arthur
was not merely Japanese ships attack
ing Russian ships, hut Asia attacking'
Christian Europe. These two â¢ civiliza
tions have totally different ideas on the
subject of arbitration, the Russian
member cf the court continues, and. al
though the Port Arthur incident seems
to -be discouraging, there is no doubt
that the future, will bring arbitration

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. MARCH , 2, 1904
. The. little Gluck-Brahma gavotte
was another number, its staccato, trio
most beautifully played, and the A
flat impromptu of Schubert, and Me
phisto. waltz of Lizst completed * the
programme- In the bravura splendors
of the Lizst. too. Mr. Bauer was equal
ly compelling. , His is. in truth, one
of .the ..most .-finely rounded nrts we
have been fortunate- enough to know.
His .technique is 1 brilliant and su^
premely beautiful. His- tone is alto-
There was the De Pachmann grace
in the lighter passages, but with a
massive strength, a processional gran
deur in the fuller moments that De
Pachmann hardly knew. The F sharp
minor nocturne exquisitely sung, and
pedaled' marvelously,: formed another
of the Chopin group, with a brilliant
handling of the C minor etude, that
waa played again only because it
could not be twice repeated. One t>t
the waltzes satisfied the imperious de
mand for more.
The pianistâ it should have been re
marked . beforeâ made a most fortu
nate debut last evening at Lyric Hall.
He is immediately likable. His fine
mane, obstinately curled, is Mr. Bauer's
sole pianistic concession, and his man
ner is cordial simplicity itself. He is ab
solutely without pose, and obtains tech
nical tours de force with marvelously
little obvious effort. Mr. Bauer's first
number was the Mendelssohn Pre
lude and Fugue in E minor, than
whichtnothipg more . indicative of his
resources was given. His tone, as be
fore said, is his most distinctive char
acteristic. Round, absolutely â¢ without
corners or edge, as pure in the fullest
forte as in his lightest pianissimo, It
sings throughout. And this, is only
one side of the artist's equipment.
The handling of the first few meas
ures of the Mendelssohn made evi
dent the fact that here was a pianist
at once scholarly and temperamental,
with a mental balance as- finely Just
as his emotional sense. The architec
ture of the fugue was no less lovely,
than its ravishing tone color, outlined
with .a masterly intelligence. The
Schumann sonata- (F sharp minor),
that came next, brought into promir
nence the dramatic faculty of the
artist. How humorous and delicate
ly fantastic the last movement, and
again full of the wildest carnival
spirit! The andante, wi^h its tense
emotion, held one breathless. The
Chopin group again reminded one of,
De Pachmann â a larger De Pach
mann. .
The pfano is a stubborn jade, a diffi
cult damosel. How difficult, how su-i
perbly fastidious, one realizes only
when the Harold Bauers come along.
She yields a . little with so de
ceitful frankness. Much is granted also
to the fervent worship of her thousands.
But the little more, the tremendous lit
tle more, that makes the essential dif
ference, she yields only to the one in
ten thousand. Harold Bauer is one such.
The thing of wood and wire, felt and
ivory that we know so well, lashed into
hard rhapsodies, whipped into wooden
preludes, slapped into flat nocturnes,
becomes under his hands a supple, liv
ing body, capable of an infinite sensi
tiveness of song. One can't feel the
wheels go round, for they seem to have
vanished into 'a thing of nerve and
blood, a vocal creature. For his tone it
is that pre-eminently distinguishes Mr.
Bauer as a master of his instrument.

failed to .carry out her treaty engage'-,

iacrease. made in her naval strength in
the Far East was as follows:
â¢'Three battleships r tonnage 38,4.88;
o.ne armored cruiser, tonnage 7727; five

nage 6000; total number of vessels
nineteen, with a total tonnage ;of 82.416.
In addition to these vessels, the Rus
sian Government sent torpedo destroy
ers in sections by rail to Port Arthur,
where the work- of putting them to
gether has been hastened and seven of
them have' already been completed.
Furthermore, two vessels of, the volun
teer fleet were armed at Vladivostok
and hoisted the Russian naval ensign.
The Russian Government also ordered
to the Far : East one battleship, three
cruisers, .three destroyers and four, tor
pedo-boats, of a total tonnage of about
20.740. which would have Joined' the
Russian squadron in the Far East had
not circumstances subsequently com

vessels., if added to' the others brought
to the Far. East during the progress of
the negotiations, would have, made.- a
total increase in Russia's naval
strength o,f about 113,000 fons.
. â¢"During the same period the increase
of Russia's land forces In the Far-Easf
ha3* been equally marked.' Since the
29th of last June,- when, 'under^ the pre
text" of' trial' transportation on the Si

NAVAL FORCE INCREASED.
-WASHINGTON. March. 1.â The fol
lowrng authorized .statement, received
to-day from his Government, is given
out "by the Japanese Minister:
"The Russian . . Government has.
charged Japan with' having treacher
'ous'ly obtained a victcfry by a sudd'etl
attack upon Russia) which was bent :
on maintaining peace. It is further as
serted that, since a rupture of diplo
matic relations can never be looked
upon as the opening of hostilities ancl
since Japan- did not Issue a declara
tion of war until February 11. she has
been guilty. of a fl.agfant breach of the
principles of internationatl law in mak
ing, as early as February 8, most un
warrantable attacks on Russian men
of-war and merchant vessels.
"The answer to these charges may
be found in tile action of Russia her
self; That her Government never en
ter.tiiined apy sincere dr'sfre.for'-peace.
can be clearly se'en from. Jts own 'con
duct. .Throughout the whole course of
the -negotiations "Russia persistently/re
fused. to meet, the proposals mudo by
Japan in a. moderate arid conciliatory
sp-irit. These delays could not be con
strued as otherwise than wanton, and
unnecessary. She put off the settle
ment of the questions af issue, whije
at the same time busily extending her
naval and military preparations, ;
'.'On the. ,6th' of ' February Japan an
nounced to Russia her.decision r to, ter
minate , the ; pending negotiations and to
take such .independent action" as she
might deem best to defend her position,
menaced by , Russia, ; and Â¦ to protect ' her
established rights "and legitimate inter
ests. At the same time the Government
of Japan informed. the Russian Govern
ment Â¦ that a^' Its .moderate . and "un
selfish ! proposals in , the' interests of :a
firm and : iastlng ; peace in the ! Far East
had < not ~ received the âÂ¦; consideration
which;was their, due Japan had resolved
.to? sever: her-; diplomatic; relations with
Russia,*, which r for - the reason } named
'Â¦During the lattec part of January
and up to the beginning- of February
Russian military activity was still
further' intensified. On January.' 21
about two -battalions of infantry and
a detachment of . cavalry were sent
â¢from Port Arthur and Dalny.to the
northern' frontier of Korea and on
January 28 a- formal order- to prepare
for war was given by Admiral Alex
ieft" to the forces, which were stationed
in the vicinity of the Xalu.. On' Feb
ruary 1 the military -commandant at
Vladivostok. under v the orders of his
Government, requested- the Japanese
commercial agent at (hat port to noti
fy his countrymen: that a state of
siege might be proclaimed at. any-.mo
ment' arid they must take Immediate
preparations to withdraw .to Hab
rovsk. About the same date all of the
Avarships a,t Port Arthur, except a bat
tleship then under repairs, made a
naval "demonstration by leaving port,
while, troops were advanced in large
numbers from Liaoyang toward the
Yalu. . ' ' *'
â¢ vin view of these facts, who can. say
that Russia had no warlike intentions
or that she was unprepared for. war?
Seeing that thrf situation had become
so '-'critical thaf^it admitted of no;fur
ther delay, the .Japanese ( Government
was compelled to break off^negotfaj'
tlons that had proved abortive andto
take ' the necessary, steps for- self-pro
tection. But the responsibility for. the
challenge to war rests not with Japan,
but solely with Russia. .'..";.-
SEVERANCE OF RELATIONS.
-From these military and- naval
preparations of every description,
made during the progress . of the ne
gotiation^ ft is quite evident that Rus
sia, was not inclined to a friendl>*>set
tlement of the questions then under
discussion betwee'n Japan and her
self, 'but so-ught, solely by her mili
tary preponderance, to . force "Japan
into^ submission. ' . â¢ . '. :
"During the same period there. has
been the greatest activity possible at
Port. Arthur and at Vladivostok and
work has been carried on. day. and
night to strengthen the fortifications
of those naval ports, while forts have
been built at Liaoyang, Hunchun and
other strategic points, arid large quan
tities of arms and ammunition have
been sent to the Far East by the Si
berian 'Railway and the vessels of the
volunteer fleet. ' In the middle, of Oc
tober last a train of fourteen cars was
hurriedly sent from Russia, laden with

The fact that. Russia' was unable to- un

that. a declaration -of war is not;an' in-
dispensable pre-requisite to the opening
of hostilities. Indeed, it has been the
common practice in recent wars to de
clare war after' hostilities have been
begun. Japan's action, therefore', is- not
open to the least criticism in this.re
gard.. From the" standpoint of ihter.na

the charges made against her' do not
come with good grace from R.ussla, in

arrest escaped.
The men were placed on the detinue
book at the City Prison and gave the
names of â¢ Jacob Schubner. Charles

these who presented it here are willing to un
dertake the trip.

Then 1 stopped the team and helped to get
him to the sidewalk, while some one called
for the police wagon.
Just before I got to the Twenty-flrst-street
crossing, driving south on San I'ablo avenue,
I turned half around and put my whip on the
top of 'the wagon. The horses were only jog
ging' alcng. One of them swerved a little and
must havt* struck the old man, knocking hfm
down, but away from the team. I did not
see him until after the wagon passed him, ly
ing In the street.

As his wife slept by his side at their
home, 2430 Fulton street, Newton W.
Mallery, a dealer in physicians' sup
plies in the Crocker building In San
Francisco, drew a pistol from beneath
his pillow early this morning and sho-t
himself in the head, inflicting a wound
from which he died almost instantly.
The horrified widow, ! still stunned by
the desperate act, is unable to account
for its commission, and the most ac
ceptable theory is that the man had
decided upon suicide while in a deep
fit of despondency, the outgrowth of
a nervous illness from which he had
suffered for a long time, though the
malady was not painful or menacing.
Mallery was cheerful enough when
he retired last night. He had been to
j the Lyceum Theater with his wife and
Miss Alice Woods and seemed to be
in his usual mood. The party arrived
at their hc-me on Fulton street about
12 o'clock and retired an hour or so
later.
Following her custom, Mrs. Mallery
read a ,book for an hour or so after
going to bed. Her husband apparently
had gone to sleep immediately ' after
retiring. Finally Mrs. Mallery dropped
her book and went to sleep, leaving the
light burning. She had been sleeping
but a few minutes, when she was
awakened by a shot, followed by a
groan. Starting up, she saw that her
husband had shot himself. The smok
ing pistol was still clutched in his right
hand.
Mrs. Mallery called the other mem
bers of the household to her assistance
and a physician was hurriedly sum
moned, but the man was dead before
assistance could be secured. The pis
tol bullet had entered the back of the
head and shattered. the brain.
Mallery is not known to have had
any business or family troubles and
his suicide can only be attributed to
fear that his illness might make him
an invalid. He was well known among
the physicians of San Francisco, who
patronized his business extensively. He
was a native of Massachusetts, 50 years
old, and leaves, besides his widow, a
son by a former wife, Walter Mallery
of Erie, Pa.
The funeral arrangements, have not
yet been made. An inquest will be held
by the Coroner.

The purchase of the Livermore Water
and Power Company, following as It
does so closely upon the absorption of
the Standard Electric Company and the
United Gas and Electric' Company,
seems to rrove that the California Gas
and Electric Corporation has made
thorough preparation to gain complete
control of the distribution of electricity,
for lighting and power in all the cities
on this side of the bay, as well, as
those in the Sacramento and San Joa
quin valleys.
The Livermore Water and Power
Company furnishes the water supply to
the town of Livermore from its own
plant, but the power used' in lighting
the town is secured from the lines of
the Standard Electric Company. Under
the new management this system will
remain unchanged. The new company
will also continue to supply light and
power to Pleasanton, but as that town
has its own . water supply the change
will make no difference in this respect.
The transfer of this plant to the Cali
fornia Gas and Electric Corporation
was made very ' quietly, and no one
knew that the change had been made
until the representatives of the corpora
tion took charge to-day. The officers of
the new local company are: President,
C. W. Weller; secretary, Eugene J.de
Sabla Jr. Daniel Murphy, who man
aged the affairs of the Livermore
Water and Power Company for Mr.
Dingee, will be retained J as manager by
the present owners of the plant. The
new company Is capitalized at $120,000."
William J. Dingee, the former pro
prietor of the Livermore Water and
Power plant, has disposed of his hold-
Ing on account of ill health. The sale
of the Livermore concern -leaves Mr.
Dingee interested in but one corpora
tion in Alameda County, this being the

The Home Club, which was organ
ized a few months ago and Includes
among its members some of Oakland's
most prominent people, both men and
women, is preparing to move into the
splendid new headquarters recently

is situated on Fourth and Cottage ave
nues and is an imposing two-story
building, containing an auditorium,
with stage, a reception-room, smoking
room, library, banquet hall, kitchen
and dressing-rooms. Trie interior is
handsomely decorated and furnished
and its windows command a splendid
view of Oakland acd the surrounding
hills. It is easily accessible by the
Fourth-avenue cars.
The Home Club, though organized
on the lines of a social club, was found
ed with a purpose, that is, the "better
ment of homes." The thought and
study of the club is to be devoted not
only to the homes of its own members,
but to the homes of all classes and to
every phase of home lifeâ social, ethi
cal, scientific and practical. The offi
cers are:
Mrs. F. II.' Smith, honorary president; Miss
Kthel Mcore. president; Mrs. Henry Wether
bce. lirst vice president; Mr?. Franklin Bangs,
second vice president ; Mrs. W. a. Good fellow,,
third vice president; Mrs. T. o. Coosran. re
conlinr J-Â»frotary; Miss Emma R. Wellman
rcrrey:Â«ivjir~ secretary; Mrs. Q. A. Chase,
treasurer.
At the last meetirfg of the club the
following resolutions were passed:
Whereas, Death has broken our circle and
has taken from us one of our beloved mem
ber*;
' IWnived. That in the passing from this life
of Mrs. \V. F. Kelly the Home Club has loÂ«t
a devoted and faithful member and an earnest
co-workvr in the cause for which we are
Resolved, That in thin time of deep sorrow
we give to the bereaved husband and con our
pmfound sympathy. '
The new clubhouse will be dedicated
at an early date. \

By their work yesterday on the cam
pus the students of the University of
California saved the treasury of the in
stitution a comfortable sum. This is
estimated at $1575, the figures being
based on what the work would have
cost had it been done by private con
tract. The cost for the several paths
constructed has been estimated to be
as follows:
Botany building to College avenue, 50
feet, $275: Hillcgass tract, near bridge,
300 feet, J1S0; Hillegrass tract, near
Hearst Hall, 400 feet, $300; Hillegass
tract, near Bancroft way, 400 feet, $300;

Mantell, the actor, recently. "At the
Inn where I was stopping lived an old
couple who were preparing to visit
the United States. Naturally enough,
they questioned me at some length
about the Urip, and the old gentle
man was anxious to know if it was
very dangerous to cross the ocean. I
assured him that It was not at all
hazardous, although it was often very

THE St. Louis Exposition will afford, great oppor

be appointed to consider the relative merits of applicants
for medals. Supposedly the jurors will give fair hearing,
will bring skilled and impartial observation to their tasks

Now, along with the Russian complaints that England
is in the rumor business, comes the indorsement in the
Russian official newspaper of this piece of French im
pudence, and a rather brazen criticism of our right to
make a commercial treaty with China at all! Americans
would like to know when and how it became obligatory
upon their Government to ask the consent of Russia be
fore making a treaty?.
The Czar has no suzerain rights in China. To secure
such rights was the object of the secret treaty which the
Czar tried to force China to accept under duress. Our
commercial treaty was the conclusion of the policy of the
open door in, China, for which Secretary Hay laid the
foundation three years ago in his identical note to the
European governments. His remarkable foresight es
tablished our .commercial rights in China, and they are'
now securedby the treaty which excites ire in St. Peters
burg.
. The Washington Government has in no particular
been unfriendly to Russia, but has gone to the verge of
international patience with that power in overlooking its
distinct aggressions and Punic faith. No matter what
may be the sympathies of our people, they intend that
their Government shall do no more than maintain its
rights, without military aggression! One need not seek'
far for the , cause of Russian objection to our. Chinese
treaty. It unconsciously discloses the Russian purpose
to make conquest of China. Treaties run with the. terri
tory and are not abrogated by change in its sovereignty.
If China be absorbed by Russia our open door treaty will
block her policy y of closing China to the rest of the
world, in order that she may gnaw the Celestial bone in
peace. \
COMPLAINTS are made in St. -Petersburg that
English reports and rumors are set going to em
broil the United States with the Czar. To this
t:lass it is said belongs the statement that the American
man-of-war Yicksburg did not rescue floating Russian
marines at Chemulpo.
Americans are rather skeptical as, to the Russian com
plaint. The position of our Government is. one thing, and
the sympathy of our people is quite another: No Rus
sian can deny the exceeding patience of our Government
with Russia. When the Czar proposed the secret treaty
with China which foreclosed against the commercial
rignts of the rest of the world in Eastern *\sia, and the
sinister pact was exposed by our Minister to China, St.
Petersburg promptly denied that any such treaty had
been mooted and flatly accused our Minister of lying to
his Government. Subsequently the Chinese Foreign
Otfice disclosed the terms of the proposed treaty, which
were found to be exactly as 'our Minister had. stated
them.
Tlie United States could not accept such conduct on
the part of Russia as a challenge to war, and short of
that there was nothing to be done except show our posi
tion by supporting our Minister. Subsequently we pub
licly negotiated and concluded a commercial treaty with
China. It was' ratified and ratifications were exchanged
between the Chinese Minister in Washington and Secre
tary Hay, and of this our Minister at Peking was noti
fied by cable. .. v
The French press, spiteful in manifesting sympathy
with Russia in order to block the diplomatic game of
Germany, immediately denounced this treaty and-insult
ingly characterized the telegraphic notice of its ratifica
tion as "resemblingr the telephone marriages in vogue in
the United States." This was unfriendly to our Govern
ment and was a gratuitous insult to. our peoplejby.a
slanderous accusation against them.

"A good many years ago the street
railroad companies issued an order
that fares be collected from policemen
when they are not in full uniform,"
cold the old police reporter a few nights
ago, "but it didn't take them very long
to countermand it. The late Sam Alden,
who at that time was detailed for duty
in the City Prison, convinced the man
agers* that It was a poor rule that did
not work both- ways.
"Sam was off duty a few days after
the order had been issued, and decided
to* visit friends residing in the Mission.
He boarded one- of .the old bobtail cars
of the Mission street line, and being in
civilian's- dress was told- by -the driver
to drop his fare in the box. The star
would pot pass him over the road. Sam
contributed his nickel- and took a stand
on- the front pjatform with the' driver.
The car had gone but a few blocks
when a leaky sand Cart pulled in on the
track. The carman sounded the bell for
the cart to pull out, but no attention
was paid to the signal. Aftr ringing the
bell for nearly two blocks and realizing
that the man ahead of him had no in
tention of giving him the right of way,
the now thoroughly exasperated driver,
turning to Alden, exclaimed, 'Mr. Of
ficer, I demand that you arrest, that
man for obstructing this car.'

The Secretary of Agriculture has been criticized, and
indeed denounced, as an unscientific man. But he is a
practical farmer and was a professor of practical agri
culture in a college when appointed to his present posi
tion. His immediate predecessor, Mr. Morton of Ne
braska, was not educated in a laboratory, but he also was
a practical farmer andÂ»niade in the department that or
ganization of the sciences contributory to agriculture,
which has been so largely and so usefully developed and
applied by Mr. Wilson. We are of the opinion that if
civil 'liberty face no greater danger than is. incurred by
the operations of that department, the days of our en
slavement are as remote as tlie fixed stars. '
This work, of plant introduction cannot be done by in
dividuals. ,It involves tours of investigation and dis
covery all over the world, and a knowledge, of botany
and physics that" is not general. The' Agricultural De
partment was capable of introducing the blastophaga
into California to fertilize our Smyrna "figs/ when the
effort of individuals had: failed.. That work of the de
partment enabled California last year to export .680 tons
of dried figs of excellence equal to the imported article.
Then the department found certain varieties of the date
ripening in California farther north than elsewhere in the
world. It started, its expert, Mr. Swingle, upon an in
vestigation of the date palm. Then for the first time our
general public learned from him that there are dates and
dates, the varieties being certainly as numerdus as the
varietiesof peaches. On a far oasis in' the Sahara he
found the deglet noor, the highest type of date.
Turning his attention to California, by patient investi
gation he found that-the Colorado Desert was even bet
ter adapted to this date than its home .on the oasis. Re
visiting the Sahara he procured the plants, packed them
on camels hundreds of miles . across the desert and'
plantedthem. on our desert.. T-heir 'rapid growth veri
fies His conclusions,' and there is presented now the pros
pect that this State will become as celebrated for date
Â¦production as it is in the growth of citrus fruits> and that
in a very few years we will dominate the markets in
oranges, figs and dates. Surely the States cannot do
this work, nor can individuals, and it is the specific work
for which, the old Patent Office was partly designed and
which belongs to the" Department of Agriculture.
If the Federal Government discovered these new and
valuable plants, proved the adaptation of our soil and
climate to their' profitable cultivation, and then itself
monopolized them, as a producer, to, the exclusion of
citizens, it is admitted that it "would be doing something
constitutionally questionable.
/-p\ .HE Colusa Sun Comments upon the criticism, in a
'â¢"I Â¦ Sari Francisco paper, of a proposition that the Ag
.* . .. ricultural Department exert itself to find a stock
food equal to Indian corn, that will grow where corn
:does. not. This ' proposition is made the text for a dis
cpurse, on the departure of the. Federal. Government from
the safe moorings of the constitution^ We are unable to
find a breach made in: the constitution by the.Agricul
tural- .Department. The Federal Government, under, all
admintstraiions, : has considered it. a duty to introduce
hew plant/ in order to. diversify .agriculture and add to
its. profits. ... ' : â¢ ' â¢ â¢
; This. work.. was formerly considered a function of the
Patent (Dmce. before the. Agricultural Bureau of the In
terior. Department was treated as the "germ- of the pres
ent Cabinet Department. The old Patent Office intro
duced orfe plant that proved of vast importance to the
people. A Democratic Patent Commissioner, the late
Gharjes Masqi"), introduced the sorghum sugar cane.- It
flourished as far north as Minnesota. The Patent Office
issued bulletins onÂ» its cultivation, methods of grinding
the cane and of evaporating tfre juice, to, make, a whole
some syrup that was a substitute for molasses; Great
skill in these processes was developed, *and forty- years
.ago, -all through the prairie States, there were evaporat
ing plants to ; which farmers hauled their cane to be manu
factured into syrup. . " . ....-Â¦
During the Civil War, when sugar was high, sorghum
.was of the greatest economic value. Later it was. discov r
ered that the plant, was valuable, fodder for stock, better
than corn stover and an excellent substitute for Kay. Now
it is a standard forage crop on the dr3 r lands of Western
Kansas and Nebraska. Sown thickly, the cane grows
small, with abundant leaves, full of sugar, and;makes a
fattening food. Vet the sorghum never destroyed the Fed
eral constitution when introduced under the administra
tion of Buchanan, and we are entirely unable to see that
liberty is endangered by finding a substitute for Indian
The story of the man Meyers, now
"the" mystery in the Detention Hos

Francisco residents of a similar fake,
if faking it is that Meyers is doing. It
Was in 1S71 that a young woman cre
ated quite a sensation by claiming that
she had lost Her hearing and power of
isp'eech in one* night. . She snieged that
through the shock of an earthquake
during the nighttime this sad happening
was occasioned. The woman was sub
jected to the most critical examination
by/the 'then leading physicians In the
city, including Drs. A. J. Bowie. J. C.
Shorb, H. H. Tqland, James Murphy
and others, 'but all agreed that it was
a mystery beyond their medical ability
to. solve.
So much" interest was manifested' in
the woman's case that the charitably
disposed people showered contributions
into her hands, so that'she soon became
more wealthy than she ever dreamed of
being. The case became so notorious
that Captain Lees," then chief of detec
tives, took a hand in the matter, be
lieving that the public were being im
posed . upon. .He was determined to
sift the woman's story to the Dc-ttom.
Lees and two of his detectives planned
to interview her one .night in her room
on Dupont street, ajid at the same time
concocted a ruse by hiding another de
tective-ln a clothes closet with instruct
tions to explode a detonating cartridge
right behind her at the time that she
was engaged in written conversation
with her p.ad and pencil. The object
of this was that the sudden noise would
cause her to turn her head involun
tarily in the direction of the explosion,
thus showing that her hearing was not
affected. Everything went Just as Lees
had planned, but the woman never
winked an eyebrow when the explosion
took place. .Lees became convinced of
hep muteness and left.
The sequel was that the woman had
been coached by a clever scoundrel
who afterward married her to possess
her money. Then he deserted her and
she confessed the whole scheme.

1 JCafeal singing- comes from one of two
jsburcw. Either because the singer un
[ consclovXBly tightens some muscle or
muscles in the nose, thus restricting
the free passage of air through Jthe
iiasal cavity, or because the student
is the victim of some catarrhal trouble.
This last reason â¢ is really' much less
serious than the other form from a
singer's point of view, for a very .slight
catarrhal Irritation "will often cause
nasal tones, and as soon as this has
beep cured the pupil will be free from
aiiy tendency toward nasal singing. It
is best, however, to find out Just what
the cause is In such a case and to
remedy it as soon as. possible, for the
effect upon the child's musical ear is
the same whatever cause . the trouble
comes from, and the longer Jt is al
lowed to go- on the harder It will be

Â¦The Â¦ stranger, however, will not pore over statistics
when He is inÂ° St. Louis. He will instantly appreciate the
fact that an orange country is delightful. He will see
oranges from Northern, Central and Southern California.
He will inquire to some extent regarding the conditions
under which, they were produced: He will, learn about
the rainfall of the different places that vaunt oranges as
evidence- of their natural advantages. He need not be a
great expert to realize that oranges are sweet, juicy; fair
to look upon, palatable in every res'pect. He will get
literature dealing with orange-growing to a large extent
as representative alike of the north aiid south. Finally
if he is interested in California he will watch to see which
particular locality is awarded the first gold medal for
oranges. ' . - ' â¢ â¢
Counties hundreds .of miles, north of San Francis-eo
and. those, south of Tehachapi will be rivals for the gold
medal distinction. The foothills of the Sierra will ad
vance to the fore with their oranges' and show them
proudb'.. The inland valleys of Central California will
show what can be done in a list of counties. The Sacra
mento Valley is confident. W. D. Nichols, who is in
charge of the. Sacramento Valley fruits, writes to a
prominent orange-grower of Placer County in reference
to oranges ready to be sent to St. Louis, "I am confident
they will carry .off a gold medal." The contest will be
noteworthy and the prizes worth struggling for. .
Hence the significance of the medal test for oranges
that is impending at St. Louis.' For a long term 'of years
Southern California has claimed to have a climate supe
rior to any to be found in Northern or- Central California.
On ttvc other hand the northern and central sections of
the State have called into the. court of public opinion the
evidence supplied by .the official figures of the United
Stages Weather Bureau to prove that the temperatures in
their- neighborhoods are as equable and that the extremes
of heat and cold are not more marked than they are south
of Xehachapi Pass. Red Bluff, for instance, has tjeen
compared with Redlands climatically. Official statistics
covering considerable periods have seemed to fully jus
tify all statements that have been made in. favor of north
ern and central points in general as compared with the
southern sections. ' -V"
delightful place for dwellings. The winner of the gold
medal for oranges will need no better advertisement for
his neighborhood. . "/-,';*

hold yesterday at Ocean View
Congregational Church. Berth meetings
were largely attended and prominent
men of the evangelical churches of the
city attended the deliberations.

what was characterized as a most orig

"The preponderance of opinion favors
the. existence of a subconscious mind.
It is possible that this subconscious

I Judge. Conlan had a difficult case to
I adjudicate yesterday ajid was cbm
| pelled to call in Clerk Jack Rice to act
' as "amicus curiae," but only tempora
; rily. The Judge Is somewhat particular
Â¦ about bis friends. .
I . W. D. Davis wajs arrested for dis
j turbing the quietude, of Mrs. Birdsall,
j who- pins birds on hats Jin the millinery
store she conducts at 26 O'Farrell
street.. She claimed that Davis wan
tonly annoyed her with his. attentions
and, when she ; refused to respond,
grew abusive and noisy.
Davis had another story to tell. He
said that once in -the dim and moth
eaten past he- was all the world and
the waters that are under the world to
Mrs. Birdsall. During that distant pe
riod, he said, Mrs. . Birdsall ' equipped
herself with copious wads of coin that
tie had earned by hard graft. In the
capacity of a collector, he claimed, he
called on the woman. When she re
fused to blow through with some coin
he admitted to using some terms not
admitted in expurgated editions.
"Back to the mines witn you," said
the Judge, after Davis delivered his
tale.- "Bundle up another roll and come
j-to a metropolis once more. You may
have to seek a Superior Court to be di
vorced from aÂ«vife, but you can be di
vorced from your money by most any
body. Come again."

.One of the littlest of them, aged 11
years and named Raymond, was view
ing the bulletins of the Corbett-SulH
van fight Monday night. Some one in
the crowd objected to the flashes, and
another man hit him a hard rap and
followed with an upper cut.
The boy tried to see the mix-up, but
Captain Duke was patrolling the dis
trict.- With wonderful acrobatic ef
fort he managed to secure the custody
of Raymond Green, but the fighters
escaped. .
When the boy was taken to the City
Prison and told his name a telephone
was sent to Captain Duke. "Lock him
up, anyway," said the gallant captain.
For several hours the boy was obliged
to remain in Jail until proper in
fluences were brought to bear.
In -Judge Conlan's court yesterday
Raymond Green was booked . for the
Juvenile court, but' after the Judge
heard the facts the boy was promptly
dismissed. . *

W. J. Cameron, ths terror of Point
Lobos avenue, is sadly .wanted In Judge
C6nlan*s court. Once he ruthlessly
frightened the babies and nurees at
the Children's" Hospital by peering
through the windows with . a loaded
revolver clasped tightly in each mitt.
At that time he pleaded that he had
been burglarized shortly before and was
given a slight fine.
Since then he has been blazing, away
v.-ith bis. guns every time the fog blew
through the Golden Gate and the
sparse inhabitants out that ..way be
came afraid to let their children play
in the sand lest. a stray bulhjt -might
puncture, them. The kids were, getting
anemic fr.om indoor .life until the po
lice were called "in. .
To Judge Fritz yesterday the woman
admitted that she was in a high state
of exhilaration due to the wine she had
drunk-, but she had a tale of woe to
tell about her father. She said he was
drunk, every night and that he sadly
abused her. The foray she made, -so
she- claimed, was prompted by the
countless efforts of her father .to ruin
her temperance place In favor of his
own. The charg'e of disturbing the
peace preferred against, the woman
was taken under advisement. . 'â-.':
There Is war in Temperance Town.
Delia Edelwards conducts an emporium
for soft drinks at .216 Pacific street,
which is widely patronized by soldiers
and sailors visiting that thoroughfare
after they have partaken of the fierce
booze that is ladled out farther up the
line. A temperance place .is an oasis
on the desert of Pacific' etreet to the
weary traveler.
Farther up the street and two blocks
away the father of Miss Kdelwafds is
proprietor of a .similar establishment,
where sprout the early oyster cocktails
and the seductive' milkshake, but the
trail of. strong drink is not over the
joint. Jt is strictly a temperance place
and the reformers proudly point to its
business success when they tour the
Barbary Coast.
Monday night Miss Edelwards went
to an Italian dinner and -absorbed more
purple paint than cc-uld a coiander
made of pponges. â¢ Then she went On
a visit to the glistening temperance
place of her father and threw every
thing but the fiaar out Into. the street.
Policeman Joy heard the commotion
and peeked into the orderly -place. The
soda fountain narrowly grazed him on
its outward flight. Then he arrested
Miss Edelwards.
It appeared from the testimony that
the Simpson girl, whose parents re
side at Paso Robles, has committed
bigamy, because, she claimed, she
married; formerly a man named Mil
ler, from whom she has not been di
vorced. The Dobbins girl comes from
Watsonviile and both have been fre
quenters of the Barbary Coast for the
last few weeks. Policeman Nelson
picked them up because of their ap
pearance of youth and innocence.

Monday wedded a plumber named
William. T. Eichler. who has a shop

performed by Rev. Dr. Stephens. The
other girl is named Edna Dobbins and
she is merely arrested on a charge of
vagrancy. .

Quite Â¦ a number of '- changes have
been" noticed; in the method of draw
ing bills in Congress. Measures which
are intended to become a law now con
tain shorter sentences, and 'wherever
possible commas - and semicolons are
omitted- and periods- used instead.
This is for, the purpose of making it
easier^ to V interpret a law and- avoid
mistakes. Several times questions have
arisen ' whether a comma or semi
colon was in the right place. In some
instances it has.' been; found that;th*e
misplacing of a comma in the law has
changed the entire meaning of the sec
tion "and - rendered { the act nugatory/
If the laws that are enacted could be
Btrippedjof the verbiage v and- much of

Win Tvvo Games Out of Three and
Incidentally the Championship
of the Coast.
The Central bowling team took the
renowned stars of the California
bowlers into camp last night and inci
dentally won the coast championship.
The Centrals took two . out of three
games, defeating their opponents by
124 pins in the series. It should really
have been three of a kind for the
Centrals, aa they only lost the odd
game by four pins. The boys were so
jubilant over , the easy game of the
Californiaa that they blew a few
spares.
The odd game, however, -was a con
solation-for the defeated ones. It
would have been too bad. after
telling their friends how they would
take three straight, to have to walk
back to their home alleys without get
ting a game. The score:

was called a practice game, but it af
forded all the excitement of a regular
set contest. The periods were of twen
ty minutes duration and they : were
played with frequent and random
changes of ponies. This afforded an
exhibition of lightning change equal to
the old-time pony express. . Players
would quit the field at pleasure for
this purpose and get back in the scrim
mage as fast as they might. - ,';y
Some of the players also shifted sides
and others did alternate stunts that
each might have a go at the fascinat
ing sport. Messrs. Haig and Carolan
for the Reds and Walter Hobart for
the Whites did not change sides nor
miss a period. . .:**v-;
. In tha first period the Reds were:

drawing the" choicest position in the
ring, but his. familfar figure was miss-
Ing ' yesterday and Monday. Coupled
"yrtth his disappearance is a story of his
Â¦infatuation for a pretty member of the
original Florodora Sextet, who seemed
'ta have completely turned his head.
The sensation In racing circles yes
<erday '-was the reported disappearance
of Caesar Young, who has been mak
ing the heaviest -book at the track this
season.'
Britt favors a clean" break in their
fight, although he feels he has nothing
to learn from Corbett at infighting.
Britt settled down at Alameda yes
terday to. commence training for the
fight. His training staff -will include
Spider Kelly. Frank Rafael, and Sam
Berger. . He will reduce his weight
systematically and does not expect to
reach the 130-pound notch { until the
day of . the fight He is sure of his
ability to weigh In with all his natural
strength, as he tested his weight last
year when he was training at Lark
epur.
Corbett stock was booming and
there was Fome wagering which made
him a 6 to 10 choice' over Britt. These
seem false odds, but there are many
good judges of prices who think the
bulk of the wagering will be at these
figures, C- ":-;
These figures are surprising in view
of the fact that in all his fights Britt
has been favorite. It is interesting: to
hear the arguments as to why Cor
bett will be so pronounced a favorite
over the Californian. At Corbett's
quarters many reasons are advanced.
Corbett has had more ring experience,
having engaged, in sixty-seven battles
to. Britt's seven important ones. He
is to fight at a natural weight, while
Britt must of necessity have some dif
ficulty in cutting three pounds off his
normal fighting weight and still enter
the ring strong. Corbett was confi
dent he could defeat Sullivan and
fought in that spirit. He has the same
feeling in regard to Britt.
As an evidence of this he offered to
bet 51000 against $3000 yesterday that
Britt will not respond to the bell in
the thirteenth round.
Corbett's fighting on Monday night
was a revelation to . those who have
seen him in other battles. He seemed
to change his style completely, show
ing what a master he Is of the art of
fighting. From the hurricane finish
he put up in the eleventh round it
seemed he had not been trying his
hardest to stop Sullivan up to that
period. .
Corbett professes to have no fear of
Britt's left-hand punch to the body,
with which he has Ijeaten down so
many of his opponents. He also scoffs
at Britt having a terrible right, basing
hi? Ideas onM.he early stages of Britt's
fight with Canole.
If Carbett is confldent.Britt is equal
ly so. He says if Corbett thinks he
will stand up like Sullivan and take a
beating he will be greatly surprised.
The Young Corbett-Sullivan fight
has had a magical effect on the Cor
bett-Britt engagement, which is set
for the 25th of thik months It seemed
the principal topic of conversation in
the Pavilion on Monday* night and
gained appreciably in volume yester

There was such a businesslike play on
Johnny Schorr's Olympian to win the
Futurity course number, third to be de
cided, that the price about Leader
lengthened from 1 to 2 to 13 to 20. The
Jennings horse looked a legitimate 1 to
3 chance, and after getting away last
won pulling up. Olympian swerved bad
ly in the stretch, losing the place to
Examiner, a newcomer in the commu
nity. .
Possart, the 2 to 1 choice, had a close
call from defeat in the seven-furlong
selling affair. Flaneur, which- ran a
mild race on the preceding day,
skimmed away .in front, and it looked
all over but the shouting. For an old
cripple Possart stood a long, severe
drive, though, getting the decision over
the McCafferty entry by a nose. Mon
tana Peeress took the show honors from
Young Morello.
A six-furlong selling event concluded
the racing, which went to Et Tu Brute,
the favorite. The Brutus gelding had
Johnny Daly on his back and led from
start to finish. Scherzo finished second,
two and a half lengths ahead of George
Berry.
Jack Martin piloted the winners
Light of Day and Leader.
Trainer Charley Patterson has pur
chased Cascine and a couple of two
year-olds of the Burns & Waterhouse
string. The racing firm will dispose
of the balance of their horses in train
ing at Oakland track on the loth inst.
Et Tu Brute, winner of the last race,
was bid up to $700 by Harry Robin
son. J. Zalinsky then carried the price
to $1000, securing the three-year-old.
J. J. Moran, owner of the gelding,
was not there to protect him and there
is a likelihood that he .will get his
horse back to-day.

Jerry Roach rode Fair Lady Anna,
favorite for the opening flve-furlong
scramble, as if she were a high-class
stake animal and any time would do
to make his move. Finally in the
seretch turn, when he discovered
Travers astride Alice Carey in sight,
Jerry sat down to ride, only to be
beaten out less than a length by the
latter mare. Benlash, a 25 to 1 shot,
finished third.
Cardinal Sarto ruled favorite for
the two-year-old sprint, and Johnny
Daly has either forgoten how to ride
or else the youngster is a poor piece
of racing bric-a-brac. The Summers'
entry went to the post favorite, and
after Johnny Daly had let him swerve
all over the track in the stretch he
brought up third. Light of Day, a 6
to 1 chance, with Jack Martin on her
back, finished first, with Velna, a 25
to 1 shot, ridden by See, a good sec
ond. Bullman, on Inspector Halpin,
went over and beat the . gate, then
finishing fourth.
r LEADER WINS HANDILY.
Lady Wads worth, the favorite, cut
a sorry figure in the race, losing the
show to Carilee. Not many tickets
were disposed of by the books on the
winner, Dell Fountain, the Idaho turf
man, being among the few who back
ed him.
While the fields lacked class, they
were fairly well balanced, furnishing
some good betting propositions. Three
purses went to first choices.
' Ridden by J. T. Sheehan and quoted
at 20 to 1 in the betting on the mile
selling number, the ancient piece of
hardware went away in the lead and
though a trifle unsteady the last
eighth of the journey, led Elmer L
by the judges nearly two lengths.
FAVORITE IS THIRD.
The ailments of the Prince are mul
tifarious and it would take a veterin
ary 6%rgeon a week and a half to
make a complete diagnosis of his case.
Once in a great while the track will
permit of his extending himself. Yes
terday the going was heavy and slow,
with no hardpan to jar the ringbones,
rheumatic joints and splints of the
Prince and he did on old time turn.
The unexpected as well as unsus
pected was furnished at Oakland yes
terday by old Prince Blazes, one of
the remnants of the once mighty
string: of Plunger Emil H|erz. The lat
ter is in Europe now endeavoring to

The main question of the jurisdiction
of the board to act off the State prop
erty has not reached the courts. Until
it does Commissioner Spear sees no
way for the five firms named to get
their permits back.
There are now no complaints before
the Harbor Commissioners against any
dealer in perishable products. The two
persons that made affidavit against the
wholesale dealers in reference to their
refusal to sell to them, Nick Fundas
and J. E. Graves, have gone out of
business. Other witnesses may appear.
Commissioner Spear says that he thinks
there will t>e other complaints.
Attorney J. B. ' Reinstein,; for the
wholesale dealers, said yesterday aft
ernoon that the Harbor Commission
era were without jurisdiction in the
five cases that are now of especial in
terest. The only allegations concern-
Ing them that were in the affidavits
were that the parties refused to sell
in their places of business, i none of
which is on the property of the State.
The wholesalers^ claim that the Com
missioners have no jurisdiction off the
State's property.
The five, so Commissioner Spear says,
were given notice of the particular of
fense that was charged against them.
With the notice . to appear there was
sent to each a copy of the complaint
applicable. Each of the parties com
plained against made answer. Then
the Commissioners held a hearing and
as the result of that hearing revoked
the selling permits of the five firms.
Reasoning along these lines, Commis
sioner Spear declares that Mitchell &
Goodall, L. G. Sresovitch & Co., Garcia
& Magini, J. Ivancovich & Co. and G.
Berti & Co. are found to have been de
prived of their permits in just such a
proceeding as the decision of Judge
Sloss requires.
The Board of State Harbor Commis
sioners conferred yesterday about the
general local situation under the Wood
ward law, the previsions of which re
late to discrimination in selling perish
able products on the State's wharves
or other State property In this city. "
There are five firms whose permits
to sell on the State property have been
revoked, in addition to the four cases
Involved in the decision handed down
on Monday by Judge Sloss. These five
have brought no injunction suits. Com
missioner Spear says that the proceed
ings in the case of the five were ac
cording to the rules that Judge Sloss
laid down in his decision.
The general law provides in section 110 of
the Code of Civil Procedure that "the term of
office of Justices of the Peace shall be four
years from and after 12 o'clock noon on the
first Monday after the first day of January
n*>xt yucceedlng an election." / .
"More accurately speaking, they, as well aa
County Justices, form part of the judicial sys
tem of the State; and both come equally with
in the provisions of section 2. article 6. of
the constitution, which authorizes the Legisla
ture to ' "determine the number of Justices of
the Peace to be elected to townships, incor
porated cities and towns, or cities ond coun
ties.' and to fix "by law their powers, duties
and responsibilities.' Under this provision the
Legislature has power to fix the terms of Jus
tices oi the Peace generally."
It thus being the law that a freeholder's
charter cannot create Justices of the Peace,
nor fix the powers, duties and responsibilities
of Justices of the Peace, and that Justices of
the Peuce are Judicial officers and part of the
Judicial system of the State, the general law
should prevail and not the charter when It
comes to consider the term of offlce of Justices
of the Peace of the city and county of San
Francisco.
. It is well settled by the decisions of the Su
preme Court in this State that a freeholder's
charter cannot fix the powers and duties or re
sponsibilities of Justices of the Peace. (Peo
ple vs. Teal. 85 Cal. 3.13; Mllner vs. Iteiben
ptein. &5 Cal. 593; People vÂ». Sand?. 102 Cal.
12; Ex pane Ileilly. 33 Cal. Â«.Â¦$Â«; Ex parte
Giovannlnl. 117 Cal. 573.) It has also been
held that Justices of the Peace are not county
officers. (Kahn vs. Sutro. 114 Cal. 316.)
In speaking of city Justices of the Peace,
the Supreme Court, in People vs. Cobb, 132
Cal. 170. said:
I am in receipt of your communication un
der date of February 19. In which you request
an opinion as to the law covering the election
of Justices of tho Peace and asking whether
your department should follow the charter or
the general law of the State of California.
City Attorney Long yesterday . filed
an opinion with the Department of
Elections, in which he rules that there
are to be no Justices of the Peace
elected at the next general election in
November. Long says that in his opin
ion the Justices elected at the last gen
eral election hold until the first Mon
day in January, 1907. The opinion says:
"The Bay Cities Water Company,"
continues Grunsky in his report,
"claims to be able to supply this city
with 62,000,000 gallons of water daily.
The litigation now pending and to be
instituted would lessen that amount
appreciably and diminish the reliability
of the proposed supply. The water
which the company could bring to this
city would have to be filtered, and
would differ In that respect from the
water from the Sierras, which would be
of the purest quality, as already deter
mined by chemical analyses.
"The offer of the Bay Cities Water
Company is vajue and indefinite, and
it does not state specifically what the
company desires to convey to the city.
We do not know whether the company
wants to sell to the city so many mil
lions of gallons of water daily at so
much per gallon, or sell Its water rights
alone or sell its plant for a stated sum."
In his report Grunsky presents fig
ures on the seasonal rainfalls on the
watersheds along the routes of the Isa
bel, San Felipe, Guadaloupe and other
streams from which the /company in
tends to take water. He refers to the
litigation that is now pending against
the Bay Cities Water Company to re
strain it from diverging the water to
its own uses, which will materially
lessen the supply which the company
claims it can furnish.
Grunsky also states it would be neces
sary for the company to drain the
waters of Calaveras Creek to carry out
its offer, and as the Spring Valley
Water Company has already acquired
certain riparian rights on the creek
named Grunsky declares that the lat
ter company would certainly resist any
attempt on the part of the Bay Cities
Company to divert the waters of the
creek.
City Engineer Grunsky yesterday
filed a report in relation to the offer of
the Bay Cities Water Company recently
made to the Board of Supervisors to
furnish an adequate supply of water
to this city from the Coyote Creek and
its tributaries. Grunsky analyzes Ihe
offer of the company in a lengthy type
written document, and concludes that
the offer is not reliable, in that the
company will be unable to furnish 60,
000.000 gallons of water daily,, which
quantity represents the prospective
needs of San Francisco in the very
near future and the amount the com
pany claims it can supply.
Grunsky reiterates his former recom
mendation Â¦ that the source of water
supply for this city should be in the
Sierras, and after an exhaustive in
quiry into all the details of the ability
of the Bay Cities Water Company to
furnish an adequate water supply
Grunsky sees no reason to change his
former recommendation.
â¢ ThÂ« attention of the Civil Service
Commission was called yesterday to
the Tact that the Board of Election
-Commissioners had j?iit twenty men to
-work at tfie election booth, warehouse
: to the exclusion of th-e- laborers on the
civil service eligible list.
.Â¦â¢Secretary Mora-n 'stated that Â¦ the
icomrhlssion' was unaware of the action
'taken .by- the. Election Commissioners,
Â¦but .asserted that there is a list" of 3000
Tfigislered. laborers at the office of the
Â¦â¢Civll> Service .Commission-, from which
Â¦Â¦tHe twenty men put to work by the
â¢.Election Commission should have been
;d'raw:n.
;Â¦-â¢Â¦ "Registrar Adams explained that the
jri^en 'employed were "warehousemen,"
_\\hose .duties consisted of moving a
lot -of lumber from the street into the
yariehouse. j Adams said the men were
appointed as a matter of urgency, as
the. lumber had to be housed at o.nce.
â¢ "The men employed are 'warehouse
men', and not 'laborers,'" said Adams,
'Â¦axvi 'will have work for. one ' or two.
veekf. I am unaware that they should
Â¦have.'been tarken from the registered
civil service list. of. laborers, .but I
kiK>\t. that they Had to be employed
right away." " .' Â¦ â¢ \
Meanwhile' the Civil Service Com
mission -may investigate the -apparent
violation Â£>f the civjl service regula
tions of the municipality under section
.5, article 13 of the municipal charter
oA**CSvU Service,!' which provides as
follows :â¢â¢ Â¦ . . .
' : '. '.'Tho selection of laborers shall be
; governed â¢ by priority .of- application
only,""
Â¦:'Â¦ As there are 3000 laborers that have
registered at the office .of' the Civil
: Service. Commission it 'would" appear
.that- any employed by the city depart
merits >hould be taken from- this list.
In explaining his reasons for signing
the demands after having held them up
for fifty days Auditor Baehr stated that
he did not audit them because he be
lic-yed the spirit, if not the letter, of the
civil service had been violated. After
Inquiring . into the matter Baehr
changed his mind, but still withheld
payment because he was given to un
derstand that suit would be brought to
restrain him from auditing the war
rants for the purpose .of determining
if ths civil service law had been vio
lated in the removal of tho secretary of
the board and four assistant sanitary
inspectors. >^.'.; '. -
â¢"I also believe," said Baehr, '"that I
am fortified in my course by the recent
decision. of Superior Judge Hebbard in
the case of one Calegaris, to the,effect
that the man who does the work for the
city is entitled to the salary. . I have
been threatened with suits to restrain
me from paying the twelve demands,
and I gave the Merchants* Association
or any private citizen ample time to
begin action. The action has been de
layed for some reason or other. Why,
the papers served on me contained the
word 'January,' which was changed, to
'March 1," showing that action was to
have heen commenced long ago, but
Mas deferred, with the probable inten
tion of using me to prevent these men
who earned their money from receiving
it. I "grew tired of the delay and signed
the demands. Now the suit has been
brought and the controversy will be
settled. I hope."
Before 9 o'clock the twelve employes
ha<I cashed their demands, for which
they had waited for nearly two months.
The injunction served on Auditor
Baehr, however, only applies to Levy,
Goodale, Jackson, Glover and Walsh,
as they displaced civil service men who
were appointed by the old Board of
Health. " -;
[ Auditor Baehr early yesterday morn
ing audited the January and February
salary demands of the twelve employes
of the Health Board, the payment of
which had been withheld ever since
they were a-ppointed on January 9 last.
The following named received their de
mands from Baehr shortly after 8:30 a.
m., at which time, his office i3 opened
daily: Louis Levy, deputy health of
ficer; D-rs. G. W. Goodale, Walter Jack-
Eon, C. A. Glover and M. J. Walsh, in
specting phye-cians; Drs. J. F. Dillon,
A. L. 'Adler and Frank Tillman, dis
trict health officers; Henry Miller and
James Rea'ny, factory inspectors; B. P.
Ehrlick, receiving secretary City Hos
pital, and A. M. Currle. assistant su
perintendent Almshouse.

Thp attorneys for the plaintiff are
Franklin K. Lane, "Wright & .Wright
and former Judge Charles W. Slack.
" +Â¦Â¦-Â¦â. Â¦ . .....
BAK1IR AUDITS DKMANDS.
The court is asked to enjoin the Au
ditor and the Treasurer from paying
the salaries of the new officials, on the
ground that they entail a useless, un
necessary and illegal expense to the
city.
The ousted officials were regularly
certified civil service appointees. They
had served beyond the probationary pe
riod and had been given permanent
appointments by the Civil Service Com
missioners. "Their removal," the com
plaint of yesterday recites, "was ac
complished under the guise, cloak and
color of abolishing the offices and was
the result of a conspiracy formed by
the Board of Health. The abolition
is a violation of the provisions of the
charter, a pretext, a subterfuge and a
sham."
The Association of Civil Service Em
ployes of the City and County of San
Francisco, through John E. Quinn, one
of its members, commenced injunction
proceedings yesterday against Auditor
Harry Baehr and Treasurer John E.
McDougald for the purpose of testing
the validity of the action of the Board
of Health In abolishing the offices of
secretary, assistant secretary and clerk
of Â£he board and of sanitary inspectors
âall civil service placesâ and creating
the offices of deputy health officer and
inspecting physicians. The claim is
advanced by the plaintiff that the
board's action is a violation of the
clfarter provision establishing civil ser
vice. The action will come up for trial
on the 5th inst.. Judge Seawell having
issued temporary injunctions returna
ble before him on that date, restrain
ing Baehr from auditing and McDou-
Kald from cashing the salary demands
of the new appointees.
The men affected by the injunction
are Deputy Health Officer Louis I.evy
and Inspecting Physicians Goodale,
Jackson, Glover and "Walsh. Those dis
placed are J. A. Emery, secretary of
the Board of Health; J. W. Cannon,
assistant secretary, and F. J. Stanton,
clerk of the board, and Sanitary In
spectors Dr. R. E. Hartley, Jonathan
Green and Dr. H. L. Curtis.

Â¦The rate of insurance on the Norwe
gian bark Theodor was advanced yes
terday to 60 per cent. In spite of the
high rate, however, conservative ship
ping people do not believe that the ves
sel has been lost. She left Rotterdam
April 9, 1903, for this port. She put into
Montevideo August 11, and September
21 resumed her voyage to San Fran
cisco. She has not been heard from
since and is now out 166 days from
Montevideo.
Although heavy stQrms have been
reported in the waters through which
lay the Theodor's course, she was well
able to take care of herself in any
kind of weather. A stout ship, well
manned and in charge of careful navi
gators, it is considered more than likely
that, finding the passage afoiind the
Horn impossible. her ( captain changed
his course and is corning here by the
longer, but less blustery way of -the
Cape of Good Hope.
The other overdues are quoted as
follows: Robert Rickmers, 30 per cent;
"W. F. Babcock, 15 per cent, and Gen
eral Mellinet, 15 per cent.

Improvements and innovations intro
duced in the City Emergency Hospitals
by Chief Surgeon George. F. Brackett
Â¦wlthinVthe last few weeks have placed
these' most important institutions on a
thoroughly modern basis and have
greatly improved their efficiency.
Yesterday morning all of the attaches
of the hospitals appeared for duty in
white duck uniforms, the insignia of
the office of each being neatly embroid
ered on' the military collar of the ser
vice coat. The purpose of this inno
vation is to prevent confusion and clas
sify the employes, that strangers and
patients may. know whom they are ad
dressing when at the hospitals.
: An important order is to. the effect
that all attaches of the various Emer
gency Hospitals shall be vaccinated im
mediately, as smallpox is sometimes
brought <4o the hospitals by patients,
the nature of whose illness is not im
mediately de terminable* >'- :
'â¢ Idlers and persons possessed of mor
bid curiosity are now forbidden to en
ter the hospitals. Outside physicians,
who sometimes volunteer their assist
ance and" advice in the treatment of
patients, will henceforth retain their
advice unless the same is solicited by
.the surgeon on duty. Dr. Brackett says
that hereafter all responsibility for the
treatment of persons brought into the
hospitals shall rest with the regularly
appointed physicians. * Â¦_:.'"':
A change of attending surgeons will
be made throughout the hospitals from
time to time, .that those on duty at out
side stations may become more con
versant with the importance of the
work at the Central Emergency Hos
pital, where all of the capital opera
tions are performed. %}^l'

CHICAGO. March 1. â Throughout the ses
sion the sentiment In the wheat pit was ex
tremely bearish and there was constant gtn
eral liquidation. Lower prices' In all foreign
grain markets caused a weak opening. May
bfjran %c to lc lower at $1 00 to ?l U0!4, and
July down %<Â§ T*c to lti@l%c at 93c to 93VjC.
Unmistakable evidence was given at the start
that general sentiment had for the time being
completely chanced from the recent remark
able bulllshnc-dg. Lont; wheat bought under
the belief that the war" would be sure to
spread was for sale in large quantities. There
was also an cnlarsred movement of wheat to
ward western accumulating centers that did
much to throw doubt on the. reported smalt
ness of the farmers' reserves. . On this view
of the situation all of the Â¦ large commission
houses had wheat for sale and the Northwest
was also a liberal seller here. Very little
pupport was offered until May had declined to
09c and July to 92%e.- A scattered demand
from ehorts and buying, of July by the insti
gators of . the. discarded May - deal caused
some recovery,. May rallying to 90%c and July
to iWVie. A decrease of nearly three: million
bushels In the world's, visible , stocks had a
steadying Influence for a time. During the
last half-hour of- trading, however, heavy
selling ncnin set in and the- market became
violent. May dropped to Â»6%c, a decline of
four cents from the high point for the day.
July fell 2c to 01 %c. A slight recovery fol
lowed on buyinc by shorts, but the close was
weak, with May at O7*4c July closed at 91%c.
Corn declined with wheat, the market being
without support. May cloned with ja. loss of.
2c and July was lT&c to 2c lower at 53Uc. Â¦
There was a severe break In .'oats. % May
closed 2 3iify2%c lower at 42c and July 2Hc
lower nt SO^c.
Liquidation In hoc products was on a scale
similar to that In â¢ the rraln markets. 'Prices
In all lists showed sharp losses. May pork,
however, was especially weak and declined
87%c for the day. '..The weakness In grains
and the lower prices for hces at the yards
were the bear factors. The close wan-prac
tically' at the bottom, with â¢ May pork S7',4c

Monday's steadiness in Butter Â»as not
maintained yesterday, as the expected orders

j Quotations were no l'iwt r, but the feeling was
; weak again, as stocks are very heavy and the

Â¦ uk.cts the market can hardly hold its own.
: The demoralization in Cheese continues and
i holders are still making liberal concessions to
work off their enormoua holdings, but without
much success. Supplies are heavy all over
the. coast, and nobody wants any Cheese from
1 this market. On the contrary, the other mar

this.

' and the few boxes sent off here and there

Condition of the Bourses.
Southern California. âClear, warm weather
prevailed 4nrinr -the first of the week" "and
crops. inade good, growth. Heavy fogs along
the coast were frequent and very- beneficial.
Rain at the close of th.e week, in some places
amounting to over one Inch will greatly im
prove the conditions cf the soil, as well as
early, sown crass and orchards. Grain is
lookinc very well in most sections and it is
probable that a fair Crop will be raided.
Plowius and seeding, are in progress in some
places. Pasturaee is steadily improving, and
â¢ffl soon be plentiful. Early potato planting
has commenced in the. vicinity of Anaheim.
Orchards are In excellent condition.
Los Angeies. Summary. â Wanner week, with
rain Saturday, caused vegetation to moke good
gTowth. Feed is plentiful in some places, but
Some *ay that heavy, rains are still needed.
Deciduous trees are leafing: peaches and .al
monds .are blooming in places.
Eureka Summary. â Continuous rains and
inoderaiely low temperatures hard on stock;
some losses of sheer' and lambs. Pome plow
ing on hieh level*, but bottom lands are too
wot for cultivation.
Sao Joaquin Valley. â Cloudy, warm weather
with lirht showers prevailed during the fore
rart of the .weak, and fairly heavy rain and
cooler weather the latter. The rain in the
latter cart, of the week . was the heaviest of
the .season. These conditions have been most
favorable for all crops, and the grcund is in
excellent . condition, except' In the extreme
northern portion of the valley, where the low
lands and Islands are flooded. Up to the pres
ent time but little damage has been reported.
and the effect of the high water on the crops
la aa yet unknown. Grain and green feed are
making rapid growth.- The grain acreage in
the central- and southern portions is light.
Stock is" improving and green feed will Boon
be plentiful. Almonds and some plums ai;
.In bloom, and other deciduous buds are swell
ing. ' : . â¢
ued darirg the week and rain fell nearly every
day.. Riveâ¢ and creek* overflowed their
banks, flooding the lowlands and causing great
carr.ase tq crops and railroad property. The
Yuba River at Morysvtlle was reported the
highest ever known. The damage to the grain
crcÂ£> cannot yet be estimated, but as many
thousand acres were flooded the loss will prob
ably be heavy. Ail farm work ha* been sus
pended and cannot be resumed for some time.
On ' thÂ» lands not yet reached by the floods
groin looks strong and healthy and is making
excellent growth. Gross Is growing rapidly
and pasturage Is abundant. Orchards and
vineyards are in good condition. Almonds and
apricot* rive indications of a large yield.
Coast and Bay Sections. â ThÂ« weather dur
lc: the week was warm and favorable for
crops. The rainfall extended to oil sections,
varying from about one Inch in the southern
district* to nearly five Inches at Healdsburg.
CroÂ£> prospects in the southern section were
greatly Improved by the rain, and grain and
erass axe now "making good growth. Crops In
the central and northern sections art In ex
cellent condition, no material damage having
been dene by the heavy rains, and at present
the outlook is good for heavy yields of grain,
hay and hops. Farm and orchard work have
been temporarily suspended, but good progress
had been made before . the rains. Orchards
and vineyards are doing well and give prom
ise of large crops. Almonds are in full bloom

NEW YORK. March 1. â The movement of
to-day's stock market was somewhat more
consistent than fhat of yesterday in that
prices were above yesterday's level through
out the day, but the character of the market
was not essentially changed. Tradintr was
near the minimum record for the last four
years, and the movement of prices was so
narrow and slneslfh an to be imperceptible.
There were minutes at * time when the
ticker was silent and motionless. The fact
that prices moved upward had no news" to
account for it. The news, in -fact, ottered
various unfavorable- features. The fact that
these unfavorable news factors failed to de
press prices was the subtle reason for the ad
vance. That is to say, traders short of stocks
who had been awaiting a decline on bad news
to cover their contracts, uneasy at the fail
ure to decline, covered their shorts and lifted
prices. The uncertainty over the outcome of
the Paris settlement seems to have been a
Urge influence. in a negative -way In our mar
ket. The progress of the settlement to-day
and report* that an arrangement had been
made to patch us . threatened difficulties in
connection with it relieved the stock market
from some of ita depression and conduced to
the rally. Sugar was the . strongest Btock.
The returns of clearings- for January, which
appeared during the day, included Canadian
Pacific and Southern, all showing declinfs in
net earnings of varying decree compared with
last year's corresponding period. -Rock Inland
and Canadian Pacific showed some heaviness
early 'In the day. but stocks of other compa
nies advanced with the rest of the market.

Edwin V. Morgan of -New York, the
newly appointed United States Con
sul to Dalny, has arrived in this city
and is staying at the Palace Hotel.
His trip, westward was made leisurely
in view of the fact that the Russian
Government, which leases the port of
Dalny from the Chinese Government,
has not signified to this country its
willingness to.recognize its represen
tatives, for reasons which it has yet to
explain to Secretary Hay.
It was originally intended that Con
sul Morgan. should leave here for the
Orient on the steamer China, which
sailed four days ago.'and his failure to
arrive in time to embark caused'con
siderable speculation, but it now ap
pears that while en route to this city
he received instructions to delay his
leavetaking until further advices from
Washington and it is probable that he
will remain here for some time.
Consul Morgan does not regard
Russia's action in his case as an evi
dence of hostile feeling, but rather in
the light of a precautionary measure,
in view of the fact that Port Arthur is
threatened with a siege and under
those conditions Dalny would be a
possible sufferer from. a food famine.
New Representative to Dalny Will Not
Depart to Orient Until Russia
Signifies Willingness.

Professor Bendix married twice, his
second wife, who, survives him, being
the accomplished Miss Ellen Gunn of
Kansas City, Mo., who had been one of
his pupils at Boston. Soon after their
marriage, which occurred ten years
ago, they came to San Francisco, where
his wife aided Professor Bendix greatly
In his professional work. Three years
ago they opened the California Con
servatory in the large house at 1329 Sut
ter street. It proved a great success
from the start and its pupils have been
numbered by the hundred.
Professor Bendix had a host of friends
among all classes of San Franciscans,
to whom the news of his death will
come as a shock. He was.a member of
many clubs and. musical organizations.
His last afternoon was spent in com
pany, with Harold Bauer. The two great
pianists had played to and with each
other, and Bendix returned home say
ing how much he had enjoyed the day.
In the evening he and: Mrs. Bendix*ac
companied Nathan Landsberger and
his wife to the Tivoll. Almost his last
words were, "What a happy day I have
had." ,
Otto Bendix-, eroprietor of the Cali
fornia Conservatory of Music and one
of the best known pianists and music
teachers in America, died suddenly at
his home, 1329 Sutter street, shortly be
fore 6 o'clock yesterday morning. He
had spent Monday afternoon and even-
Ing with friends, who found him in
high .spirits and . apparently perfect
health. Shortly after retiring for the
night he became seriously ill, and his
death followed in spite of all that could
be done for him. His physicians believe
death was due to heart failure, but an
autopsy'wlll be held.
Professor Bendix was a native of Co
penhagen, Denmark, where he was born
about fifty-three years ago. His father,
a prominent merchant, was a talented
amateur musician, and at his house
the royal orchestra was accustomed to
meet for rehearsals. Thus the lad grew
up in a musical atmosphere, and before
he had reached his tenth year was
playing*the piano with the orchestra.
From that time he devoted himself
to preparation for a musical career,
studying rtrst at the Danish capital un
der the celebrated Antbine Ree, later
at Berlin with divers masters and final
ly at Weimar under the supervision and
instruction of the great Liszt. His first
public appearances as a soloist were
made at Weimar, with the Grand Duke
as a patron of the concerts. '
Thus completing his studies, he re
turned to Copenhagen and was at once
installed as a teacher in the National
Conservatory, where he spent the next
thirteen years. In 1S80 he determined to
settle in America. His first concert in
this country was given at Boston and
at once won him enviable reputation as
an interpreter of great music. He be
came an instructor in the New Eng
land Conservatory at Boston, where he
was long a popular teacher. His con
certs in all the leading American cities
made him known as one of the most
brilliant instrumentalists of the mod
ern school, his rendition of the works
of the famous masters combining re
markable technique with a truthfulness
and sympathy of interpretation that
never failed to receive the enthusiastic
applause of music lovers.^ He was al
ways singularly successful as a teacher,
possessing in a noteworthy degree the
ability to impart knowledge and to en
list the interest of his pupils. Several
musical compositions of merit are cred
ited to his pen, but he will be remem
bered rather as a teacher and an in
terpreter of the music of others than
as a composer.

The large ntfmber of burglaries com
mitted throughout the city in the day
â¢time during the last few months has
caused a stir in police circles. En
trance was always effected through the
basement door by means of a skeleton
'key and as many of the articles stolen
Â¦were bulky it. was surmised that the
"burglar used a horse and wagon to
carry away hlÂ« plunder.
Detectfves O'Dea. Mulcahy, Bunner
and Freel were specially detailed by
Captain Martini to locate â¢ the daring
thieves and they arrested Louis No
vinsky, 18 years of age, and Moses
Levy, 17, last Saturday on suspicion.
Yesterday they obtained sufficient proof
against the suspects that they were
the boys who had been committing the
burglaries and they were booked at the
City Prison on three charges of bur
glary each, but about two dozen alto
gether could be placed against them.
â¢They had a horse and wagon and
voiild drive up to a house and boldly
enter the .basement by means of a
skeleton ke3 ; . They vÂ»-ouid break open
trunks and steal the contents and carry
tfff. anything else of value they found
â¢lying around loose. In some cases
they gat watrhes and other Jewelry
â¢ and at a house on McAllister street
thej' cot $147 in a trunk. They sold
mof t of the -stolen articles to second
hand dealers. The detectives have re
covered the articles sold. The dealers
have identified the prisoners as the boys
" "wht) Bold- the goods.

bed are 'the following: December 24,

On the discussion of the report
thora was a frank interchange of opin
ion. Many references were made to
the past struggles of the club and the
burden of debt when the league moved
from Geary street to' the present quar
ters in the Palace Hotel. Figures were
presented showing that the present in
come of the club would. Justify the ac
ceptance of added responsibility.
There Was a strong sentiment in fa
vor of housing the Union League of
San Francisco in a style of comfort
and convenience and placing it in line
with the Union Leagues of other lead
ing cities of the United States.
Mr. de Young did not advocate the
adoption of the report of the commit
tee in so 'many words, but he de
scribed the building now occupied by
the Pacific-Union as the finest club
house In the city," surpassing in many
respects the new home of the club
now in course of construction. It. was
his judgment, that the offer of Mr.
Burbank was a\ great opportunity for
the league, such an opportunity as a
club could get but once in a lifetime.
After unanimous adoption of the com
mittee's report' the members gave
throe cheers for Mr. de Young and
thanks to the committee.
The league will move to the Union
square house about November 1 next.
The membership now is 700. It will
doubtless be increased to 1000 before
the close of this year. It is fancied
that rooms which the league may not
use can be subrented to bring in $700
a month.
The Union League Club at a general
meeting of members last evening au
thorized its board of directors, to
lease for a term of ten years the prem
ises at the north\vest corner of. Post
and Stockton streets, now occupied by
the,. Pacific-Union Club. An extended
report was presented by a committee
consisting of M. H. de Young, John
P. Fraser, Thomas K. Kase, George
Stone and Frank Marston. Mr. de
Young, as the spokesman of the com
mittee, reviewed the negotiations with
W. ' F. Burbank, the owner of the
building. The. outcome of the negotia
tions was a written acceptance on the
part of Mr. Burbank of a proposition
presented by Mr. de Young. The ren
tal stipulated is $1350 a month for
the first year, $1400 a month for the
second year, $1450 for the third year,
and $1500 a month for the remaining
years. The landlord is required to put
in a new electric motor for the ele
vator and to meet the cost of keeping
the clubhouse in repair.
Colonel George H. Pippy, president
of the club, presided at the meeting.
