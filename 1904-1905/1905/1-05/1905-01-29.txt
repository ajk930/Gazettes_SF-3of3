THERE are four -Hals, in the key of A
fiat, which makcs'the key dffficult for
the piano student to master, unless he
employs these charts. With the charts
this key becomes as simple as the key
of C. which has neither sharps nor flats to con
fuse the eye and ringers. The lower chart on
this page gives of the key of A flat
while the chords of its relative, the key of F
tniii' r. are given on the upper chart. The top,
middle and lower sections of each chart give
the three, chords of each key, and these are all
surhcient for accompaniments. No other knowl
edge is required to play, in perfect harmony.
The black letters are to be played with the left
hand Â«nd the colored letters with the right hand.
Having placed the. chart oh the piano, play
the black letter on the top section with the left
hand, and then the three colored letters in uni
son with the right hand.. Next play the middle
section in the same way, then the lower section,
and then rÂ«urn to the top section. The
small - letter D. with a dash above it, which
giyÂ« the chart position, must not be played.
After a brief practice these chords can be mem
orized,and you may play without the use of the
chart. But with the chart a person who never
struck a not*-ah the-piano may in a few min
utes play the harmonious chords correctly, and
then accompany-his or her own songs or the
songs of friends. ,
â¢Proficiency requires a little practice, but no
previous k"P>* ledge of. music.
If you. desire to delve deeply into, the mys
teries of music the chart gives you the best pos
- hie foundation on. which to base a musical
education: A knowledge of the keys and their
choVds. underlies all the triumphs of the ac
complished musician.

THE man was not very tall, and
slight of build, yet about him
was much majesty, although his
garb was such as the humblest
might have worm He came forward,
lifting his head, and they saw that hia
featured were small and finely cut; that
be was bearded, and beneath his broad
brow shone thoughtful yet at times
pJtTClng eyes that were brown in hue.
Now' ihj Prince Hassan sank to his
knees and touched the marble with
bis forehead, and, guessing that they
were in the presence of the mighty
'monarch Saladin, the brethren saluted
Id their western fashion. Presently the
Sultan spoke In a low, even voice to
Hassan, to whom ho motioned that he
should rise, saying:
"I gee that you trust these knights,
emir," and he pointed to their great
â words.
"She,'' was the answer, "I trust
them as i trust myself. They are
brave and honorable men, although
they be Infidels."
The Sultan stroked his beard.
"Aye," ho said, "infidels. It is a
pity, ret doubtless they worship Gou
after iheir own fashion. Noble to look
on alJo, like their father, whom 1 re
member well, and if all 1 hear is true,

swered Godwin, "\iho have learned it

"Geou. 'men tell me, as soldiers to a
soldier, what do you seek from Salah
ed-din?"
"Our cousin, the Lady Rosamund,
who by your command, lord, was stolen
from our home in England."
"Knights, she is your cousin, that I
know, as surely as J know that she is
my niece. Tell me now. is she aught
more to you?" and he searched them
with those piercing eyes.
Godwin looked at Wulf, who said in
English:
"Speak the whole truth, brother.
From that man nothing can be hid."
Then Godwin answered:
"Sire, we love her, and are affianced
to her."
The Sultan stared at them in sur
prise.
'.'What: Both of you?" he asked.
"Yes, both."
"And.is the Princess, then, affianced
to. you both?"
' "Yes. to both."
'"And does she love you both?"
â¢."Yes," replied Godwin, "both, or so
She says."
Saladin stroked his beard and con
sidered them, while Hassan smiled a
little.
. "Then, knights," he said presently,

ay sat down on the divan and
keeping nothing back from the
ng to the end, nor, although the
s long, did the Sultan weary of
g.
'at story, truly." he said, when
.1 they had finished, "and one in

blood of tens of thousands; and in that

stretched nut my arm and took her
from far away. And now, through you
âyes, through youâshe has been

therefor, henceforth I am your friend."
"Sir> , have you seen her?" asked
Godwin.
"Knitt.U, I have seen her, and the
face is the face of my dreams, and I
know (hat In those dieams God spoke.
Listen, S':i Godwin and Sir Wulf," Sal
adin on in a changed voice, a
etern, commanding voice. "Ask of me
what you will, and, Franks though you
are, it thall be given you for your ser
vice's sakeâwealth, lands, titles, all
that men desire and I can grantâbut
ask not of me my niece. Rose of the

and 1 recapture her. then she shall die.
These things 1 have told her already,
and 1 swear them in the name of Allah.
Here she is, and in my house she must
abide until the vision bÂ»; fulfilled."
Now in their dismay tha brethren
looked upon each other, for they seem
ed "further from their desire than they
had been even in the castle of Slnan.
Then a light broke upon the face of
Godwin, and he stood up and an
swered :
"Dread lord of uli the East, we hear
you and we know our risk. You have
given us your friendship; we accept it
and are thankful, and seek no more.
God, you say, ha 3 brought our lady
Rosamund to you for his own pur

â"We!l spoken," replied Saladin. "I

fore blame me not if I keep my word;
but 1 ask no promise from you who
would not tempt noble knights to lie.
Yes, Allah has set this strange riddle;
by Allah let it be answered in his sea

Then he waved his hand to show
that the audience Was ended.
CHAPTER XVII.
The Brethren Depart From Damascus.
At the court of Saladin Godwin and
Wulf were treated with much honor.
A house was given them to dwell in
and a compahy of servants to minister
to their comfort and to guard them.
Mounted on their swift horses, Flame
and Smoke, they were taken, out Into
the desert to hunt, and, had they so
willed, it would have been easy for
them to outdistance their retinue and
companion's and ride away to the near
est Christian town. Indeed, no hand
would have been lifted to stay them
who were free to come and go. But
whither were they to go without Rosa
mund ?
Saladin they saw often, for it
pleased him to tell them tales of those
days when their father and uncle were
in the East, or talk with them of
England and the Franks, and even
now and again to reason with Godwin
on matters of religion. Moreover, to
show his faith in them, he gave them
the rank of officers of his own body
guard, and when, weffiarylng of Idle
ness, they asked it of him, allowed
them to take their share of duty in
the guarding of his palace and per
son. This, at a time when peace still
reigned between Frank and Saracen,
the brethren were not ashamed to
do, who received no payment for their
services.
Peace reigned indeed, but Godwin
and Wulf could guess that it would
not reign lor long. Damascus and the
plain around it were one great camp,
and every day new thousands of wild
tribesmen poured in and took up the
quarters that had been prepared for
them. They asked Masouda, who
knew everything, what it meant. She
answered: j
".IWmeans that Jibad, the Holy
War. which :-; being preached in
every mosque throughout the East. It
means that the great struggle between
tress and Crescent is at hand, and
then. Pilgrims Peter and John, you will
have to chooso your standard."
"There can be little doubt about
that." said Wulf.
"None." replied Masouda. with one Of
her smiles, "only it may pajn you to
have to make war upon the Princess
of Baalbec and her uncle, the Com
mander of the Faithful. Then she
went, still, smiling.
For this was the trouble of it: Ros
amund, ihÂ°ir cousin and their love,
had In truth become the Princess of
Baalbec âfor them. She lived in
great state and freedom, as Siladln
had promised that she should live in
his letter to Sir Andrew d'Arey. No
insult or violence were offered to her
faith; no suitor was thrust upon her.
But she was in a land where women
<!o not consort with men. especially if
they be high placed. As a Princess
of th? empire of S.iladin she must
obey its rules, even to veiling herself
w hen she went abroad and exchang
ing- no private words with men. God
win and Wulf prayed Saladin that
they might be allowed to speak with
her from time to time, but he only
answered shortly:
"Sir knights, our customs are our
customs. Moreover, the less you see
of the Princess of Baalbec the better
I think it will be for her, for you,
10$ ClL.
whose blood I do not wish to have
upon my hands, and for myself, who
await the fulfillment of that dream
which the angel brought."
Then the brethren left his presence
sore at heart, for although they saw
her from time to time at feasts and
festivals, Rosamund was as far apart
from them as though she sat in Stee
ple Hallâand farther. Also they
came to see that of rescuing her from
Damascus there was no hope at all.
She dwelt in her own palace, whereof
the walls were guarded night and day
by a company of the Sultan's Mame
lukes, who knew that they were an
swerable for her with their lives. With
in its walls, again, lived trusted
eunuchs, under the command of a cun
ning fellow named Mesrour, and her
retinue of women, all of them spies
and. watchful. How could two men
hope tÂ« snatch her from the heart of,
such a host and to spirit her out of
Damascus and through its encircling
armies? #
One comfort, however, was left to
them. When she reached the court
Rosamund had prayed of the Sultan
that Masouda should not be seaprated
from her, and this, because of the part
she had played in his niece's rescue
from the power of Sinan, he had
granted, though doubtfully. More
over, Masouda, being a person of no
account except for her beauty, and a
heretic, .vas allowed to go where she
would and to speak to whom she
wished. So, as she wished to speak
often with Godwin, they did not lack
for tidings of Rosamund.
From her they learned that in a
'fashion she was happy enoughâwho
would rot be that had just escaped
from AI-Jebal?âyet weary of the
strange Eastern lif". of the restraints
upon her, and of her airdless days;
vexed also that rhc> might not mix
with the brethren. Day by day she
sent them her greetings, and with
them warnincs to attempt nothingâ
not even to gee herâsince there was
no hope that they would succeed. So
much afraid of them was the Sultan.
Rosamund said, that both she and
they were watched day and night, and
of any folly their lives would pay the
price. When they.heard all this the
brethren began to despair, and their
spirits sank so low that they cared
not what should happen to them.
Then it was that a chance came to
them Of which the issue was tit make
them stfll more admired by Saladin
and to lift Masouda to honor. One
morning they were seated in the
courtyard of theh house beside the
fountain, staring at the passersby
through the bars of the bronze gates
an*i Â»t the sentries who marched to
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALLS
and fro before them. This house was
in one of the principal thoroughfares
of Damascus, and in front of it flowed
continually an unending, many-colored
stream of folk.
There were white-robed Arabs of the
desert mounted on their grumbling
camels; caravans of merchandise from
Egypt or elsewhere; asses laden with
firewood of the gray, prickly growth of
the wild thyme for the bakers' ovens;
water sellers with their goatskin bags;
venders of birds or sweetmeats; women
going to the bath in closed and cur
tained litters, escorted by the eunuchs
of their households; great lords riding
on their Arab horses and preceded by
their runners, who thrust the crowd
asunder and beat the poor with whips;
beggars, halt, maimed and blind, be
seeching alms; lepers, from whom all
shrank away, who wailed their woe 3
aloud; stately companies of soldiers,
some mounted and some afoot; holy
men, who gave blessings and received
alms; and so forth, without number
and without end.
Godwin and Wulf, seated In the shade
of the painted house, watched them
gloomily. They were weary of this
ever-changing sameness, weary of the
eternal glare and glitter of this unfa
miliar life, weary of the insistent cries
of the mullahs the minarets, of the
flash of the swords that would soon be
fed with the blood of their own people;
weary, too. of the hopeless task to
which they were sworn. Rosamund
was of this multitude; she was the
Princess of Baalbec, half an Eastern
by her blood and growing more East
ern day by dayâor so they thought In
their, bitterness. As well might two
Saracens hope to snatch the Queen of
England from her palace at Westmin
ster as they to drag the Princess of
Baalbec out of the power of a monarch
more absolute than any King of Eng
land.
So they sat silent since they had
nothing to say, and looked now at the
passing crowd, and now at the thin
stream of water falling continually
into the marble basin.
Presently they heard voices at the
gato, and looking up saw a woman
wrapped in a long cloak, talking with
the guard, who with a laugh thrust
out his arm, as though to place it
around her. Then a knife flashed,
and the soldier stepped back, still
laughing, and opened the wicket. The
woman came in. It was Masouda.
They rose' and bowed to her. but she
pawed before them into the house.
Thither they followed, while the sol
dier at the gate laughed again, and
at the sound of his mockery God
win's cheek grew red. Even, In the
cool, darkened room she noticed It,
and said, bitterly enough:
"What does it matter? Such In-,
suits are my daily bread whom the*
believe â" and she stopped.
"They had best say nothing of
what they believe to me," muttered
Godwin.
"I thank you," Masouda answered,
with a sweet, swift smile, and, throw
ing off her cloai;. stood before them
unveiled, clad-in the white robes that
fc befitted her tall and graceful form,
4 and were on the breast with
j the cognizaruWot, JSaalbecV "Well for
you." she wem on, "that they hold
me to be wha| I am not, since other
wise I should -ifrln no entry to this
house."
"What of our Lady Rosamund,"
.broke in Wulf awkwardly, for, like
Godwin, he was pained.
Masouda laid her hand upon her
breast ss though to still its heaving,
then answered: â¢
"The Princess of Baalbac, my mis
tress, is well and as ever, beautiful,
though somewhat weary of the pomp
in which she finds no Joy. She sent
her greetings, but did not say to
which of you they should be deliv
ered, so. pilgrims, you must share
them."
Godwin winced, but Wulf asked If
there were any hope of seeing her, to
which Masouda answered:
"None," adding in a low voice, "I
came upon another business. Do you
brethren wish to do Salah-ed-dln a
service?"
"I don't know. What is it?" asked
Godwin gloomily.
"Only to save his lifeâfor which
he may be grateful, or may not, ac
cording to his mood."
"Speak on," said Godwin, "and tell
us how we can save the life of the
Sultan of the East."
"Do you still remember Sinan and
his fedais? Yesâthey are not easily
forgotten, are they? Well, to-night
he has plotted to murder Salah-ed-dln,
and afterward to murder you If he
can, and to carry wny your lady
Rosamund if he can, or, failing that,
to murder her also. Oh! the tale is
true enough. I have it from one of
them under the Signetâsurely that
Signet has proved us wellâwho be
lieves, poor fool, that I am In the plot.
Now, you are the officers of the body
guard who watch in the antecham
ber to-night, are you not? Well, when
the guard is changed at midnight, the
eight men who should replace them
at the doors of the room of Salah-ed
dln will not arrive: they will be de
coyed by a false order. In their stead
will come eight murderers, disguised
in the robes and arms of Mamelukes.
They look to deceive and cut you
down, kill Salah-ed-dln, and escape by
the further door. Can you hold your
own awhile against eight men, think
you?"
"We have done so before and wIU
try," said Wulf. "But how shall we
know that they are not Mamelukes?"
"Thusâthey will wish to pass the
door, and you will say, 'Nay, sons of
Sinan,' whereupon they will spring
on you to kill you. Then be ready and
shout aloud."
"AnO if they- overcome us," asked
Godwin, "then the Sultan would be
slain?"
"Nay, for you must lock the door of
the chamber of Salah-ed-dln and hide
away the key. The sound of the fight
ing will arouse the outer guard ere
hurt can come to him. Or," she, added,
after thinking awhile, "perhaps' it will
be best to reveal the plot to the Sul
tan at once." â¢
"No, no," answered Wulf; "let us
take the chance. I weary of doing
nothing here. Hassan guards the outer
gate. He will come swiftly at the
sound of blows."
"Good," said Masouda; "I will see
that he is there and awake. Now fare
well, and pray that we may meet again.
I say nothing of this story to the
Princess Rosamund until it is done
with." Then, throwing her cloak about
her shoulders, she turned and went.
"Is that true, think you?" asked
Wulf of Godwin.
"We have never found Masouda to
be a liar," was his answer. "Come; let
us see to our armor, for the knives
of those fedai are sharp."
It was near midnight, and the breth
ren stood in the small domed ante
chamber, from which a door opened
into the sleeping rooms of Saladin. The
guard of eight Mamelukes had left
them, expecting to be met by their re-
lief In the courtyarp\ according to cus
tom, but no relief had come.
"It would seem that Masouda's tale
is true," said Godwin, and, going to the
door, he locked it and hid the key be
neath a cushion.
Then they took their stand in front
of the locked door, before which hung
curtains, standing in the shadow with
the light from the hanging silver lamps
pouring down in front of them. Here
they waited awhile In silence, till at
length they heafcd the tramp of men,
and eight Mamelukes, clad in yellow
above their mail, marched in and
saluted.
"Stand!" said Godwin, and they
stood a minute, then began to edge for
ward.
"Stand!" said both the brethren
again, but still they edged forward.
"Stand, sons of Sinan!" they said a
third time, drawing their swords.
Then with a hiss of 'disappointed rage
the fedai came at them.
"A d'Drcy! A d'Arey! Help for the
Sultan!" shouted the brethren, and the
fray began.
Six of the men attacked them, and
while they were engaged with these
the other two slipped round and tried
the door, only to find it fast. Then
they also turned upen the brethren,
thinking to take the key from off their
bodies. At the first rush two of the
fedai went down beneath the sweep of
the long swords, but after that the
murderers would not come close, and
while some engaged them in front,
others strove to pass and stab them
from behind. Indeed, a blow from one
of their long knives fell upon Godwin's
shoulder, but the good mail turned it.
"Give way," he cried to Wulf, "or
they will best us."
So suddenly they gave way before
them till their backs were against the
door, and there they stood, shouting
for help and sweeping round them with
their swords, into the reach of which
the fedai dare not come. Now from
without the chambers rose a cry and
tumult, and the sound of heavy blows
tailing upon the gates that the npur
derers had barred behind them, while
upon the farther side of the door,
which he could not open, was .heard
the voice of the Sultan demanding to
know what had passed.
The fedai heard these sounds also,
and read in them their doom. Forget
ting caution in their despair and rage,
they hurled themselves upon the
brethren, for they thought that if they
could get them down they might still
break through the door and slay Salah
ed-dln before they themselves were
slain.* But for a while the brethren
stopped their rush with point and
buckler, wounding two of them sore
ly; and when at length they closed In
upon them the gates were burst, and
Hassan and the outer guard were at
hand.
A minute later, and but Uttie hurt,"
Godwin and Wulf were leaning on their
swords, and the fedai, some of them
dead or wounded and some of them
captive, lay before them on the marble
floor. Moreover, the door had been
opened, and through it came the Sul
tan in his nightgear.
"What has chanced?" he asked, look
ing at them doubtfully.
"Only this, lord," answered God
win, "these men came to kill you and
we held them off till help arrived."
"Kill me! My own guard kill me!"
"They are not your guard; they are
fedai, disguised as your guard and sent
by Al-Jebal. as he promised."
Now Salah-ed-din turned pale, for
he who feared nothing else was-all his
Ufe afraid of the Assassins and their
lord, who thrice had striven to murder
him.
"Strip the armor from those men,"
went on Godwin, "and I think that you
will find truth in my words, or, if not,
question such of them as still live."
They obeyed, and there upon the
breast of one of them, burnt into his
skin, was the symbol of the blood-red
dagger. Now Saladin saw, and beck
oned the brethren aside.
"How knew you of this?" he asked,
searching them with his piercing eyes.
"Masouda, the Lady Rosamund's
waiting woman, warned us that you,
lord, and we, were to be murdered to
night by eight men, so we made
ready."
"Why, then, did you not tell me?"
"Because," answered Wulf, "we were
not sure that the news was true, and
did not wish to bring false tidings and
be made foolish. Besides, also, my
brother and I thought that we could
hold our own awhile against eight of
Sinan's rats disguised as soldiers of
Saladin."
"You have done it well, though yours
was a mad counsel," answered the Sul
tan. Then he gave his hand first to
one and next to the other, and said,
simply:
"Sir Knights. Salah-ed-din owes his
life to you. Should it ever come about
that you owe your lives to Salah-ed
din. he will remember this."
Thus this business ended. On the
morrow those of the fedai who re
mained alive were questioned, and con
fessing freely that they had been sent
to murder Salah-ed-din. who had
robbed their master of his bride, the
two Franks who had carried her off,
and the woman Masuda, were put to
death cruelly enough. Also many oth
ers in the city were seized and killed
on suspicion, and so for awhile there
was no more feaf from the Assassins.
Now from that day forward Salah
ed-din held the brethren in great
friendship, and pressed gifts upon them
and offered them honors. But they re
fused them all, saying that they need
ed but one thing of him. and he knew
what it wasâan answer at which his
face sank.
One morning he sent for them, and,
except for the presence of Prince Has
san, the most favorite of his emirs,
and a famous imaum, or priest of his
religion, received them alone.
' Listen," he said briefly, addressing
Godwin. "I understand that my niece,
the Princess of Baalbec,- Is beloved by
you. Good". Subscribe the Koran, and
I give her to you in marriage, for thus
also she may be led to the true 'faith,
whom I have sworn not to force there
to, and I gain a great warrior and
paradise a brave soul. The imaum
here will Instruct you in the truth."
Thus he spoke, but Godwin only
- stared at him with eyes set wide in
wonderment, and answered:
â¢ Sire, I thank you, but I cannot
change my faith to win a woman, how
ever dearly I may love her."
'So I thought," said Saladin with a
sigh, "though indeed it is sad that
superstition should thus blind so
brave and good a man. Now, Sir Wulf,
It Is your turn. What say you to my
offer? Will you take the Princess and
her dominions with my love thrown in
as a marriage portion?"
Wulf thought a moment, and as he
thought there arose in his mind a vi
sion of an autumn afternoon that
seemed years and years ago. when they
two and Rosamund had stood by the
shrine of St. Chad on the shores of Es
sex, and Jested of this very matter of
a change of faith. Then he answered,
with one of his great laughs:
"Aye, sire, but on my own terms, not
on yours, or if I took these I think that
my marriage would lack blessings. Nor.
Indeed, would' Rosamund wish to wed
a servant of your prophet, who If It
pleased Mm might take other wives."
Saladin leant his head upon his hand
and looked at them with disappointed
eyes, yet not unkindly.
"The knight Loselle was a eross-wor
shlper," he said, "but you two are very
different from the knight Lozelle, who
accepted the faith when it was offered
to himâ"
"To win your trade," said Godwin,
bitterly.
"I know not," answered Saladin,
"though It is true the man seemed to
have been a Christian among the
Franks, who here was a follower of the
prophet. At least he is dead at your
hands, and though he sinned against
me and betrayed my niece to Sinan,
peace be with his soul. Now I have
one more thing to say to you. That
Frank, Prince Arnat of Karak. whom
you call Reginald de Chatillonâac
cursed be his name!â" and he spat
upon the groundâ"has once more brok
en the peace between me and the King
of Jerusalem, slaughtering my mer
chants and stealing my goods. I will
suffer this shame no more, and very
shortly I will unfurl my standards,
which shal' not be folded up again
until they float upon the mosque of
Omar and from every tower-top in
Palestine. Your people are doomed. I.
Yusuf Salah-ed-dln," and he rose as he
said the words, his very beard brist
ling with wrath, "declare the Holy
War, and will sweep them down to the
sea. Choose now, you brethren. Do
you fight for me or against me? Or
will you give up your swords and bide
here as my prisoners?"
"We are the servants of the cross,"
answered Godwin, "and cannot lift
steel against it and thereby lose our
souls." Then he spoke with Wulf, and
added, "As to your second question,
whether we should bide here in chains,
it is one that our Lady Rosamund must
answer, for we are sworn to her serv
ice. We demand to see the Princess of
Baalbec."
"Send for her, Emir," said Saladin
to the Prince Hassan, who bowed arid
departed.
A while* later Rosamund came,
looking beautiful, but, as they saw
when she threw back her veil, very
white and weary. She bowed to Sa
ladin, and the brethren, who were
not allowed to touch her hand, bowed
to her, devouring her face with eager
eyes.
"Greeting, my uncle," she said to
the Sultan, "and to you, my cousins,
greeting also. What Is your pleasure
with me?"
Saladin motioned to her to be seat
ed and bade Godwin set out the case,
which he did very clearly, ending:
"Is it your wish, Rosamund, that
we stay in this court as prisoners, or
go forth to fight with the Franks, in
the great war that is to-be?"
Rosamund looked at them awhile,
then answered:
"To whom were you sworn the
first? Was It to the service of our
Lord or to the service of a woman?
I have said."
"Such words as we expected from
you, being what you . are," exclaimed
Godwin, while Wulf nodded his head
in assent and added:
"Sultan, we ask your safe conduct
to Jerusalem, and leave this lady in
your charge, relying on your plighted
word to do no violence to her faith
and to protect her person."
"My safe conduct you have," re
plied Saladin, "and my friendship
also. Nor. indeed, should I have
thought well of you had you decided
otherwise. Now, henceforth we are
enemies in the eyes of all men and I
shall-strive to slay you as you will
strive to slay me. But as regards this
lady, have rio fear. What I have
promised shall be fulfilled. Bid her
farewell, whom you will see no more,"
"Who taught your lips to say such
words, O Sultan?" asked Godwin. "Is
it given to you to read the future and
the decrees of God?"
"I should have said," answered Sa
ladin, " 'whom you will see no more
if I can keep you apart.' Can you
complain, who, both of you, have re
fused to take her as a wife?"
Here Rosamund looked up wonder
ing, and Wulf broke in:
"Tell her the price. Tell her that
she was asked to wed either of us who
would bow the knee to Mohammed
and to be the head of his harem, and
I think she will not blame us."
"Never would I have spoken again
to him who answered otherwise," ex
claimed Rosamund, and Saladin frown
ed at the words. "Oh! my uncle," she
went on, "you have been kind to me
and raised me high, but I do not seek
this greatness, nor are your ways my
ways, who am of a faith that you call
accursed. Let me go, I beseech you,
in care of these my kinsmen."
"And your lovers," said Saladin bit
terly. "Niece, It cannot be. I love you
well, but did I know even that your
life must pay the price of your sojourn
here, here you still should stay, since,
as my dream told me, on you hang the
lives of thousands, and I believe that
dream. What, then in your life, or
the lives of these knights, or even my
life, that any or all of them should
turn the scales against those of thou
sands? Oh, everything that my em
pire can give is at your feet, but here
you stay until the dream be accom
plished, and," he added, looking at the
brethren, "death shall be the portion
of any who would steal you from my
hand."
"Until the dream be accomplished?"
said Rosamund, catching at the words.
"Then, when It is accomplished, shall
I be free?"
"Aye," answered the Sultan; "free to
come or to go, unless you attempt es
cape, for then you know your doom."
"It is a decree. Take note, my cous
ins, it is a decree. And you, Prince
Hassan, remember it also. Oh! I pray,
with all my soul I pray, that it was no
lying spirit who - brought you that
dream, any uncle, though how I shall
bring peace, who hitherto have brought
nothing except war and bloodshed, I
know not. Now go, my cousins; but,
If you will, leave me Masouda, who
has no other friends. Go. and take my
love and blessing with youâaye, and
the blessing of the saints which shall
protect you in the hour of battle, and
bring us together again."
So spoke Rosamund and threw her
veil before her face that she might hide
her tears.
Then Godwin and Wulf stepped to
where she stood by the throne of Sala
din, bent the knee before her, and, tak
ing her hand, kissed it in farewell, nor
did the Sultan say them nay. But
when she was gone and the brethren
were gone, he turned to the emir Has
san and to the great imaum who had
sat silent all this while, and said:
"Now tell me. you who are old and
wise, which of those men does the
lady love.' Speak, Hassan, you who
know her well."
But Hassan shod: his head. "One
or the other. Both or neither âI know
not," he answered. "Her counsel is
too close for me."
Then Saladin turned to the Imaum
âa cunning, silent man.
"When those infidels are about to
die before her face, as I still hope to
see them do, we may learn the an
swer. But unless she wills It, never
before," he replied, and the Sultan
noted his saving.
Next morning, having been warned
that they would pass there by Masou
da, Rosamund, watching through the
lattice of one of the palace windows,
saw the brethren go by. They were
fully armed and mounted on their
splendid charges, Flame and Smoke,looked glorious men as, followed by
their escort of sworthy, turbancd
Mamelukes, they rode proudly side by
side, the sunlight glinting on their
mail. Opposite to her house they halt
ed awhile, and, knowing that Rosa
mund watched, although they could
not see her, drew their swords and lift
ed them in salute. Then sheathing
them again, they rode forward in si
lence, and soon were lost to sight.
Utile did Rosamund guess how dif
ferent they would appear when they
three met again. Indeed, she scarcely
dared to hope that they would ever
meet, for she knew well that even
if the war went in favor of the Chris
tians sht> would be hurried away to
some place where they would never
rind her. She knew well also that
from Damascus her rescue was impos
sible, and that although Saladin
loved them, as he loved all who were
honest and brave, he would receive
them no more as friends, for fear
lest they should rob him of her, whom
he hoped in some way unforeseen
would enable him to end his days in
peace. Moreover, the struggle between
Cross and Crescent would be fierce and
to the death, and she was sure that
where was the closest righting, there
in the midst of it would be found God
win and Wulf. Well might it chance,
therefore, that her eyes had looked
their last upon them.
Oh! she was great. Gold was hers,
and gems more than she could count,
and few were the weeks that did not
bring her added wealth or gifts. She
had palaces to dwell Inâalone; gardens
to wander inâalone; eunuchs and
slaves to rule overâalone. But never
a friend had she, save the woman of
the Assassins, to whom she clung be
cause she, Masouda, had saved her
from Sinan, and who clung to her, why,
Rosamund could not be sure, for there
was a veil between their hearts.
They were goneâthey were gone!
Even the sound of their horses' hoofs
had died away, and she was desolate
as a child lost in a cityful of folk. Oh!
and her heart was filled with fears for
them, and most of all for one of them.
If he should not come back into it,
what would her life be? She bowed
her head and wept; then, hearing a
sound behind her, turned to see that
Masouda was weeping also.
"Why do you weep?" she asked.
"The maid should copy her mistress,"
answered Masouda, with a hard laugh;
"but, lady, why do you weep? At least
you are beloved, and, come what may,
nothing can take that from you. You
are not of less value than the good
horse between the rider's knees, or the
faithful dog that runs at his side."
A thought rose in Rosamund's mind
âa new and terrible thought. The
â  eyes of the two women met, and those
of Rosamund asked, "Which?" Be
tween them stood a table inlaid with
ivory and pearl, thereon the dust from
the street had gathered through the
open lattice. Masouda leaned over, and
with her forefinger wrote a single
Arabic letter in the dust upon the ta
ble, then passed her hand across it.
Rosamund's breast heaved twice or
thrice, and was still. Then she asked:
"Why did not you who are free go
with him?"
"Because he prayed me to bide here
and watch over the lady whom he
loved. So to the death â1 watch."
Slowly Masouda spoke, and the heavy
.words seemed like blood dropping from
a death wound. Then she sank for
ward into the arms of Rosamund.
CHAPTER XVIII.
The Battle of Hattin.
Many a day had gone by since the
brethren bid farewell to Rosamund at
Damascus. Now, one burning July
night, they sat upon their horses, the
moonlight gleaming on their mail, look
ing out from a rocky mountain top
across that gray and arid plain which
stretches from near Nazareth to the
lip of the hills at whose foot lie Tiber
ra6 and the Sea of Galilee. Beneath
them, camped round the fountain of
Seffurieh, were spread the hosts of the
Franks to which they did sentinel; thir
teen hundred knights, twenty thousand
foot, and hordes of Turcopolesâthat is,
natives of the country, armed after the
fashion of the Saracens.
Two miles away to the southeast
glimmered the white houses of Naz
areth, set in the lap of the mountainsâ
Nazareth, the holy city, where for thir
ty years lived and toiled the Savior
of the world. Doubtless, thought God
win, his feet had often trod that moun
tain whereon they stood, and in the
watered vales below his hands had
sped the plow or reaped the corn. Long,
long had his voice been silent, yet in
Godwin's ears it still seemed to speak
in the murmur of the vast camp, and
to echo from the slopes of the Galilean
hills, and the words it said were: "I
bring not peace, but a sword."
To-morrow they were to advance, so
rumor said, across yonder desert plain
and give battle to Saladin, who lay
with all his power by Hattin, above
Tiberias. Godwin and his brother
thought that it was a madness; for
they had seen the might of the Sara
cens and ridden across that thirsty
plain beneath the summer sun. But
who were they, two wandering unat
tended knights, that they should dare
to lift up their voices against those of
the lords of the land, skilled from their
birth in desert warfare? Yet Godwin's
heart was troubled and fear took hold
of him, not for himself, but for all the
countless army that lay asleep yonder,
and for the cause of Christendom,
which 6taked its last throw upon this
battle.
"I go to watch yonder; bide you
here," he said to Wulf, and turning the
head of Flame, rode some sixty yards
over a shoulder of the rock to the fur
ther edge of the mountain which looked
toward the north. Here he could
â¢cc neither the camp, nor Wulf,
nor any living thing, but in
deed was utterly alone. Dis
mounting, and bidding the horse
stand, which it would do like a dog,
he walked forward a few steps to
where there was a rock and, kneeling
down, began to pray with all the
strength o *' n * s Pure, warrior heart.
"O Lord," he prayed, "who once
wast man and a dweller in these
mountains and knowest what is in
man, hear me. I am afraid for all
the thousands who sleep round Naz
areth, not for myself, who care noth
ing lor my life, but for all those, thy
servants and my brethren. Yes, and
for the cross upon which thou didst
haifg and for the faith itself through
out the East. "Oh! give me light! Oh!
let nic hear and see, that I may warn
them, unless my fears are vain!"
And he beat his hands against his
brow, praying, ever praying, as he had
never prayed before that wisdom and
vision might be given to his soul.
It seemed to Godwin that a sleep
fell on him âat least, his mind grew
clouded and confused. Then it
Cleared again, slowly, as stirred water
clears, till it was bright and still; yet
another mind to that which was his
Servant day by day which never could
see or hear those things he saw and
heard in that strange hour. Lo! he
heard the spirits pass, whispering as
they went; whispering, and. as It
seemed to him, weeping also for some
great woe which was to be; weeping
yonder over Nazareth. Then like cur
tains the veils were lifted from his
eyes and as they swung aside he saw
further and yet further.
He saw the King of the Pranks in
his tent beneath, and about him the
council of his captains, among them
the fierce-eyed master of the Tem
plars, and a man whom he had seen
In Jerusalem where they had been
dwelling, and knew for Count Ray
mond of Tripoli, the Lord of Tiberias.
They were reasoning together, till.
presently, in a rage, the master of the
Templars drew his sword and dashed
It down upon the table.
Another veil was lifted, and lo! he
saw the camp of Saladin, the mighty,
endless camp, with its ten thousand
tents, among which the Saracens
cried to Allah through all the watches
of the night. He saw the royal pavi
lion, and in it the Sultan walked to and
fro aloneânone'of his emirs, not even
his son. were with him. He was lost in
thought, and Godwin read his thought.
It was: "Behind me the Jordan and
the Sea of Galilee, into which, if my
flanks were turned, I should be driven,
I and all my host. In front the terri
tories of the Franks, where I have no
friend; and by Nazareth their great
army. Allah alone can help me. If
they sit still and force me to advance
across the desert and attack them be
fore my army melts away, then I am
lost. If they advance upon me round
tne Mountain Tabor and by the wa
tered land, I may be lost. But ifâoh!
if Allah should make them mad, and
they should strike straight across the
desertâthen, then they are lost, and
the reign of the Cross in Syria is for
ever at an end. I will wait here. I
will wait hereâ"
Look! near to the pavilion of Saladin
stood another tent, closely guarded,
and in it on a cushioned bed lay two
women. One was Rosamund, and she
slept sound; and the other was Masou
da. and she was waking, for her eyes
met his in the darkness.
The last veil was withdrawn, and
now Godwin saw a sight at which his
soul shivered. A fire-blackened plain,
and above it a frowning mountain, and
that mountain thick, thick with dead,
thousands and thousands and thou
sands of dead, among which the hyenas
wandered and the night-birds
screamed. He could see their faces;
many of them he knew again as those
of living men whom he had met in
Jerusalem and elsewhere, or had seen
with the army. He could hear also the
moanings of the few who were yet
alive.
About that fieldâyes, and In the
camp of Saladin, where lay more dead
âhis body seemed to wander searching
for something, he knew not what, till
it came to him that it was the corpse
of Wulf for which he sought and found
it notânay, nor his own either. Then
once more he heard the spirits passâ
a very great company, for to them
were cathered all those deadâheard
them pass away, wailing, ever more
faintly wailing, for the lost cause of
Christ.
Godwin awoke from his dream
trembling, mounted his horse, and
rode back to Wulf. Beneath, as be
fore, lay the sleeping camp, yonder
stretched the brown desert, and there
sat Wulf watching both.
"Tell me," asked Godwin, "how long
Is it since I left you?"
"Some few minutesâtwenty, per
haps," answered his brother.
"A short while to have seen so
much. Then Wulf looked at him cu
riously and asked:
"What have you seen?"
"If I told you, Wulf, you would
not believe."
"Tell me, and I will say."
So Godwin told him all, and at the
end asked him, "What think you?"
Wulf considered awhile, and an
swered:
"Well, brother, you have touched
no wine to-day. so you are not drunk,
and you have done nothing foolish, so
you are not mad. Therefore It
would seem that the saints have been
talking to you, or, at least, so I
should think of any man whom I be
lieved to be as good as you are. Yet
it is folk like you that see visions, and
those visions are not always true, for
sometimes, I believe, the devil is their
showman. Our watch is ended, for
I hear the horses of the knishts who
come to relieve us. Listen; this is my
counsel. In the camp yonder is. our
friend, with whom we traveled from
Jerusalem, Egbert, the Bishop of Naz
areth, who marches with the host.
Let us go to him and lay this matter
before him, for he is a holy man and
learned; no false, self-seeking priest."
Godwin nodded In assent, and pres
ently, when the other knights had
come and they had made their report
to them, they rode off together to the
tent of Egbert, and, leaving their
horses in charge of a servant, en
tered.
Egbert was an Englishman who
had spent more than thirty years of
his life in the East, whereof the suns
had tanned his wrinkled face to the
hue of bronze, that seemed the darker
in contrast with his blue eyes and
snow-white hair and beard. Enter
ing the tent, they found him at his
prayers before a little image of the
Virgin, and stood with bowed heads
until he had finished. Presently he
arose, and, greeting them with a
blessing, asked them what they
needed.
"Your counsel, holy father," an
swered Wulf. "Godwin, set out your
tale."
So, having seen that the tent flap
was closed and that none lingered
near, Godwin told him his dream.
The old man listened patiently, nor
did he seem surprised at this strange
story, since in those days men sawâ
or thought that they sawâmany such
visions, which were accepted by the
church as true.
When he had finished Godwin asked
of him as he had asked of Wulf:
"What think you, holy father? Is this
a dream, or is it a message? And if
so, from whom comes the message?"
"Godwin D'Arcy," he answered, "in
my youth I knew your father. It was
I who shrove him when he iav dying
of his wounds, and a nobler soul never
passed from earth to heaven. After
you had left Damascus, when you were
the guest of Saladin, we dwelt together
in the same lodging in Jerusalem, and
together we traveled here, during all
which time I learned to know you also
as the worthy son of a worthy sireâ
no dissolute knight, but a true servant
of the church. It well may be that to
such a one as you foresight has been
given, that through you those \*ho
rule us may be warned, and all Christ
endom saved from great sorrow and
disgrace. Come, let' us go to the King
and tell this story, for he still sits in
council yonder."
So they rode out together and rode
to the royal ffent. Here the Bishop was
admitted, leaving them without. Pres
ently he returned and beckoned to
them, and as they passed the guards
whispered to them:
"A strange council, sirs, and a fate
ful!"
Already it was near midnight, but
still the great pavilion was crowded
with Barons and chief captains who
stood in groups, or sat round a narrow
table made of boards placed upon tres
tles. At the head of the table sat the
King, Guy of Lusignan, a weak-faced
man, clad in splendid armor. On his
right was the white-haired Count Ray
mond of Tripoli, and on his left the
black-bearded, frowning master of the
Templars, clad In his white mantle on
the left breast of which the red cross
was blazoned. Words had been run
ning high, their faces showed it, but
just then a silence reigned as though
the disputants were weary, and the
King leaned back in his chair, pass
ing his hand to and fro across his
forehead. He looked up, and seeing
the Bishop, asked peevishly.
"What is it now? Oh! I remem
ber, some tale from those tall twin
knights. Well, bring them forward
and speak it out, for we have no time
to lose."
So the three of them came forward
and at Godwin's prayer the Bishop
Egbert told of the vision that had
come to him not more than an hour
ago while he kept watch upon the
mountain top. At first one or two of
the Barons seemed disposed to laugh,
but when they looked at Godwin's
high and spiritual face their laughter
died away, for it did not seem won
derful to them that such a man should
see visions. Indeed, as the tale of the
rocky hill and the dead who were
stretched upon.it went on they grew
white with fear and whitest of them
all was the King, Guy of Lusignan.
"Is all this true. Sir Godwin?" he
asked when the Bishop had finished.
"It is true, my lord King," an
swered Godwin.
"His word is not enough," broke in
the master of the Templars. "Let him
swear to it on the Holy Rood, know
ing that if he lies it will blast his soul
to all eternity." And the council mut
tered, "Aye, let him swear./'
Now there was an annex to the tent,
rudely furnished as a chapel, and at
the end of this annex a tall, veiled ob
ject. Ruftnus, the Bishop of Acre,
who was clad in the armor of a
knight, went to the object and, draw
ing the veil, revealed a broken,
blackened cross, set around with jew
els, that stood about the height of a
man above the ground, for all Its low
er part was gone.
At the sight of It Godwin and every
man present there fell upon his knees,
for since St. Helena found It, over
seven centuries before, this had been
accounted the most precious relic in
all Christendom; the very wood upon
which the Savior suffered, as, in
deed, it may have been. Millions had
worshiped It, tens of thousands had
died for it, and now. In the hour of
this great struggle between "Christ and
the false prophet it was brought from
its shrine that the host which escort
ed it might prove invincible in battle.
Soldiers who fought around the very
cross could not be defeated, they said,
for, if need Were, legions of angels
would come to aid them.
Godwin and Wulf stared at the the
relic with wonder, fear and adoration.
There were the nail marks, there was
the place where the scroll of Pilate
had been affixed above the holy head
âalmost could they seem to see that
form divine, and dying.
"Now." broke in the voice of the
master of the Templars, "let Sir God
win d'Arcy swear to the truth of his
tale upon this Rood."
' Rising from his knees, Godwin ad
vanced to the cross and, laying his
hand upon the wood, said:
the very Rood I swear that
not much more than an hour ago I saw
the vision that has been told to the
king's highness and to all; that I be
lieve this vision was sent to me in an
swer to my prayer to preserve our host
and the holy city from the power of
the Saracen, and thatPlt is a true fore
shadowing of what will come about
should we advance upon the Sultan. I
can say no more. I swear, knowing
that if I lie eternal damnation is my
doom.**
The Bishop drew back the covering
over the cross, and in silence the coun
cil took their seats again about the
table. Now the King was very pale.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL!.
and fearful; . .deed a gloom lay upon
all of them.
"It would seem," he said, "that here
a messenger has been sent to us from
heaven. Dare we disobey his mes
sage?"
The Grand Templar lifted his rugged,
frowning face.
"A messenger from heaven, said you,
King? To me he seems more like a
messenger from Saladin. Tell us, Sir
Godwin, were not you and your broth
er once the Sultan's guests at Damas
cus?"
"That is so, my lord Templar. We
left before the war was declared."
"And/ went on the Master, "were
you not officers of the Sultan's body
guard V*
Now all looked Intently at Godwin,
who hesitated a little, foreseeing how
his answer would be read, whereon
Wulf spoke in his loud voice:
"Aye, we acted as such for a while,
andâdoubtless you have heard the
storyâsaved Saladin's life when he
was attacked by the Assassins."
"Oh!" said the Templar with bitter
sarcasm, "you saved Saladln's life, did
you? I can well .believe it. You, being
Christians, who above everything
should desire the death of Saladin,
saved his life! Now, Sir Knights, an
swer me one more question "
"Sir Templar, with my tongue or
with my sword?" broke in Wulf, but
the King held up his hand and bade
him be silent.
"A truce to your tavern ruffling,
young sir, and answer," went on the
Templar. "Or, rather, do you answer,
Sir Godwin. Is your cousin, Rosa
mund, the daughter of Sir Andrew
d'Arcy, a niece of Saladin, and has she
been created by him Princess of Baal.
-bee, and is she at this moment in his
city of Damascus?"
"She is his niece," answered Godwin
quietly; "she is the Princess of Baal
bec, but at this moment she is not in
Damascus."
"How do you know that, Sir God
win?"
"I know it because in the vision of
which you have been told I saw her
sleeping in a tent in the camp of
Saladin."
Now the council began to laugh, but
Godwin, with a set, white face,
went on:
"Aye, my lord Templar, and near
that very blazoned tent I saw scores of
the Templars and of the Hospitallers
lying dead. Remember It when the
hour comes and you see them also."
Now the laughter died away and a
murmur of fear ran round the board,
mixed with such words as "Wizardry."
"He has learnt It from the Paynims."
"A black sorcerer, wlthont doubt."
Only the Templar, who feared neither
roan nor spirit, laughed, and gave him
the He with his eyes.
"You do not believe me," said God
win, "nor will you believe me when I
say that while I was on guard on yon
der hillton I saw you wranalina with
the Count of Tripoliâaye, and draw
your sword and dash it down in front
of him upon this very, table."
Now again the council stared and
muttered, for they, too, had seen this
thing; but the Master answered:
"He may have learnt it otherwise
than from an angel. Folk have been in
and out of this tent. My lord King,
have we more time to waste upon
these visions of a knight of whom all
we know for certain Is, that like hisr
brother, he has been In the service of
Saladin, which they left, he says, in
order to fight against him in this war?
It may be so; it is not for us to Judge:
though were the times different I would
Inform against Sir Godwin D'Arcy as a
sorcerer, and one who has been in
traitorous communication with our
common foe."
"And I would thrust the He down
your throat with my- sword's point!"
shouted Wulf.
But Godwin only shrugged his shoul
ders and said nothing, and the Master
went on, taking no heed.
"King, we wait your word, and it
must be spoken soon, for in four hours
it will be dawn. Do we march against
Saladin like bold, Christian men, or do
we bide here like cowards?"
Then Count Raymond of Tripoli rose,
and said:
"Before you answer, Kins;, hear me,
If it be for the last time, who am old
In war and know the Saracens. My
town of Tiberias is sacked; my vassals
have been put to the sword by thou-
sands; my wife Is imprisoned in her
citadel, and soon must yield, if she be
not rescued. Yet I say to you, and to
the Barons here assembled better so
than that you should advance across
the desert to attack Saladin. Leave
Tiberias to its fate and my wife with
it, and save your army, which is the
last hope of the Christians of the East.
Christ has no more soldiers in these
lands, Jerusalem has no other shield.
The army of the Sultan is larger than
yours; his cavalry are more skilled.
Turn his flankâor, better still, bide
here and wait his attack, and
will be to the" soldiers of the cross.
Advance and the vision of that knight
at whom you scoff will come true, and
the cause of Christendom be lost in
Syria. I have spoken, and for the last
time."
"Like his friend, the Knight of Vis
ion," sneered the Grand Master, "the
Count Raymond is an old ally of Sal
adin. Will you take such coward coun
cil? Onâon! and smite these heathen
dogs, or be forever shamed. On, in the
name of the cross! The cross is with
us!"
"Aye," answered Raymond, "for the
last time."
Then there arose a tumult through
which every man shouted to his fellow,
some saying one thing and some an
other, while the King sat at the head
of the board, his face hidden in his
hands. Presently he lifted it, and said:
"I command that we march at dawn.
If the Count Raymond and these
brethren think the words unwise, let
them leave us and remain here under
guard until the issue be known."
Now followed a great silence, for all
there knew that the words were fate
ful, in the midst of which Count Ray
mond said:
"Nay, I go with you," while Godwin
echoed, "And we go also to show
whether or not we are the spies of Sal
adin."
Of these speeches none of them
seemed to take heed, for all were lost
in their own thoughts. One by one they
rose, bowed to the King, and left the
tent to give their commands and rest
awhile before it was time to ride. God
win and Wulf went also, and with
them the Bishop of Nazareth, who
wrung his hands and seemed ill at
ease. But Wulf comforted him, say
ing:
"Grieve no more, father; let us think
of the Joy of battle, not of the sorrow
by which it may be followed."
"I find no Joy in battles," answered
the holy Egbert.
When they had slept awhile, Godwin
and Wulf rose and fed their horses.
After they had washed and groomed
them, they tested and did on their
armor, then took them down to the
spring to drink their fill, as their mas
ters did. Also Wulf, who was cun
ning in war, brought with him four
large wineskins which he had provided
against this hour, and filling them
with pure water, fastened two of
them with throngs behind the saddle
of Godwin and two behind his own.
Further he filled the water bottles at
their saddle bows, saying:
"At least we will be among the last
to die of thirst."
- Then they went back and watched
the host break its camp, which it did
with no light heart, for many of them
knew of the danger in which they
stood; moreover, the tale of Godwin's
vision had been spread abroad. Not
knowing where to go, they and Eg
bert, the Bishop of Nazareth âwho Was
unarmed and rode upon a mule, for
stay behind he would notâjoined
themselves to the great body of
knights who had followed the King. As
they did so, the Templars, five hun
dred strong, came up, a fierce and
gallant band, and the Master, who was
at their head, saw the brethren and
called out, pointing to the wineskins
which were hung behind their sad
dles:
"What do these water carriers here
among brave knights who trust in
God alone?"
Wulf would have answered, but
Godwin bade him be silent, saying:
"Fall back; we will find less ill
omened company."
So they stood on one side and
bowed themselves as the cross went
by, guarded by the mailed Bishop of
Acre. Then came Reginald of Chan
tillon, Saladln's enemy, the cause of
all this woe, who saw them and cried:
"Sir knights, whatever they may
say, I know you for brave men, for I
hove heard the tele of your doings
among the Assassins. There is room
for you among my suiteâfollow me."
"As well him as another," said
Godwin. 'Let us go where we are
led." So they followed him.
By the time that the army reached
Kenna. where once the water was
made wine, the July sun was already
hot and the spring was so soon drunk
dry that many men could get no wa
ter. On they pushed into the desert
lands below, which lay between them
and Tiberias, and were bordered
on the right and left by hills. Now
clouds of dust were seen moving
across the plains and in the heart of
them bodies of Saracen horsemen,
which continually attacked the van
guard under Count Raymond and as
continually retreated before they
could be crushed, slaying many with
their spears and arrows. Also these
came round behind them and charged
the rear guard, where marched the
Templars and the light armed troops
named Turcopoles and the band of
Reginald Chantillon, with which rode
the brethren.
From noon till near sundown the
long harassed line, broken now into
fragments, struggled â¢ forward across
the rough, stony plain, the burning
heat beating upon their armor till the
air danced around it as it does before
a fire. Toward evening men and
horses became exhausted and the sol
diers cried to their captains to lead
them to water. But in that place
there was no water.
The rearguard fell behind, worn out
with constant attacks that must be re
pelled in the burning heat, so that
there was a great gap between it and
the King, who marched in the center.
Messages reached them to push on, but
they could not, and at length camp was
pitched in the desert near a place called
Marescaleia, and upon this camp Ray
mond and his vanguard were forced
back. As Codwin and Wulf rode up,
they saw him come in bringing his
wounded with him, and heard him pray
the King to push on and at all hazards
to cut his way through to the lake,
where they might drinkâaye, and
heard the King say that he could not,
since the soldiers would march no more
that day. Then Raymond wrung his
hands in despair and rode back to his
men, crying aloud:
"Alas! alas! O Lord God, alas! We
are dead, and thy kingdom is. lost."
That night none slept, for all were
athirst, and who can sleep with a burn
ing throat? Now also Godwin and
Wulf were no longer laughed at be
cause of the water skins they carried
on their horses. Rather did great no
bles come to them, and almosi on their
knees crave for the boon of a single
cup. Having watered their horses
sparingly from a bowl, they gave what
they could, till at length only two skins
remained, and one of these was spilt
by a thief, who crept up and slashed
it with his knife that he might drink
while the water ran to waste. After
this the brethren drew their swords
and watched, swearing that they would
kill any man who so much as touched
the skin which was left.
All that long night through there
arose a confused clamour ' from the
camp, of which the burden seemed to
be, "Water! Give us water!" while
from without came the shouts of the
Saracens calling upon Allah. Here,
too, the hot ground was covered with
pcrub dried to tinder by the summer
drought, and to this the Saracens set
fire so that the smoke rolled down on
the Christian host and choked them,
and the place became a hell.
Day dawned at last, and the army
was formed up in order of battle, its
two wings being thrown forward. Thus
they struggled on, those of them that
were not too weak to stir, who were
slaughtered as they lay. Nor as yet
did the Saracens attack them, since
they knew that the sun was stronger
than all their spears. On they labored
toward the northern wells, till about
midday the battle began with a flight
of arrows so thick that for a while they
hid the heavens.
After this came charge and counter
charge, attack and repulse, and al
ways above the noise of war that
dreadful cry for water. What chanced
Godwin and Wulf never knew, for the
smoke and dust blinded them so
that they could see but a little way.
At length there was a last furious
charge, and the knights with whom
they were clove the dense mass of
Saracens like a serpent of steel, leav
ing a broad trail of dead behind them.
When they pulled rein and wiped the
sweat from their eyes it was to And
themselves with thousands of others
upon the top of a steep hill, of which
the sides were thick with dry grass
and bush that already was being fired.
"The Rood! The Rood! Rally round
the Rood!" said a* voice, and looking
behind them they saw the black and
jeweled fragment of the true cross set
upon a rock, and by it the Bishop of
Acre. Then the smoke of the burning
grass rose up and hid it from their
sight.
Now began one of the most hideous
fights that is told of in the history of
the world. Again and again the Sara
cens attacked in thousands, and again
and again they were driven back by
"the desperate valor of the Franks, who
fought on, their jaws agape With
thirst. A blackbearded man stumbled
up to the brethren, his tongue pro
truding from his lips, and they knew
him for the Master of the Templars.
"For the love of Christ, give me to
drink," he said, recognizing them as
the knights at whom he had mocked
as watercarriers.
They gave him of the little they had
left, and while they and their horses
drank the rest themselves, saw him rush
down the hill refreshed, shaking his
red sword. Then came a pause, and
they heard the voice of the Bishop of
Nazareth, who had clung to them all
this while saying, as though to himself:
i "And here it was that the Savior
preached the sermon on the mount.
Yes, he preached the words of peace
upon this spot. Oh! it cannot be that
he will desert usâit cannot be."
While the Saracens held off, the sol
diers began to put up the King's pavi
lion, and with it other tents, around
the rock on which stood the cross.
"Do you mean to camp here?" asked
Wulf bitterly.
"Peace," answered Godwin; "they
hope to make a wall about the Rood.
But it Is of no avail, for this is the
place of my dream."
Wulf shrugged his shoulders.
"At least, let us die well," he said.
Then the last attack began. Up the
hillside rose dense volumes of smoke,
and with the smoke came the Sara
cens. Thrice they were driven
back; thrice they cams on. At the
fourth onset few of the Franks could
fight more, for thirst had conquered
them on this waterless hill of Hattin.
They lay down upon the dry grass
with gaping jaws and protruding
tongues, and let themselves be slain
or taken prisoners. A great company
of Sf.racen horsemen broke through
the rang and rushed at the scarlet
tent. It rocked to and fro, then down
it fell in a red heap, entangling tha
King in its folds.
At the foot of the cross, Rufinus.
the Bishop of Acre, still fought on
bravely. Suddenly an arrow struck
him in the throat, and throwing his
arms wide, he fell to earth. Then
the Saracens hurled themselves upon
the Rood, tore it from its place, and
with mockery and spittings bore it
down the hill toward their camp, as
ants may be seen carrying a little
stick into their nest, while all who
were left alive of the Christian army
stared upward, as though they await
ed some miracle from heaven. But
no angels appeared in the brazen sky,
and knowing that God had deserted
them, they groaned aloud in their
shame and wretchedness.
"Come," said Godwin to Wulf in a
strange, quiet voice. "We have seen
enough. It is time to die. Look!
ycnder below us are the Mamelukes,
our old regiment, and among them
Saladin, for I see his banner. Having
had water, we and our horses are
still fresh and strong. Now, let us
make an end of which they will tell in
Essex yonder. Charge for the flag of
Saladin!"
Wulf nodded, and side by side they
sped down the hill. Scimitars flashed
at them, arrows struck upon their
mall, and the shields blazoned with
the death's-head D'Arcy crest.
Through # it all they went unscathed,
and while the army of the Saracens
stared, at the foot of the Horn of Hat
tin turned their horses' heads straight
for the royal standard of Saladin.
On they struggled, felling or riding
down a foe at every stride. On. still
on, although Flame and Smoke bled
frcm a score of wounds.
They were among the Mamelukes,
where their line was thin. By heaven!
they were through them and riding
straight at the well known figure of
the Sultan, mounted on his white horse,
with his young gon and his emir, the
Prince Hassan, at his side.
"Saladin for you, Hassan for me,"
6houted Wulf.
Then they met and all the host of
Islam cried out in dismay as they saw
the Commander of the Faithful and
his horse borne to the earth before the
last despairing charge of these mad
Christian knights. Another instant and
the Sultan was on his feet again and a
score of scimitars were striking at
Godwin. His horse Flame sank down
dying, but he sprang from the saddle,
swinging his long sword. Now Saladin
recognized the crest upon his buckler
and cried out:
"Yield you, Sir Godwin! You have
done wellâyield you!"
But Godwin, who would not yield,
answered:
"When I am deadânot before."
Thereupon Saladin spoke a word and
while certain of the Mamelukes en
gaged Godwin in front, keeping out of
reach of that red and terrible sword,
others crept up behind and, springing
on him, seized his arms and dragged
him to the ground, where they bound
him fast.
Meanwhile Wulf had fared otherwise,
for it was his horse Smoke, '-eady
stabbed to the vitals, that fell as he
plunged on Prirlce Hassan. Yet he also
arose but little hurt and cried out:
"Thus, Hassan, old foe and friend,
we meet at last in war. Come, pay
the debt you owe me for that drugged
wine, man to man and sword to sword."
"Indeed, it is your due. Sir
Wulf," answered the Prince, laughing.
"Guards, touch not this brave knight
who has dared so much to reach me.
Sultan. I ask a boon of you. Between
Sir Wulf and me there is an ancient
quarrel that can only be washed away
in blood. Let it 6e decided here and
now and let this be your decreeâthat
If I fajl in fair fight, none shall set
upon my conqueror and no vengeance
shall be taken for my blood."
"Good," said Saladin. "Then Sir Wulf
shall be my prisoner and no more, as
his brother is already. I owe it to the
men who saved my life when we were
friends. Give the Frank drink that the
fight may be fair."
So they gave Wulf a cup of which he
drank and when he had done it was
handed to Godwin. For even the
Mamelukes knew and loved these
brethren who had been their officers
and praised the fierce charge that they
had dared to make alone.
Hassan sprang to the ground, say
ing:
"Your horse is dead, Sir Wulf, so ws
must fight afoot,"
"Generous as ever," laughed Wulf.
"Even the poisoned wine was a gift."
"If so, for the last time, I fear me,**
answered Hassan with a smile.
Then they faced each other, and oh!
the scene was strange. Up on the
slopes of Hattin the fight still raged.
There amidst the smoke and fires of
the burning grass little companies of
soldiers stood back to back while the
Saracens wheeled round them, thrust
ing and cutting at them till they fell.
Here and there knights charged singly
or in groups, and so came to death
and capture. Upon the plain hundreds
of foot soldiers were being slaughtered,
while their officers were taken prison
ers. Toward the camp of Saladin a
company advanced with sounds of
triumph, carrying aloft a black stump
which was the holy Rood, while oth
ers drove or led mobs of prisoners,
among them the king and his chosen
knights.
The wilderness was red with blood,
the air was rent with shouts of vic
tory and cries of agony or despair.
And there, in the midst of it all,
ringed around with grave, courteous
Saracens, stood the emir, clad above
his mall in his white robe and Jeweled
turban, facing the' great Christian
knight, with harness backed; and reddened, the light of battle shining in
his fierce eyes, and a smile upon his
strained features.
For those who watched the battle
was forgottenâor, rather Its interest
was centered on this point.
"It will be a good fight," said one
of them to Godwin, whom they had
suffered to rise, "for though your
brother is the younger and the braver
man, he is hurt and weary, whereas
the emir is. fresh and unwounded. Ah.
they are at it!"
Hassan had struck first and the
blow went home. Falling upon the
point of Wulf's steel helm, the heavy,
razor-edged scimitar glanced from it
and shore away the links from the
flap which hung upon his shoulder,
pausing the Frank to stagger. Again
he struck, this time upon the shieia.
and so heavily that Wulf came to ms
knees.
"Your brother is sped." said the Sara
cen captain to Godwin, but Godwin
only answered:
"Walt,"
As he spoke Wulf twisted his body
out of reach of a third blow, and while
Hassan staggered forward with the
weight of the missed stroke placed his
hand upon the ground, and. springing
to his feet, ran backward six or eight
paces.
"He flies!" cried the Saracens; but
again Godwin said. "Walt." Nor was
there long to wait.
For now, throwing aside his buckler
and grasping the great sword In both
his hands, with a shout of "A D'Arcyl
A D'Arcy!" Wulf leaped at Hassan as
a wounded Hon leaps. The sword
wheeled and fell, and lo! the shield of
the Saracen was severed In two. Again
it fell, and his helm was cloven. A
third time, and the right shoulder and
arm with the scimitar that grasped it
seemed to spring from his body, and
Hassan sank dying to the ground.
Wulf stood and looked at him. .while
a murmur of grief went up from those
who watched, for they loved this emir.
Hassan beckoned to Wulf with his left
hand, and, throwing down his sword
to show that he feared no treachery, he
came to him and knelt beside him.
"A good stroke," Hassan said faintly,
"that could shear the double links of
Damascus steel as though it were silk.
Well, as I told you long ago, I knew
that the hour of our meeting in war
would be an ill hour for me, and my
debt is paid. Farewell, brave knight.
Would that I could hope that we
should meet in paradise! Take that
star jewel, the badge of my house,
from my turban and wear it In mem
ory of me. Long, long and happy be
your days.".
Then, while Wulf held him in his
arms, Saladin came up and spoke to
him. till he fell back and was dead.
Thus died Hassan, and thus ended
the battle of Hattin, which broke the
power of the Christians in the East.
CHAPTER XIX.
Before the Walls of Ascalon.
When Hassan was dead, at a sign
from Saladin, a captain of the Mame
lukes naroed Abdullah unfastened the
jewel from the emir's turban and
handed it to Wulf. It was a glorious
siur-shaped thing, made of great
emeralds set round with diamonds,
and the captain Abdullah, who like
all Easterners loved such ornaments,
looked at it greedily, and muttered.
"Alas! that an unbeliever should
wear the enchanted star, the ancient
Luck of the House of Hassan!" a say
ing that Wulf remembered.
He took the Jewel, then turned to
Saladin and said, pointing to the dead
body of Hassan:
"Have I your peace, Sultan, after
such a deed?"
"Did I not give you and your
brother a drink?" asked Saladin with
meaning. "Whoever dies, you are safe.
There is but one sin of which I will
â not pardon youâyou know what it
is," and he looked at them. "As for
Hassan, he was my beloved friend and
servant, but you slew him in fair
tight, and his soul is now in paradise.
None in my army will raise a blood
leud against you on that score."
Then dismissing the matter with a
wave of his hand, he turned to receive
a great body of Christian prisoners
that, panting and stumbling like over
driven sheep, were being thrust on
toward the camp with curses, blows
and mockery by the victorious Sara
cens.
Among them the brethren rejoiced
to see Egbert, the gentle and holy
Bishop of Nazareth, whom they had
thought dead. Also, wounded in many
places, his hacked harness hanging
about him like a beggar's fags, there
was the black-browed Master of.the
Templars, who even now could be
fierce and insolent.
"So I was right," he mocked in a
husky voice, "and here you are, safe
with your friends the Saracens, Sir
Knights of the visions and the water
skins "
"From which you were glad enough
to drink just now," said Godwin.
"Also," he added sadly, "all the vision
is not done." And turning, he looked
toward a blazoned tent which, with
the Sultan's great pavilion, and not
far behind it, was being pitched by the
Arab camp-setters. The Master saw
and remembered Godwin's vision of
the dead Templars.
"Is it there that you mean \o mur
der me, traitor and wizard?" he asked.
Then rage took hold of Godwin and
he answered him:
"Were it not for your plight, here
and now I would thrust those words
down your throat, as, should we both
live, I yet shall hope to do. Tou call
us traitors. Is it the work of traitors
to have charged alone through all
this host until our horses died be
neath us?"âhe pointed to where
Smoke and Flame lay with glazing
eyesâ"to have unhorsed Saladin and
to have slain this Prince in single
combat?" and he turned to the body
of the emir, Hassan, which the ser
vants were carrying away.
"You speak of me as wizard and
murderer," he went on, "because some
angel brought me a vision which, had
you believed it, Templar, would have
saved tens of thousands from a bloody
death, the Christian kingdom from
destruction and yonder holy thing
from mockery," and with a shudder
he glanced at the rood which Its cap
tors had set upon a rock not far away
with a dead knight tied to its black
arms. "You, Sir Templar, are the mur
derer who by your madness and am
bition have brought ruin on the cause
of Christ, as was foretold by the
Count Raymond." â¢
"That other traitor who also has es
caped," snarled the Master.
Then Saracen guards dragged him
away and they were parted.
By now the pavilion was up and Sa
ladin entered It. saying:
"Bring before me the King of the
Franks and Prince Arnat, hÂ© who is
called Reginald of Chatillon."
Then a thought struck him, and he
called to Godwin and Wulf, saying:
"Sir Knights, you know our tongue;
give up your swords to the officerâ they
shall be returned to youâand come, be
my Interpreters."
So the brethren followed him into the
tent, where presently were brought the
wretched King and the gray-haired
Reginald de Chatillon, and with them
a few other great knights, who, even
in the midst of their misery, stared at
Godwin and Wulf in wonderment. Sa
ladin read the look, and lest their pres
ence should be misunderstood, Bald:
"King and nobles, be not mistaken.
These knights are my prisoners, as you
are, and none have shown themselves
braver to-day, or done me and mine
more damage. Indeed, had it not been
for my guards, within the hour I
should have fallen beneath the sword
of Sir Godwin. But as they know
Arabic, I have asked them to render
my words into your tongue Do you
accept them as interpreters'/ If not,
others must be found."
When they had translated this, the
King said that he accepted them, add
ing to Godwin:
"Would that I had also accepted you
two nights gone as an interpreter of
the will of heaven!"
' The Sultan bade his captains be
seated, and seeing their terrible thirst,
commanded slaves to bring a great
bowl of sherbet made of rose water,
cooled with snow, and with his own
hands gave it to King Guy. He drank
in great gulps then passed the bowl
to Reginald de Chatillon, whereon
Saladin cried out to Godwin:
"Say to the King it is he and not
I who gives this man to drink. There
is no bond of salt between me and the
Prince Arnat."
Godwin translated, sorrowfully
enough, and Reginald, who knew the
habits of the Saracens, answered:
"No need to explain. Sir Knight;
those words are my death warrant.
Well, I never expected less."
Then Saladin spoke again.
"Prince Arnat, you strove to take
the holy city of Mecca and to dese
crate the tomb of the prophet, and
then I swore to kill you. Again, when
in a time of peace a caravan came
from Egypt and passed by Esh-Sho
bek, where you were, forgetting your
oath, you fell upon" them and slew
them. They asked for mercy in the
name of Allah, saying that there was
truce betwen Saracen and Frank. But
you them, telling them to seek
from Mahomet, in whom they trusted.
Then for the second time I swore to
kill you. Yet I give youj one more
chance. Will you subscribe the Koran
and embrace the faith of Islam. Or
will you die?"
Now the lips of Reginald turned
pale and for a moment Ire. swayed
upon his seat. Then his courage
came back to him and he answered In
a strong voice:
"Sultan, I will have none of your
rrercy at such a pi'ice, nor do I bow
the knee to your dog of a false
prophet, who perish in the faith of
Christ, and, being weary of the world,
am content to go to him. - '
Saladin sprang to his feet, his very
beard bristling with wrath, and draw
ing his saber, shouted aloud:
"You scorn Mahomet! Behold! I
avenge Mahomet upon you! Take him
away!" Then he struck him with' the
fiat of his scimitar.
Then Mamelukes leaped upon the
Prince. Dragging him to the entrance
of the tent, they forced him to his
knees and there beheaded him In sight
of the soldiers and of the other pris
oners.
Thus, bravely enough, died Reginald
de Chatillon, whom the Saracens called
Prince Arnat. In the hush that fol
lowed this terrible deed King Guy said
to Godwin:
"Ask the Sultan If It Is my turn
next."
"Nay," answered Saladin; "kings do
not kill kings, but that truce-breaker
has met with no more than his de
serts."
Then came a scene still more dread
ful. Saladin went to Hie door of his
tent, and standing over- the body of
Reginald, bade them parade the cap
tive Templars and Hospitalers before
him. They were brought to the num
ber of over two hundred, for it was
easy to distinguish them by the red and
white crosses on their breasts.
"These also are faith-breakers," he
shouted, "and of their unclean tribes
will I rid the world. Ho! my emirs
and doctors of the law," and he turned
to the great crowd of his captains
about him, "take each of you one of
them and kill him."
Now the emirs hung back, for though
fanatics they were brave, and .loved
not this slaughter of defenseless men,
and even the Mamelukes murmured
aloud.
But Saladin cried again:
"They are worthy of death, and he
who disobeys my command shall him
self be slain."
"Sultan," said Godwin, "we cannot
witness such a crime; we ask that we
may die with them."
"Nay," he answered: "you have eaten
of my salt, and to kill you would be
murder. Get you to the tent of the
Princess of Baalbec yonder, for there
you will see nothing of the death of
these Franks, your fellow-worshipers."
So the brethren turned, and led by a
Mameluke, fled aghast for the first time
in their lives, past the long line of
Templars and Hospitalers, who in the
last red light of the dying day knelt
upon the sand and prayed, while the
emirs came up to kill them.
They entered the tent, none forbid
ding them, and at the end of it saw
two women crouched together on some
cushion?, who rose, clinging to each
other. Then the women sprang for
ward with a cry of Joy, saying:
"So you liveâyou live!"
"Aye, Rosamund," answered Godwin,
"to see this shameâwould God that we
did notâwhile others die. They mur
der the knights of the holy orders. To
your knees and pray for their passing
souls."
So they knelt down and prayed till
the tumult died away, and they knew
that all was done.
"Oh. my cousins," said Rosamund, as
she staggered to her feet at length,
"what a hell of wickedness and blood
shed in which we dwell! Save me from
it if you love meâl beseech you save
me!"
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
"We will do our best," they answer
ed; "but let us talk no more of these
things which are the decree of God â
lest we should go mad. Tell us your
story."
But Rosamund had little to tell, ex
cept that she had been well treated and
always kept by the person of the Sul
tan, marching to and fro with his army,
for he waited the fulfillment of his
dream concerning her. Then they told
her all that had chanced to them; also
of the vision of Godwin and its dread
ful accomplishment and of the death of
Hassan beneath the sword of Wulf. At
that fctory Rosamund wept and shrank
from him a little, for though it was
this Prince who had stolen her from
her home, she loved Hassan. Yet when
Wulf said humbly:
"The fault Is not mine; It was so
fated. Would that I had died instead
of this Saracen!" she answered: "No,
no; I am proud that you should have
conquered."
But Wulf shook his head and said:
"I am not proud. Although weary
with that awful battle, I am still the
younger and stronger man, though at
first he well nigh mastered me by his
skill and quickness. At least, we part
ed friends. Look, he gave me this,"
and he showed her the great emerald
badge which the dying Prince had
given him.
Masouda, who all this while had sat
very quiet, came forward and looked
at it.
"Do you know," she asked, "that
this Jewel is very famous, not only
for Its value, but because It Is said to
have belonged to one of the children
of the prophet and to bring good for
tune to.its owner?"
Wulf smiled.
"It brought little to poor Hassan
but now when my grandsire's sword
shore the Damascus steel as though
it were wet clay."
"And sent him swift to Paradise,
where he would be, at the hands of
a gallant foe," answered Masouda.
"Nay, all his life this emir was happy
and beloved by his sovereign, his
wives, his fellows and his servants,
nor do I think that he would have de
sired another end whose wish was to
die in battle with the Franks. At least
there is scarce a soldier in the Sul
tan's army who would not give all he
had for yonder trinket, which Is
known throughout the land as the
Star of Hassan. So beware. Sir Wulf,
lest you be robbed or murdered, al
though you have eaten the salt of
Salah-ed-din."
"1 remember the captain Abdullah
looking at it greedily and lamenting
that the Luck of the House of Hassan
would pass to an unbeliever," said
Wulf. "Well, enough of this trinket
and its dangers; I think that Godwin
has words to say."
"Yes," said Godwin. "We are here
in your tent through the kindness of
Saladin, who did not wish us to wit
ness the death of our comrades, but
to-morrow we shall be separated
again. Now if you are to escapeâ"
"1 will escape! I must escape, even
If I am recaptured and die for it,"
broke in Rosamund passionately.
"Speak low," said Masouda. "I saw
the eunuch Mesrour pass the door of
the tent, and he is a spyâthey are all
spies."
"If you are to escape," repeated God
win in a whisper, "it must be within
the next few weeks, while the army is
on the march. The Tisk Is great to all
of usâeven to you, and we have no
plan. But, Masouda, you are clever;
make one and tell it to us."
She lifted her head to speak when
suddenly a shadow fell upon them. It
was that of the head eunuch, Mesr**nir,
a fat, cunnlng-faced man, with a cring
ing air. Low he bowed before them,
saying:
"Your pardon, O Princess. A mes
senger has come from Salah-ed-din
demanding the presence * of these
knights at the banquet that he has
made ready for his noble prisoners."
"We obey," said Godwin, and rising
they bowed to Rosamund and to Ma
souda, then turned to go, leaving the
star jewel where they had been seated.
Very skillfully Mesrour covered it
with a fold of his robe, and under shel
ter of the fold slipped down his hand
and grasped it, not knowing that al
though she seemed to be turned away
Masouda was watching him out of the
corner of her eye. Waiting till the
brethren reached the tent door, she
called out:
"Sir Wulf, are you already weary of
the - enchanted Star of Fortune, or
would you bequeath It to us?"
Now Wulf came back, saying heav
ily:
"I forgot the thingâwho would not at
such a time? Where is it? I left it on
the cushion."
"Try the hand of Mesrour," said Ma
souda, whereat with a very crooked
smile the eunuch produced it and said:
'T wished to show you, Sir Knight,
that you must be careful with such
gems as these, especially in a camp
where there are so many dishonest per
sons."
"I thank you." answered Wulf as
he took it; "you have shown me."
Then, followed by the sound of Ma
souda's mocking laughter, they left
the tent.
The Sultan's messenger led them
forward, across ground strewn with
the bodies of the murdered Templars
and Hospitalers, lying as Godwin had
seen them in his dream on the moun
tain top near Nazareth. Over one of
these corpses Godwin stumbled In the
gloom, so heavily that he fell to his
knees. He searched the face in the
starlight, to find it was that of a
knight of the Hospitalers of whom he
had made a friend at Jerusalemâa
very good and gentle Frenchman, who
had abandoned high station and large
lands to join the order for the love
of Christ and charity. Such was his
reward on earthâto be struck down
in cold blood, like an ox by its butch
er. Then, muttering a prayer for the
repose of this knight's soul, Godwin
rose and, tilled with horror, followed
on to the royal pavirlon, wondering
why such things were.
Of all the strange feasts that they
ever ate the brethren found this the
strangest and the most sad. Saladin
was seated at the head of the table
with guards and officers standing be
hind him and as each dish was
brought he tasted it and no more, to
show that it was not poisoned. Not
far from him sat the King of Jerusa
lem and his brother and all down the
board great captive nobles to the
number of fifty, or more.
Sorry spectacles wejte these gallant
knights in their hewff and blood
stained armor, pale-faced, too, with
eyes set wide in horror at the dread
deeds they had just seen done. Yet
they ate, and ate ravenously, for now
that their thirst was satisfied, they
were mad with hunger. Thirty thou
sand Christians lay dead on the horn
and plain of Hattin; the kingdom of
Jerusalem was destroyed and its King
a prisoner. The holy rood was taken
as a trophy. Two hundred knights of
the sacred orders lay within a score of
yards of them, butchered cruelly by
those very emirs and doctors of the
law who stood grave and silent behind
their master's seat, at the ' express
command of that merciless master.
Defeated, shamed, bereaved âyet they
ate, and, being human, could take
comfort from the thought that having
eaten, by the law of the Arabs.'at least
their lives were safe.
Saladin called Godwin and Wulf to
him that they might Interpret for him,
and gave them food, and they also ate
who were compelled to it by hunger.
"Have you seen your cousin, the
Princess?" he asked; "and how found
you her?" he asked presently.
Then, remembering over what he
had fallen outside her tent, and look
ing at those miserable feasters, anger
took hold of Godwin, and he answered
boldly:
"Sire, we found her sick with the
sights an/1 sounds of war and shamed
to know that her uncle,-the conquer
ing sovereign of the East, had slaught
ered two hundred unarmed men."
Wulf trembled at his words, but
Saladin listened and showed no anger.
"Doubtless," he answered, "she
things me cruel, and you also think me
crU eiâa despot who delights in the
death of his enemies. Yet it is not bo,
for I desire peace and to save life, not
to destroy It It is you Christians who
for hard upon a hundred years have
drenched these sands with blood, be
cause you say that you wish to possess
the land where your prophet lived and
died more than eleven Centuries ago.
How many Saracens have you elaln\
Hundreds of thousands of them. More-i
over, peace with you is no peace. These
orders that I destroyed to-nlght have
broken it a score of times. Well, I will
bear no more. Allah has given me and
my army the victory, and I will take
your cities and drive the Franks back
into the sea. Let them seek their own
lands and worship Allah there after
their own fashion and leave the East
In quiet.
"Now, Sir Godwin, tell these captives
for me that to-morrow I send those of
them who are unwounded to Damscus,
there to await ransom while I besiege
Jerusalem and the other Christian
cities. Let them have ho fear; I have
emptied the cup of my anger; no more
of them shall die, and a priest of their
faith, the Bishop of Nazareth, shall
stay with their sick in my army to
minister to them after their own rites."
So â¢Godwin rose and told them, and
they answered not a word, who had
lost all hope and courage.
Afterward he asked whether he and
his brother were also to be sent to Da
mascus. .
Saladin replied, "No; he would keep
thpm fora while to interpret, then they
might go their ways without ransom."
On the morrow, accordingly, the cap
tives were sent to Damascus, and that
day Saladin took the castle of Tiberias,
setting at liberty Eschiva, the wife of
Raymond, and her children. Then he
moved on to Acre, which he took, re
lieving four thousand Moslem captives,
and so qn to other towns, all of which
feil before him, till at length he came
to Ascalon, which he besieged in form,
setting up his mangonels against its
walls.
The night was dark outside of As
calon, save when the flashes of light
ning in the storm that rolled down
from the mountains to the sea lit it up,
showing the thousands of white tents
set around the city, the walls and the
sentries who watched upon them, the
feathew palms that stood against the
sky, the mighty, snow-crowned range
of Lebanon and encircling all the black
breast of the tioubled ocean. In a
little open space of the garden of an
empty house that stood without the
wails, a man and a woman were talk
ing, both of them wrapped in dark
cloaks. They were Godwin and Ma
souda.
"Well." said Godwin, eagerly, "is all
ready?"
She nodded and answered:
"At length, all. To-morrow afternoon
an assauÃ will be made upon Ascalon,
but even if it is taken the camp will
net be moved that night. There will
be great confusion and Abdullah, who
is somewhat sick, will be the captain
of the guard over the Princess' tent.
He will allow the soldiers to slip away
to assist in the sack of the city, nor
will they betray him. At sunset but
one eunuch will be on watchâMes
rour. and I will And means to put him
to sleep. Abdullah will bring the Prin
cess to this garden disguised as his
young son and there you two and I
shall meet them."
"What then?" asked Godwin.
"Do you remember the old Arab
who brought you the horses Flame
and Smoke and took no payment tot
them, he who was named Son of the
Sand? Well, as you know, he is my
uncle, and he has more horses of that
breed. I have seen him and he is
well pleased at the tale of Flame and
Smoke and the knights who rodfe
them, and more particularly at the
way in which they came to their end,
which he says has brought credit to
their ancient blood. At the end of
this garden is a cave, which was once
a sepulchre. There we shall find the
horses âfour of them âand with them
my uncle. Son of the Sand, and by the
morning light we shall be a hundred
miles away and lie hid with his tribb
until we can slip to the coast and
board a Christian ship. Does it please
you ?"
"Very well; but what Is Abdullah's
price?"
"One onlyâthe enchanted star, th*
Lurk of the House of Hassanâfor
nothing else will he take such risks.
Will Sir Wulf give it?"
"Surely," answered Godwin with a
laugh.
"Good. Then it must be done to
night. When I return I will send Ab
dullah to your tent. Fear not: if he
takes the jewels he will give the price,
since otherwise he thinks it will bring
him ill fortune."
"Does the lady Rosamund know?"
asked Godwin again.
She shook her h<-ad.
"Nay, she is mad to escape; she
thinks of little else all day long. But
what is the use of telling her till the
time comes? The fewer in such a plot
the better, and if anything goes wrong,
it is well that she should be innocent,
for then "
"Then death, and farewell to all
things," said Godwin; "nor Indeed
should I grieve to say them good-by.
But. Masouda, you run great peril.
Tell me now, honestly, why do you do
this?"
As he spoke the lightning flashed and
showed her face as sne stood there
against a background of green leaves
and red lily flowers. There was a
strange look upon It that made Godwin
feel afraid, he knew not of what.
"Why did I take you Into my inn
yonder in Beirut when you were the
pilgrims Peter and John? Why did I
lind you the best horses in Syria and
guide you to the Al-Jebal? Why did
I often dare death by torment for you
there? Why did I save the three of
you? And, why for this weary while,
have Iâwho, after all, am nobly born
âbecome the mock of soldiers and the
tire-woman of the Princess of Baal
bec?"
"Shall I answer?" she went on,
laughing. "Doubtless in the beginning
because I was the agent of Sinan,
charged to betray such knights aB you
are Into his hands, and afterward be
cause my heart was filled with pity
and love lady Rosamund?"
Again the lightning flashed, and this
time that strange look had spread from
Masouda's face to the .face of Godwin.
"Masouda," he said in a whisper,
"oh! think me no vain fool, but since
it is best perhaps that both should
know full surely, tell me, Is it as I
have sometimesâ"
"Feared?" broke tn Masouda with
her little mockmg laugh. "Sir God
win, it is so. What does your faith
teachâthe faith in which I was bred,
and lost, but that now Is mine again
because it is yours l ? That men and
women are free, or so some reaf it.
Well, it or they are wrong. We are not
free. Was I free when I first saw your
eyes in Beirut, the eyes for which I
had been watching all my life, and
something came from you to me, and I
âyÂ»e cast-off plaything of Sinan â
loved you, loved you, loved youâto my
own doom? Yes, and rejoiced that It
was so, and rejoice that it is so, and
would choose no other fate, because in
that love I learned that there is a
meaning In this life, and that there is
an answer to it, otherw here if not here.
Nay, speak not_ I know your oath, nor
would I tempt you to its breaking.
But, Sir Godwin, a woman such as the
Lady Rosamund cannot love two men,"
and as she spoke Masouda strove to
search his face while the shaft went
home.
"Masouda," went on Godwin, taking
no note of her words, "although we
may guess her mind, our lady has said
nothing yet. Also Wulf may fall, and
then I All his place as best I can. I
am no free man, Masouda."
"The love-sick are never free." she
answered.
"I have no right to love the woman
who loves my brother: to her are due
my friendship and my reverenceâno
more."

''She has not declared that she loves
your brother; we may guess wrongly in
this matter. They are your wordsâ
not mine."
"And we may guess rightly. What
then?"
"Then," answered Masouda. "there
are many knightly orders, or monas
teries, for those who desire such places
âas you do in your heart. Nay. talk
no more of all these things that may
or may not be. Back to your tent. Sir
Godwin, where I will send Abdullah to
you to receive the Jewel. So, farewell,
farewell."
He took her outstretched hand, hesi
tated a moment, then lifted it to his
lips, and went. It was cold as that
of a corpse, and fell against her side
again like the hand of a corpse.
Masouda shrank back among the
flowers of the garden as though to hide
herself from him and all the world.
When he had gone a few paces, eight
or ten perhaps, Godwin turned and
glanced behind him, and at that mo
ment there came a great blase of light
ning. In its fierce and fiery glare he
saw Masouda standing with out
stretched arms, pale, upturned face,
closed eyes and parted lips. Illumined
by the ghastly sheen of the levin the
face looked like that of one now dead,
and the tall red lilies which climbed
up her dark, pall-like robe to her
throat, yesâthey looked like streams of
fresh-shed blood.
Godwin shuddered a little and went
his way, but as she slid thence into
the black, embracing night, Masouda
said to herself:
"Had I played a little more upon his
gentleness and pity, I tnink that he
would have offered me his heartâafter
Rosamund had done witn it and in
payment for my services. Nay, not his
heart, for he has none on earth, but
his hand and loyalty. And, being hon
orable, he would have kept his prom
ise, and I. who have passed through the
harem of Al-Jebal, might have be
come the Lady D'Arcy, and so lived out
my life and nursed my babies. Nay, Sir
Godwin; when you love meânot before;
and you will never love meâuntil I am
dead."
Snatching a bloom of the lilies into
her hand, the hand that he had kissed.
Masouda pressed it convulsively against
her breast, till the red juice ran from
the crushed flower and stained her like
a wound. Then she glided away and
was lost in the storm and darkness.

/-y ENOR MANUEL. ESPITACIO
HIGUERA DE MORENO'S si-
J egta was rudely disturbed by a
mtghty din in the front yard.
Ic'dolently patting the foliage of the
great grapevine, the lateral branches
â¢of which threw into shadow the en
tire ' house-encircling veranda upon
which ho was seated, the senor looked
out and at the point toward which five
low born but full lunged dogs were con
verging. Just beyond the yard gate,
eying the hostile demonstration in evi
dent trepidation, stood a man. He ap
peared to be a stranger, and an Ameri
cano at that. With a tew energetic in
sults the master scattered the yelping
pack, when the newcomer approached
and stood at contrast with his host
He was tall, gaunt, angular, with an
unbearded, tan-blackened face, and a
neivous restlessness of manner. The
other man was round, plump, indolent.'
with a complexion the native swarthi
iifcss of which had been modified by
his time-silvered hair and beard, and
much avoidance of sunshine; super
imposed upon this was the faint eru
bescence which told of long continued
commerce with the native wine of his
land.
The senor made a low bow of cere
monious politeness and motioned the
stranger to the easy chair just vacated
by himself. After a word of acknowl
edgment the guest began:
â¢â¢Harkens is my nameâJohn Har
kens. I've Just "
â¢ "Eh. Marcela!" and with an apolo
getic smile to the somewhat startled
stranger. Senor Moreno waved his
hand before his mouth and shook his
head.
A pretty dark-skinned girl of perhaps
eighteen summers, with a pair of glo
rious black eyes, light footedly ap
proached. The old man addressed a
few words to her, and she turned to
Markers.
"Meester, my papa say for you talk
to me. an' I'm goin' tell heem what
you say."
"Well. Miss, tell your paânowâ
that my team has got stuck down the
' road a piece an' I'd like to hire a span
of his hosses to.take me to Jolon."
The maiden hesitated, pondering
troublous!}'.
"I don't know what is 'stoke,' " she
confessed.
Mr. Harkens, figuratively, shouted
ixito the ear of a long hibernating im
agination to supply a synonym.
' Hoss tired. Lay down. No pull
him wagon. Savvy?"
As soon as the senor had been made
acquainted with the difficulty and its
proposed remedy he sprang to his
feet, made a couple of low bows and
spoke' energetically. His tone and elo
quent gestures, more clearly than his
translated words, indicated his belief
that the purpose of his long life un
doubtedly had been to arrive at this
day. that he might relieve the tem
porary inconvenience of a transient
stranger. He turned and issued a
command to a swarthy lad who, clad
in a gingham shirt and much be
w ashed pair of blue overalls, was
lounging in the yard. Another com
mand and a large, luscious watermelon
appeared. Over this refreshment the
host, through his interpreter, opened
conversation.
"You all alone, Meester 'Arkens, no?"
"No: my wifeânow âshe's back
there."
"You got some cheeldr'n, ain't it?"
"Nary a one."
"Tha's ver' bad. Heemself, 'c got six
teen."
"Gosh!"
Pity seemed to be mutual.
*' 'E say tha's ver' 'ot day, an' Jolon
eet ees long away an* high up. Eef you
will do heem the honor to honor heem
weeth the honorâ"
She gave It up and returned to head
quarters for a fresh start.
" 'E weel theenk It an honor eef you
weel stay here to-night," triumphantly.
"Thees 'ouse is yours."
. "Well, I'll see what the oldânowâ
woman thinks," and after clinking
glasses with his host and absorbing a
goodish dose of his wine Harkens joined
the boy, who was In readiness with the
horses.
An hour later a covered wagon
creaked up and Harkens alighted, fol
lowed by a woman only less spare and
angular than her lord. He began the
work of freeing the horses from the
vehicle, but Moreno, who had come up,
waved him back and with a gesture
brought to the task a couple of boys
(boys were plentiful thereabouts), and
with a courtly bow ushered the couple
within the plastered walls of his house.
The evening meal brought the Moreno
family together in force. A few of the
sixteen were dead or absent, but they
were more than represented by an ar
ray of sons-in-law and
law and their olive branches.
There was a seemingly interminable
time of punctilious individual presenta
tions; and it was with a sigh of relief
that the Harkenses finally sat down nn
either side of the host. In the course
of the conversation that ensued the
American explained that he had jour
neyed tfi these parts upon information
ânowâthat land might be had cheap
here. The senor delved Into his memory
and described the locations of several
quarter-sections known to be for sale,
giving minute directions as to the most
accessible route to
each.
Marcela showed
â¢tfie couple to their
room. When she
had withdrawn,
after seeing that
all* arrangements
for their comfort
were complete,
Mrs. Harkens
heaved a content
ed figh.
"I s'pose we've
routed that ole
man outen his bed,
but my! won't a
feather tick seem
nice after them
nasty spring mat
tresses? But how
much is he goin' to
charge?"
"I don't know.
No more'nânow âa
hotel, I reckon."
"You â don't â
know! â¢ Don't you
know that they
killed and cooked
five chickens,
butchered and
roasted a kid,
made pies an'
cakes an' all them
things, o' purpose
for us?" Then the
good lady somewhat irreverently gave
expression to a short but very decided
opinion anent the mental endowment
of general.
"An' as like as not them poor hosses
'11 git about half enough to eat. I
noticed he didn't let you go to the
barn."
"I'll go an' see," quoth the husband
with alacrity, and thus gained a short
respite. On his return he reported.
"They's hay enough in front o' them
two houses to furnishânowâa Te &\~
ment o' cavalry. I never see the beat."
"As the old sayin' is, 'Wilful waste
makes woful want.' " and Mrs. Har
kens sniffed, "How in the name o'
goodness do you s'pose all these people
live?"
"They live on their principal. When
he was showin' me through his orchard
an' garden a spell back, us a-talkin'
through that boy o' his'n, he told me
his father used to have aânowâgrant
o' three leagues square in this section.
Then, sez he, the Americans come, an'
he wasn't no match with 'em for money
gettin', he sez; an' he's let it all ânow â
slip through his fingers 'cep'n this three
hundred acres. It's a fine pronerty, an'
I thought he he was* showin*
the place to a maybe buyer; so I sez:
'I'm lookin' for land. What do you
hold your place at?' I sez. Then he
told about his pa an' ma dyin' In this
house, an' his first wife an' threeânow
âyoung uns buried on the hill, an'
about him plantin' that big grape vine
when he was ten years old, an' the boy
sez he: 'No, Meester, he am' goln' sell
thees land.' All the same, I'm goln' to
look up the records, an' If the place isâ
nowâmortgaged, an' I can buy the
mortgage, it'll be my land b'fore many
years."
"I hope to goodness you can, an' set
tle down. As the old sayin' Is, 'A rollln'
stone gathers no moss.' "
The next morning, promptly at the
time they had requested, the Harkenses
were awakened by a rapping at their
door. A hot breakfast was awaiting
them, and afterward, when they went
out, they found their horses hitched to'
their wagon.
There remained one formality to be
gone through, and Harkens, sliding his
hand into his pocket, turned to Mar
cela.
"Miss Moreno, ask your pa how much
Iânow âowe him."
"Pa" made his grandest bow, and
Harkens learned that " 'c coodn' geev
you moch of the comfortâver' poorâso
poor he was ashamed on himself; but If
Meester an' Mees'es 'Arkens was satis
fied, he would feel paid, two, three
times."
Th*Â» guests stared. Instances In
which their feelings passed as currency
were rare. Finally Harkens said:
"Well, shorely, your pa Isânowâreal
good; but I want to pay him somethln'.
Savvy?"
The reply was curt: "My 'ouse Is not
a 'otel."
"Well, let me payânowâfor the hay
my hosses et."*
Then the senor raged; he stamped
with his foot, he threw out his chest
and struck his breast with his hand.
His hot words were faithfully rendered:

So Harkens accepted the Inevitable

spised coin.

They were nearing Jolon when they
were overtaken by a horseman, in
whom they recognized Anastacia, a
grown-up son of their whilom host. He
rode beside the wagon, conversing on
different topics for a few moments,
then casually inquired:
"J'u lookin' for land, ain't it?"
"Well, lookin' around a mite."
"I know one fellah that's got a quad
der section qf good land, an' I theenk
he wants to sale."
"P'ssessory right?"
"Yals."
"That ain't wut> much money.
Savvy?"
"But it's good land, meester âmuch
good, land."*
"For how much?"
"I theenk about $300. Plenty cheap,
no?"
"Is it ânow âyour ranch?"
Anastacia looked ud with a smile of
engaging frankness.
"Don't tale my papa, for the place
jines his'n at the mouth of the canyon
and holds the range for hees goats."
"Well, we'll see."
Mr. Harkens saw, with the result
that a week later he made a trip to
Salinas in company with Anastacia Mo
reno. He returned the next day, free
to take undisputed possession of the
place which controlled Senor Moreno's
goat range.
If that gentleman felt any annoyance
over the transaction Â«he did not permit
it to become manifest. On the contrary,
he extended "the right hand of neigh
borllness with unhesitating affability
and pointed out the most promising
spot, in his judgment, for well sinking.
But Harkens had performed more
than one piece of business in Salinas.
As he reported to his wife;
"I found that the old feller has got
ânow âa three thousan' dollar plas
ter on his place, and the note is
mighty nigh matoored. So I hunted
up Stormson, his land lawyer, an'
found that the mortgagor wants his
money. So I up an' gives Stormson a
power of attorney to buy the mort
gage, an' tells him to advance as #
much as six hundred more if Moreno
should want it. That'll be more'n
anybody '11 lift, an' we'll ânow âsoon
have that 'ere ranch."
"As the old sayin' is, 'All things
come to him as waits," " and Mrs.
Harkens permitted her gaze to wan
der across the Moreno acres to the
low, rambling adobe house, . pic
turesque, harmonious, co-operating so
heartily with nature that it seemed to
blend into the eternal landscape. With
her mind's eye she saw it vanish,
grapevine and all, while in its stead
stood a self-conscious affair of wood
and nails, srarish with fresh paint and
morning glories.
Harkens built his cottage as near to
the boundary line between his ranch
and that of Moreno's as practicable,
and, In common with his neighbors,
busied himself In preparation for
farming time. As the autumn slid
into early winter the air became Im
pregnated with the aroma of many
lamp-light breakfasts, which, with the
faint reek of fresh turned sod, pro
claimed the advent of plowing and
seeding time. Every breeze came to
be questioned and every cloud to be
anxiously watched. However, Jupiter
Pluvlus was in a gracious mood this
season. In a short time the crows
feet left by the plows disappeared be
neath a verdant smile. The Jovial
wheat spears shot flourishingly- up
ward, "stooled," "booted" and all at
once, almost In a day, displayed their
headed promise of the future harvest.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
In tl|e late spring the fields donned the
soberer tints of middle age and beck
oned to the haymakers. The gray of
old age in turn was replaced in the
early summer by the russet brown
which told that the perennial miracle
of nature was complete.
It was about this time that Har
kens one day received a note written
in a neat, feminine hand, to the fol
lowing effect:
"Dear Sir: Yourself and ladies are
invited to attend a grand harvest
feast, barbecue, picnic and ball at the
grove near the residence of Mr. Man
uel Moreno, on September 16, 1895.
"Mr. Manuel Moreno and Lady."
Upon discussing this invitation with
his neighbors Harkens learned that
the notes had been scattered broad
cast, and that the function was
planned on an extensive scale. Rpr
miles around, the coming fiesta, sched
uled to occur on the anniversary of
Mexican independence, came to share
honors with the harvest as a topic of
conversation. Senor Moreno was
grandly reticent concerning his plan
of entertainment; but it leaked out
that the barbecued and other tooth
some eatables were to be of a quality
and in a quantity to bring despair to
a gourmand. There was to be a floor
among the trees for dancing, a string
band was to be on hand, prizes were
to be competed for in games, horse
racing and fancy riding! riata throw
ing, etc.
"As the old sayin' is. 'They're makin'
their bed an' they must lie upon it,' "
commented Mrs. Harkens to her lord.
"Tbe idee o' spendin' all that money to
be big Injun for a day. As the old
sayin' is, 'A fool an' his money is soon
parted.' " <
"Then I reckon weânowâbettern't
go," and the wily John stole a furtive
glance at his spouse.
"Oh, I s'pose we'll have to go," was
the* hasty response. "As the old sayin'
is, 'When in Rome do as the Romans
do.' But I don't know what I'm goin*
to do; I ain't got a thing to wear."
The headers came, eating their way
through the fields, and leaving in their
wakes vast wastes of stubble, thickly
interspersed with stacks of "settings,"
replete with the golden wealth of the
farms.
One day Harkens waded home
through the stubble over a somewhat
steep hill which separated his place
from the one adjoining his own and
Moreno's on the upper side. He seated
himself on a tree stump near the well
curb.
"Well, they've got Ruiz all threshed,
an' have started down around the hill
an'ânow âback up to Moreno's. It's
our turn after hjs'n. The separator is
doin' crood work, but I don't seem to
go much on them straw burnin' in
gines. The way theyâ nowâthrow
sparks 'pears to me is dangersome."
"Is that from the ingine?" queried
his wife, pointing to a thin, black col
umn of smoke which rolled upward
from beyond the hill.
"W'y. no; the ingine left afore I did.
I'm goin' to seeânowâwhat it means,"
and vaguely apprehensive, Harkens
walked up the hill. . In a moment he
rushed back, yelling:
"The stubble's afire, an* comin*
straight this a-way. Git sacks, Abbie,
an' helpânowâfight it."
The two hurried over the hill. Within
those few minutes the conflagration
had spread to an incredible width in
the thick, dry straw, while, urged from
behind by a stiff breeze, the flames
leaped forward with furious speed,
throwing up dense clouds of jet black
Wrm The le flfttg,.
smoke. The straw joints, crackling un
der the heat, sent forth a roar not un
like the rattle of musketry, or, as Mrs.
Harkens afterward expressed it,
"seemed 's if the whole world was a
baton o pup corn, an 'the devil was
a-shakin' the popper."
Frantically the pair beat at the blaze
with their sacks, but were crowded
steadily back up the hill. They
abandoned the idea of conquering the
fire and fell back upon the hope that
their retarding efforts might gain a
sufficient margin of time for assist
ance to arrive.
Looking forth anxiously, Harkens
saw the Senor Moreno and three of
his sons riding swiftly toward him,
lashing their bare-backed horses at
every stride. The fire had invaded
the Mexican's land and Was speeding
toward the "settings" which dotted his
place. Harkens saw the boys draw
rein before this section of the confla
gration, but Moreno shouted some
thing to them and pointed to the
American. They hesitated, and his
voice could be heard again, stern, im
perious. Then the lads whipped up
again. They abandoned their beasts
at Harkens' line fence and hurried
forward. The old man probably had
passed through similar experiences be
fore, as he knew exactly what to do.
Under his direction and with his as
sistance a considerable space in front
of Harkens' house, barn, etc., was
speedily back-tired. The on-sweeping
flames roared, blustered and threatened
up to this space and vanished with
ludicrous suddenness. The boys then
ran away toward their own Are. As
Harkens approached to thank Moreno
he saw the senor gazing stolidly over
his iiat, and turning his own eyes in
that direction the American saw wide
sheets of flame flinging nfty feet into
the air from three of the Mexican's
"settings," while two others were ir
retrievably doomed.
"You've ânow âlost your crop savin*
my property."
The old man, overcome as much by
the unwonted exertion as by the heat,
sat upon the ground ejaculating,
"Aqua; aqua!" Harkens had learned
so much of Spanish and hastened to
bring water from his well to his savior.
The latter then rolled and lit a cigar
ette, -meantime waving away the
other's fervent protestations.
Harkens saw the threshing crew run
ning toward the fire and he himself
hurried to the scene. When he re
turned two hours later the Mexican
was gone and his wife still was doing
vigilant police duty about the long
cold spot. Answering her natural
query, he said:
"Yes, we got the fire out. but not 'til
after it had burned out ole man Ben
nister âevery settin' goneânowâplumb
to ashes."
"My! Oh. my! Too bad! As the old
sayin' is, 'Fire is a good servant, but a
poor master.' What'll the poor man
do?"
They walked toward the house in
silence, until Mrs. Harkens spoke:
"How much has Moreno got left?"
"Three settin'sâ'bout enough to pay
for headln' an' sacks, after takin' out
hisânow âseed."
"I wish he hadn't helped to put out
that fire."
"I wish he had been anybody else,"
amended Harkens.
Another silence, then Harkens broke
forth:
"Well, dog gone it, if I back out, some
other feller'll slip in an' that won't
lelp the Greaser, nor us neither. An'
ye can't ânow âafford to let the thing
run."
"Well," mused the lady. "I s'pose this
settles that fee-esta. That'll go hard
for some, but I don't care. As the old
sayin' is, 'What is to be. will be.' "
As the days passed it became cvi

Harkens was t

Jl eral men, sitting in the court

iway of this landmark, dating back
o British rule, when Liimuel Jucklin
poke up: "And I understand that
t's not to be rebuilt. This shows how
11timent has grown in a certain di
f-ction. Why, I can remember the
.â rae whera if a still house had burned
!own they would have begun to re
uild it before the ground cooled off.
Every man in the community would
tave been interested. It would have
been almost like the shutting off the
supply of milk from a youngster. In
those days if a man hollered hello,
you'd ask him to have a drink before
you inquired the nature of his business
That much was naturally to be in
ferred. But a good many folks will tell
you that there want as much drunk
enness then as there is now. Well,
there want as many people. If there
had been as many people there would
have been more drunkenness. The fact
is that a good many men were about
full all the time, and as no one had
ever seen them sober nobody could
tell when they were drunk."
"Then you don't believe that a dram
is good for a man," said the County
Judge.
"Well, if he thinks it is, mebby it is
as long as he is justified In thinkin' so.
But in these days it requires about all
of a man's keenness, his freshness, you
understand, to make a livin' or to push
anything to success, and a good sized
horn of liquor nearly always takes off
the wire edge. I can recollect when
the average lawyer thought he had to
be about half drunk before he could
make a speech. Whisky gave him a
bigger flow of words, and as whisky
was the jury and sometimes the judge
as well as the lawyer, liquor appeared
to have pretty nigh everything its own
way. A trial want hardly anything
but a talkin' contest. The loudest
talker was usually regarded as the
smartest man, for of all critics in the
world whisky is the worst.
"Whisky not only furnished the ar
gument, but very often supplied the
cause of litigation. Most of the trials
were of a criminal nature, the cause
for an ordinary law suit having result
ed in a fight. And I could always be
lieve the- story they told on old Tom
Marshall, one of the greatest lawyers
of his time, I reckon. One day he was
rather hurriedly engaged to defend a
feller, but as he was pretty far along
in his cupsâquart cups at thatâhe got
off on his wrong foot and began to
prosecute. He tiptoed in his wrath.
He painted the feller as beln' the worst
scoundrel on the earth. Just then
somebody pulled at his coattall and
says, 'Tom, you're on the wrong side.'
What did Tom do, apologize? No, he
Just sloshed his liquor over on the
other side and there he was. He said,
'Such, gentlemen of the Jury, is the
false argument that will be brought
forward against this inoffensive gen
tleman,' and so forth, and then he pro
ceeded to clear him. The young lawyer
had to drink because the old feller set
him the example. Why, in those days
a man didn't think he was at himself
until he had about three drinks. There
was hardly any such thing as farm
machinery. They cut wheat with a
cradle and plowed with cast iron
thrashed grain with a flail andâ"
Here old Uncle Ben Weatherby
spoke up. "Yes, and folks were a
dinged sight better off then than now.
There wasn't half as much stealin'
a-goin' on."
"No," L/imuel admitted, "because there
want half as much to steal nor half
as many fools to.steal it. But when a
man thinks as you do, Uncle Ben, there
ain't no use to arguy with' him. No
body can successfully arguy with a
man that's a-livin' in the past. It is
of no use to dispute the writin' on a
tombstone. But I happen to remember
that in them good old days I had to
work on a farm and I know what it
was. There want hardly a book in
the whole neighborhood, and a news
paper was looked on as the agent of
old Satan himself. The result was that
when a man went a few miles from
home he was in a strange land. There
want a stove anywhere and to the
winter we nearly froze to death. But
there's no use in recountin' all of the
inconveniences. You won't acknowledge
'em anyhow."
"Well, that's all right," said the
Judge, 'but with all the liquor drinkin'
folks lived longer then."
"That so? The reports of the life
insurance companies don't say it. The
faster w.e get out of the good old days,
the longer the average of life. They
say it's on account of sanitation. But
there hasn't been much of a change
in that respect, in the country. But
here the average length of life is in

The WOMAN who is TOO AMIABLE J
â  | /HERE is she?
11l Where will we find her?
VAy I almost hear a cordon of
men firing the question at my
defenseless head and laughing de
risively that I should even have dared
to assert that even one woman in all
the wide world might possibly be
sifted out and labeled as being too
amiable.
One word, however, in defense of
the proposition. The woman who is
too amiable is one-third angel and
two-thirds fool, a combination that is
too weak to be managed, too good to
be reclaimable, too volatile to be
changed, and, in fact, too thoroughly
more or less negative not to entirely
obliterate her own light.
Woman, as a rule, has as many
tempers and caprices as a race horse.
You cannot always gamble whether
she will be left at the post or come
in tinder the wire, but the actual femi
nine tempers may be divided into two
distinct classesâthe tabasco brand,
that does a hot screaming act, and the
soggy apple dumpling kind, that set
tles down stubbornly in one spot, giving
you a terrific racket of indigestion
which you could not dislodge with a
root-raising derrick.
The hot tabasco-cayenne modifica
tion of temper we have all experi
enced. We have had our lips, our
hearts, our brains and our stomachs
fairly scorched by the spitfires. The
scars are still sensitive in many in
stances when perhaps those who in
flicted them have forgotten all about
it and the wretchedness and misery
caused. Your hot-tempered people
who never try to cultivate the beauty
of self-control, or the consideration

that spares the feelings of others, are
surprised ofttimes that the unfortu
nÂ£te who bears the brunt should be
either wounded or insulted. At the
period of irresponsibility of irritability
they vent a lot of spleen that is both
uncalled and unjust, the ebullition
perhaps of pent-up worries from other
sources that are poured out and all
over the first handy aspirant for hot
air treatment. Later when the irre
sponsible one is brought face to face
with the fact that he has -wounded
another, he is positively aggrieved that
his victim should have resented the
sting of the lash.
â¢ * Â»
It would be hard to say whether
men or women are most given to this
sort of outbreaks, although a man's
tempers have generally more reason
behind them, and yet that reason may
be contiguous to his own stomach. A
man's temper Jis often built on a dys
peptic basis when it flares up without
the aid of match or kerosene, and he
takes exception to everything said or
dene, and thinks every one else to
blame when the rock bottom facts are
that he, himself, is simply off his feed.
All the same my sympathies are with
the poor devil who gets the benefit
without the box receipts.
* â¢ ' * â 
The soggy apple-dumpling brand of
temper does not say the hot-tempered
things that hurt and cut so deeply.
The latter wounds, the former aggra
vates. The stubbornness that settles
down flat, that will not say or do any
thing or give any reason for it, would
aggravate a saint. Such a temper
spoils your pleasure and often upsets
all your plans, and, while you may be
brought up to a fit of frenzy by it, yet
it has the redeeming feature that there
are no uncalled for insults to cut into
youi very soul and burn your flesh.
There are many, we grant, who are so
utterly callous and indifferent that
nothing could feaze them, but unfor
tunately all are not so constituted.
But whether the woman possessing
either particular style of temper is not
better off than one who, even if pos
sessed of one or the other, has mas
tered the art of self-control and is al
ways amiable, might be questioned.
The woman who Is too amiable will
be imposed upon by her brothers in
early life as a preparatory course to
being slighted and Ignored on all oc
casions reaching down to her very
grave. The mother and father evsen
will say that it dots not matter about
Arethusia Jerusha, that she is "to good
she won't mind." Her big brothers
Will pile all sorts of odd jobs on her
weaker shoulders, compensating her by
telling her that she's "no end of a
brick," and if any one is to be left out
of a party it is the same amiable
Arethusia Jerusha, because she never
gets mad. while they would not dare
slight the hot-tempered Marianna
Maude for fear she would demolish .the
whole home ranch. Because the
amiable woman is not always hunting
for trouble and imagining slights peo
ple arc apt to think that she does not
see or notice, or if she does that she
does not care. No greater mistake
could be made in the majority of cases.
The amiable woman who is refined and
sensitive is too often most keenly alive
to every trifle and every inflection of
the voice even, but to spare her own
feelings she finds it more congenial to
ignore as completely as if she neither
saw nor heard.
This is not an indication of lack of
spirit, but is, rather, a more potential
desire for peace with its corresponding
abhorrence of scenes. The amiable
woman, however lovable she may be,
never enjoys her dues in this life. She
would rather do without than fight for
her rights, with the result that she does
without much that should be hers by
right divine. If she wants anything
done she soon learns that she must do
it herself or gq without. Others will
generously offer to do many things
for her, but. having nothing to fear
in the way of spasmodic outbursts of
temper, they will put her off from time
to time, finally neglecting entirely to
fulfill any promise. Her beart may be
set on any one thing, and much may
depend upon it, but her friends who
love her so much for her sweet dis
position and admire her so unstintingly
take good care to let it end right there,
they never think of keeping a promise,
even though her very heart may be
breaking because of disappointments
and ncr very living from day to day
depending upon the issue.
People pretend to love and to ad
mire the too amiable woman, but no
one ever respects fee* wishes. No one
ever takes her seriously until It be
comes a sort of premium on temper to
make yourself as disagreeble as pos
sible when people will fear yodr tem
pers and respect your wishes accord
ingly.
The amiable woman in her home gets
less than any one else. In her married
life, her husband never thinks that she 1
needs anything because she does no:i
insist upon having what she wants. ,
Her amiability is the loophole through
which others shirk their duty towards
her, and, while it may be a blessing to ,
others, to herself it occasions slights
innumerable from those who should 1
care for her, but who take advantage of i
her good nature by disregarding her
wishes at all times as they would not
dare do one whose temper was feared.
And, after all. it is. a mistake for onÂ«
to be too amiable. People forget you
have even ordinary rights and take ad

even the commonest courtesies of life

"So far as liquor makin' a lawyer or

of whisky mixed up in politics, and
there is also a good bit of old Nick

time when the man that could furnish
the most whisky was the surest of

whisky keg used for a ballot box, and
I never knew of anything more appro

but in these days liquor on a young
man's breath offsets a thousand letters
as to character. I notice in a newspa
per that the Emperor of Germany says
that beer is ruiniri' thousands of his
people. Temperance folks used to hold
up beer as a means of escapin' whisky.
But when a man's drunk it doesn't
make much difference what put him
there. I've noticed that a right indus
trious man can get drunk on beer, and
when it comes to drinkin', the average
man ain't wantin' in industry.
' "A good while ago when I didn't have

At the time this outburst of family
solicitude blocked my chosen career I
was earning $1- v week in a Chicago
foundry and paying my monthly dues
into the union. Still, that wasn't good
enough for me, so one day in midwin
ter the author of my being came on
and yanked me back to Mudville. He
had, he said, secured for me a position
ânot jobâin the village ice cream par
lor, where I was to work for nothing
and learn a genteel business. Note the
difference between a job and a position.
At the former I made two dusty dol
lars per day; in the latte: I wore a
tiean smile and a laundered shirt, with
the progpect of pulling down something
like $8 a week in the misty future. In
fact, I was slated to become a regular
dude.
Thtre wasn't much doing when I
butted Into the higher life as depicted
in a country ie c cream foundry in win
ter. It would have been more con
genial tending the lobster stall In a
city fish market. The Arctic soda
fountain, which had a thirsty Polar
bear climbing the North Pole for a
glass of sparkling sarsaparilla at the
top, was swathed in gunny sacks, and
the ice cream freezer was frozen fast
to the sidewalk in front of the parlor.
However, they let me turn the peanut
roaster, sweep out the shells and
monkey with the k*rpe*?tÂ« lam, s.
Three weeks I clung to this genteel
situation like a man afloat in deep
water with a shingle, while my dinky
competence nmas?ed in the foundivâ
coarse and uncouth placeâdwindled
softly.
"This is the limit, and then some," I
said to myself, after which I borrowed
Sl h from an opulent clerk in the
Pants Emporium and sidestepped
Mudviile in the night without Issuing
any handbills regarding my move
ments.
The first stop was at Omaha, the
theater of social and industrial tri
umphs two years before. There was
no one in the old shop 1 knew save a
son of the former boss. His father,
he said, was running a gigantic shop
nt Leadville and wanted vast quanti

ing gave Mr. Grlnderface more pain la
the legion of the moral sen?'- than to
see small boys playing ball in the
streets or dogs gamboling in the park
without muzzles or some other vicious
and unprincipled offender against the
law of the land pursuing hiy nefarious
practices. As for Sunday baseball and
the automobile that flyoth -y at mid
night he was wont to grow exceeding
ly black In the fa< c and choke up with
emotion whenever the spbiect was
mentioned. Those werÂ«r the tendencies
which foretold the downfall of the re
public, the straws which showed which
way the wind was blowing. It is un
necessary to add that Mr. Grinderface
was on the downhill sid.- of sixty and
that he always wore light gray gaiters
and a white vest with little b'ue dots
in it. He wore other clothes also, but
the o-nes we have mentioned are suffi
cient for purpose* of description.
J. Worthington was firmly convinced,
as we have Intimated, that ;he ruin of
the Government was impending unless
something could be done to inoculate
the rising generation with greater re
spect for law. Too often citizens
seemed disposed to regard law in the
same light as the ordinary five-dollar
bill of commerceâno good to any one
until it was broken. After breaking,
the period of usefulness, in both cases,
is usually very brief and very much
checkered. In feeling tones Mr. Grind
erface would allude to the cor
ruption that was rampant in
legislative. executive and ju
dicial circles. As long as men in sue h
positions were willing to allow offend
ers to commute their sins for gold the
future of the nation was trembling In
the balance. From the manner In
which J. Worthington delivered him
self of these profound thoughts you'd
have concluded that he was holding
the balance all alone and that when
de blink wit dat jiu-jitsu. I'm on. It
was a long time before I was on top,
but when I'd took twenty lessons from
Mr. Paul's Jap valetâand he's next to
de gameâl began to get on top about
once in twenty times. Do you want to
know what dat trick is? De professor
what is loining de New Yorjt cops de
game charges a million yenâdats
about five American plunkâa lesson,
but I'll put you wise for fun. It isn't
what you does to de odder mug dat

it's what he does to himself.
Listen. "Tommy," I says to me fren
de Jap, "give me a lesson in dis Orien
tal rough house, and I'll take you down
to de next dance of de Rose Leaf So
cial. Outing and Life-Saving Club^
"Sure," says Tommy, what his name
is Tomozo. so I calls him Tommy.
Well, he puts his little brown hand
on de lapel of me jacket, and he gives
it a soft little twist, and he smiles like
a kid wit a new football. "Now," he
says, "all you has to do is to get
away."
I tinks he was getting funny wit me,
but he says dat of course if a crook
was took soft and gentle like dat, he'd
try to get away, and I was to try like
I was a crook, and a cop had me by de
lapel. Just to please him I gives a
suddent solid jerk, for to loose meself,

to burn the rails to Colorado without
loss of time and cuddle down with the
old map. It was me to Leadville on
this straight tip.
I reached the great mining camp),
high up in the mountains, the posses
sor of $1 50 and some hand baggage.
The gigantic foundry, that had gone
daffy for want of hands, was a miser
able board shack containing Old Man
Thomas and one dejected looking
molder prodding around in some half
frozen sand. The old man was star
tled to see me and he choked and
spat copiously when I reeled off the
pipe dream his son had smoked for
my benefit at Omaha. Maybe the boss
had blown his bugle by letter and the
son was innocent of nipey deeds. Any
how, there wasn't enough work to
keep the foreman and his hired man
warm.
However, the prospect didn't daze
me. I was dazed already, having
been two days and nights in a day
coach without sleep. Mr. Thomas
kindly forsook his job and volunteered
to help me find a cheap place in which
to slumber a few paragraphs: he
would do that much for old times'
sake. We found lodgings over a keno
joint, and I had no sooner turned in
than the old man was back, thumping
at mv boudoir door. The dejected
looking molder Mr. Thomas had left
at the shack shop knew the foreman's
son was coming on from Omaha. Mis
taking me for that favored offspring,
the dejected mechanic jumped his job
rather than wait and be fired in the
evening. He was a proud and haughty
spirit, anyhow. The old man came
hustling back to tell me this, and. be
cause I needed the money. I crawled
out of bed and went to work at $5 a
day. Some neople are born to luck
and others stumble into it while walk
ing in their sleep.
Business picked up a bit by the time
the son arrived, and the boss found
werk for us all. But there was an
other less fortunate victim of this
gigantic foundry swindle. This was
Mr. B. Jones, a furnace tender, who
had worked with us at. Omaha. Like
myself, the confiding Jones took the
tip and galloped on from some place
h< lowa. He landed in Damp a bank
rupt and was eking out a greasy exist
ence as dishwaFher in a restaurant.
Sometimes 1 called on Mr. Jones and
found him enveloped in an air of ex
treme melancholy and a blue apron,
swabbing gravy off the plates in a
large tub. Jones was a diplomat. He
had soured on the Thomas outtlt, for
caure. and eventually he turned me
against them by depicting the joys of
railroading In Idaho. 1 had saved Â«p
SCO. and when Jones learned this he
â aid it was lime to start. He would
show the way to Idaho, while I backed
the enterprise. Sometimes I think B.
Jones was working me.
To save railroad fare to Denver,

be the to!e survivor to mourn the death
ot our institutions.
About the time that J. Worthingtim
was ready to give up in despair and
retire to his humble cottage at Lenox to
pats the remainder of his days in soli
tude and peace, a healthy reform
movement /was launched In the more
or less adult village where he did busi-
ness. The man who was on the ticket
for district attorney, and who was re
agonslble tor putting the ticket on its
feet, was an ambitious young lawyer,
about toil ' ears <>ut of college, with an
aversion to the overproduction of con
versation and a fondness for hard
work. In his opinion the only way to
do a thing was to rolt up your sleeves
and do it. Afterward you could bal
ance your books and find out whether
it paid or not At fÂ»rst sight this ris
ing .Napoleon of politics and J. Worth
ington Grinderface were due to occupy
the same new. Their ideas seemed to
he twins in every respect. The candi
dal : informed the dear public: on every
possible occasion that if he was elected
he would enforce the laws as he found
them, and J. Worthington, in the back
ground, raised a constructive cheer and
told the young man that he would
pray for his success.
The goodâand generally bunkoedâ
people were inclined to look on the
whole matter as a joke at first, but as
the game progressed and the candidate
grew ever warmer on the trail of the
law breakers, opinion became general
that he was a good thing and mlght
safely be pushed along. If It was a
joke it was just as well to finish it oft
in good style; any way, the candidate
was nutting up a good fight and de
served to have a look in. So when elec
tion day came, and afterward disap
peared, as all days do except the one
when that promissory note falls due,
soft brown hand on your wrist in a
soitan way, and you try to get loose,
if you try hard enough you truns your
elbow out of Joint; and his hand on
your arm will make you dislocate your
shoulderâif you try to get away. Now
you are getting wise, eh? It's de mus
cle you puts into de game dat puts you
out of It.
I hear dat de President Is going in
for de game. He should. It belongs to
de simple life he longs to lead. Dats
no joke. It's de simplest ting you
knowâwhen you know it.
I reads everyting de President reads,
when I know what he reads, sq when I
hears a lad on Sixt avenue giving de
cry: Here's your 'Simple Life,' rec
ommended by de President, and writ
by Wagner, de autor of 'Parsifal,' only
a nickel, half a dime, here you are!"
I pungles de price and .sinks de book in
me kick to read dat night.
Say, dat Wagner is all to de good.
He has de wisest coco on his shoulders
dat ever discovered great trutes. If
you're next to his line of life you don't
need nottin but tree square meals a
day. a good home, plenty of golf and
hockey and a pint of beer now and
den, to be perfectly happy.
Listen. He says, in dis book I'm tell
ing you about, dat if we are always
calm we will never get excited. Can
you beat dat? Can you? "Let not de
small afflictions of life bodder you," he
says, "for if dey do not bodder you,
you are not boddered by dem." Say, is
dat great? It is de limit? What!
But dat isn't all he knows. He's a
top-liner, and knows it all. "Do not
hold malice," he says. "To hold malice
makes man unhappy, and to be unhap
py is to be miserable, and to be mis
erable is to hold malice; therefore," he
says, "do not hold malice." Is he a
willy-wonder? Tell me, Is he a cham

which would have taken half my capi
tal, we walked out of Leadville, over
Mcsqulto Pass. 14,000 feet in the air,
pack-laden and bucking a blizzard. We
were sixteen hours reaching the valley
on the other side of the range, half
dead from cold and fatigue. There we
encountered a wandering woodchop
per and his boy. bound to Denver by
wagon. The party camped that night
in a deserted log cabin and the wood
choppers h-iuled us through to Denver
In the course of a week. Then the
wily Jones unfolded his scheme, which
was nothing more than a pair of fine
jobs In a railroad construction camp.
I kicked on that, having had one ex
perience in a Texas swamp, but Jones
assured me on his honor that Idaho
was all dry land. He had been there
and knew. The Oregon Short Line
was building fr -m Granger. Wyo.. on
the Union Pacific, to Umatilla, Or., on
the Columbia River. In that wild and
desert region good men were scare,
and Jones said they needed us.
The Short Line office at Denver gave
up 4aborers' passes to American Falls,
Idaho, on the representation of Jones
that we were expert drillers and blast
ers of iiva rock, bridge builders, mul*
skinners, and what not. I bought
blankets and grub, mostly air tight in
tin cans, and we pulled out for Idaho
in a F'ie< nil train of four condemned
cars jerked along by one crjppled

1 saw plenty of bottles, but not a
single cake'of soap in the entire cara

was all right and that we soon would
be there. At that, I liked the prospect

It was pn tty cheesy going for a
while after having Green River Junc

that classic flag station the Italian con
tingent, prow'ing in an alley behind
the grocery, found a box of quaran

lust is not a thing of rare and fragrant
perfume, and wshen the dagoes set
about boiling the codfish in the for

J. Worthington rubhtd bis hands to
gether and congratulated himself that
at last the smalt boys and th j dogs and
the shameless Sunday golfers and other
pernicious enemies of the national wel
fare would get all that was due them.
In a warm glow of civic righteousness
and exultation he sat him down and
dictated a letter to the recently elected
defender of the country's liberty, assur
ing him that he could have all the sup
port that J. Worthington could gee to
gether in the performance of the duties
of his oftice and pointing out several
directions In which be thought a be
ginning might be made with profit. For
example, he mentioned having seen an
alleged guardian of the peace brazenly
and in the full glare of daylight ab
stracting chestnuts from the cart of a
harmless won of sunny Italy. Can such
things be tolerated in free America,
the birthplace of human liberty and the
home of the oppressed of all nations?
he Inquired, in Impressive chest tones.
Then he suggested that steps be taken
to Imprpye the manners of street car
conductors. On numerous occasions, he
declared, he had been requested to step
lively by these hirelings of a soulless
corporation, and he tho-ught that some
thing ought to be done about it.
The erstwhile candidate thanked Mr.
Grlnderface for his interest and pro
ceeded to get busy with the duties of
his office. The first intimation that J.
Worthington had of the new District
Attorney's view of law breaking and
breakers was when he read in the
morning papers that various and sun
dry institutions for the investigation of
the laws of average and chance and
the promotion of the circulation of com
mon or garden coin had been raided by
the aforesaid District Attorney, and
seer. Listen. "Always pay for what
you buy." says dis great man, "and
den you'll never be in debt. To be in
debt," he says, "is to bid good-by to
contentment, and to bid good-by to

without contentment where are we?"
he says. "Derefore." says he. "have a

says he, "for dere is no place like

"Be good to your children," he says.
"Be good, and be just. Be Just good,"
he says. "If you are good and just to
your children, and dey finds it out. dey
will know it. Do not tell 'em, do not

pieces. Other daring spirits produced
a gunny sack and a committee of
abating nuisance mounted to the roof
of the Italian dining car.
In the front end of the coach was the
stove, which had a straight pipe lead
ing from the fire up through the car
roof. Into this pipe the committee
poured the minced gum boot and then
plugged the pipe with the sack, in
stantly the flavor of overwrought cod
fish faded away like the dew of the
morning, and the Italians would have
done likewise had they seen the ghost
of a chancy Wreaths, spirals and
streaks of dark purple smoke floated
from the car windows until the heads
of the strangling Italians blocked those
openings. Two of our men guarded the
front door with knives. The rear exit
was so effectively barricaded on the
inside that the frenzied inmates them
selves couldn't open it.
Stray Mashes of the crematine gum
boot' penetrated the rear coaches, but
tiie outcasts climbed to the roofs, and
thus diluted the main current with
fresh air, while the penned-up Italians
spluttered and gasped in the fumigating
oven. Both sides of the car were
draped in garlands and festoons of un
happy creatures, hanging from the win
dows, and it was said half a dozen or
so fell off and never were heard of
more. I learned afterward the Italians
expected the stuff in the stove to blow
up with fearful carnage, and, coming
that he was named as on? of the possi
ble defendants because it bad been dis
covered that the titles to two or three
of the lenvilfcÃ of chance were in the
name of J. Worthington Grinderface.
He was horrified that a more official
Should have so little regard for the dig

face, and hastened to assure that per
son that "he was making a serious mis
take. He informed him also that there
was a deep and wide gulf fixed between
pitting behind a faro table and raking

which said table is operated and col
lecting the rent therefor. The former,
he declared, is gambling and should be
prohibited: but the latter is business,
and no one should interfere with pri
\ate business under any circumstances.
The District Attorney regarded Mr.
Grlriderface with a cold and glittering
eye for v moment or two. Then he in
formed him that as long as business
men rent their property for illegal pur
potefl they must expect to be classed
with the lawhreakers whom they
skelter. This astounding heresy was
followed by the statement that it had
discovered that the tenement
house law was being broken into little
hits in several of the most disreputable
tenements in the city, some of the
worst of which were owned by a cer

against whom proceedings of a serious
and unavoidable nature were about to
be begun. When J. Worthington made
his stock reply to this that no officer
Ol the law should interfere with private
business, the District Attorney made
answer that po private business could
be allowed to interfere with an officer
of the law and that if any apoplectic
gentleman with shady real estate in
vestments got in the way he was likely
to be hurt
J. Worthington went his way breath-

of a tousand dollars every time ten
tousand of his books was sold here,
and he wanted to know what kind of a
country dls was, to do a man out of
his good long green in dat gold brick

way. He don't get no royalty rake-off
on his opray. "Parsifal," neider, but I
know he's a wise guy, and I guess he's
a good one.
But Tommy Lawson Is de white

to a few fine points in de game. Dere

Folks Is passing him out some hot

from a bomb-building race, this fear
buffaloed the whole crowd. There must
have been a dago or two from Paterson,
N. J., in that bflnch. In time the ixum
boot' calmed down and the surviving
codfish fiends fell back into their car
pale, sick and exhausted. The gum
boot was a beautiful ldea*in a way. for
the remainder of the trip the tourists
in the forward car stuck to cold vict
uals.
I never care to criticize the likes and
dislikes or the eating habits of my fel
low beings, but. honestly, in this in
stance I feel the dagoes got all that
was coming to them, and got it hot.
Gum boot, properly applied, is one of
the best disinfectants I know of for
shopworn codfish. Try it some time.
To my notion, the Italian rapidly is
supplanting the Digger Indian In this
qpuntry. You seldom see him without
his pick and shovel. This observation
has no special hearing on the fish story,
but I couldn't help wedging it in as a
delicate little bon mot. Besides. I get
so much per word for this stuff, and
every line looks good to me.
Thus, and in other harmless ways,

Such an outrage was unheard of!
There was weeping and wailing and
gnashing <>f teeth In more than one
dignified and highly respectable brown
stone front in that city when it was
learned that the malicious District At

the opprobrious epithet of criminal to
the conduct of men with incomes that
ran into five and even six figures. Such
a state of affairs could not be tolerated
and there was a gathering of the mil
lionaire clan which boded evil for the
said attorney. To be sure, the rail
roads paid their taxes and J. Worthing

their finesâthe jury balked at sending
such dignified elderly parties to jail
but when the next election came 'round
the young District Attorney learned
that for reasons which the Executive
Committee were not at liberty to state
it was deemed advisable to leave his
name off the ticket,. The free and sov

and then forgot all about him and
voted as they were told. J. Worthing

to start out.
"Murphy, you're a fool. You'd better

I received, . and everybody always
wound un with, "You'll make a deli
.cious stew for those pirates."
But, you see. i didn't make a stew,

â¢lully say I have traveled farther into
the interior of that country than any
other white man. Of course, I encoun

the one that proved the most serious
handicap was my inability to hire na
tives to carry supplies, and as I carried
a camera hnd quantities of plates it
Mas' no easy task reaching my destina
tion. Later on I found that the natives
were risht in refusing to trust their
l\ides too far inland, for I have seen
those heathen lie in wait for days*at Â«i
time watching for a stray victim, and
the way he was transtormed into
min'terneat was a marvel to me. One
or two or three savages would steal
out and lie in the thick undergrowth
and for days would be content to eal
grasshoppers, herbs or any other old
thing that chanced to be convenient,
and aril this was counted as naught if
one unfortunate was lured into their
Itching grasp.
In traveling from tribe to tribe I soon
learned that it v. as good policy to walk
up as though 1 owned the earth and was
X-orrtempiatlng putting a fence about
it immediately. As soon as natives
caught a glimpse of. me they would
shout and take to their heels, but I

run a safe distance, stop and Deer at

ways served as my greeting, and at
the! same time I gave him to under
stand by signs that I was hungry and
wanted something to eat. All this time
I kept my weather eye on him and my
hand suspiciously near something that
glittered brightly in the sunlight, for I
had no intention of taking too much
on faith. My one Idea was to impress
upon him that I came as a friend and
that I fully expected to be treated as
one. As soon as I could get their cos
tume I put it on and lived as they lived
In'every particular. When they danced
t danced, and when they howled I lifted
up my voice and went them one better.
To make. you clearly understand
about the houses, I must first tell you
that they differ somewhat according
to tribes, as do their customs, and I do
not want to convey the impression
that all the tribes are man-eaters,
though I have attended more func
tions of this nature than I cared to.
The houses are similar inasmuch as
they are but., some eight or ten feet
above the ground and are supported
by trees and logs that look too frail
to besr their burden. One big room
suffices for all purposes and they eat,
siren and live in it and seem to be
perfectly comfortable and satisfied. It
is uo rare thing to find thirty people
sleeping in one room, but as they do
not use beds or sleep in a reclining
position for that matter, they are not
overly crowded. Each person wraps
a blanket about him or her self and
sits down against the wall. Their
heads and shoulders are bent over
until it seems as though their bodies
would break in two, but to all intents
and purposes, the sleepers are quite
comfortable and cozy and they cer
tainly derive as much benefit from
their rest as the white man does in
his luxurious, soft bed.
The rats and smaller anjmals are a
source of great annoyance, so much so,
in fact, that the houses are planned
and constructed to keep them out. The
props are a uniform size, some six feet
from the ground, and then a round
block six or seven inches larger is
forced on.top of the main one and the
house proper built on this foundation.
The result is just this. When Mr. Rat
starts on his journey to the house he
crawls up the post to the larger piece
and. when he tries to climb over the
ledge he finds to his sorrow that it is
one too many for him and that he has
gained a sore head from his tumble
and a little heart-breaking experience.
The marriage ceremony of these peo
ple is more than Interesting, as it dif
fers from any other race-in the world.
When a man sees a girl and decides he
wants her for his wife he tells her so,
and if she thinks well of him he goes
to the father and asks him for her.
Both consents gained, he dons his war
clothes and starts forth on a bloody
quest. Before he can win the girl he
must visit a neighboring tribe, kill one
of the men and return the head to the
object of his affection in what is known
as a "head basket," which is woven for
this very purpose. Stealing up on a
sleeping man and killing him before he
knows what has happened to him
proves to the lady in question and to
her father that in times of war he will
be able to protect his family from the
enemy and that his arm is strong and
his heart true. This over the head is
buried arid the man and woman walk
solemnly through the village to the
beating of the tom-toms, and in this
way declare to their friends that they
are now man and wife. Nor does the
ceremony end here. Months later the
head is taken from the ground and fas
tened to the roof of the hut, and there
it remains revered as something sacred
and reminding all who enter that the
father of the family Is greatly to be
admired and feared.
Occasionally the parents raise some
objections and then there is a peck of
trouble brewing. If the man gives up
meekly and casts his eye about for
another wife, all is well and good, but
If he persuades the girl to flee with him
to a neighboring village, vendettas of
all descriptions fly madly through the
air and war is on in a minute. Over
goes the irate father and the son-in-law
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
promptly loses his head for being so
presumptuous and the daughter is taken
home with little or no ado. And what
.s more to the point, no blame is at
tached to bet whatsoever, for in his
:rude way. her father believes that un
less the man hai persusdod her in the
First place, such an ider- would never
have occurred to her, and therefore she
is not to be punished.
One might think that there would be
great immorality among these people,
but really I found only one tribe where
there was the least suspicion of loose
ness. Family relations are held sacred
and if any one forgets himself for an
instant and strays from the "straight
and narrow path, off comes his head in
the twinkling of an eye and' he is held
up ns an example to the rest of the
swains in the different tribes.
Half of life down there is spent in
hanging on to one's head. For each and
every offense the punishment is the
same, and it certainly does not pay to
sleep in the open, for when the mar
riage bug gets on the rampage some
body's head has to pay the price else
the compact is not properly sealed.
Death to the native is something
that occurs so frequently that he re
gards it very lightly and goes about his
way making preparations for it. A
blanket, commonly called the "death
blanket" is woven and kept to wrap
the body in after the spirit has started
or- its weary flight, and this must be
held in readiness in case death should
steal upon them unawares. In some
tribes they dress 'the body in all its
finery, bolster it into a sitting position
and then howl and scream about -t for
several days. They seem to think the
spirit can hear their supplications and
they are not slow in asking for every
thing under the shining sun.
This ceremony over the body is
placed in a rude stone box that stands
by the side of the house and boards
are placed over the top and cemented
with soil and water to keep the dogs
from molesting it. When another
death occurs in the family the bones
are removed, placed in. a sack and
hung in the hut, near the sacred head,
and it is no unusual sight to see a
number of grinning skulls staring
down and an alarming array of bone
bags decorating the celling.
Other tribes dig into the side of a
mound or hill and make a grave In
this fashion. After the body is taken
to its final resting place they seal up
the end of the cavity and leave it for
good and all. If it 4s disturbed it is
only because another occupant has
found its way to the burial ground,
for .the same grave is used until it Is
too crowded with bones to admit of
any more.
These people certainly deserve great
credit for one thing and that is their
ability to work and raise crops. From
early morning until late at night they
will labor in the Held and take it quite
as a matter of course. And such agri
culturists as they are, too!- Sweet po
tatoes that average two and a half
Â»nd three pounds each and onions that
fairly melt in your mouth. Besides
this they have a peculiar red rice that
is entirely different from that used by
the whites. In the first place *t is
much larger and has a peculiar flavor
that is very palatable, though I could
not compare it with any other article
of food 1 have ever eaten. When it is
growing they go carefully through the
field and cut off all the little shoots, or,
as we call them in plain English,
"suckers," and in this nay what re
mains flourishes and grows to an un
usual size.
Usually the people on the island raise
but one crop a year, but some of the
tribes coax Mother Earth into doubling
the supply. Water is the great problem
that eternally perplexes them, and the
means that they have resorted to cer
tainly required a clever bit of engineer
ing. All the ground as far as the* eye
can reach is terraced, giving the sur
rounding country a peculiar aspect. The
majority of them are some fourteen or
fifteen feet in height, and as the water
seeps down it runs to the edge of the
ledge and falls down to the next, and so
on until it has reached the valley be
neath. Not one drop is wasted, and I
have seen them bring, it in this way a
distance of five or six miles, and from
a spring that seemed sluggish, too.
Of course, everything in this part of
the globe is very primitive, but one can
scarcely imagine to what an extent.
The implements of warfareâspears and
"head knives," so called because they
are used for scalping purposes aloneâ
are fashioned in the crudest possible
way. Two small barrels made of hard
wood are placed side by side. At the
bottom of each a small pipe is fitted
and extends perhaps a foot and a half
or two feet to a fire. Two long poles
with feathers bound securely to the
ends of them are then forced into the
barrels, one coming up as the other
goes down, and the turkey feathers
make a current of air that is forced out
of the smaller pipes the Are
glowing and burning, on the same prin
ciple as our bellows. In this way iron
and steel are heated and they are able
to work it into crude implements and
weapons.
All primitive tribes seem to have a
few customs in common. For instance,
their mode of transportation. If there
*are any animals about- they use them
to a greater or less degree, but they al
ways fashion baskets that are strapped
to their backs, and in this way fre
quently carry all their earthly pos
sessions along with them. For example,
the Indians used a basket to carry the
pappoose in, and so do these people to
a great extent. At any time and any
place one may see a woman bending
over and working in a rice field all. day
with her baby strapped to her hack and
paying absolutely no attention to it.
But no matter how interesting the
customs and characteristics of a
strange people, are, they soon grow dis
tinctly tiresome, and one fairly longs
for a glimpse of home. Just at present

BY AUGUSTA PRESCOTT.
aa V HAVE bought a cashmere dress
for a card party." said a wor
n an of taste to her neighbor.
"Cashmere?" exclaimed the
other, aghast. "Cashmere!"
"Yes, cashmere, oid-fashioned cash
mere." repeated the woman of style.
And then she told her friend that she
had found the new cashmere to be just
like the old In its soft qualities, but
silkier, in a greater variety of colors, a
little thinner and finer and even more
durable.
DDK [nwiits
Cashmere, old friend of womankind,
Is back again in the loveliest varieties
imaginable. All the delicate tints are
enrolled in its lists and great piles of
the goods lie upon the shelves ready to
be brought out and draped before the
waiting customer. It would be really
worth one's while to look at the new
. grades of cashmere before purchasing
â¢other materials, for it may be that it
â  Will answer the purpose nicely. As to
its durability, there is no question. And
in its new weaves it looks more like
veiling than like cashmere. So much
.by way of advice. And the woman who
is going to buy is always ready to look
and learn.
Buying a card party gown ready
made is one of the most satisfactory of
all things. There is a woman who makes
it'her custom to purchase ready-made
gowns. Then, if she so desires, she gives
the additional touches just to make the
gowns look distinctive. "I add a little
â  â Id la. < or 1 go into some of the trim
ming novelties." said a woman.
And another added: "1 sometimes
apply the new medallions, which are
shaped like crests and shields, coronets
and coats of arms, une can get such
lovely little lace novelties these days so
very cheap. For 1" cents each I bought
lace designs, which, when applied to the
bust of my new gown and to the cuffs
and to the front of the stock, changed
it suddenly from an inexpensive gown
â into something which bore the stamp
of an imported dress."
So, In buying your ready-made gown'
select with care and, then, if you are
a woman of taste, add a few of the
little "imported" touches which make
it so smart. Put on the crest of yellow
lace, the coronet, the medallions, the
Greek key design In lace, if you can
find it; add anything that is catchy
and note the result.
The Handsome Trimmings.
And, while throwing out hints to the
wise woman dresser, here is another.
Buy the handsome velvet passemen
teries that come by the yard and are
ao desirable in every way. You can
get a yard of velvety trimming with
grapes and leaves all cut out and ready
to be applied. It comes three or four
Inches wide and is in the natural colors,
pretty as it can be, and just the thing
foj paneling a skirt and decorating a
waist.
' The nev thing in waist trimmings
opens up such a possibility that one does
not hesitate to say that one is be
wildered and delighted. And they offer
th* means of securing at a nominal
price as handsome a gown effect as
could be produced in previous
by the expenditure of a great deal of}
money. I
. "These things are necessary," said aj
modiste, "in selecting a card partyj
dress. First a handsome waist, second?
a well fitting skirt which will permit*
the wearer to be seated comfortably}
and, third, a handsome set of acces-<j
Bories or small trimmings, little bits ot
Jewelry and the jeweled trimmings of!
the season. In addition to this a wo- \
man requires a handsome petticoat, i
But, perhaps, it is not necessary to
mention this, as all women know how
important a part the petticoat plays'
in the making of the costume. j
"Ahd then a woman needs a hand- j
some ornament for her hair and the
best modistes, these days, are supply
ing hair ornaments, along with the
gowns." 1
A very lovely separate bodice which ,
was called a card party waist was (
made of the softest of golden brown
panne velvet. Its yoke and vest were
lgld in folds, while across the bust 1
there was draped a fichu of white lace |
in which there were embroidered brown
velvet dots. At one side there was a 1
chou of brown velvet ribbon. The |
sleeves wore shirred above the elbow, ,
.and at the wrist there was a fall of (
white lace with brown dots embroid
ered again. The neck was a Wllhel
mina neck, cut round and filled in with I
a white lace embroidered stock. (
"How much ought I to pay for a .
handsome card party waist?" queried
a woman of apother.
The other who knows the value of |
gowns replied: "Phy as much as you |
can afford. Go as high as $75 if you >
can afford to do so."
This meant that house bodices come j
in the most' elegant forms, and in the \
best materials; and that they are at"
very good investment for the woman]
who has the money to spend, and is \
going to spend it upon a house dress, i
You are not wasting money If you put {
it upon a handsome ready-made shirt)
waist or bodice. You are only invest- 1
ing it in something that will come back \
to you in good shape many a time. i
Most of the very new and very ele- (
gant shirt waists are fitted tightly to
the figure around the belt line; and
very trim and nice they look. It is a
relief to see them after the bloused
bagginess of other seasons. As an ap
preciative man expressed it: "It is
nice to see a woman in her natural fig
ure again, not bagging over at the belt
and sagging all around."
The comfortable blouse is still in
vogue and in its modified forms, full
across the bust, it is very pretty, and it
will be worn a great deal. But for even
ing and dressy wear the tight-fitting
bodice, snug to the hips and close to
the waist, with a little basque effect,
is the thing that will be worn most
of all.
And Its favorite trimming will be lace
arranged in the surplice effect, crossed
over the bust and tied in tassel form at
one side or finished with hanging lace
ends. It is an old-fashioned effect, this,
of the trimmed bodice, yet so becoming
that one embraces it as a friend whom
one has not seen in ages.
Ideal Card Gowns.
One must remember in making a
card party gown that one plays the
game seated and the fft of the bodice
is of paramount importance. The hips
must be snug, but not too tight, or the
appearance will be awkward.
The ideal materials are those that will
not wrinkle nor full up, but that will
adapt themselves to the situation nice
ly, no matter how they may be crushed
or how awkward the way in which one
Is settled.
"It would make a beautiful gown,
madame," said a modiste to a woman
who was selecting a dress for a card
party sociable. "But it would wrinkle
too easily. And it is stiff and unman
ageable. It would be just the thing for
a reception or calling gown, where one
stands. But for a card party, never."
And so one must take into considera
tion Its uses in selecting such a dress
and get one that will not crease or
show the folds.
The ideal stuff is crepe, not the stiff
crepe, but the new soft Oriental weaves
âthe delicate crepes that look so frail
yet will stand so much. These crepes
A LITTLE MATTER OF AGE
(Copyright, 1904, by Keith Gordon.)
T"f TJST around the first corner of
1 the small, square table sat a slight
l woman whose dark eyes met young
QJ Barton's exploring glance with a
smile lurking in their depths, and
whom, with the arrogance of youth,
he promptly catalogued in his mind as
"old." Around the next corner, and
directly opposite .him, the figure of a
Juno-like young creature appeared,
silent and impressive as the facade of
a handsome building. At his left, a
dapper middle-aged man, whose hair
showed a shameless tendency to re
treat by the back way, was eating his
soup in a severely business-like man
ner.
Neither the young lady nor the lit
tle man showed the slightest ripple of
interest in the stranger at the table,
and with the chagrin of a warm na
ture whose open friendliness has beep
silently declined, his wandering glance
came back to Miss Mitford.
The demure smile in her eyes seemed
to haVe deepened, and whether 1*
meant sympathy or amusement was an
open question. At any rate, Stuart
Barton reversed his decision and de
cided that she was not so very old
after all. and that she undoubtedly un
derstood.
He had heard of people so congenial
that they were old friends before they
had time to become new acquaintances.
Before the meal was over he' was con
vinced that Miss Mitford and he were
persons of that description. To be
sure, they spoke only in platitudes,
but there was a raillery In her soft
eyes and in the smile that played about
her lips which seemed to answer his
keen but unexpressed derision of their
conventional companions.

have wonderful wearing properties.
One of the best wearing materials in
the world for a house dress la crepe

never wrinkles, and does not cut nor
crease. Moreover, it is very adaptable
and is easily draped. It ig ideal as a
soft, becoming, delicate house material.
A certain Washington woman bought
last year a gown of gray Oriental
crepe, something like crepe de chine.
She had it made with shirred hips and
a round full waist shirred along the
'yoke. It was trimmed with white lape,
after the fashion of the dresses of last
winter. And yet it wore bravely for a
season.
This January she has taken the same
gown and had it dyed a plum bloom
color. The shirring Is ripped out and
the hips are knife plaited. Around the
foot there is a flounce two fingers deep.
The waist has all the shirring ripped
out and is laid in little plaits. The

began to And Miss Mltford's society as
necessary to his comfort as sleep or
food.
She listened to his arrogant, boyish
views of men and things with an In
terest that had not always been ac
corded them and which did not fail
of its effect. After the jaded, cynical
opinions of older men, she really
found them as exhilarating as wine.
Always they parted with a grudging
sense of breaking off at the most in
teresting point, with a parenthetical
"To be continued," like a serial story.
More than once she had surprised
amused glances on the faces of other
boarders, and she was far too acute
not to Interpret their meaning accu
rately. But she remained tranquil, too
happy and engrossed to care what the
common, conventional herd might
think.
"I suppose you know that they are
saying all sorts of things about us?"
she said to him one evening when
Miss Selwyn's behavior at dinner had
amounted to nothing less than a repri
mand.
Then she went on mercilessly:
"They probably say that I am leading
you on âthat I am old enough to
know betterâthat I am a designing
old maid and a few more nice things
of that sort. I want you to know all
about it, because I am a lot older than
youâsixteen long years of 365 days
each!"
She paused with a queer, breathless
feeling that was an unpleasant sur
prise to herself. She waited for his
answer as if her life hung upon his

"Bother your age!" he laughed gayly.
"Your eyes are as young asâasâ"
He hesitated, casting about for a sim

a good deal younger, and so is your
mind. Your age is Just right! It is I

By Keith Gordon
this summary manner, he began to
talk of other and pleasanter things,
and before long Miss Mitford's clear
laugh was ringing out like a girl's.
Miss Selwyn was passing through the
hall, heard it and wondered in a
vaguely nettled way what Mr. Bar
ton saw in that old maid! There were
times when 6he half regretted her
hauteur to the young stranger. His
eyes certainly were fine! Besides, it
touched her pride that a man should
deliberately turn to another woman
when she was at hand. The fact that
the woman was her senior and no
beauty only made the offense more
heinous.
By degrees, therefore, her manner
toward him changed, thawing slowly
but surely, like ice before the spring
sun. But though she melted. Barton
was politely indifferent and Miss Mit
ford looked on with a keenly fem
inine appreciation of the by-play. She
felt that the siren was singing to her
knight in vain and she rejoiced with
true womanly exultation.
"What possesses Miss Selwynâ
that's what I'd like to know?" that
gentleman blurted out as they were
swinging along through the park to
gether one day. "She used barely to
speak to me and now-âbutter wouldn't
melt in her mouth! She's go blamed
pleasant she worries me. It doesn't
seem natural!"
For reply Miss Mitford stopped
short and fixed her eyea upon him
expressively. His color rose and he
looked rather.confused.
"You don't 'mean â?"
"Yes. that's It!- she replied, nod
ding maliciously. Then they both
laughed merrily after the manner of
irresponsible young things who laugh
from mere joy, until she abruptly re
membered that In a woman of 38 such
behavior was shockingly frivolous
and, resolving to be more dignified,
she grew suddenly pensive.
It was a soft April day. The ten
der greens snd misty grays of the
park were like a wistful promise of
of resemblance to its old color and
style.
There some several different stamps
of crepe, all of them tough and durable,
and all of them capable of being made
into handsome house dresses. They
are extremely neat and the material is
so dressy that one does not really need
any other trimming. A crepe gown Is
prettiest self-trimmed.
Next to crepe in desirability comes
voile. Voile has been greatly changed
in character the past season. It now
comes mors lustrous, softer in finish
and prettier, because more satiny. It
can be bought in either light or heavy
weight and It Is one of those materials
that makes up admirably for day or
evening.
Voile', as most readers know, is very
much like the old-fashioned nun's veil
ing, and a better goods than this was
never found for its own particular pur
pose. It is very pretty made up into
house dresses, and It can be ruffled- and
draped and tucked and plaited and
beauties to come. In the air the
damp, earthy smells of early spring
floated, the aweet breath of the soil
as it awakened from Its winter trance.
With a sigh of enjoyment she seated
herself on one of the green benches and
Barton took his place beside her. For
some moments they sat gazing at the
scene before them in dreamy silence,
taking in long whiffs of the soft air
with sensuous delight. The blurred,
faint loveliness of it all bespoke fairy
land.
He did not speak, but she knew that
he was watching her intently. With a
sort of helpless, bewildered dismay she
realised that she was flushing like a
schoolgirl. "A woman of 38," she taunt
ed herself savagely. "38â38â38!" But
it was no use. She flushed and flushed
until she longed wildly for an earth
quake, for any deliverance that would
rescue her from the absurdity of her
position. But none came, and with lips
that quivered with annoyance she tried
to form some diverting, Impersonal re
mark.
A big, firm hand closed over hers and
Stuart Barton looked down at her like
a triumphant young god.
"I know what you are going to say,"
he began, "but it's no use! I love you
and I'm old enougb to know my own
mind. This is an exceptional case, and
there's no use of your tormenting your
self and me by bothering about our
ages! I am certainly going to marry
you, so yuu might just as well make
up your mind to it."
He paused for breath, and though
she eyed him in disdainful silence, a
dangerous excitement, *a triumphant
happiness danced in her blood, and she
dared not trust herself to speak.
"You love meâyou know you do,
Alice!" be resumed exultantly, and at
the protest that she tried her best to
make convincing he only laughed In
dulgently. With a shock it came to her
that he was rightâshe did love him.
When she spoke a moment later her
voice was very low and tense.
made pretty without In the least Injur
ing It.
One of the new voile gowns is in the
new shade of orange, sometimes called
cogue de roche. It is a color that is
worn a great deal in the house and is
the favorite card party color in Wash
ington. Voile comes in this peculiar
shade of orange, which is almost a
brown, and It Is made up charmingly
and in diverse ways.
A very handsome gown was of cogue
de roche voile made up with bands and
strappings of, Roumanian embroidery,
showing deep tones rather than light
ones. The cuffs were of the embroidery
and the yoke and collar and yoke bands
and girdle were all fashioned of this
embroidery. The style of the gown was
box plaited, with an abundance of art
nouveau buttons upon the waist and
the cuffs. The effect, while showy and
stylish, was not gaudy, for, the Rou
manian bands toned down the tint and
made the gown harmonious. One can
do so much with these trimmings of the
Orient and with embroidered canvas.
The length for the card party gown
is a rough length, sweeping the floor.
It is the same length all the way
around and it lies upon the floor an
inch or two front and back. This is de
cidedly more graceful for sitting pur
poses than the short gown, which hops
up when you sit down.
Gowns of Glossy Canvas.
And there are other materials that
are being used, besides voile and crepe,
"We won't talk of It any more now,
Stuart," she said, laying her hand on
his arm, "but a year from* now, if you
feel the sameâno, don't interrupt!
You think you will, but you don't
know. Don't you suppose it is hard
for me?" and she looked straight in his
eyes with an expression he thought to
remember always. But youth has
ever a poor memory and a year con
tains 265 days.
Tm going away immediately," she
continued, with a little break in her
voice, as she realized what life would
seem without him. "For a year I shall
drop out of existence, so far as you
sre concerned. But at the end of that
timeâ"
A year had passed and another had
begun before Stuart Barton found
himself again in that particular part
of the park. As before, he was ac
companied by a lady, young, proud
and superb looking, and as they seat
ed themselves on the identical green
bench that he had occupied on a for
mer momentous occasion he awaited
anxiously for the reply that she had
promised him. Later, the first flurry
of excitement over, she looked at him
with an inquirThg face.
"You were awfully attentive to that
Miss Mitford last year," she remarked
tentatively. "I always wondered what
you could see in a woman so much
your senior."
Consternation seized Barton. Now
he knew why the spot had vaguely
haunted him âwhy it reminded him of
something once vivid but now forgot
ten. His face went pale.
"She was a lovely woman," he said
quietly.
"She doesn't know that I gave him
to her," murmured Miss Mitford when
she heard of her truant lovar's engage
ment to Miss Selwyn. Then, as two
tears brimmed up in her eyes and roll
ed down her cheeks, she exclaimed
emphatically: "You idiot 1" and then
her face went down to her hands.
and one of these Is canvas. And the
canvas gown must neither be forgot
ten nor neglected in a resume of the
styles. They make canvases now thai
are the very epitome of beauty and
elegance. Partly-silk, with a high
gloss, finished exquisitely .and coming
in heavy substantial weights, they ajre
ideal for the making of gowns. There
are canvas dresses that rank with
brocaded satins and which cost almost
as much. And those gowns are made
up in conjunction with other materials
which bring them well upward in the
world of dress and Its varying schemes.
Scrim has been revived for neck
trimming and the newest stocks are
made of scrim embroidered in green
four-leaf clovers, with a big embroid
ered clover leaf at the front.
A canvas gown for a bridge party
was made of cream canvas with a high
giosa It was trimmed with navy blue
bands of Chinese mandarfn trimming
with the bands all cut-in strips taken
from the robes of a mandarin. They
trimmed the waist running downward
from the neck in modern fashion. They
composed a square yoke front and
back They were used to trim the flar
ing cuffs and similar bands were used
upon the hips to make very showy
panels.
Later in the season all of these bands
will be ripped off and laid away and in
place of them the gown will be
strapped with bands of white satin.
Thus a new effect will be produced.
And, again, the owner can vary thÂ«
whole by lining the gown with vivid
green and trimming it with green
suede.
. There come such beautiful trimmings
these days that one must pauee before
the counters on which they are dis
played, whether one can buy or not.
Truth to tell they rank high in the
artistic world, these trimmings, and
they actually make a gbwn stylish, no
matter how poor its niaterials.
Sets of trimmings come on cards for
the decoration of a dress. And one
can buy Oriental goods by the yard.
A square yard of brilliant trimming,
alt designed in strips, can be cut apart
and used to decorate a dress.
That these trimmings are expensive
there is n6 doubt at aIC ' But, on the
other hand, they are 1 Immensely serv
iceable. They can be Worn half a sea
son and then*ripped off and laid away.
Meanwhile another-set of trimmings
can be'-added in such-a manner as to
completely change-a gowh and afford
that nbveTVy which makes dress so
very attractive.
One gets exceedingly -.tired of the
same styles every day, ahd one wearies
of the same colors and the same trim
mings. To have something new is one
of the most desirable things in the
world.
A Gown in Purple and Green.
L Â» ~ â  '
A woman who h is known for her
handsome accessories is planning her
luncheon and card party dresses with
a special view to these. She is buying
the handsome mock gems and is wear
ing them in chains and watches, pins
and bracelets, and is fitting her color
scheme to match them.
The Duchess of Manchester gave a
very nice exhibition of good taste the
other day when going among her old
friends. She dressed beautifully, yet
modestly, and her- dress was a study.
It was made of purplish cloth, fine as
voile, and it was trimmed with narrow
bands of green suede stitched to the
shoulders, the upper arms and the
cuffs. In addition to this trimming
there were bands of green taffeta bor
dered with pipings of white, and the
girdle was a combination of greeV and
purple and white in Oriental fashion.
Her Jewels were green shamrock
leaves with amethysts in the center. In
her hairâfor it was a ladies* dinner
partyâshe wore an aigrette of purple
fastened with a knot of green velvet.
One must be a little careful now in
putting out one's sleeves, for the styles
[are changing, and sleeves that are
[fashionable now may be ruined for
[wear later on. The newest London
[sleeves are cut In coat sleeve shape, but
[with the top Immensely large. From
[the shoulder to the wrist the sleeve,
[tapers gradually until it Is very tight
at the hand, while at the should
er it is very large Indeed. This is called
the London sleeve, and It is one of .the
smartest tailored sleeves of the year.
But the woman of style does not
want a tailored sleeve save on her street
gowns. She prefers something prettier,
something more delicate and something
more feminine. She wants a trimmed
sleeve. And she would like something
with a cuff and a droop.
The dropping, sagging sleev.e hoids Its
own pretty well. The new shirt waists
show voluminous folds of sleeves, with
something of a droop near the elbow,
either Just above or Just below. There
is not the long bagging, 'sagging droop,
which was once so very fashionable,
but there is a fullness which will not
down and out in spite of many efforts
to nut it out of business.
The bell cuff for card parties is pret
ty, and it shows the hand and gives
one a chance to wear bracelets. This
cuff Is shaped precisely like a bell. It
flares full around the knuckles and is
stiffened and trimmed. It is tight at
the top and sets very snug to the wrist.
It is a typical bell cuff.
Sleeves are again made very Jpng,
and this ie awkward for card playing,
but they can be shoved up a little with
out injury to their outline. Indeed, there
Is very little outline to the new sleeve,
and with the puffs, the bags and the
shlrrings one must learn to imagine
the natural size and shape.
A study of the new waists reveals.lh.e'
fact that they are heavier than the
waists of last season and that a greater {
variety of materials is usfcd in their'
make. If you want to prove this tf>.
your own satisfaction examine thÂ«
lovely brocades, 'the handsomely "flh^ t
ished taffetas of heavy ( weight* the *
lovely velvets of all weights and the,
novelty silks, seeded and striped''and
rich with lustrous qualities." â¢ <*Â«W *ONCE more uame Fa9nlon nas
turned fairly and squarely about
and declared that the quaint old*
hairdressing of the time of the
â war shall be the style of the day. She
doesn't seem to care either whether she makes
her devotees look like flatheads in the sudden
process, but goes serenely on her way pointing scorn
fully at the high pompadours that seem to tilt all the new
hats sixty ways for Sunday.
â¢In fact the set pompadour is decidedly a thing of the past, and
whenever this arbitrator of fashion sees one she immediately resents it,
like a cat whose fur has been brushed the wrong way. It isn't so much
the pompadour as it is the way it is done, for it is the height and the
stiffness that offend her. ... â 
So if you think you simply cannot part your hair because it Is dis
tressingly thin or woefully unbecoming, divide it into two distinct parts
and then give your entire attention to the art of piling it about your face
In a soft fluffy manner. And, by the way, let me tell you another secret
that the hairdresser has had up her sleeve for some time. Curls and
waves and all manner of things that mean irons and tongs are stealing
In again and you will find that the best groomed women are making
appointments with great regularity and defying the elements to do their
wprst. It's too bad, I know, for straight hair has been such a comfort,
but then one might almost as well be dead as out of the style, so what
are you going to do about it?
And. after all, the majority of women only dress to please mascu
line taste, and certainly every little art that makes you more womanly
makes you just that much more attractive in his eyes. A pretty
woman might commit highway robbery and any masculine jury
would promptly acquit her if she had done it gently and in
In a trailing skirt and picture hat. Man can say all he
pleases about the broad-shouldered modern Amazon,
but she is not the girl who can wheedle him out of
.his very eyes and who can finally wheedle him into
walking proudly down the church aisle and in
shaking hands with himself for having drawn
such a. prize, too.
But back to the pompadour. No hair, un
less It is very coarse and wiry, will stand out
very much unless it is given aid of some sort.
After it has been divided into two parts, "back
comb" the front just a trifle and arrange it just
as you want it to be when finished. A comb
will hold It in place nicely if you have any
trouble with it, for more than half the time it
has an uncomfortable habit of slipping back
ward and flattening down in a woeful heap.
The front arranged, all else is easy. The
â  hack hair is combed up into place and the coil
hides all tne deficiencies that take such glee in
bobbing up whenever they can. If side combs are
'used, and they are too pretty thesÂ£ days to be laid
aside altogether, the hair is held firmly in place
all. around and the entire effect is one of a fluffy
snugness that Is the admiration of every man and
the' envy of every woman.
But parting the hair and going backward some V j
fifty or sixty years is quite another question. In the \ M
days of hoops and stiffly starched petticoats every \ jm
it squarely in the middle, smoothed and Am\
flattened down on top and puffed out over her tiny \Jk M
ears until they were quite covered. And she didn't think V%lB
anything of it, either, for her next door neighbor did the
same thing and so did the next and the next.
But with the girl of to-day it is entirely different. When
the'lÃ3o short skirts came in and the dainty old fichus were
'unearthed from their lavender beds in the attic every one was *X
delighted, for the quaint old type was a relic from the tight-fitting H
garments and besides when the new-old fluffy fluff fluff was be- w
csming it was vastly so. Unfortunately one thing always calls fa I
another. The old fashioned frock demanded boots with buckle II j
rhade of dull leathers and great fluffy hats with soft lace frills ant Vl
drooping feathers that seemed to recall the days of one's babyhood >\
For a change the three-cornered affair came in and then the trim \
little hat that comes well over the face, but fluffs and frills about
in Its own pretty independent way. And with these hats came the
change in hair dressing.
Loudness is a crime in the category of feminine sins, and while you
cannot wear scarlet and literally soak yourself in peau d'espagne without
attracting the attention of the whole street, you can be admired for your
sweetness and gentleness.
It is tiresome to get into a rut and never deviate in the least, so the
girl who wears her hair in a figure eight on her neck piles it as high on her
head as she can in the evenings. Really, truly Southern fashion. Flat it is
In front, but a great soft roll on either side finds Its way mysteriously to the
puffs that adorn the crown artd top of the headâand really the girl who
cannot twist a man about her little finger when she is :.rrayed thusly in all
her glory Is indeed a poor specimen of femininity. A man needs soothing
and smoothing just as a cat does. He cannot be bluffed half as easily as he
can be coaxed or wheedled, and it Is the innocent-eyed, artless little girl who
oftenest wheedles him into falling madly in love with her.
Now and again the middle part is anything but becoming, but a slight
change makes all the difference in the world. For this reason the side effect
has been recalled and right smart and chic it is, too, though it rarely if ever
creates the same impression or gives the same look of demure sweetness.
So, miladl, if you would increase your matrimonial chances, learn how to
make the most of every opportunity. Study yourself as no one else will
trouble to do, and change with the fashions onlyâif the style is becoming
to you. Otherwise modification is your keynote. And knowing when to
change radically and when to modify is indeed a great knack, more to be
coveted than alLthe wisdom of the Ptolemies and all the graces of a saint,
that isâif you are a woman.
I ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS |
MRS. PERRY (Crochet Work Again in Vogue)â After a long session of
convent embroidery, Oriental laces, handwork from Japan and India, Mexi
can drawn work and Irish wool work, we are back again to the simplest,
most old-fashioned crochet work for all sorts of pretty indoor matinee garments.
Many of the garments are silk lined in soft cream silk, with broche of
Dresden designs in delicate hues to match or contrast nicely. Or plain tinted
silks are used and the garment bound with Dresden or pompadour liberty
ribbons.
In fact, nearly all the prettiest articles are bound, with wash ribbon In
lovely colors, plain or figured. The liberty wash-satin ribbon Is durable and
holds its color well, and the corded wash-taffeta has also a reputation for
fair dealing.
There is hardly any sort of convenient morning or bedroom aacque or
wrap that is not crocheted to fit most neatly. The sacques are usually In-
tended to
wear over
silk blouses or
cotton shirt
waists or over*
a night dress for

Kimona sacques are
very easy to either
knit or crochet They
are very useful for
dressing sacque or for ex
tra wrap. When worn with
out waist underneath they are more
tractable lined with silk or silkolene.
No lining is necessary over a' waist
The oply trimming Is a wide kimona
band of ribbon or a crocheted band in
white or any other contrasting color.
Short little Eton coats are very smart
as well as comfortable, and they, too,
because of their straight lines, are easy
to do. They are bound or finished with
crocheted revers.

'A pretty present for an Invalid or for
the nursery Is a knitted or crocheted

be folded Into a shawl, or used as extra

Besides the dainty room luxuries, the
smartest of all the new sweaters, golf
vests and waistcoats are hand crochet
ed or knitted. The newest sweaters are
long, a Norfolk or reefer cut and dou
ble-breastedâthese axe for girls, of
course; for boys the old style one-piece
football design prevails, that you have
to be pulled into as well as out of.
JThe golf vesta and waistcoats are
furnished with" silk" backs and linings
and the vests have loose silk sleeves.
They make a most appreciated birth
day gift for a college boy or golf enthu
siast. The college boy will also be grateful
for a home-made sweater in his college colors.
Women who are really experts In the use of
crochet or Icnltting needles often hesitate about the
making of such a gift, thinking it will only be ruined
the first time It is sent to the laundry. The dark colors will,
of course, stand long wear; but light wools and any wools worn for
sports must occasionally be thoroughly washed.
If light or bright hues are to be cleaned let them soak a few minutes,
ten say, each in a separate pail in cold borax water, about a teaspoonful
of powder to two quarts of water.
Then put them directly into a tub of suds made with shaved castils
soap, borax and hot water. Never boil, or rub with soap, or let stand In
the hot water more than five minutes, or put through a wringer.
Rub lightly through the hands, rinse in warm borax water and then
In clear cold water. Wring as dry as possible in the hands, then clap for
a few minutes, and carefully pull into shape. Let drlÃ dry out of doors
unless it is freezing cold. When nearly dry take off the line and again
shake. Pull the neck up and down, the sleeves out, the fronts straight
and the garment will look like new.
But if you let it dry according to its own wind-blown fancy you will
have a useless garment on your hands.
E. G. N. England (Recipes).âYes, I did answer your question oneÂ©
and am sorry you didn't get your recipes long ago. Only last Sun
ay I gave a recipe for a pure soap, but I will give it again.
There are some pure medicated soaps and I will send you
a list of them through the mail.
Rosebud SoapâWhite castile soap (pure), S pounds;
white curd soap, 2 pounds; distilled water, % pint;
melts together in a custard boiler and add vermil
ion (powdered), V< ounce. After the mixture
has cooled a little stir in attar of roses, 1 dram;
oil of bergamot, IV 3 drams; oil of cinnamon,
% dram; oil of rose geranium, % dram. Pour
into molds to harden.
2. I am just a trifle afraid of lanolin, so
will also send you two recipes already pub
lished, as you may not have seen the paper
In your country.
3. Yes, there is a good book (American)
on cosmetics, but I cannot give it you through
the medium of the paper.
4. Pimples are nothing more or less than
blackheads or particles of dirt that gather in
the pores. Plenty of hot water and green
soap will do a great deal. Here is a remedy
that is supposed to be very good: Rose water,
/10 grams; pure alcohol, 10 grams; glycerin, 10
grams; powdered borax, 5 grams.
After five minutes apply this mixture:
Pure alcohol, 80 grams; spirits of laven
der, 10 grams; green soap, 40 grams.
Wash off in the morning.
LUCY (Hair). âIf your hair is brittle and in
/cllned to kink it certainly needs a little treatment If
you object to the use of ordinary coal oil, try a bit of
sweet oil in its place. For instance, take us much oil
as will fill a thimble. Warm it just a trifle and massage
the head every night. Part the hair, dip the Angers Into
the oil lightly and rub it in the scalp, not the hair. If
your hair Is a red, natural, mind you, it can be benefited by
a shampoo of henna. Take about ten cents' worth of henna
leaves and steep them, making a tea out of them. Shampoo the
hair and then rtnse it in the henna tea. Dry it as quickly as you
can and you will find it a lovely red, provided you do it properly.
2. Yes, a facial bath is an absolute necessity. Take a big bowl
of warm water and put a little carbolic acid into it. Begin by put
ting in about ten drops to a gallon and Increase It gradually, but
never use more than ten drops to a quart. This acts as an antiseptlo
upon the skin and is a splendid tonic. All the microbes are promptly
destroyed and the skin is livened up more than a little.
3. The camphor ice is made as follows: Take a riece of mutton
and melt itâsay a:jout the size of an egg. Into this sift a pinch of pow
dered camphor and a teaspoonful of oil of sweet almonds. Beat gently as
it cools, and when cool pour into a jar or small air-tight vessel in order
that it may retain its strength and freshness.
HOUSEKEEPER (Salads). âThere are any number of simple salads
that are always nice. Apple salad is easy to make. There are apples, nuts,
a bit of onion, lettuoe and mayonnaise. Unfortunately it discolors and so
be careful not to mix it until the last minute, for it looks more appetizing
when the blocks of apple are crisp and white. Some people fancy v a little
celery In it and a dash of red pepper, so try it the way that seems best.
Another salad is known as a vegetable oneâstring beans, tomatoes, celery,
onions, a few olives and mayonnaise. Of course all salads are served on
lettuce leaves. Still another refreshing one is made of the contents of a can
of lima beahs bedded with crisp lettuce. The dressing is made as follows:
Take one egg and beat it and a tablespoonful of butter together until they
are foamy. Add a teaspoonful of powdered mustard, four tablespoonfu's of
vinegar and enough salt and pepper to suit your taste. Put on the fire and
keep constantly stirring until it thickens, but do not let it boil.
. H. W; C. (Mourning).âThese days people do pretty much as they please
about wearing mourning, but if you intend wearing it at all, wear it prop
erly. All black is worn six months or a year*and then purple or white are
introduced and colors are put In gradually. It is entirely a matter of senti
ment, you know, and there are many people who feel they can mourn Just
as sincerely in blue as in black and they do not care to parade their gsief
as it were. Certainly It seems very like a mockery to go to the theater or
some place of amusement clad in widow's weeds or weighed down with
crepe, but such things are seen every day. Black is worn as a mark of re
spect and if one does' not care enough to remain where the somber tone
belongs, it is far better to let it alone, for then the world at large is not
taken into your secret and you escape criticism.
BETSY (Underwear). âIf you want an elaborate wardrobe and want it
made in sets, I doubt if you could get it as cheaply as you can make it.
But making it under ordinary circumstances seems foolish to me when it
can be purchased for such prices as are now quoted at nearly every shop In
this city. When you read of a sale make it a point to be downtown bright
and early and you can Just about have your pick of all the garments. Really,
if I were you, I would look into the ready made line first, for it seem* to me
you could devote your time and energy to something that would be more
profitable;?i if hour wrm mAMM

passed from this vale of tears into a
haven where it is to be hoped that no
maggoty write)- of annals can pester
them with traducement of their name
and fame. For be it known that here
tofore those historians who deigned to
give notice to the labors of these two
French courriers-de-bois and discov
erers-of the Northwest made montio-i
of their names only to heap obloquy
upon them, calling them renegades and
liars. Miss Laut comes to their tardy
defense with vehement rebuttal.
After Parkman had written his his
toric â¢ of Canada and the discoveries in
the Northwest, in which no mention
was made of the two men, Radisson
and Grosetllers, there came to light, in
ISSS. an authentic journal of voyages
written In the script of Radisson'him
self. . This chronicle of exploration was
so" at variance with accented opinion
and the state papers of the days of
New France that modern commenta
tert followed in the path of the old
writers and proclaimed that even if
Radtsson's journal was genuine its
author must have been as great a liar
as his contemporaries believed him to
beÂ» fo- he is mixed on his dates and
vague in his assertions. But Mr. Ben
jamin Suite, president of the Royal So
ciety of Ottawa, rallied to the defense
of the two maligned explorers with an
exhaustive historical brochure. Draw
ing from this her inspiration. Miss
Laut has written "Pathfinders of the
West" to popularize the true story of
the discovery of the Mississippi and the
openmg up of the Hudson Bay country
â two works upon which these obscure
hen i s base their claim to immortality.
That Radisson cast eyes upon the
great Mississippi ten years before Pere
Marquette and twenty years before La
Salle is the claim that his journal puts
forth and which Miss Laut seconds em
phatically. In the spring of 1659 Radis
son and his companion crossed the
Wisconsin country under the guidance
of some friendly Crees and found them
selves upon the bank of "a mighty
river, great, rushing, profound and
comparable to the St. Lawrence," to
quote from Radlsson's Journal. This
the Indians called the Forked River
because of the two great branches
which united where St. Louis now
stands. Beyond this river, they told
the two Frenchmen, there lived nomad
Indians in a country of little wood and
beyond them were mountains where
precious stones and copper were to be
had. And the intrepid Frenchmen,
nothing daunted, made a bold incur
sion into this unknown land, circling
through what must be now the States
of lowa and Nebraska and coming back
by a wide northern circuit through
Minnesota to the north shore of Lake
Superior. This before ever a canoe of
the good Father Marquette had touched
the waves of Mississippi and when the
great interior valley and the plains be
yond were as unknown to civilization
as the frozen moon fields.
Miss Laut has made a book of ab
sorbing interest out of the records of
this Radisson and Oroseillers. Vividly
she makes the reader appreciate what
the call of the wilderness and the spell
of the unknown waters of the North
"west meant to those hardy and adven
turous men of a growing nation, whose
new land was rimmed with the veil of
the mystery. Then, too, she portrays
the strife that was waged between the
English and the French for control of
the great beaver trade In the North.
Radi.-son and Groseillers were the first
to penetrate by land to the shores of
the great salt sea (Hudson Bay) and
there In the wilderness of the far North
they established the first of that long
line of trading posts which was later
to stretch from Winnipeg to the mouth
of the Mackenzie and to pour gold into
the c >ffers of one of the world's richest
trading companies. In this struggle
for supremacy between r.nglish and
Fremh fur tiaders Radisson evidently
followed the line of least resistance and
was found fighting and scheming first
with one belligerent and then with the
Other; hence the infamy .-tttributed to
his name by the old chroniclers and the
name of renegade. Miss Laut explains
this away, however, by shewing how
the treatment received by the explorer
at the hands of both patran nations
Justified his free-lancing.
Miss Laut's book would have been
made more attractive by the omission
of the illustrations which the publishers
have t-een fit to give it. They vary
from wood cuts to half tone photo
graphs and do everything but illus
trate the text.

NOVELS,
Good and Otherwise
NELLIE K. BLISSETT'S novel
"The Bindweed" is good of Its
kind, but the kind is dangerous.
Success is rarely achieved in the
effort to rehabilitate facts of near his
tory with the gloss of romance, for
either the nearness of perspective fore
shortens the author's view or he is
prone to give sway to Judgments
formed hot upon the occurrence he
seeks to reflect in his story and not yet
allowed to gain temper by reflection.'
In the present instance the novelist
has utilized the royal tragedy that took
place at Servia's capital so short a
time since. The ill-fated Queen Draga
and her incompetent husband, King
Alexander, are made to play the lead
ing roles in the novel and the unwhole
some atmosphere of moral and politi
cal rcltvnntsa that saturate* the gov
ernment of Servia to-day, as it did
two years ago, breathes through the
chapters of the story with a realistic
taint.
Llane, the heroine of Miss Blissett's
tale, embodies the life story of Queen
Draga with a liberal dash of romance
thrown in. At first she appears as a
beautiful, light-hearted child of the
people, living in the hum-drum life of
th<* poor; and while she remains thus
she catches the reader's sympathies
quite completely. But when she falls
before the wiles of a young butterfly of
the army and her home crumbles at
the shot of her husband's suioiaX:
pistol, then this tarnished girl, sudden
ly turned a woman of craft, becomes
scarce an object of sympathetic regard
and her subsequent tortuous ascent to
a qucn's seat is made under a dun
cloud of unholy intrigue and disgrace.
King Alexander the author paints in
kindly colors, attributing bis flagrant
weaknesses to the influence of evil as
sociates and a neglectful early train-
Ittg. Hardly the bullet-headed degen
erate of history is Miss Blissett's King
Viidimir. Much nearer to truth, prob
ably, is the author's conception of the
part Russia had in the violent unseat
ing of the King of Servia; the record
of crafty diplomacy and plottings on
the part of the Czar's trusted servants
is a thrilling one as the author writes
it and one that must be disconcerting
to those high up in the Czar's land if
ever "The Bindweed comes under
their noticeâwhich it probably will
not.

"Delightful Dodd," by Elliott Flower,
is a character sketch, better than the
average. It is richly humorous with
out being grotesque. Its characters act
and speak with the naturalness of
every-day life; and in these two- fea
tures does Flower's book differ from
others of the ilk which are more cari
cature than character study.
Dodd, the central figure of the story,
is a quiet Michigan farmer, who neither
beats another man in a horse trade nor
makes a clown of himself at a New
port palace. He does not talk in dia
lect, for he is a typical farmer of the
Middle West and dialect is not their
medium of conversation. What he does
have to say, however, comes .with the
homely directness and trenchant wis
dom of Poor Richard himself. His
saws are unexpected, unhackneyed and
direct to the point; they point a genial
and a tender personality and open up a
way for their speaker close to the heart
of the reader. There Is not much of a
story in "Delightful Dodd"; not much is
needed. The incidents of the light plot
hinge upon the affairs of Dodd's sum
mer place for boarders and the troubles
that arise incidental to its manage
ment. Throughout the whole story the
reader catches at the wise axioms of
the quiet, clear spoken proprietor and
has a good smile at their unfeigned
cleverness.
"When you're commercially sorry for
a man," says Dodd on one occasion,
"you're Just sorry enough so's not to
let it interfere with business. You say.
Too bad about poor old Jones,' and
then you reach out for anything he
happens to have that you want, and
tell ycur lawyer to jump in ahead of
the other creditors."

ed; price $150.)
In "The Buccaneers" Henry M. Hyde
has written a novel of what he aptly
terms "the black flag in business."
Never, indeed, did Sir Henry Morgan
display less scruples In cutting a throat
than does the spider-like financier of
this story cutting a pocket. In the
present instance, however, it is more
than a pocket that is looted; corpora
tions are wrung to their last dollar,
trusted employes are given the sack,
spies are posted upon a rival's business
and the rule of might is supreme.
Though the author has painted a black
enough picture of modern "frenzied
finance"âblack even as that daubed by
Mr. Lawson of Bostonâhis story is
convincing eyen in its seeming improb
ability. AIL of the intricacies of busi
ness speculation and commercial ri
valry are marshaled before the reader
in bewildering array. Event follows
event with startling suddenness. The
game of advance and check waged be
tween the heads of warring corpora
tions is mapped out to the smallest de
tail. A love story, somewhat crudely
finished and unstable on its founda
tions, is tlhrown in to satisfy the pub
lic taste.

TREATISE
On Speech Elements
ONE seeking light literature for
diversion's sake would better not
turn to Emil Sutro's "Duality of
Thought and Language," for
speedily he will be beyond all soundings.
To place spiritual facts upon a physical
basis is, in general, the author's task;
to prove that the spiritual as well as
the physical forces are Involved In the
phenomenon of human speech Is hfs
direct goal. If this Is not enough to
warn away all but the specialists let
me say that it is Mr. Sutro's belief that
"man's cell from its first incipience is,
and always has been, of dual nature,
and that words, or rather groups of
words, representing groups of ideas, are
inherent In special parts of man's
body. - ' Thus, words belonging to the
house and household find their expres
sion in the liver; every combination of
words representing the various parts of
one's wearing apparel arises from the
pancreas, etc.
Because at the very outset and
throughout the entire treatise the
author takes bitter exception to science,
which says: I know because I see,
touch, hear, taste or smell and advo
cates; I know because I know, the
reader must pin his trust on faith if
he is to enter here and must seek in
vain for any demonstration that ap
peals through the senses. Therefore
Sutro's book will not be taken seriously
by the psychologists since they base
their principles on science, nor by the
Writers Who Bring Sincerity to Their Work
JT)OBCRT HHr.l r .\ r TER. whose book, "Poverty" reviewed in these columns but recently, has
/\ gained the unanimous approbation of critics, is still a very yoapg man, but one whose en-
ergy has been boundless. In ISO 6. after graduating from the of Indiana, Hunter
determined to break from theory and to discover for himself the facts of some of our modem eco
nomic evils. Pursuing this purpose, he lived the life of the poor in the stockyards district of Chi
cago, later throwing his energies into an investigation of the tenements of that city, which was
then being vigorously pushed by some of the zvorkers at Hull House. From Chicago Hunter went
to take up his work at. Toynbee Hall, London, the pioneer institution in settlement work of the
great metropolis. Of late Hunter's name has been first among the settlement workers of New
York, where, as chairman of the child labor committee, he once encompassed the passage of laws
protecting a quarter of a million children.
Thomas Dixon Jr., though a novelist, brings every bit as much sincerity to his ivork as
does Hunter. By the very earnestness of their convictions his books have invited zvider com
ment, perhaps, than those of any contemporary Southern writer. A native of North Carolina, he
is a descendant of sturdy Scotch Covenanters, whose best traditions of liberty and loyalty were
maintained by the Ku Kinx Klan in the troubled days of the reconstruction. He
was educated for the lan; Viif abandoned it to become a preacher. He was a brilliant,
fearless and impassioned pulpit orator, and his Sunday afternoon sermons at the Academy of
Music. New York, attracted thousands. He is also a noted lecturer. He has repeated in litera
ture his success in the pulpit and on the platform. His last book, "The Clansman," was reviczved
in these columns last Sunday.
philosophers since faith cannot sup
plant reason with them.
In a previous work, "The Basic Law
of Vocal Utterance," the writer set
forth the details of a discovery he had
made in relation to the dual nature of
the human voice. By demonstration
upon self he became assured that there
was a voice of the oesophagus as well
as a voice of the larynxâin brief that
the voice possessed a dual nature. Ex
panding this dictum, he now asserts
that the dual nature of the voice Is
that of the material and the im
material, the body and the spirit; that
immaterial thought must first be trans
formed Into material sounds of speech
before it becomes intelligible. With
this fact once appreciated, asserts this
authority, the whole system of voice
control and voice culture must be revo
lutionized because the action of the
speech producing muscles, directed now
by involuntary effort, will be modified
directly by the molding influence of the
inner conscience.
The nature of "Duality of Thought
and Language" Is such that a reading
of the book will embrace only the nar
rowest circle of those Interested in
physio-psychic lore and I am not Justi
fied in giving more space to the book's
consideration even if I were so minded.
After reading the whole volume very
conscientiously I call to mind that pe
culiar psychic phenomenon that used to
find Its occurrence with a sect of early
anchorites of the church; by gazing
steadfastly, each at his own navel,
these worthy religionists were able to
see visions and dream dreams when the
proper conditions of a hot Afrlc sun
and a disordered digestion obtained.

Isaiah down to the broad conception of
lofty universalism which marks the

NOTES
on Random Reading
THE latest addition to the very ac
ceptable Beacon Biographies se
ries is the life of Walt Whitman,
"the good, gray poet." written by
Isaac Hull Piatt. Perhaps there is no
poet in the last decade who has stirred
up so much controversial bitterness and
who has forced so sharp an alignment
of opinion as this creator of "Leaves of
Grass." In Boston the District Attor
ney procured an injunction against the
publication of his volumes on ac
count of their alleged indecency; in
England some of the best credited grit-
Ics hailed the peculiar poems of Whit
man as something beyond the ordinary
scheme of verse In beauty of sentiment
and sonorous roll of i meter. Differ
ences, first as wide as the ocean itself,
have gradually become reconciled
under the influence of a more-dispas
sionate study of Whitman, however,
and to-day nearly all are ready to ac
knowledge him as a strong factor to
be reckoned with in the appraisement
of American letters.
Piatt gives a very thorough neview
of the life of his subject, dwelling par
ticularly upon that peculiar gaucherie
of the man which set him so definitely
apart from the. plane.of his fellowa A
frequenter of bohemisn beer halls, a
dilettante at carpentry as at school
teaching, one who cared not a whit for
the opinion of others,, but who kept
jealously before him his opinion of
himselfâthe biographer sets' forth
Whitman's peculiarities with a lively
pen. A brief estimate of the man's
ideals closes Piatt's little volume. Of
Whitman's ethics, so often in. question,
he has this to say:
"Whitman's ethics is not of the letter
but of the spirit. He never preaches.
With 'Thou shalt not' he has no con
cern. He knows nothing of arbitrary
rewards arid punishments. He says
little or nothing of duty. This spirit
ia nothing that can be expressed in a
formula or represented by a dogma, or
proved by logic. It is lifeâa life of
faith without dogma, of acceptance
without argument, of love' of nature
and of man, without exception or limi
tation."

Florence Elizabeth Maybricfe, the
American woman whose release from
an English penitentiary recently sent
a wave of sensational journalistic ac
tivity spreading over the country, has
written a book on her experiences as a
condemned murderess which she has
entitled "Mrs. Maybrlck's Own Story
âMy Fifteen Ldst Tears." The book
has no excuse for publication other
than the great public's morbid curi
osity. This It will, of course, satisfy
quite completely. Aside from this
element the book has nothing to dis
tinguish it from similar panderings to
sensation that were written about the
Theodore Durrant case here in San
Francisco, about the theater fire in
Chicago and the Slocum disaster in
New York. Mrs. Maybrlck's case was
indeed a startling one. She was con
demned by a Judge who was latter
deemed insane and her life in Woking
and Aylesbury jails in England was
rendered doubly hard by the fact that
so many people on this side of the
Atlantic were holding out the delu
sive promise of release. But the nar
ration of these facts gains its whole
weight of popularity with readers be
cause Mrs. Muybrick is the narrator.
The public will read the book in
trains and street cars, but it will not
put the same on the shelves of its
library.

It is a book for Christian Scientist
readers. Of Christian Science I know

Hebblewhite's book a conscientious
review. Part of this volume I could
understand: the grouping of Bible
texts under headings indicative of the
different moralities. To this are ap
pended quotations from the Vedas and
extracts from the Bhagavad Gita
which seem to have bearing upon the
doctrines of Mrs. Eddy in one way or
another. A chapter upon the history
and aims of Christian Science brings
some light to those in darkness and
I would recommend it to those who
desire even an imperfect acquaintance
with the creed. The author's alpha
betical affirmations to the question:
What is Christian science? may be il
luminating to some. They run thus:
"Absolute, All-Science.
"Bible. Beautiful Science.
"Christ, Celestial Science.
"Divine Science.

thou mayest be able to see exactly in

out mixing up the others.
"Do the same with the cases. Take
good care of the individual leaves
which are in the convolutes and fas
cicles. Look continually into the cata
logue in order to remember what books
thou hast. When thou lendest a hook
record its title before it leaves the

draw thy pen through the memoran
dum. Restore all loaned books on
Pesah, and Sukkot."
A lively discussion has developed
over Margaret Hugonin, the lovely
heroine of James Branch Cabell's Vir
ginia romance "The Eagle's Shadow."
Letter writers and card writers all

tacking and defending Mr. Cabell for
putting very strenuous language into
the mouth of his heroine. There are
some people who believe that Mr. Ca
bc 11 has violated the best traditions of
the American girl in Action, and there
are others who are equally strenuous
in the belief that he has made a faith
ful, even if tempestuous, heroine. All
the while Margaret serenely makes her
way and the book was one of the most
popular of the holiday volumes.
Hall Came, whose latest novel, "The
Prodigal Son," published by D. Apple
ton & Co., is netting him many thou
sands of dollars, was once asked if he
were happy in his tremendous success.
"Happy?" said the great author.
"The only times that writing makes a
man happy is when he is actually writ
ing, actively evolving a scene or pas
sage that seems to him successful, or
directly after. There are many poor
places in all great books and all great
poems, but there are a few spots in
each that are as gleams of light, after
the writing of which one feels a tem
porary satisfaction. After describing
the death of Thora in "The Prodigal
Son' I had a satisfied sense of finality
because I knew that that part would
not have to be written again. Nothing
in the world, especially no long piece
of prose, can be all satisfactory any
more than any human being can be
perfect. I presume that the poets ap
proach nearer to perfect happiness
than the prose writers, In spite of the
general theory that poets are the un
happier of the two. Think of how
Tennyson must have felt after writing
'Crossing the Bar.'

elist, "literary history has it that even

SCOTCH WRITER'S
5ITTER STRUGGLE
TRIUMPH OF DR. MACKINTOSH
ABERDEEN, Jan. 28.âWith the
exception perhaps of Bunyan's "Pil
grim's Progress," it is probable that
no great book has ever been written
under conditions less favorable to lit
erary work and research than the
"History of Civilization in Scotland,"
by Dr. James Mackintosh, whose fel
low citizens in Aberdeen have just
presented him with a substantial sum
that he may live in comparative com
fort In his old age. The little known
story of this venerable historian's ca
reer affords a striking proof of the ca
pacity of genius to triumph over
seemingly insurmountable obstacles.
He was born in 1833 in a humble
thatched cottage of a bleak hillside
peasant farm in Banffshire. His fath
er had fought as a common soldier
under Wellington throughout the
Peninsular campaign and had retired
on a pension. Even with this aid, so
scanty were the family means that at
10 years of age the boy, who was des
tined to become the foremost author
ity on Scotch history, was set to work
on the farm. At this occupation he
continued until he was 17, reading
whatever books he could get hold of
as time permitted, and in the slack
est months of the winter attending the
village free school.
APPRENTICED TO COBBLER.
The income from the little farm,
even with the most rigid economy,
proving insufficient to support all the
members of the household, young
Mackintosh was apprenticed to a
shoemaker and at this trade he
worked for fourteen years in various
parts of the northeast of Scotland.
Meanwhile he eagerly availed him
self of every opportunity to gratify his
thirst for knowledge. As he moved
from place to place he joined local
literary and debating societies and
mutua] improvement clubs with which
Scotland abounds, and prepared and
road various papers on a great variety
of subjects. This work was excellent
preparation of its kind and helped
Bhape the bent of his later nnd riper
studies, but as his mind unfolded and
his craving for the treasures of liter
ature Increased he began to feel keen
ly tlie need of better books than the
libraries of such rural societies as ]Â»â â :
was connected with afforded.
It was not until he removed to Aber
deen, when 31 years old, that he found
sources of learning open to him com
mensurate with his requirements, and
with indomitable pluck and persever
ance he set to work to make the most
of them. He solved the problem of pro
viding himself with the means of live
lihood by joining the city police force,
and for five years helped to preserve
order in the ancient city, assiduously
haunting the libraries while off duty.
WRITES AT HIS STORE.
Though much interested in the devel
opment of law, the practical enforce
ment of it was not much to his taste,
and in 1869 he opened a small station
ery and book shop in Gallowgate, one
of the poorest thoroughfares of the
city. In 1882 he removed to Broad
street, under the shadow of Marischal
College and next to the house where
Byron once lived, and It was here, dur
ing the Intervals of business and amid
all the noise and bustle of the street
traffic, that he wrote the greater part
of his monumental work. He was usu
ally astir at 5 o'clock in the morning,
for he preferred the morning sunlight to
the midnight oil, and in the early hours
customers were few. This allowed him
time to devote to his work free from
interruption. He was usually able to
complete eight or nine pages a day.
. The idea of the work had entered his
mind long before he settled down at
Aberdeen. In the preface to one of his
volumes he says:
"I worked for some time before I be
came luliy aware of the original sources
of information, while, for long after I
had become aware of the most valuable
and original materials of history re
lating to my subject, I had often ex
treme difficulty in finding access to
them for the purpose of my researches.
The libraries of mutual improvement
societies and mechanics' institutions
were utterly insufficient. But it was
then chiefly that; I prepared myself by
a course of philosophic study, embrac
ing metaphysics, psychology, logic, eth
ics and politics, carefully reading hun
dreds of works on these matters, both
ancient and modern. But it was only
afur I obtained the privilege of con
sulting the library of the University of
Aberdeen that 1 was enabled to prose
cute my special historical inquiries with
ease and advantage."

QUICKLY GAINS
FRIENDSHIP
OF QUEEN.
Mrs, Frank Mackau
Pet of the English
Roual Couple.
LONDON, Jan. 28.âMrs. Frank
Mackay, in the shortest time on record,
has succeeded in gaining Queen Alexan
dra's personal friendship. Like the late
Queen Victoria, the present Queen is
most conservative in matters of court
etiquette, and it usually takes a con
siderable time for a stranger to get on
speaking terms with her. All the for
malities and ceremonies of court have
to be strictly observed, and even hun
dreds of women who have been "pre
sented" never have the opportunity
afterward of enjoying her Majesty's
personal friendship. They come and go
and the "presentation" means a mere
incident in their social lives.
When Mrs. Mackay took a house and
became a part of the American colony
In Mayfair last season few of her
friends imagined that she was so soon
destined to become a pet of royalty.
It is only since her recent accident in
the hunting field that it has become
known that the Queen takes a per
sonal Interest in her. Her Majesty has
been making inquiries daily about her
condition and a special messenKerJias
gone to Kirby Hall to see the patient
personally on behalf of the Queen and
King Edward.
The Duchess of Bedford, who is one
of Queen Alexandra's personal friends.
Is the medium through which Mrs.
Mackay has secured the personal re
card of her Majesty.

MARLBOROUGH
TRIES HAND
AT ANGLING
Stories of a Friend
Make Duke an
Enthusiast.
LONDON, Jan. 28.âThrough the ex
citing fishing stories of a permanent
official at the Coloniar Office, the Duke
of Marlborough has developed into an
enthusiastic angler. The official in
question made it a practice of taking
his rod and tackle to the office on Sat
urdays with the view of taking advan
tage of the afternoon for Indulging in
his favorite pastime.
The Duke has caught the fever. It is
a common thing to find the Duke and
his subordinate sitting by the side of
some of the well-known streams around
London. It is doubtful whether the
Duke will ever become an expert an
gler, although his enthusiasm almost
laid him open to a charge of poaching
a few days ago.
What is known as the New River,
which supplies a considerable part of
London with water for household con
sumption, is prolific in fish, but anglers
mutt not approach it without the per
mission of the directors. The Duke,
hearing much of the sport to 6e found
there, made his way to a quiet spot in
the neighborhood of Enfield, close to
the Government gun factory, one Sun
day morning. A river keeper was
quickly on his track and it took the
Duke some time to convince him of his
identity.
Frenchman's Morganatic Wife Not
Considered Obstacle to Match.
BRUSSELS. Tan. 28.âThere was a
rumor last year that Princess ClemÂ«
entine, the youngest daughter of King
Leopold of the Belgians, had become
engaged, in spite of her father's
wishes, to Prince Victor Napoleon,
who, as head of the Bonaparte family,
would be Emperor of France to
day if the Napoleons had managed to
remain on the throne. That rumor
was promptly and vigorously denied
before the public fairly had a chance
to consider the significance and inter
est of such an alliance.
Whatever may have been the case
when the rumor was first denied, It
Is now an absolute fact, and It begins
to look as If the efforts of King Leo
pold to prevent the match would be
futile.
Prince Victor has just been making
a tour of the various courts of Eu
rope, with many of which he is con*
nected, to obtain family opinion on
the matter, and everywhere, it is re
ported, the proposed alliance has
been received with favor. It is recog
nized that the Prince ought to marry,
and no better wife could he find, in
the restricted circle of royalty, than
the stately, graceful Princess Clemen
tine.
KING FEARS THE MATCH.
In every respect she Is considered
worthy to mate with a representative
of the Napoleonic dynasty and to be,
perhaps, the mother of one who may
sit upon the throne of France, even
if the Prince himself should never at
tain what the French imperialists con
sider his rightful position.
One reason King Leopold, is so
strongly opposed to the match is that
he fears the enmity of the French re-
publican party, which would see in the
marriage a source of strength to the
Bonapartists. Not to be able to es
cape constantly to Paris would be a
matter of great annoyance to the Bel
gian monarch, who, when there, lays
aside all that chilling, distant manner
which grates so much on the suscep
tibilities of the democratic Belgians.
Besides, the King is interested in many
business ventures, which would suffer
if he lost the friendship of the French
Government.
It is no secret that the King and
Princess Clementine do not live hap
pily together, the Princess greatly re
senting certain affairs of his amorous
Majesty, wh'ch occasionally bring her
into contact with people she considers
undesirable.
OBJECTS TO HIS GUESTS.
A story is told which explains why
the Princess, who has lived for years
a very retired life, did not leave Lae
ken throughout the whole of the past
warm summer season. By the King's
orders she was compelled to relinquish
her usual visit to Ostend as a pun
ishment for a little "contretemps"
which occurred one fine morning in
the spring when the Princess was tak
ing a stroll in the park at Laeken.
She saw there, to her surprise, two
women, who appeared to be as much
at home there as herself. One was a
young and very beautiful girl, the
other, evidently the mother, though
older, was equally handsome. The
Princess, with that gracious manner
which is renowned throughout Eu
rope, went to them, and, thinking they
were unintentional intruders, said: "I
beg your pardon, mesdames, but per
haps you do not kno" â¢ this is private
ground."
The women looked her squarely in
the eyes and the mother replied: "Oh,
yes we do, but we like to walk here."
"Then I must request you to with
draw at once," said the Princess with
royal dignity. "This is the Royal
Park and you have no business to in
trude on my privacy.'*
"Oh," sneered the younger of the
women, tossing her head, "but per
haps her Royal Highness Is not aware
that we are staying at the palace as
guests of the King, who is most gra
cious to both of us and has given per
mission that we shall do whatever we
like." Â»
The Princes threatened to call the
guard and have them turned out, when
the King came on the scene and the
Princess appealed to him.
"These ladies are my guests," said
the King wrathfully, "and are welcome
to go anywhere they please. Go to
your apartments at once and do not
leave them until I send for you, and
do not interfere with my friends
again."
GENUINELY IN LOVE.
And thus humiliated before the two
women, the Princess was forced to
*
withdraw after making the requisite
salutation to her father, while her
rivals stood by smiling. They are
known as the Countess de La.unay and
her daughter. It is not difficult to un
derstand therefore that the Princess
will welcome as a real deliverer a
Prince who enables her to leave her
father's palace, though she is so proud
that she would sooner suffer virtual
imprisonment In the palace than
marry out of her rank. It is said,
however, that she nas fallen genuinely
in love with Prince Victor and looks
forward to her marriage to bring her
the happiness of which thus far she
has had such scanty measure.
The opposition of King Leopold may
present some obstacles to the marriage,
but "love laughs at locksmiths" and
perhaps at kings. In any case the ex-
Empress Eugenic has given her con
sent, and as she will leave her great
fortune to Prince Victor, he will not
lack for money enough to provide com
fortably for a royal spouse, even should
her father disinherit her.
VICTOR'S MORGANATIC WIFE.
It is a matter of common knowledge
that Prince Victor already has a mor
ganatic consort and a flourishing fam
ily which cannot inherit his title. There
is plenty of precedent in the pages of
the unwritten history of European
courts for the disposition of what is
considered a little complication like
this. The facts of tjie case are per
fectly well known to Princess Clemen
tine, who, educated as she has been in
the code of state marriages, cannot but
be forgiven for looking upon the situa
tion from another viewpoint than that
of any woman who does not happen
to be the daughter of a monarch. She
is now thirty-two years old and can
have few of the illusions of youth left.
And, of course, she knows the story of
the first Napoleon and Josephine.
The royal lovers. It Is reported, are
only waiting until the settlement of the
Pages 17 to 24
King's law case, which is now before
the Court of Appeal. It will be remem
bered that the basis of this suit,
which was decided In the first court in
the King's favor, is the auestion
whether his Majesty has a risrht to dis
pose of his immense private fortune as
he likes, or whether he is not bound
by his marriage contract with the
Queen to leave a certain portion to his
daughters.
NEUTRAL IN DISPUTE.
Being at odds with all three of them,
he is endeavoring to avoid his paternal
responsibilities, and certain creditors
of Princess Louise, anxious to obtain
some assurance that they will be paid
the money owing them eventually,
sought by bringing the matter before
the courts to prevent the Kine from'
giving away his wealth to the nation
and private friends, in order to revense
himself on his children.
Princess Clementine has borne a
neutral part in the dispute, which has
lent color to the belief that the King
has promised her a portion at least
of her fortune. Anyhow, as
soon as the judgment is givenâand It
is more than likely it will be given
again In the King's favor, for it is both
disagreeable and dangerous work for
lawyers to thwart kingsâthe Prin
cess will quietly leave Belgium and,
having summoned her father in the
customary way in France and Bel
gium to give his consent, will, if he
refuse, marry without it in another
country. There is no doubt that in
the circumstances her act will be con
doned if not absolutely approved by
the Belgians.
HEAD OF BONAPARTES.
Prince Victor is 42 years old and it
is high time, his friends and political
supporters think, that he settle down
to a legitimate family life, which
would insure some prospect of leav
ing behind him an heir. He derives
his position as head of the Bonapart
ists from his grandfather, Jerome, the
younger brother of the great Napo
leon. His father was that Prince Na
poleon who was derisively nicknamed
"Flon-Plon" in the second empire.
Of plebeian strain on the paternal
side âfor, as everybody knows, the
founder of the house, who made and
unmade kings at will, was the son of
a Corsican lawyer â through his
mother, Princess Clothilda of Savoy,
daughter of the brave old King Victor
Emanuel of Italy, he is allied to the
bluest blood of Europe. He was 10
years old when the French empire
fell.
By the "Senatus Consultum" of 18TO
the succession to the imperial throne of
France was vested in the descendants
of King Jerome. Accordingly when the
ex-Empress Eugenie's son, the gallant
Prince Imperial, was slain by Zulus in
South Africa in 1879 the chieftainship
of the Bonaparte family and of the im
perialist party was assumed by "Plon-
Plon," who had ofttimes openly de
clared his contempt for his cousin, the
"Man of Sedan."
DISINHERITED BY FATHER,
A bitter family feud now took place.
Eugenic and the whole papal section of
the Bonapartists rejected "Plon-Plon's"
pretensions and opposed to him his eld
est son, Victor, who had been desig
nated as chief of the family and party
In the young Prince Imperial's will.
And when on obtaining his majority
Victor claimed the leadership in direct
opposition to his father he was fol

Surely it was a bit of classic Greece
before one! The'little Greek head, the
nose that might have been filched from
the Medicean Venus, the beautifully
made body wrought to its utmost of
efficiency, suggested all kinds of Olym
pias and things. Yet, no, there were
the profaning spangles and satins;
there was the usual Orpheum mist be
tween one and Alcide Capitaine; and it
was O'Farrell street and a wet Sunday
afternoon in 1905. But one was grate
ful, even, so, to see this young woman.
One remembered, further, to be grate
ful to the Orpheum powers for the only
opportunities most of us have to seek
that wonder of God's handiwork, a
beautiful human body, at its highest
power.
O'Farrell street as a branch Olympla

even is the notion of the Orpheum as
its temple. Yet, in its way, the Or

Rough and virile in the drawing of his
hers for one thing. Neither could I
take in at first that the trimly skirted,
shirtwaisted little lady in front of me
was the glittering figure of the
trapeze. Then I noted the shoulders
and believed. Besides, there was the
noseâsurely from some old Greek for
bear it comes. We went then to the
dressing-room, Miss Capitaine making
for the trunk and I for a chair.
"Height?" I began professionally,
looking down from my extra Inch.
Miss Capitaine laughed, showed the
prettiest of teeth and confessed to 6
feet 3 Inches, to 130 pounds, to a 22
waist measure and a 39 bust measure.
She did not have to catalogue a pair
of the clearest, kindest, finest brown
eyes that I know, lidded heavily yet
delicately, and without taking aught
from their merrimentâarched over,
too, by eyebrows that Helleu would' de
light In. There is a mouth small and
very red. skin clear and fine as a
child's, the strong silken black of the
hair giving Tightest value to its warm
olive. And the noseâbut I'm no Phid
ias; I'll have to let the nose go.
It was just after this that Miss
Capitaine took off her shirt waist to
show me her upper arm muscle with a
little delicate hesitancy curious and
delightful in one who had been the
center of two thousand eyes only a
short while before. But Miss Capi
taine is that kind of person. Tou
would give her a recent convent if you
knew nothing about the trapeze. Off
it she is as simple, modest, retiring as
a school girl. But to the muscles: She
showed me arm. ntck, back and chest
muscles whipping and writhing under
the smooth skin, bunching up here
or at her will, and then lying
dormant without a hint of their un
usual development. Only in the "egg"
muscle of the arm is there any indica
tion of abnormal development in re
pose. The rest might be simple
plumpness.
As she was donning her waist I asked
her something as to her habits of
life.
â¢ Habits? I haven't any."
Miss Capitaine laughed at the very
idea of her having any. Mr. Binns,
â whom she then enticed into the room
by asking him to show me his Stroh

Miss Capitaine did not own up to an
exclusive diet of pickles and chocolate,
not quite; she did confess to almost
everything else. That is why I am un

becoming a Capitaine in six

His wife nodded a tranquil "almost"

"But you used to practice?" I pro

not," she said.
"Did you really begin it at two years

"I really began to perform in public
at that age," Miss Capitaine assured
me "When I was little older," she
went on, "I worked in Malta. The
King of Englandâthen Prince of
Walesâwas there. He took me up in
his arms"âshe laughed roguishly here
â"wouldn't dare to do it now!"

Amedee Joullin is happy as a Hot

where he is going in for thoughtful

There are those irreligious enough to

imperfections. Well, granted that there

wake to in a morning, the two-year
old Alcide Carlotta Lucia Magnago sus
pended by her tiny fists in a soft bunch
half way between the ceiling and floor.
It was this evident ear for the trade
that induced Alcide's papa to permit
the infant phenomenon to go her own
way. Since then she has done most
things that can be done on a trapezeâ
things so far attempted by no other
woman. Incidentally, also, Miss Capi
taine speaks, besides her native Italian,
a little matter of French, German,
Spanish and English; sings, plays
piano, makes all of her own costumes
and cooksâMr. Binns says "like an
angel."
"You would have to say that," I
threw over to him, "with those muscles
behind the biscuit." Husband and wife
laughed together at this, but there was
that in the gentle, laughing, deer
like eyes of the wife that explains her
angelhood to Binns. A trifle short of
Gabriel, not to count, however, she
evidently believes Mr. Binns. They
bcth told me, as of the most delightful
possible romance, that it was at the
Orpheum they met, eight years ago.
It might have been yesterdayâthe
beauty and wonder are still so evi

Binns is himself interesting. He is
the one of the Binns trio with the ex
traordinary black wig, and plays ex
tremely well on his curious Stroh
violin. That one of the trio, by the
way, that impersonates King Edward
is the father, and âmark this âplayed
the cornet for years in one of the
finest orchestras in the world, the
Halle orchestra of Manchester.
But to return: There is yet another
Binns, 7 years old, who calls Miss Capi
taine "mother." I had heard disre
spectful things about the children of
strong women: I had heard that they
were few, to begin with, and that for
their own sake it would be well that
they were fewer; I had heard that
the strong woman was an unglfted
motherâa failure in woman's dear
est sphere. It was, therefore, with
much more than common Interest that
I heard this one talk of little Miss
Binns and looked at the portrait of a
chubby-faced youngster, cheek to
cheek with her mother, evidently the
picture of health. From her privileged
position Mrs. Binns discussed the mat
ter âspoke of her own small girl's
physical fineness, of the extraordinary
strength and more than common
beauty of the children of other strong
women that she knew. Only as un
adulterated good to the child she holds
all of physical development that the
mother is capable of, adducing in
stance after instance to support her
theory. Only, too, as conducive to the
finest health of the woman, she holds
the fullest possible development of her
muscles.
All this we talked out while Mr.
Binns went to fetch his Stroh violin
for me to see. But came then the
Cerberus of the Orpheum, the man
with the keys. He wanted to lock up.
He generally wants to do what you
don't want him to. Couldn't he leave
the key with Mrs. Binns? What? Leave
keys with a woman? Never! He knew
better than that anyway. Ladies al
ways lose keys. He hadn't been twen
ty-five years holding down the stage
door without knowing that. Some day
I am going to interview Cerberus and
have my revenge. But we did leave
then, Mr. Binns, "Cheedy"âthat is
Binns' unclassic diminutive for
Alcide (her brothers are yclept Her
cules and Jupiter!) and myself, and
as we stepped out into the damp street
I was sure that in it there was not a
prettier, kinder or sweater little
creature than the strong woman, Al
cide Capitaine.

on "The Dictator"âRichard Harding
Davis made the playâwas practically
unanimous. The thing was one of the
few bright spots in New York's last
disastrous season, and ran merrily
through one of its longest engagements
at the Criterion. The scene of the
comedy is laid in Porto Banos, capital
of one of the mythical South American
republics in which Mr. Davis delights.
Mr. Collier has the role of Travers, a
New Yorker, who, believing that he
has killed a cabman In a row, flee* to
Porto Banos. On the way there he
meets a Colonel Bowie, an adventurer,
who is going to the republic as its Con
sul. Travers volunteers to Impersonate
the colonel and drops in for a neat
little revolution. The fun can be imag
ined and Mr. Collier In the middle of
it is also conspicuously suggestive. In
cluded in the support are Charles Jack

Howard Estabrook, Emmet Whitney,

At the Grand Opera-house that splen

which his impersonation of Lachlan
Campbell has made him famous for

February 17. The performances given
to help along the good work of the

tors and professionals generally who
belong to the organization are always
notable events. This year's programme
will be the strongest ever offered, every
theater in the city having promised to
contribute the best feature from its
current bill.
The event of this week musically is
the appearance of the Dolmets< hea,
who come on Tuesday evening to Lyric
Hall. Expectancy is very high concern
ing them. Their entertainmentâwith
all respect one uses the wordâis of the
highest appeal. Neither as Instruction
may their concerts be neglected, nor
for the unique and piquant pleasure
they afford. Among the archaic instru
ments upon which they will play are
the harpsichord, the lute, the virginals
âupon which Queen Elizabeth's white
fingers condescended to strayâthe
viols, the clavicene, the viol da gamba,
the viola d'amour, and yet more. Mr.
and Mrs. Dolmetsch both play, and
Miss Kathleen Salmon, who provides
the vocal illustration, is also an instru
mentalist.
As to what one gets from the affairs
here is what Philip Hale saysâyou all
know Philip Hale of the Hub, and one
of the foremost critics of the day:
"The concert given by Arnold Dol
metsch and his assistants was one of
rare interest. Not merely because ar
chaic Instruments are shown and ex
plained and played, but also because
the players are enthusiasts in their
art; because there is a return for the
time being to the fresh days of music,
when beauty was neither aggressive
nor morbid, when there was simoly
faith and modest, fragrant sentiment.
It is a pleasure to speak of Mr. Dol
metsch's quaint, interesting explana
tion of the lute, cithern, viols, virginals
and harpsichord. Throughout the con
certs there was nothing to break the
spell for the enthusiasts, or. to use the
words in the old sense, the humor of
Mr. Dolmetsch only strengthened it.
To the hearer who does not measure
art by bulk, sensationalism or commer
cialism, how full of suggestion was
this old music in the performance;
what piquancy in the music of Scar
latti and Rameau when played on the
harpsichord, the instrument for which
this music was written.
"The music is as though it wers
written solely for you, and, perhaps,
one other. There is a personal appeal.
There ts necessarily close relationship
between player or singer and the
hearer. And then the emotion is in
the player and hearer, as well as In
the sonata or the song.
"Would that these artists might
visit us again, as we now know that
music is not a thing of purely modern
invention; and that there were musical
instruments before the gigantic orches
tras and ingenious mechanical con
trivances."

at the Alhambra Theater on February
7 and 10. Prices are to be Melba prices,

among other of Melba's numbers. Also
there is to be heard a young harpist
who has made a sensational success,
Signorlna Sassoll; Ellison Van Hoose,
the well-known tenor; Charles Gilibert,
the barytone, whom we shall all be
glad to welcome; Miss Llewela Davies,

FOLSOM ALMOST
FREE OF OPIUM
Drug Sells Among Convicts
at Unprecedented Trice
of Fifty Cents a Pellet
The opium market in Folsom Prison
is in crying stress. Scarcity of the
drug among the convicts has forced the
p.rice to a figure unprecedented in Cali
fornia's penitentiaries. The quotation
per pellet is now 60 cents, and the de
mand is clamorous. The normal rate,
as has been established for many years,
?t both Kepresa and San Quentin, is
wo pills for 5 cents.
Warden Yell has campaigned vigor
ously sdnee he took charge at Folsom
to Stamp out the opium traffic. All
wardens strive hard enough, but he has
bten by far the most successful. The
high price now obtaining among the
inmates of the prison attests this fact.
Yell has been relentless in his efforts
to keep the drug from the prisoners.
Last summer he summarily discharged
four guards who were in a conspiracy
to make high profit by smuggling
opium. Others of his force have been
quietly dropped from the rolls for the
same reason. The grounds have been
constantly searched for "plants" and
many have been unearthed. Those ex
perienced in prison management will
say that it is not possible to free a
penitentiary altogether of the drug,
and Yell's success, as Is Indicated by
the prison market price, they will also
say, is marvelous fn comparison with
conditions that have prevailed here
tofore.
The warden's diligence has not tend
ed to make maintenance of discipline
among the Inmates easier. Deprived of
the drug, the nerves of the convicts
have aroused a more dangerous unrest.
It is believed that the recent foolhardy
attempt at a break, in which several
prisoners were killed, was in large
measure due to deprivation of opium.
Jangling nerves had driven them to
desperation. Almost all the men In
volved In the effort for freedom were
addicted to the habit.
Folsom Prison is on the point of being
overcrowded, there being 1000 men in
stripes. To have the "fiends" virtually
denied the drug is a serious element, it
is realized, in the question of con
trolling them and vigilance has been
commanded the stronger of the guard
ing force. It Is something of a new ex
perience to have a threatening aspect
in the penitentiaries of the State as a
result of the scarcity of opium within
the walls.

BURNING WORDS
FOR THE MATE
John Bermingham Scores
the Negligence of Hedvall
of the Steamer Northland
It is not often, outside of the judicial
department of the United States, that
biting sarcasm is to be fpund in official
reports and decisions, but United
States Supervising Inspector John
Bermingham inserted a vitriolic para
graph in a decision yesterday strong
enough to corrode the toughest cuticle.
The matter before him was the appeal
of Peter C. Hedvall from the decision
of United States Local Inspectors O. F.
BoMes and John K. Bulger, who re
voked Hedvall's license as chief mate
on October 18 of last year for ground
ing the steamer Northland near Point
Pinos, Cal.. on September 19. Captain
Bermingham offered the following sug
gestion:
"I suggest that Mr. Hedvall devote
about a year to the study of the Pacific
Coast pilot, and the charts indicating
the location of the lighthouses, head
lands and soundings, especially along
the Pacific Coast of the United States.
"In order that such studies as I have
suggested may not be interfered with
by his official duties, I will modify the
penalty imposed upon the appellant,
Peter C. Hedvall, by the lower court,
from a revocation of his license to a
suspension of the same for twelve
months, from and after October 18,
1904, and it is so ordered.
" The appellant evidently took Point
Pinos lightâthen on his port side âfor
that of Santa Crue, which was twenty
miles distant on his port quarter. Such
gross negligence on his part could
have, been remedied by a view of a
chart, which, it appears, was not readi
ly accessible, by reason of the absence
of a chartroom conveniently near the
pilot-house, which should be, by all
means, a part of the equipment of
every vessel, especially one the size of
the Northland.
"I will not dwell on the neglect of the
master of the vessel for not placing his
orders in a proper book that should be
kept for that purpose in the pilot-house,
for the Information of his officers; nor
of his carelessness in giving his order
to the second mate, to be passed to the
appellant on coming on watch at mid
night, to call him (the master) when
the log Indicated one hundred. The or
der was too strictly complied with, on
the part of Hedvall, but too late for
correction, as shown by â¢ the result
above stated. The appellant should
have called the master half an hour be
fore he did, as the master did not give
any orders not to be called if an emer
gency arose. The entry in the pilot
house log book shows evidence of hav
ing been tampered with after the dis
aster."
When in disease or in company think
as little of yourself as possible.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', SUNDAY, JANUARY 29, 1905.
CONTRACT MAY
BE RESCINDED
Proceedings for Street Ee
pairs Illegal Because Au
thority Was Granted
City Attorney Long yesterday filed an
opinion with the Board of Supervisors
which will enable the Board of Public
Works to rescind the contract held by
the F. M. Yorke Company for the re
pair of bituminous pavements. Long
advises that the Board of Works has
not the power to enter Into a public
contract without specific authorization
of the Board of Supervisors. As such
authorization was not given by the Su
pervisors the fact will in all likelihood
be used as a loophole to take the con
tract away from the Yorke Company
on the ground that it was not legally
entered Into. The company has refused
to go on with the repairs because Its
bills for two months have been refused
payment by the Supervisors' Finance
Committee. The opinion says:
"In view of the fact that no express
provision of the law exists for the gen
eral repair of streets, other than such
as is found in section 14 of chapter I
of article VI, which power can be exer
cised by the Board of Public Works
only under authorization of the Board
of Supervisors, I am forced to the con
clusion that any contract let by that
board without such authorization
would be void. It is possible that a re
covery might be had under such a void
contract for the reasonable value of the
services rendered and materials fur
nished, but I am not requested to pass
upon that question in this reference,
and so express no opinion thereon."
In reply to a second question pro
pounded by the Supervisors:
"Has the Board of Public Works the
right to rescind any contract, providing
it has the power to make a contract,
for the repair of streets upon the fail
ure of the contractor to comply with
the requirements of said contract?
"If my view that the Board of Public
Works is without power to let a con
tract for the general repair of streets
without previous specific authorization
of the Board of Supervisors is correct,
an answer to your second inquiry be
comes unnecessary. Any contract at
tempted to be let without such au
thorization would be void and no re- ;
scision thereof would be required."

the organizations located at Los An
geles, Santa Ana, San Diego, Pomona,
Anaheim, Redlands, Long Beach, Pasa

tions in the Second Brigade.
At an election for first and second
lieutenants of Battery B, First Bat
talion of Artillery, Lieutenants Kneer

Duty Sergeant John Wilmot Cobby as
first and Private Arthur S. Hatfield as
second lieutenant.
P. N.Winlund has been commissioned
second lieutenant of Company A, Fifth

Adjutant General Lauck In reply to
questions asked has replied that he
concurs in the views of Attorney Gen
eral Ford to the effect that an officer
on the retired list who receives a com
mission in the National Guard forfeits
: his place on such list. The adjutant
general holds that an officer placed on
the retired list should be retired with
the rank last held in the guard. He
also expresses the opinion that an of
ficer cannot be on the retired and ac
tive list at the same, time, and that
when an officer on the retired list ac
cepts a commission to an elective office
in the guard he loses his place on the
i retired list.
i Under this decision if an officer of
the guard is placed on the retired list
with the rank of colonel and subse
quently receives a commission as ma
jor, to which position he has been elect
ed, his place on the retired list becomes
vacant, and if after the expiration of
his commission as major he again ap
ply for retirement he would be placed
:.on the list as a major.

with misappropriation of $295,000 of

contended by Garret W. McEnerney,

were based was insufficient in that it
did not properly aver the service of

for taking the deposition was not held
to be proof of his acceptance of ser

ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHN McNAITGHT .. â¢ M* f * w,g ?
PUBLICATION OFFICE .7.777.7..7. THIRD AKO MAXXSPI STREETS, 8AÂ» TRA3tCUcS
SUNTJA V.7 . .77 JANUARY 29, 1905
DURING the past week two things occurred of interest to I
business men and taxpayers. The Harbor Commission in San j
Francisco, negotiating for the sale of the seawall bonds which j
were authorized by popular vote in November, went far enough I
to discover that they will command a premium of 6 per cent. This is
' very satisfactory. It shows that investors have confidence in the
' proper management of the seawall and its revenues by the Harbor
Commission. These bonds do not rest on the credit of the city or of
. the- State, but are based entirely upon the property they will create
and are to.be paid out of its revenues. No one questions the legal
' ity or the propriety of such a bond issue. It adds no burden to the j
taxpayers.' It is to create a commercial convenience, a necessity for.
' those who desire to use it, and to pay for its use, and such users .
will pay for the improvement by paying the bonds. j
The other event was the decision of the Oakland City Council to j
'" submit to vote a proposition to bond that city for $5,750,000, for a
municipal Water plant, to be purchased of a corporation which claims
water rights in Santa Clara County. Instead of making these bonds
a lien on the plant, like the seawall bonds, they are to be issued on
.the credit of the city, to be a mortgage on the property of every
taxpayer. The time required to complete the plant is put at three
years' The law requires the bonds to be sold in a lump, so the
people will be paying interest and sinking fund taxes three years for
water before they get a drop. So they will have paid in taxes for
the bond interest alone $690,000 before they get any water. They
â¢ must pay a tax also each year for the sinking fund to redeem annually
one-fortieth of the principal of the bonds. This sinking fund will be,
the first year, $143,750: the second, $140,156; the third, $136,750; or a
total for the three years of $420,656.
The (Oakland Council, then, by asking the people to vote upon |
themselves a debt of $5,750,000 to buy a water plant that has no ex
istence, and from which it is admitted not a drop can be had for j
three- years, is asking them to pay a tax for that period, without
any return for it at all. of $690,000 for interest and $420,656 for sink
ing fund, or a total water bond tax that brings no water of $1,110,650.
â Granting thai the annual water bill paid to the Contra Costa during
that three years will be $400,000. or $1,200,000 for the whole period,
it will be seen that the Council asks the people to pay out on water
account for the next three years $2,310,650. This approaches fren
zied finance so closely as to be startling.
There were two ways to avoid it. but both are business ways
and therefore probably not attractive to a city government. One
was to buy the Contra Costa plant, an existing and operating supply
â¢ of water. If the parties could not agree on a price the offer of the
'company to accept condemnation should have been accepted. This
would put the city in immediate possession of a water plant and
o would save the payment of $1,110,650 in taxes on a bond issue, for
$650,000 of which, the interest, the people will never get any return
at all. It is money thrown in the fire. But the Council refused to
let the people pass upon the purchase of the existing plant at all.
â¢ Why? No one answers why, and the result is that the people are
' asked to vote upon themselves for the next three years a water tax
and water rate that will take from their pockets $2,310,650.
â¢ This is one of the results of trying to get a municipal plant while
leaving a competitor in the field. Everywhere it results in loss and
waste. Such result is so obvious that in Europe the law requires
that all private plants shall be bought before entering upon municipal
â¢ ownership.
The second way to avoid this, waste of a large sum of the tax
'.' payers' money is by basing the bonds on the plant alone. In that
event none but the water rate payers would pay interest or principal
on the bonds, and they would not pay a penny until the plant deliv
â¢ ered water to them and fixed their rate for it. The Council, without
explanation, rejected both of these plans, and adopted one to exact
from the people in the next three years a total water charge of
$2,310,650:
Concurrently with this remarkable exhibition of public finan
â¢ .cieriiig the seawall bonds were at a premium of 6 per cent, and the
taxpayers do not pay a penny of them, principal or interest, and the
â¢users of the seawall, who will pay them, will not pay a penny until
the wall is ready for their use, and then they will get value received
for their money. If the Oakland Council desires to furnish the
greatest possible contrast between grossly unbusinesslike methods
and those that are businesslike it has succeeded. We have prob
ably put the loss at a minimum, for with the litigation pending in
Santa Clara County against taking away the water claimed by the
new plant it is more likely to be six than three years before the
municipal plant can supply a drop of water.
The Call has insisted upon carrying business principles into
municipal socialism, if we are to have municipal socialism. We have
insisted that no private plant be left in the field to compete with a
municipal plant, and that bonds issued for a municipal plant be based
upon it alone, to be paid by those who use it. Our readers will see
in Oakland's plight our reasons for insisting upon these two things.
They are not only consistent with public ownership of public utili
ties, but are absolutely necessary to it, if the people are to have any
protection at. all under that policy.
LIVE STOCK MEN AT WAR.
A FIGHT is imminent between sheep and cattle men in Ante
lope'Valley. Heretofore this range war has not much dis
turbed California, but now threatens to break out here. An- 1
telope Valley is an arid grazing region, where the natural forage is i
considerable, and if put under control could be made a perma-'
nent grazing range of some importance. But it is public domain, j
subject to occupancy in common by rangers, and as a result the |
inevitable fight is on for possession of its fast disappearing pasture.'
The invading sheep have been temporarily turned back, but their
owners say they will return and then there will be destruction of
. property and perhaps of life.
This condition of things is not creditable to our Government, nor
to the citizens who cause it. The potential wealth of the arid re
gions was great. Most of the land now public domain is useless for
anything but grazing, and if put under some kind of control it would
be of permanent value as a wealth producer. Its forage has the j
same function in preserving moisture that the forest has, and this
it can perform and at the same time furnish pasture, if it be properly '
treated.
' The live stock men themselves are greatly to blame that some- |
thing has not been done by the Government before this to preserve '
the range. Their failure to agree upon and promote a plan is re
sponsible for the range wars and disorders which are the odium of
the W r est. If one of these wars occur in this State it is to be hoped
that the State authorities will interfere and put a stop to the carnage
and destruction.
SUPERFICIALLY it would seem that the Russian Government
has smothered revolution and preserved its entity. From St.
Petersburg, Moscow and the disturbed regions of Poland
comes word of conciliation being offered and met by the malcon
tents with a show of unanimous assent if not with enthusiasm. Lead
erless and without definite motive, the crowds of reds and socialists
that have been terrorizing both the old and the new capital of Rus-'
sia for the week past are being decimated by arrest and defection.
The revolution seems only to have been a riot.
Below the surface of things, however, appears a different aspect.
Even though .for the nonce the leaders of the new political thought
in the Czar's realm have been beaten and cowed by the ruthless
display of force, the movement which had its inception in St. Peters
burg within the past fortnight must go on, increasing in strength and
OAKLAND'S BONDS.
REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 29, 1905.
BY DOROTHY FENIMORE.
. . ' j y RT," says Bliss Carman in
J \ his latest book, "The Friend
ff ship of Art," "must convince
our reason, it must enlist our
sympathy, it must charm our sensuous
nature."
This last qualification of art I would
define more definitely than Mr. Car
man does in this sentence of his, and
in his succeeding paragraphs. Art, I
should say, really fails, so far as the
world is concerned, unless it touches
the chord of love. Of course, from the
artist's standpoint, he has succeeded
if through the medium of a superior
technique he has stirred the minds of
his feilowmen by some vital force, such
as wonder, fear or hatred. But his
masterpiece, however good In other
particulars, has not the vitality which
imparts vitality unless there is in it a
spark of the living life; and the living
life is love.
In one of his poems on Greek themes
Professor Symonds made a comparison
between art and love, which is marked
by that imaginative insight which is
poetry's inner self. He drew a picture
of a painter working through the long
hours of the night to put into visible
perfection his artist's dream. And
when at last, with the first blush of
the morning, comes fulfillment of his
aspiration, even then:
"Mid that supreme b atitude there lin
gers
An aching wantâa sense of something
missed â
Secluded, cloud involved, and unat
tainable.
The melody that neither flute nor lyre.
Through breath of maidens, or sharp
smitten strings,
Hath rendered. See how Art is like
to Love."
Art is love, indeed, runs on the phil
osophic thought. Poor are the both,
and prodigal. And both of them must
suffer, else inspiration, poems, pictures,
statues never would be born.
1 like this comparison. There is in
it a thought which it is wise to linger
over. When a lover suffers, as he does
invariably, if he is worthy of the name,
or when an artist suffers with that ten
sion of nerve and brain with which
genius expresses itself, each may know
how precious is his pain. For love is
pain ciuite as much as it is ioy. And
art is pain in due proportion to the art
ist's power.
Once, when I was traveling, I heard
âin one of those moments of confiden
tial reminiscence which are so likely
to rise in an idle hour between Deoole
who are comparative strangers to each
otherâa story from a fellow-tourist
which has come back to me many times
since, and always with a new apprecia
tion of its eloquence.
This gentleman had received not lone:
before from an old friend of his boy
hood a poem of hers called "Unfulflll
inent." He found it was almost an ex
act counterpart of another poem, pub
lished earlier, which had been written
by a young artist whom he knew, who
had failed to reach the eminence in her
chosen line of endeavor at which she
had originally aimed. The similarity
between the two productions was so
striking my acquaintance took the
latter poem with him when, shortly,
he revisited his home town, after an
absence of many years, and. calling
upon his old friend, he handed the slip
broadening in scope until at last it achieves ultimate victory. For j
the Russian people have at last had the bandage pulled from their
eyes. The "little father" is no longer "little father"; the aristocracy
of church and nobility no longer dazzles the commonalty into blind
adoration; faith in things political as* in things religious is now a
thing of the past. Skepticism, the dangerous, brooding skepticism
of the last days of the old regime in France, has seized upon the peo
ple of Russia and temporary reverse cannot check for long the im
petus of its progress. The revolution is already a present and
permanent fact even though the despotism of the bureaucracy may ,
hold hollow sway over the Government for several years to come.
The thing needed to crystallize the whole seething maelstrom of
revolt into irresistible onslaught is the vesting of leadership in the
person of a second Danton or Murat. The revolutionists are lead
erless, and while they remain thus action cannot be concerted nor re
sults centered upon definite action. When there arises in Russia-
as there surely will arise in this time of'crisisâa man of tremendous
power of initiative and command who can gather the whole skein of
revolution into his single hand, then will the overthrow of despotism
and the inception of free government be a fact accomplished.
RtJSSIA AND ENGLISH JOURNALS.
WHAT weight journalism may bring to bear upon the progress
of events for good or for evil may be conclusively determined
by a close following of the course the English press is taking
in reference to the quick march of Russian events. The Rus
sians have openly proclaimed that the English people through their
newspapers have given strong impetus to the disturbances now
raging throughout the Czar's empire and Britain's resentment
aroused by the charge bids fair to find its way into diplomatic chan
nels.
The most significant fact to present itself is that during the en
tire course of the present war in the Far East, English journals, not
excepting the most conservative even, have been over-ready to give
credence to the most exaggerated reports of Russian losses, defection
among the troops and incompetency on the part of the officers and
departmental chiefs. It was a correspondent of a London newspaper
who gave coinage to the story of General Stocssel's*cowardice after
the fall of Port Arthur. Again it was from an English news source
that word of Kuropatkin's vacillation at Liaoyang and the conse
quent demoralization of his troops came. The incident of the firing
upon the Hull trawlers naturally gave breath to the most sensational
charges and wildly imaginative prognostication of events.
All of which would seem plainly to demonstrate the fact that
the hostility of the British press is a power confronting Russia of no
mean or indefinable quality. It is ominous and threatening because
it is the sure index of the temper of the English people. Where
willful and systematic perversion of news values receives ready ac
ceptance at the hands of news readers blunt revelation of conditions
is affected such as the finesse of diplomacy could never accomplish.
The Mormon idea of marrying a man to a dead woman would certainly
seem to indicate that the Mormons take matrimony gravely.âRichmond News-
Leader.
Addicks has not been able to capture Port Delaware, although he has
expended an immense amount of time and treasure on his assaults. âChicago

of paper to her without a word, and
waited for her to explain, as best she
j could, what he believed was her act of
{ plagiarism.
! From the simplicity of her denial of
j guilt he gained a glimpse into
! her secret heart, which showed
! him the terrible disappointment
!in her life, of which he heard
! later from other lips than hers,
i Kor veais, it seemed, she had watched
| her husband, whom she dearly loved,
jgo down, down, from a youth of th*
! richest promise into the sodden wretch
: edness of the habitual drunkard,
j "Do you know what gave me the
idea?" the woman said. She led her
I caller to the window and pointed to a
â¢ peach tree in the yard.
"Every rprin,*." she said, "that tree
jis beautiful with buds and blossoms,
j The whole plate is filled with the
I fragrance of its promise. But it never
j bears any fruit. And it made me think
i
of the pitiful human story qÂ£ unfulfill
ment."
And the man, pondering over it all,
marveled at the narrowness of mortal
experience. He saw that the plots of
Hfe are few in numberâthat it is only
in details that the individual departs
from the several type:* which exist.
So, after all, it was not strange that
two women who had never met each
other, who had worked in ways utter
ly dissimilar, should both have reached
by their separate paths the samÂ» goalâ
that the cry of the disappointed artist's
soul was the cry of the disappointed,
loving wife.
Love means pain, some time or other,
in its course, v hether its destiny is ful
fillment or unfuliillment, either for our
hopes, for ourselves or for our ideals
of the ones we love.
But what of that? If we are not will
ing to work and suffer for the sake of
our love we have not the artist soul
within us.

Wanamaker of Philadelphia, when he
was already insured for $2,000,000, was
widely discussed in Insurance circles,
says the New York World. It developed
that the applicant for large insurance
is an object of special surveillance.
After a thorough examination as to his
heart action, lung capacity and general
physical condition the most vigorous
part begins.
Two men are detailed to investigate
his habits. They watch him at his clubs,
at the theater and wherever he may be.
They record what he drinks and what
he smokes. The hours he keeps are
carefully recorded. In short, a week's
biography in the applicant's life is
taken minutely, without his knowledge.
On this really depends the granting of
the policy.
"PANDEX OF THE PRESS."
How often you have heard your
friends say: "I'm so busy I haven't
time to read the newspapers. The best
I can do is to glance over the head
linos and perhaps read one or two
items." Perhaps, at times, you have
said substantially the same thing. And
you express the wish for some publi
cation that will give you the news and
other information in such form that
you will be able to read it in the lit- ;
tie time at your disposal for reading |
and feel then that you are pretty well
informed and not at a loss to discuss
the everyday events of this busy world.
Such a "long-felt want" is the "Pan
dex of the Press." and it is published
right here in San Francisco. "It reads
ill the newspapers from everywhere
and is a complete digest of the press
of the world âthe same thing in the
newspaper field." says the editor, "that
the Review of Reviews is in the mag
azine field:"
The February issue of the Pandex
of the Press, just out, contains more
than 100 pages of excellently selected
matter from the leading papers of the
country. It is brimful of good things,
as far as readable matter is concerned,
and its pages also contain reproduc
tions of the best work that has been
turned out lately by the cartoonists
of the big journals. The editor, too,
has not forgotten the lighter side of
life, and some hall-dozen pages are
devoted to little laughs culled from
the funny columns.
The Pandex q|f the Press is edited by
Arthur Â£ Street, lately editor in chief
( f the Associated Sunday Magazines
and managing editor of Collier's Week
ly. It has an attractive cover and its
typographical appearance compares
favorably with the leading magazines
of the country.

A DREAM WITH A MORAL.
A rich lady dreamed that she went to
heaven and there saw a mansion being
built.
"Whom is that for?" she asked of the
guide.
"For your gardener."
"But he lives in the tiniest cottage on
earth, with barely room for his family.
He might live better if he did not give
away so much to the miserable poor
folks."
Further on she saw a tiny cottage be
ing built.
"And whom is that for?" she asked.
"That is for you."
"But I have lived in a mansion on
earth. I would not know how to live in
a cottage."
The words she heard in reply were
full of meaning. "The Master Builder is
doing his best with the material that is
being sent up."
Then she awoke, resolving to lay up
treasures in heaven.âChicago Post.

BESSIE W/iyi\E^SlVS

OH, good gracious!" cried
Bessie. She had jumped
up from her seat under the
great oak, her eyes large
and dark with terror. "This must be
he now coming up the avenue! And
no one at home but me!"
Involuntarily her -swift glance meas
ured the distance to the gabled frame
house, then her frightened look went
back to the- man limping up the path
from the gate. No, she could not reach
the house before he was beside her.
And of all things she despised cow
ardice. So she hastily picked up the
magazine she had dropped in her first
shock of alarm, and gripped it very
tightly to keep her hands from trem
bling. He was nearâquite near her
now. He stood still, and their eyes
met.
She saw a muscular-looking young
He opened his eyes, sat erect
and took the glass.
fellow, with wavy blond hair, a good
square chin and dark blue eyes, direcl
md intelligent of glance. He held hie
handkerchief to a wound on his tem
ple, and she noticed the square ol
linen was crimson. His appearance
R-as singularly disheveled. His clothes
jvere muddy, as though he had waded
:hrough creeks. His hat was battered.
\nd the halting way in which he
iragged his leg indicated injury.
He saw a young and very pretty girl
iressed in a soft woolen gown of crim
son cashmere. Her eyes were gray,
3ut just now so dilated were the pupils
they appeared to be black. The wind
had ruffled her dusky hair about her
forehead. There was no color in the
piquant, frightened face.
"I beg your pardon!" the man said,
ipd took off his hat. "I fear I have
startled you. I've had quite anâan ex
perience, and an accident. Have you
my objection if I go into the house?
t should like a drink of waterâand to
rest for a little while."
Bessie Hammersley strove to speak.
Put no words came to her lips. She re
called what her uncle had told her a
few hours before, when he had gope
nto the house for his revolver, mount
?d his big gray horse, and had drawn
â¢em to explain before he joined the
sosse of determined-looking farmers
md townspeople at the gate.
'"Held up the bank at the county seat
all by himself and got away with a cool
thousand. This isn't his first exploit.
He's a nervy ruffian. The banker is
Jangerously wounded âshot through
the shoulder. He thinks âin fact he
knows âhe hit the robber when he fired
by th? blood that marked his escape.
It isn't likely he'll have got far away
before we strike his trail. And when
we do â"
He had nodded grimly there and gal
loped off.
And now here was a travel-stained,
injured, grimy individual confronting
her and asking aid. If only the ser
vants had not gone in by special per
mission to the annual fair in the near
est town. If only her aunt had not gone
over to spend the morning with a
neighbor.
"I'm afraid." the man said with a
smile, surprised, evidently, at her si
lence and her air of intense agitation,
"that you consider me too disreputable
an individual to admit to your home."
He glanced down deprecatingly at his
soiled and disordered attire. "If you
have objections," he said with what
sounded like an inflection of offense,
"I shall wait here, if you will be good
enough to bring me the water."
He sank down on the seat, and as he
did so a groan burst from his lips. She
saw drops of sweat start out around his
handsome mouth.
"Oh, I will!" she cried compassion
ately. "You are suffering. I am sorry.
Just wait a moment."
And pity was the sensation para
mount in the mind of Bessie Ham
mersley as she sped across the tawny
grass, looking like a flash of flame in
he. vivid gown.
Supposing he were a bandit twenty
times over. He reminded her of
Charlieâher beloved young brother.
Brandy. Some was always kept up
stairs in tho medicine chest' for emer
gencies. So up the stairs she flew,
dashed a quantity of the liquor into
the glass she held, and, adding water
at the kitchen sink, sped out again
into the autumn sunshine and across
the lawn.
"Here," she gasped, "take thisâ
quick!"
He was deadly pale. His head, with
eyes closed, rested against the brown
tree trunk. His handkerchief had fal
len to the ground, and she saw that
the blood was trickling from a jagged
cut across his temple.
Without the slightest shrinking or
hesitation she leaned down and held the
glass to his lips.
"You must drinu this at once: she
said, speakingly loudly. "And the?! y< v
| may go into the house, if you wish,
j You can gc up in the attic and lie
| down. No one goes there." Her touch,
1 her voice, the strong odor of the liquor
| roused him. He opened h>s eyes, .sat
1 erect and took the glass with a slight
bow of acknowledgment and a swift
smile.
"You are very good." He drank the
mixture gratefully. Almost at once
its effect was perceptible. The color
came back to his cheek. He groped for
his handkerchief. "I shall not intrude.
It is nothing. I shall be all right pres
ently."
But he spoke to the dancing leaves,
for Bessie had fled back to the house.
When she returned she carried a roll
of linen.
"You mUst let me bandage your
head," she said. "Then, if you think
you would be safer you may go into
the barn."
"Safer!" he repeated blankly.
"Yes. Sit still, please!" It took all
her tender memories of Charlie, and
the persistent thought that if he were
in trouble she would wish even strang
ers to be kind to him, that made her
force herselfâshrinking with repulsion
the whileâto wind the white material
over the Jagged cut. "There!" She.put
a final pin and stepped back. "They
will be coming back this way, and I'm
afraidâl knowâthey will see you from
the road!"
He rose and stood looking down on
her in bewilderment.
"Who will see me?" he asked. "Why
should I mind?"
"Oh," she cried suddenly, and clasped
her hands In distress, "they are coming
this way now! They must have traced
you here!" She pointed away to where
many figures were visible, approaching
through a vast blur of dust along the
country road. "They are terribly angry.
You must go somewhere âtit once! You
must get awayâquick!"
"My dear child," he cried, "why
should they be angry at me? What
have I done?"
"Oh, you know what you've done!"
she cried In piteous passion. "You've
robbed the bank at the county seat and
shot the banker, and âand he shot at
youâand that's why you're wounded â
andâ"
She broke off in amazement. For, al
though the mounted men were steadiiy
drawing nearer, this reckless young
man sank again to the bench and burst
into laughter so gay, so amused, so
ringing, that she began to doubt his
sanity.
"Bess!" roared a stentorian voice.
She looked toward the gate. Her un
cle had stopped his horse, but the oth
ers were jogging along. Like one walk
ing in a dream she went down at his
summons.
"They landed the bandit safe in jail
before we reached there, so we turned
back. That young fellow," indicating
the man under the tree, "ought to be
in bed. He got a pretty bad fall wnen
his automobile ran into the ditch. I
told him this was the nearest house,
and to come on here so your aunt
could look after him. What are you
shaking for? I've got to go on into
town. He's a city manâa fine young
fellow. I used to know his father.
His name is Frederic Lyle. His friend
v/ent on to town for Dr. Fox. They'll
be here pretty soon. Tell your aunt
to get a fine dinner. We'll keep the
boys over night if they'll stay."
Blushing furiously, Bessie went
slowly back to where young Lyle
stood.
"Oh," she said brokenly, "what a
dreadfulâdreadful mistake!"
"You must have thought," he de
clared quizzically, "that the banker
assaulted me with a rock! A bullet
doesn't leave this kind of a mark."
She broke down and laughed help
lessly.
"Come in." she said, and held out
her hand. "I wonder if you will ever
forgive me."
Her eyes drooped under the linger
ing glance that met her own.
"I am pretty sure I shallâsome
dayâon one condition," he said slj
nificantly.

"The Simple Life" of Charles Wagner, who
has but recently been introduced to us by
our honorable President. There is a deep
thought underlying these simple sentences.
We can hardly question the good logic set
forth in these words; neither will, we deny
the truth of this statement, granted that we
are to some extent familiar especially with
our modern city life. Thousands of people
of undoubted good will are constantly
jumping their nearest duties, in the mean
while wasting their time and energy on dis
tant objects. And probably the home is the
heaviest loser in this misdirected race of

dollars toward the founding and maintain
ing of high schools of learning; but at the
same time the duty of personally directing
and supervising the education of their own
offspring is set aside. There are numbers
of mothers ever ready for work of charity
|at large; but at the same time the care for
I their own little ones is intrusted to un
scrupulous servants. There are many
parents well informed as to the demands
and needs of society abroad; but they are
well-nigh strangers within their own family
circles; the environments of their children,
their developments, their thoughts, theii
dangers, their sorrows, their hopes, their
mishaps, their aspirations are over

achievements. I am not speaking of those
piteously disordered homes, where all the
natural relations arc distorted and broken;
but I am referring to honorable families of
good and high social standing.
Now there is certainly something wrong
about this course of our social life of to
day. The distant duty, so attractive and
fascinating, is successfully enticing us away
from the near duty, so simple and so mo
notonous. And the result is quite evident
and must not be underestimated. I have be
fore me a January number of one of our
periodicals and there find a fair warning,
which is well up to date. It reads thus:
"Take care of the children! In the prisons,
reformatories and jails of the United States
there are living approximately a hundred
thousand criminals, and three-fourths of
these come from the army of neglected
children. What unscrupulousness on the
part of parents!" Judge Thomas of Ala
bama has recently published the result of
his careful investigations into the criminal
life within the United States. He finds
that each million of persons living within
the bounds of our country does annually
yield 129.3 of manslayers, while on the
same basis Canada is averaging but 9.6,
Great Britain 10.15, and France 11.22. Such
figures reveal a most alarming fact before
our sight. And it is only fair on the ground
of common experience to trace a great part
of this deplorable state of affairs back to
the lack of true and pure home life in our
great nation. We can haYdly evade this
conclusion. Our people as a whole are well
up to the standards of learning and social
education at our time. Our public school

I fear we are devoting too much of our

thereby laying the foundation for shrewd

the inculcation of true moral principles into
the hearts of our young. It is quite well,
by increasing our knowledge, to throw our
abilities on broader fields of operation. But
it is an evil thing to leave the nearest field
uncultivated, the field of our heart, the
homestead of our life. It is by all means

St. Vitus' dance. If he don't do that he
bombards his fellow man with th' kind iv
a composition that they keep boys afther
school f'r. Carney made wan iv that kind
at this banket. Carney has a head as hard
as a cocynut. He wanted a new bridge
built acrost th' crick an' he was going' to
talk about that at th' banket. On th' way
over he tol' me about it. He argyed so well
that he convinced me. an' I'm wan iv th'
most indignant taxpayers f'r a poor man
that ye iver knew. I thought whin he got
up he wud say something like this: 'Boys,
we need a new bridge. Th' prisint want is
a disgrace to th' ward. Curtins' horse fell
through it last week. By jimuneddy, if
Billy O'Brien don't get us a new bridge
we'll bate him at th' prim'ries.' That wud
have gone fine, for Curtin was a loud an'
poplar fish peddler. But what did Carney
do? He niver was within four thousan'
miles iv a swing bridge acrost th' Chicago
River. Says he: 'Gintlemen: We ar're th'
most gloryous people that iver infested th'
noblest counthry that th' sun iver shone
upon,' he says. 'We meet here to-night,'
he says, 'undher that starry imblim that
flaps above freerrren's homes in ivry little
hamlet fr'm where rolls th' Oregon in ma
jestic volumne tc th' sun-kist wathers iv th'
Passyfic, to where th' Pimsicoddy. shim
mers adown th' pine clad hills iv Maine,'
he says. 'Th' hand, iv time,' he says
'marches with stately steps acrost th' face
iv histhry, an' as I listen to its hoof beats
I hear a still small voice that seems to say
that Athens (a shout), Greece (a shrill cry),
Rawhm (a shriek), an' Egypt (a deep roar)
an' iver on an upward an' as long as th'
stars in their courses creep through eternity
an' twinkle as they creep recallin' th'
wurruds iv our gr-reat pote, "Twinkling
stars ar-re laughin', love, laughin' at you
an' me.' and a counthry, gintlemen, that
stands to-day as sure as to-morrah's sun
rises an' kisses th' flag that floats f'r all.
Now, gintlemen, it is growin' late an' I
foreign tutor, however loving and consci
entious, will by skill ever gain the same in
fluence over a child's heart which God by
nature has granted to a true father and
mother. It is a gross error, committed by
many well-meaning parents of our day, to
waste their good will on remoter duties,
while their nearest duties are more or less
shifted to the shoulders of persons much
less qualified for the task and responsibility.
Our social relations to the outside world
have in many respects grown to excess to
the detriment of our home relations. And
the sooner we acknowledge this fact and
make recourse to the more simple home
life of our venerable forefathers, the more
will we contribute to the true welfare of our
people. A father should spend less even
ings at the clubroom. not to speak of more
questionable resorts, and should devote
more of his time to the home fireside. A
mother should subtract from the long list
will not detain ye longer, but I have a few
wurruds to say. I appeal fr'm Philip
dhrunk to Philip sober.' That ended th'
speech an' th' banket. Th' chairman's
name was Philip. Th' second Philip that
Carney mintioned was not there.
"I guess a man niver becomes an orator
if he has annything to say, Hinnissy. If a
lawyer thinks his client is innocint, he
talks to th' jury about th' crime. But if he
knows where th' pris'ner hid th' lead pipe,
he unfurls th' flag, throws out a few re
marks about th' flowers an' th' bur-ruds an'
asks th' twelve good men en' thrue, not to
break up a happy Christmas, but to sind this

th' eye army man that attimpts to wrap up
his sicond-hand oratory in th' American

to read in th' pa-aper some day/that Joe

"No, sir. whin a man has something to
say an' don't know how to say it, he says
it pretty well. Whin he has something

of her self-imposed duties toward her social
circles and should add such amount to the
divine duties toward her family circle. This
solution of our life problem would be fair,
natural and successful. It would not only
lessen the burdens of hosts and minimize
the number of nervous prostrations, so
characteristic of our times, but it would
also increase their happiness of heart and
would insure worthy success of their life
work. Let us here follow the good example
held out by our honorable chief executive,
who, burdened with the cares of a nation,
nevertheless finds ample time to devote to
his dear family. Let us strive toward fos

home life, home life so essential for the
moral uplifting of our coming generation
and the future welfare of our country.
What They Hope For.

HE TOOK AMERICAN
GIE FOR A WIFE
ENGLISH MEMBER OF NORTH
SEA COMMISSION WHO IS
PHOI'D OF AMERICAN WIFE.
LONDON, Jan. 2S. âIt is not gener
ally known that Admiral Sir Lewis j
Anthony Beaumont, the representative
of Great Britain in the international
commission that is inquiring into the
attack of Russian warships on the i
North Sea fishing fleet, has an Ameri- j
can wife. She is the daughter of ;
Charles Perkins of Boston and a I
very charming and socially popular j
woman. The gallant sailor considers I
his marriage to her in lSSf> as the most
fortunate event of his career, ashore
or afloat.
Sir Lewis is still a young man as !
British admirals go, being three years
short of 60 yours old. Ho entered i
the navy some four and forty years
ago. England has done little sea fight- i
ing during that period, and it is not j
the admiral's fault, therefore, that h'j j
has seen little of naval engagements, i
As a lieutenant he served in the Arc
tic expedition *of 1875 and 1376, and
earned promotion for his services and
also a fellowship in the Royal Geo- j
graphical Society. In he was j
naval attache for Europeâa species of
roving commission whose high-sound- j
ing title conveys rather more thÃn its I
actual duties warrant. For thres years j
subsequently ho was private secretary i
to Lord Northbrook when that states
man was First Lord of the Admiralty,
and as High Commissioner accom
panied him on his fa.vi.M... mission to
Egypt In 1884. From 1831 to 189 Che
was commander of the training squad
ron, and during the three years follow
ing added greatly to his reputation as
director of naval intelligence. For the
next three years he was naval A. D. C.
tÂ«i Queen Victoria.
In 1599 he was made commander in
chief of the Pacific, with headquarters
in Australia. He was there when th*;
Prince and Princess of Wales made
their globe-circling tour, and while
they were In Australia ho was in per- !
sonal attendance on them. It affords !
a striking illustration of the species i
of flunkeyism which gains titles that
It was for this and not for eminence
in his profession that he was made a I
K. C M. G.âknight commander of the i
Order of St. Michael and St. George, j
However, he has deserved it for other
things. His shore training, no less
than his experience aiioat. well quali- !
lies him for the semi-Judicial duties
which attach to his present mission, j
He is well versgd in the arts of dl
plomacy, and better perhaps than that i
bluff sea dog. Sir Charles Beresford,
knows how to give expression to an
emphatic opinion without wounding
the sensibilities of his colleagues. To
consummate knowledge of seamanship
he adds the polish of wide culture and
familiarity with court society. As his
photograph shows, he has what Jack
Tar calls a fine ficurehcad.
WEALTHY AMERICAN GIRL
SCORNS BRITISH TITLES
LONDON, Jan. 28.âThere are few
women in England who dispense char
ity more genen-us y and with less osten
tation than Miss Van Wart, formerly
of Washington? The poor of London's
dreary East End, especially the chil
dren, are regular recipients of her
bounty, but it is not restricted to any
one locality. Wherever she goesâand
she is fond of travelâshe devotes time
and money to the poor of the locality.
Duiing a recent visit to the High
lands of Scotland she personally visited
many of the croftersâsmall peasant
farmers, many of whom are in a chonic
state of povertyâand found much to
arouse her compassion. She relieved
some of the most urgent cases at once
by donations of food and clothing, and
left a substantial sum with a local
charitable society to be expended in the
relief of these poor people.
Miss Van Wart is an Inveterate and
fearless slum explorer. On her return
journey to London she stopped at Glas
gow, whose praises as a model munici
pality have been sounded by several
American writers, and visited some of
the districts that are seldom seen by
trans-Atlantic tourists. Here she found
destitution and misery quite equal to
anything that she had seen in the worst
quarters of London. Things were not
quite so bad with many of the poor
wretches when she left the city.
Miss Van Wart is very popular in
English society, and at the same time
a sore puzzle to It. She is rich," main
tains a handsome town residence in
Curzon street and a stately country
seat âDitton Parkânear Slough, and
entertains hospitably at both places.
Apparently she prefers England to
America. She is a handsome woman,
with a dignified manner and bearing
that would grace the most exalted po
sition.
Though peers in plenty are willing to
share their titles with her, she persists
In remaining a spinster and retaining
control of her own exchequer.
Pawns His I'ncle's Tomb.
VIENNA, Jan. 28. âThe friends and
comrades of Marshal Karl yon Turn
fort, who was curator of the army
museum In this city and died in 1896.
were recently much worried by the
fact that his body had been secretly
removed from the magnificent mauso
leum he had built in the St. Leonard
cemetery at Gratz and placed in a
plebeian grave without even a suitable
inscription or cross. Investigation re
vealed the fact that a nephew of the
general, who led a gay life, had
pledged his uncle's tomb as security
for a large champagne bill at a fash
ionable hotel. â¢

MANCHESTER, Jan. 28.âAn Ameri
can company's recent location in Man
chester is going to make a lot of dif
ference in the condition of the working
classes of this city. The company in
question is the American Wagon and
Car Company, and up to the time that
its representatives made their ap
pearance in Manchester, a few months
ago, it looked as if there would be
nearly as acute distress here through
lack of employment as exists in Lon
don at present. Things were slack
everywhereâthe cotton mills were on
short time, and even the Westinghouse
Company showed no signs of wanting
more hands.
Soon after the American Wagon and
Car Company started operations in
Manchester, however, it became evi
dent that the whole situation was go
ing to be changed. The company came
over at the invitation of the promoters
of the new "tube" which will connect
the south and southwest of London
with the northwest by means of a
tunnel under the Thames at Charing
Cross. The distance is about four
miles, and the scheme is going to be
known as the Waterloo and the
Baker street extension. The line is ex
pected to be ready for working in
about six months, before which time
the Wagon and Car Company has
contracted to produce all the necessary
rolling stock.
Four acres of land have been ac
quired by the company at Old Traf
ford. a suburban district of Manches
ter, and here an army of workmen have
been employed night and day for the
last month erecting the necessary
buildings and machinery. The sys
tem employed is to go on producing
the rolling stock for the "tube" simul
taneously with the erection of the
building. English workmen have never
seen anything like this before, and
those who come to seek employment
look on in amazement at the hus
tling that Is proceeding under appar
ently quiet and well organized condi
tions. Those who have been taken on
are now earning wages which they
never before have received in any Brit
ish employment. The company will
spend at least $75,000 between now and
April in the purchase of material for
the construction of their works, and
much of this is to be found In Man
chester and the district. ;
It Is estimated that the company will
be able to give employment to between
1000 and 1500 men when every'thlrg is
in proper working order. The rolling
stock of the Waterloo and Baker street
extension is merely the commencement
of their operations in England. Big
ger things are expected to follow.

Remarkable Career of Lon-I

Burglar and Village Sleuth
STORY OF DOUBLE LIFE
* !
Sentence of Four Years in;
English Prison Is Fate of a |
Decidedly Clever Rascal!
LONDON, Jan. 28.âSherlock Holmee 1
and the amateur cracksman rolled Into I
oneâthat was Joseph Machln Hirst, 'â 
who, despite his esthetic to
the demeaning associations it entailed, |
was recently sentenced to four years'
penal servitude at Newington Sessions. ;
The story of his dual lifeâhow he was
a burglar by night and a highly aris- ,
tocratic sort of detective by dayâis an
amazing one. The Scotland Yard men
describe Hirst as one of the cleverest
rogues of his generation.
The police credit Hirst with having
committed no less than forty burgla
ries in Balham during the last year,
but although this extraordinary series
of crimes has been for some time the
chief topic of conversation in this
South London suburb, up to a few
weeks ago no one was less suspected
in connection with them than the
prosperous "private inquiry agent,"
who lived in one of the most comfort
able houses In Balham, and who moved
in the smartest circles in the district. ,
In fact, on more than one occasion
Hirst was called in to "investigate" .
one of the crimes that he himself had
committed. He really was a social fa- j
vorite, but all the time he was doing
the society act he was also getting j
"wise" to the peculiarities of the dis-
Met and its people and finding out |
which houses contained valuables and
by what methods the latter might be j
obtained.
In the dock Hirst declared that until
abottt a year ago detective work was ;
his real means of getting a living.
Then, however, he says that the scan- i
dal spoiled his business and obliged
him to turn burglar while pretending
to be still on the side of justice. What- \
ever success he may have had as a ]
sleuth, there is no doubt that he found !
the trade he was best fitted for when i
he took to burglary. For sheer au- i
dacity and quickness at seizing an op- |
portunity the hero of Hornung's sto- \
ries was not to be compared with this '
real amateur cracksman.
At the house where Hirst lodged he
had bachelor apartments which could
only have been kept up by a man with
a substantial income. He was engaged
to a girl of good family and it was
largely through "keeping company"
with her that he made some of his
richest hauls. As her intended he was
invited to many functions and seldom
received an invitation of this kind
without utilizing it as an aid to theft.
At one dinner party he sat beside his
sweetheart's sister. He made an ex- |
cuse for leaving the dinner table rather
hurriedly, and. rushing off. broke into 1
the sister's house. Having taken all
he wanted he returned to- the party and
spent the rest of the evening sitting be- j
tween his fiancee and her sister with
the latter's jewelry in his pocket. On 1
another night he accompanied the girl '
to a ball, when he took a fancy to a
diamond stud worn by the master of |
ceremonies. A few days after Hirst
broke Into the man's house and stele
the piece of jewelry. As a guest at
an afternoon reception the "detective" |
had his attention called by his hostess
to some beautiful old silver. A few I
nights later the silver disappeared. 1
This was one of the cases that Hirst i
was called upon, in his capacity of
sleuth, to investigate. Needless to say !
he didn't produce the criminal. After j
committing another daring burglary he
called and sympathized with his vic
tims, and suggested that in addition to
the ordinary lock on- their front door
they should put en a Yale. They lost
n<> time in following his advice, when j
Hirst in order to show his contempt for j
all locks, broke into the place again.

His nerve and coolness never desert
ed him. One day he entered a
house in broad daylight while the wom
an who owned it was out for a walk.
While he was inside the woman's
father-in-law arrived and knocked at
the door. Hirst opened It, saluted the
caller and told him rather frigidly that
the lady of the house was out. The rel
ative left immediately, but while going
away met his daughter-in-law and de
manded who was the man she had in
her house. Of course, she was astound
ed, but when she reached home with
a policeman, found that the Intruder
and a goodly number of her most valu
able trinkets had disappeared.
Hirst had a particularly ingenious
way of getting into houses, and one
which generally puzzled the police, who
could nevei find that locks had been
forced or wir.dcws broxen. He had a
wire with a loop at the end of It par
tially wound with cotton wool, and so
arranged that if put through a "letter
box it could be used to pull back the
Catch of the doorlock. Hirst got rid of
his plunder to dealers in stolen proper
ly, whom he met by night at some
specially chosen rendezvous. He corre
sponded with them by means of cipher
messages.
Unluckily for this amateur cracksman
be hart an uncommonly clever member
of his former craft on his trail In the
person of Detective Sergeant Fipp of
Scotland Yard. For months while the
Balham burglaries were going on and
Hirst was playing the part of society
butterfly on the proceeds therefrom.
Fipp worked on the mystery without
much result. At first the authorities
had believed that an organized gang
was at work, but after a while Fipp
satisfied himself that the series of
crimes were committed by one man.
He decided, too, that the robber must
live In the district which he evidently i
knew like a book. Sj he set himself
to find out if there was any one in Bal
ham who seemed to be prospering ex
ceedingly without doing much work.
Finally he became suspicious of Hirst,
vÂ«;ho, though ha posed as a private de
tective, didn't appear to have many
clients and yet lived on the fat of the
land. So he got in touch with Hirst's
landlord and eventually got permission
to visit th* "detective's" rooms. In the
fireplace the real sleuth discovered a
torn check taken from a checkbook
which had formed a part of the pro
ceeds of a recent burglary. Then he
arrested Hirst and made a more careful
search of his establishment, when arti
cles of jewelry and other valuables
were found relating to seventeen cases
of theft.
Not the least remarkable thing about
Hirst's case was the plea on which, af
ter his conviction, the "gentleman bur
glar" asked not to be sentenced to pe
nal servitude. Through his counsel he
issued a written petition to the Judge,
in which, after stating that his relatives
were highly respectable and that he
had received a good education, he said:
"I have during my remand seen enough
of the ordinary prisoners to see what
they are like, and I can assure you that
it is my earnest desire not to associate
with such a class of people. I pray you
not to send me to prison to mix with
such an ordinary class of criminals."
But estheticism didn't appeal to the
Judge, who gave Hirst the maximum
sentence.

Scaly
Scalps
Nine people out of every
ten have trouble with their
heads. Many of them
suffer from a species of
eczema, which forms a dry
scale upon the skin of
the scalp, popularly known
as dandruff.
If this condition be
neglected the hair follicle
loses all its vitality, the
hair becomes brittle and
falls out, and baldness is
the inevitable result.
Coke Dandruff Cure has
proved to be the only
reliable cure for this
annoying condition. It
positively removes, with
one or two applications,
every trace of dandruff.
Faithfully used it will cure
every diseased condition of
the scalp (except
constitutional blood
disorders), and will
produce a luxuriant, glossy
growth of hair after all
other remedies have failed.
This is a strong
statement and one which
we would not dare to make
if we were not in
possession of thousands of
grateful letters from people
in every walk of life, who
have proved, to their
intense gratification, the
wonderful powers of
Coke Dandruff Cure.
If you are annoyed with
any scalp trouble
whatsoever, get a bottle

will tell you the same story
of uninterrupted triumph.

Strikers are cutting telegraph wires

fears of most serious disorders, espe
cially In Poland, are expressed.
Governor General Trepnff has warned

There is much gossip about what is

only thing certain is that the Emperor

MOSCOW, Jan. 28.âThe situation
here to-night is slightly more threat

sprees and have become turbulent.
The disposition of the troops makes
serious trouble to-morrow unlikely,
but If the men continue drinking there
undoubtedly will be disorders. The
authorities, however, still hope to
avoid bloodshed.
Commenting on the London telegram

St. Petersburg society shares the be

how a Princess who was expressing
the most positive views 1 concerning

"You talk like an anarchist."
"Are you not one?" replied the
Princess.

Kuropatkin Begins a General
Movement Against Both
Japanese Flanks.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 29. â
Whether or not the report be true that
General Kuropatkin has broken
through the lines of Field Mar
shal Oyama, the press learns
from a high military source that
General Kuropatkin has under
taken a general offensive movement
on both flanks, with the object of
threatening both lines of Japanese
communication and forcing the Jap
anese from their winter quarters. The
informant of the press said:
"After General Mistchenko's raid
General Kuropatkin decided that
Oyama's position could be turned
westward from the plains. The ad
vance has absolutely no connection
with the events in European Russia.
If, as has been reported, the Russians
have already succeeded In piercing the
Japanese left, they doubtless will be
able td reach a point west of Liao
yang, in which case the Japanese will
be outflanked. A similar movement
southward from Bentsiaputze will
strike the Japanese line of communi
cations toward the Yalu. AlthQugh
cold, the weather is ideal for winter
campaigning. The ground is hard and
the rivers frozen solid, making the
handling of artillery easy."
Genera! Kuropatkin has few less
than 300,000 men and more than 1100
guns. The troops engaged on the right,
in addition to General Mistchenko's and
General Rennenkampff's cavalry, are
believed to be principally Siberian, and
part of the first European army.
A telegram from Chansiamutun
says the Russians lost forty-five of
ficers and 1000 men killed or wound
ed at the capture of the village of
Sandepas on January 26. The Rus
sians took 102 Japanese prisoners, be
sides arms, wagons and ammunition.
The general staff has received the
following dispatch from General Sak
haroff, General Kuropatkin's chief of
staff:
"Our troops continue on the offen
sive at Sandepas. South of there our
cavalry encountered four Japanese
battalions and six squadrons of cav
alry advancing from Heikoutai. The
Japanese fled, throwing their arms
into ambulance wagons. One of our
columns took thirty prisoners and an
other captured twenty."
All dispatches from Russian cor
respondents at the front foreshadow a
batttle of decisive character. They
tell of arrangements for the receipt of
an immense number of wounded, not
only at Mukden, but as far back as
Harbin, and speak of a general en
gagement in which almost a million
men and 2500 guns were to be in
volved and say that the importance of
the engagement will overshadow the
battles of Shakhe River and Liao
yang.
Rumors are already flying about of
defeat and victory. Success, all ad
mit, will be of immeasurable value to
the Government at this juncture,
while disaster would only serve to
complicate the situation and render
the Government's position still more
difficult, if not critical.
JAPANESE DRIVEN BACK.
Retreat Five Miles From Their Ad
vanced Positions.
MUKDEN. Jan. 28. âA general en
gagement is progressing. Only the left â 
flank is not involved. The hospitals
here and at Harbin have been placed
Jr. readiness to receive large numbers
of wounded, of whom about 1000 have
already arrived at Mukden. Several
hundred Japanese were made prison
ers.
The battle commenced on the right
flank, on General Kuropatkin's initia
tive. The Japanese were driven back
five miles from their advanced posi
tions, defended by the reserve bri
gades.
The fighting extended on January 26
to the center. The Japanese en
deavored to take Poutiloff Hill and
other positions, but were driven back
with heavy losses.
The men going into battle are well
prepared for the weather conditions,
being warmly clad and shod, well fed
and in good spirits.
The activity of General Mistchenko's
fast riding cavalary continues. A
large Japanese transport train was
captured on the extreme right of the
west flank.
MUKDEN, Jan. 28, nightâThe most
important cannonade since the first
battle on the Shakhe River was main
tained all yesterday in a continous
snowstorm against the Japanese left, |
which Field Marshal Oyama has been j
reinforcing with troops from Port Ar- I
thur since General Mistchenko's raid. J
The attack was centered about seven j
miles west of Shakhe station, and re- j
suited in the Japanese withdrawing
from Holantai and Funchuangchiatzu, I
which the Russians have occupied. The J
cannonading and snowstorm continued j
undiminished to-day. It is considerably j
colder.
The cannonading Indicates that an;
extended contest is progressing. The |
i driving wind and snÂ«w favor the Rus- |
j sians, thus offsetting the advantage the
' Japanese had last October, when the
I sun shone in the Russians' eyes.
! To-day's reports Indicate that the
I Japanese are continuing to fall back,
I while the Russian cavalry has ad
vanced its lines ten miles.
The Japanese yesterday flew a large
kite into the Russian lines. The kite
was covered with photographs show
ing the kindly treatment of Russian!
prisoners in Japan.
On January 27 there was a heavy'
cannonade on the right flank. It sub
sided entirely shortly after noon, and
quiet now continues throughout the
center and right.
NOT IN ACCORD WITH HAY.
Minister Hayashi Believes Neutrality
Conference Would Be Futile.
LONDON, Jan. 28.âBaron Hayashi,
the Japanese Minister to Great Britain,
talked freely to-day on the subject of
Secretary of State Hay's proposal for
a conference by the powers on the in
tegrity of China. Minister Hayashi does
not regard the proposition as being
likely to result in a satisfactory adjust
ment of the question, and is of the
opinion that it would not bring about
any improvement of the existing situa
tion.
"Mr. Hay's proposal is decidedly in
teresting," said the Baron. '"It is only
another evidence of the sincere desire
of the American State Department to
reach some acceptable solution of the
vexed question of the preservation of
the territorial integrity of China. For
my part, however, I am unable to see
how it could be effectual under the cir
cumstances. If a conference should de
cide that all countries sign a treaty
guaranteeing territorial integrity to
China, it is a question if we would be
any better off.
"Treaties have been broken before
without the signatories enforcing them
by a resort to arms. What is the use
of making an agreement with a coun
try which has no regard for treaty
promises? China is not like a country
that could maintain its own neutrality
and territorial integrity with the
moral support of the powers. If so a
treaty would be a good thing. But in
the present case, in the event of a
breach of the treaty, it Is not likely
that America would rush into war to
enforce its observar' and, therefore,
a treaty is valueless.
"Japan is now fighting to prevent the
violation of Chinese territorial integ
rity and proposes to continue to pre
vent its violation by force of arms if
necessary."
OYAMA CLAIMS VICTORY.
field Marshal Reports That He De
feated the Russians.
TOKIO, Jan. 28.âThe long inactivity
oil the Shakhe River was broken on
January 25, when General Kuropatkin
advanced a full corps from the vicinity
of Shengtsu. Field Marshal Oyama
immediately assumed the aggressive
and engagements occurred at Chen
chiehpao and Heikotutai. Oyama re
ports that he defeated the Russians at
Chenchiahpao. The engagement at
Htikoutai was progressing when the
Field Marshal reported. The official
telegram does not disclose the object
of the Russians and does not indicate
the prospects of a general engagement.
Oyama's report follows:
' The enemy on the right of the Hun
River began activity on January 25.
More than one corps advanced from
the district south of Chengtsu toward
Heikoutai and Chenchiehpao. Our
army assumed the offensive on Jan
uary 26. Our detachment repulsed a
division of the enemy at Chenchieh
pao. The Russians retired to Llutiako.
Another detachment has been engaged
with a division of Russians at Hei
kcutai since January 26." â

Steamship M. S. Dollar From San
Francisco Seized.
TOKIO, Jan. 28.âThe American steam
ship M. S. Dollar, en route to Vladi
vostok with a cargo of provisions and
forage, was seized yesterday by the
Japanese in the Pacific Ocean east of
Hakkaido Island.
VICTORIA, 8.C., Jan. 28.âThe steam
ship M. S. Dollar, formerly the Arab,
seized by the Japanese, is owned here.
At the office of the owning company it
is said she was fully insured. She took
5500 tons of hay, oats and barley from
San Francisco for Vladivostok.
A dispatch from London dated Janu
ary 25 stated that a steamship with a
black funnel encircled by two red bands
was ashore at Vladivostok and that it
was supposed to be the M. S. Dollar,
sailing from San Francisco on Decem
ber 31. It was deemed possible that she
had been run ashore purposely to avoid
capture by Japanese warships.
The M. S. Dollar was formerly the
British steamship Arab, built in 1890 at
Newcastle. England. She was subse
quently sold to the Dollar Steamship
Company of San Francisco.
The London dispatch further stated
that the M. S. Dollar had been posted
on the overdue board in that city at a
rate of 30 guineas. In San Francisco
the vessel has been posted as an over
due, with a rate of 30 per cent quoted
for reinsurance.

NEW YORK, Jan. 28.âWith tongue
cut out to its uttermost roots, Thomas
J. Maguire, a veteran theatrical man
of New York and formerly a resident
of San Francisco, can talk and sing
almost as well as any man.
This latest physiological wonder has
excited interest in the medical pro
fession throughout the world, and to
prove the almost incredible fact that
a man can talk, and talk well, without
h tongu<\ Maguire next Wednesday
will appear before the National Con
vention of Surgeons* in Albany, where
he will make a speech and even sing

Maguire was operated upon last
March for cancer of the tongtfe, due
to excessive smoking. Notwithstand
ing his age. 05 years, he survived the
operation, and is to-day as hale and
hearty as ever.
While listening to his words It is al
most impossible to believe that he has
no tongue. In answer to a question
he opened his mouth and displayed the
cavernous gap that the tongue had
formerly occupied. Not a vestige of it
remained.
"Four weeks after the operation," he
said, "1 was thinking how hard it
would be not to talk for the rest of
my life, and T said 'Dân it!' right out
like that. Then I knew I could talk.
Next morning they brought me eggs
for breakfast. I had nothing but liquids
and eggs for four weeks. I was sick
of them, and 1 said: 'Dân those eggs!
Don't bring mÂ» any more.' The doctor
almost jumped into the air when he
heard me speak."

merger of forty-three of the blggeat
telephone companies in the country In
to a $250,000,000 corporation, it was ac
knowledged that a business arrange
ment was being made with all of the
companies reported to be in the com
bine, by which it would be possible for
telephone subscribers in this city to
talk with San Francisco or any far dis
tant point either in this country or
Canada.
Notwithstanding denials, it is report
ed that the arrangement is more than
a mere workiâ agreement and that
while the combination may not nom
inally be made it will exist in fact.
All of the forty-three constituent
companies, however, will retain their
Independent titles and seemingly oper
ate as Independent companies under
separate officers.
The controlling American (Bell) Tel
ephone and Telegraph Company has, it
ia understood, obtained practically a
controlling Interest in each of the forty
three companies and Is now In a posi
tion to dominate not only the telephone
business of the United States, but prac
tically the telephone business of
Canada.
Connections are now buildine: which,
it Is expected, will make it possible
within six weeks or two months for
subscribers in this city and San Fran
cisco to converse with one another.
An officer of the New York Telephone
Company, at its offices, 15 Dey street,
said to-day that it was necessary to
construct switchboards In the main
offices In each of the companies on the
main line between here and San Fran
cisco to make the necessary connec
tions.
What it will cost to have a five min
ute talk with a person in San Fran
cisco, none of the officers of the local
company would venture to estimate.
The lines of about twenty different
companies will have to be used, and
each will get a share of the charge.
FROZEN MOUTH
REMAINS OPEN
Greorgia Woman in a Sorry
Predicament Until She Is
Relieved of Frost Bite
ATLANTA, Ga., Jan. 28 âA strange
case of freezing during the recent bliz
zard developed to-day, when physi
cians reported that Mrs. Mary Wilson's
mouth had been frozen wide open, so
that she could not close it.
Mrs. Wilson arrived here on Wednes
day night and walked to her home. She
had been riding in a warm coach. As
she walked along the streets battlins;
agalnst the cold wind her blood began
to chill. WBy the time she reached
home her body was almost fi .zen. and
her mouth was wide open and ahe was
unable to speak.
The frozen woman stumbled into the
house, frightening the occupants by
her unusual appearance. She was un
able to close her mouth or explain her
plight. Physicians were called and to
day reported that she was able to
close her mouth.
PRUSSIAN GOVERNMENT
TAKES HAND IN STRIKE
Six Commissioners Are Appointed to
Investigate the Troubles of
the Miners.
DORTMUND, Prussia, Jan. 28.âThe
Commissioners of the Ministry of the
Interior at a conference with the rep
resentatives of the striking coal min
ers to-day informed them that the
Prussian Government had appointed
six Commissioners to investigate the
strike. The Government, it was added,
had acted after consultation with the
mine owners, and the latter had signi
fied their approval. The commission
will begin its work of inquiry Monday.
The expectation is that a settlement of
the controversy will result.
ESSEN, Jan. 28.âSince the confer
ence between a committtee of seven
persons with the Government commis
sion the coal mine strikers have taken
a pessimistic view of the situation and
have abandoned hope for an early set
tlement of the strike. Commissioner
yon Velsen has returned to Berlin.
The mine pwners declare that the pro
posed revision of the mining laws in
the Interest of the operatives will have
a damaging effect on the German man
ufacturing industry, intensifying the
danger of foreign competition, and will
encourage operatives to come forward
later with greater demands.

NEW YORK. Jan. 16.âMarconi has
Signed an agreement with the Govern
ment "for the transmission of wireless
messages between the high-power sta
tions'of Cape Cod. Mass.; Poldhu, Eng
â¢l'und; Cape Breton, Canada, and Pisa,
Italy. â¢
' NEW YORK. Jan. 18 âA contract has
been signed with the White Star Line foi
the equipment of all its vessels with
Marconi "Wireless telegraph apparatus.
The' first vessel installed is the
"Oceanic." .which will sail at the end of
tui* month. By this contract the Mar
'coni a Company will have included In its
system* the entire fleet of important
'trans-Atlantic steamships carrying pas
sengers between Europe and this conti
m r.t. .
It maV be said that no vessel of any
size or consequence will be built in the
future without its Installation of Mar
coni apparatus, and the numerous shore
stations on both sides of the Atlantic
pr ovide means for the reception and dis
tribution of" messages.
The foregoing telegrams, showing the
progress of the Marconi system, have
appeared in the press of the country dur
ing the last few days.
Successful communication was main
tained for over ten hours one day of last
week between the Marconi station in San
Francisco, â  and the U. S. battleship
"Ohio,", as.sh* left the harbor on her
way oqt to sea.
The m< ssages were received up to 144
mil.es. It was the most successful test
of wireless telegraphy ever made on the
Pacific Coast and one of the most unique
tests made anywhere. Never before
have Marconigrams been received from
such a dis'tance in the heart of a big
c ity. Dots and dashes flew all day long
over the skyscrapers and oyer the hills
of Ban Francisco. At 10:40 a. m. the
"Ohio" announced that she was 20 miles
south of the lightship, 27 miles out of
the harbor. The-distance at 5:30 p. m.
was 144 miles, when a message came
saying the power was getting low. Nu
merous messages of a business and per
gonal nature were recorded on the tape.
â¢in a recent article the Electrical Re
view says:
"There is no other system than the
Marconi which regularly accepts com
murclal business for ship-to-shore trans
mission. There is no other system than
the* Marconi which can communicate
with, the large fleet of steamers which
enter and leave New York harbor. There
is no other system than the Marconi that
has evidenced its faith in wireless teleg
raphy by installing three expensive sta-'
tions for * trans-oceanic service, and no
one but. Marconi has transmitted meg- j
sages thYough space across 3000 miles of
ocean. â¢
Many of the readers of this article had
the opportunity a few Tears ago of in- 5
vesting in Bell Telephone stock, and $100 ;
invested then would have netted them to
dale a profit of over $200,000. Marconi:
steurities, taken now, offer as great an
opportunity. The investment is as safe
as a bank and. certain to pay vastly more
in dividends.
The Marconi Company is already in re
ceipt of considerable and constantly In
creasing revenues. There are already'
over 3o0 Marconi stations in commercial
operation, -earning money every day As
an illustration, during a recent trip of
the steamer "Lucania" over $800 00 in
tolls was collected. It is. therefore, safe
to estimate that each ship installation
will show a net profit of $5000 to $10 000
a year, which, multiplied by the number
of snips, will amount to several hundred
thousand dollars annually.
It iÂ» estimated that the forwarding of. 4
press news for the "Ocean Dally," pub
., eJ . h /JP boa rd the trans-Atlantic Jiners,
will giOe an annual profit to 'the com
pany of at leant $760,000, t
The Marconi Company will derive Its
largest profits from its trans-Atlantic
â er*lce. There are 14 trans-Atlantic ca
bles In the United States, handling all
the "traffic they are capable of handling
at 25 cents a word. It is not unreason
able to expect that with 14 trane-Attantio
J!**!*"}*, the profit will be over
$10,000,000. making possible a net profit
for dividends of 160 per oent on the en
tire capitalization from that bfanoh of
the business alone.
The magnitude of the t*l#raph busi
ness is best evidenced by the fact that
an average of i ono.000 telegrams are
sent every day throughout the year. This
shows that the possibilities of the wire
less telegraph are practically unlimited
The cost of Installation, maintenance
and operation of the Marconi system is
Â»o small compared with that of the cable
and wire systems that it can afford to
transmit Â» messages for LESS THAN
HALF the price of the old systems
Therefore it stands to reason that the
public always gives the preference to the
cheaper rate.

WEBER LAUGHS
IN COURTROOM
Appears to Enjoy Answers
of Talesmen Summoned to
Try Him on Murder Charge
SEVEN JURORS SECURED
Acting Under the Advice
of Counsel Youthful Priso
ner Stops Writing Notes
â -â  â*âi â¢ â 
Special Dispatch- to The
AUBURN, Jan. 28.âTwo more jurors
were secured to-day to try Adolph
Weber on the charge of murdering his
mother, Mary .Weber. James Â£. Doher
ty of Bath and Frank Ellsworth Coburn
of Bullion satisfactorily answered all
the Questions asked them and were
sworn to try the case, making seven in
all chosen so far. \
Weber did not look as well to-day
and seemed less self-possessed than on
the opening day. He laughed heartily,
however, at some of the answers given
by C. H. Francis, one of the talesmen.
Francis is a fruit grower in this vicin
ity, and in reply to a question from
Attorney General Webb regarding the
death penalty said, "I believe in a death
penalty if a man needs It."
General Webb then asked, "If you
v. ere the defendant lh this case would
you be willing to be tried by a jury of
men that feel about this case as you
do?" Francis answered, "I never tried
them. I tried yesterday to pick out
twelve men from the venire that I
would like to try me. I don't know any
of the parties in the case. Of course, if
I was being tried 1 would want men to
try me that didn't know me."
At this point Attorney Johnson took
the talesman in hand and said, "Sup
pose you were the defendant In the
case and C. H. Francis came on the
stand ânow, you know C. H. Francis
well âwould you be willing if you were
the defendant to have twelve men Just
like C. H. Francis try the case?"
Francis replied, "Well, I go a good
deal on the appearance of a man, and
would pick out a jury by appearances.
I don't know what kind of an appear
ance I create here."
This seemed to appeal to Weber as
being particularly funny, and he joined
the others in a hearty laugh.
Francis, continuing, said: "I would
want men that feel about as I feel in
the case, but if I was picking out a
jury to try me I wouldn't pick out that
kind of men. I would pick out men
that I thought I could handle and keep
them op my side."
Weber again enjoyed a hearty laugh,
which was taken up by attorneys and
others present.
The matter of selecting the remain
ing five jurors to serve on the jury will
be taken up again Monday morning.
Court adjourned to-day at 1 o'clock In
order to allow Attorney Grove L. John
son, who has charge of the defense, to
go to Sacramento. So far forty-five.
talesmen have been examined. Twenty
seven more out of the original venire
are to be examined. Anothr venire of
seventeen was issued to-day. It is ex
pected that the jury will be completed
by Tuesday night.
Since Grove L. Johnson has taken ,
charge of the case Weber has stopped
writing notes, which was his previous
wont to do.
Mrs. Snowden. the sister of the mur
dered woman, was not in court to-day,
as she is threatened with an attack of
nervous prostration. The prosecution
has served subpenas on seventy wit
nesses and the defense on twenty wit
nesses.
WILL WORK TO DEFEAT BILLâJohn E.
MeDcugald, O. V. Tveitmoe and Eugene A,
Clancy were appointed as a committee by the
Budding Trades Council to proceed to Sacra
mento and defeat the bill preventing boycotts. '
They will also urge a measure to Tbo passed by
which the State will employ laborers to repair
reads and public buildings.

"I bought a fifty-cent package of
Pyramid Pile Cure from my druggist
and have used two dollar packages
since. I find them" just as you recom
mended them to be. I have not felt
the least sign of piles since using your
remedy three months ago. If you want
to use my name you may do so, as I
feel like a new man. I now have no
trduble with the dreadful, aggravat
ed disease.
"I meant, to write you sooner, but
thought I would wait until I was
cured. I thank you for your wonderful
Pile Cure. I was a great sufferer from
r piles," Fred Deerr, R. F. D. 4, New
Brunswick, N. J.
Seldom, if ever, is there any doubt
about the. effect produced by the use
of Pyramid Pile Cure, as is shown
by the experience given above. The
proprietors qf this remedy have thous
ands of similar letters on file, and
surely no better proof of the merit of
the preparation could be asked; when
it is borne in mind that these letters
are wholly unsolicited, there is cer
tainly cause for pride In the remedy.
Pyramid Pile Cure is sold by drug
gists for fifty cents a package, and If
yours hasn't it he will get it for you
if asked to do so. Accept no sub
stitutes, and remember there is no oth
er remedy "just as good." Every one is
urged to writs Pyramid Drug Co.,
Slarshnll. Mich., for their little book
escribing the causes and cure of piles,
as it affords much useful information
and is sent free for the asking.

BROKERS TELL
ABOUT REALTY
Market Is Strong
First Month of the Year Is Lively
There has been steady improvement
in the business of the real estate brok
ers since the opening of the new year.
The principal stir is in the business
section, but there is enough doing in
all parts of the city to keep owners
and brokers interested.
More than at any time in recent
years the conditions favor the con
tinued growth of San Francisco. In a
short time the advantages of free com
petition in rates over the line of the
Panama railroad, which will open up
a competing route between the east
and south and San Francisco, will be
realized. With nine national conven
tions coming to the city this year and
a great iiiitux of people into the terri
tory north of Tehachapi, the facts
about San Francisco are in a way to be
generally known in all parts of the
United States.

the local realty market ia buoyant. All

KENTUCKY CAVE
NOW HAS RIVAL
Immense Subterranean Cav
ern Discovered by Prospec
tors in British Columbia
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REVELSTOKE, B. C, Jan. 18.âA 1
wonderful subterranean cavern, be
lieved to rival the Mammoth Cave of
Kentucky, has been discovered in the
Canadian Northwest. It is believed to
be the largest cave yet found in the
world.
This cave is situated near Revel
stoke, within two miles of the Cana
dian Pacific Railway in a country
which was thought to have been thor
oughly explored by those living In the
vicinity. It has four entrances, and
its length is two miles and its width
is nearly half a mile. It has a depth
in some places of more than 2000 feet, j
It is studded with millions of brilliant |
crystals and colored stalactites, rang
ing from colorless, pink, red ani
brown to purple, which hang from the
top and sides in clusters, resembling j
icicles. Beautiful colored coiumns
from six Inches in diameter reach
from floor to celling.
The formation is a blue 11m-* rock.
The cave was probably formed
through the action of water, for far
down in the depths of the ibyss in the
center of the cave can be heard the
rushing of waters of a mighty sub
terranean river, whose source or out
let Is yet a mystery.
There are evidences that this oave
has been inhabited by Indians of an
ancient race. Old stone weapons,
tools and bones are lying ahwiid In
odd corners, but they are far from be
ing plentiful. In one of the recesses
explored were found the mummified
bodies of two human beings, now re
sembling dried and sponge-like leath
er. The outlines of the forms are
plainly discernible.
The discovery of this cave was made
by prospectors for coal or gold and It
was then partially explored by a par
ty of Canadian engineers, who made
measurements. An exploration party
is now being formed to systematically
traverse the entire cave and gather
such information as It may.
Inquiry among the native Indians
who have lived in this vicinity for
generations reveals the fact that the
existence of this cave has been un
known to them. The location of the
cave is 120 miles north of the interna
tional boundary from the State of
Washington, west of the Selkirk range
of mountains, and it Is thought the
subterranean stream may be connect
ed with the Columbia River, which
flows past Revelstoke, two miles dis
tant from the cave.AT>VKRTT STffIVTF.TVTS.

Gridiron Club of Washing
ton Celebrates Twentieth
Anniversary With Dinner
ROOSEVELT IS PRESENT
Foibles of the Guests Are
Ridiculed, jEven the Presi
dent Being Burlesqued
WASHINGTON. Jan. 28.âThe Grld
{ iron Club celebrated lta twentieth an-
I nlversary with a dinner at the New
| Wlllard to-night, which was attended
! by 250 guests, including the President,
i members of his official family, repre
: sentatlves of the courts and the House
I and Senate and the army and navy, as
: well as men of prominence in the lit
! erary, scientific and business world,
j While the anniversary was recog
! nlzed in making Major John M. Carson
i president of the club and in the pro
duction of a souvenir which told the
: story of a score of yea/8 of successful
dining, the dinner dealt with political
events, which were treated with the
! usual levity and burlesque.
I The presence of Mr. Roosevelt af
i forded an opportunity for many polnt
\ed allusions to the doings of the ad
j ministration and views of the chief
1 magistrate. The inauguration of Major
\ Carson as president, with a Rough
; Rider accompaniment and a reference
ito the charge of the President's regi
[ ment at Santiago, was managed by a
| khaki-clothed band, which played
I "There'll Be a Hot Time ln the Old
j Town To-night."
The pending impeachment charges in
Congress were satirized by having all
j the Senators present "not under Indlct
j ment" sit in a trial of Speaker Cannon,
who was charged with eight counts,
among which were that the Speaker
j had refused to comply with the anti
i smoking ordinance; that he insisted
j that the House was a co-ordinate
; branch of the Government, to the men-
I taJ anguish of many Senators; that he
i had with concern refused the Vice
Presidency, thus thrusting upon the
| country Charles W. Fairbanks, and
j that he had been guilty of pushing in
too many chips on a bob-tailed flush
and was caught in the act. The
Speaker, notwithstanding his plea, waa
! adjudged guilty and Senator Gorman
j pronounced sentence. m
} "Frenzied Finance" was the theme of
! a pretentious skit which burlesqued
I some late events in banking, brokerage
j and railroading and introduced "Col
j onel Bill Greene," "Tom Lawson" and
"Mrs. Cassle Chadwick," who were
; portrayed by members of the club.
Among the many bright things in the
dialogue were hits on many of the
I guests about the tables.
Among the prominent guests were:
! President Roosevelt, Associate Justice
Brewer of the Supreme Court, Baron
| Mayor dcs Planches.the Italian Embas
sador; Baron yon Dem Bussche-Heid
enhausen, German Embassy; Represen
tative Bartholdt, William B. Bryan;

YOUTH MAKES TROUBLE
FOR KATE MARSDEN
Excited by Presence in New York City
of the Friend of Hawaii's
Ijfpers.
NEW YORK, Jan. 28.âOwing to the
zeal of a youth who thought he had
a civic duty to perform, there was tur
moil to-day in the manager's office of a
Broadway hotel. The agitation spread
to the police and health department*
and the Immigration Bureau on Ellis
Island.
The young man was in the foyer ol
the hotel on Friday night when h<
heard some one inquire for Miss Kate
Marsden. He recollected that in a San
Francisco paper four years before h*
had read about her going to the Sand
wich Island leper colony.
His mother, who was with him, saw
the woman later in a corridor and
asked her if she were not Miss Mars
den. On an affirmative reply being
given, the youth proceeded to stir up
things.
He first reported to Captain Cottrell,
who called tip the Board of Health and
asked for advice. The hotel official
was told that if even the fact was as
the youth feared there was no dangei
in this climate. Neither would the su
perintendent of Ellis Island give the
youth any satisfaction.
The story got about the city, and
the hotel was besieged by many anx
ious inquirers.
The woman whose presence had
given the youth such concern has for
years visited leper camps as a mission
ary and has written books on colonies
in Siberia. Se said that there was no
cause any fear for the safety of any
one who might be in the same hotel
with her. for she was in perfect health.
Miss Marsden sailed this morning
for her home in England.
A few years ago bananas were seldom
seen In English markets. To-day they
are almost as plentiful and as cheap as
in the United States.

ARE SUSPECTED
OF AIDING HOCH
I CHICAGO, Jan. 28.â1n searching for
a woman who might be interested in
, hiding Johann Hoch, the alleged "Blue
| beard," the police have secured evl
dence which leads them to believe that
' Hoch was aided in his quest for
I wealthy widows by two persons, a man
: and a woman. The officers intimate
j that Beveral arrests may soon be made.
The man in the case is an employ
ment agent and the woman is said to
: have been one of Hoch's numerous
i wives. Each has supplied the police
| with much information. There is, how
j ever, a feud between the pair and each
| accuses the other. The man declares
j that the woman has been illegally mar
i ried many times and that there are
| charges pending against her in connec
j tion with one of the marriages. In re
' turn the woman asserts that her ac
j cuaer was an accomplice of Hoch and
watched the cash windows of savings
banks in order to "spot" widows who
made deposits.
The discovery of another wife of
Hoch in the person of Mrs. A. S. Houk
of Peoria, 111., n\ay be the outcome of
a letter received by Assistant Chief of
I Police Schuettler from the woman to-
I day. Mrs. Houk asked that a picture
i and a description of Hoch be sent her.
: She said that some years ago she mar
ried a man who gave his name as
Houk, and that this man may have
been Johann Hoch.
Fearing that Hoch may have suc
ceeded in sailing for Europe, the police
to-day directed that wireless telegraph
messages be sent from New York to all
steamships that left that port within
the past three days.
The police to-night anounced that
they had received indisputable evidence
of the fact that Hoch's actual name is
Jacob Schmidt. His birthplace was
Herrweiler, Germany, close to Bingen
on-the-Rhine.

William Directs German Embassador
to Discuss Proposed Educational
Scheme With Roosevelt.
BERLIN, Jan. 28.âEmperor William
has directed the Embassador to the
United States, Baron Speck yon Stern
berg, to lay before President Roose
velt in official form the suggestion for
an exchange of professqrs between
Germany and America that the Em
peror mentioned to Embassador Tower
on New Year's day. The Embassador,
who sailed on the Kaiser Wilhelm der
Grosse January 25, carries only an out
line of the project, which the President
will be asked to approve and co-oper
ate in, making a workable plan.
The Emperor has invited several
German professors to present him with
their ideas on the subject. Professor
Adolph Harnack, one of those invited,
writes in the Preussische Jahrburcher
that the great scholars of the middle
ages were not tied fast to any one
country.

The Pianola Piano
. - â 
The First Complete Piano
An entirely new thought in musical instrumentsâ
a combination in a single, complete instrument of a
perfect piano and a Metrostyle Pianola. A piano that
may be played by hand and by means of a perforated
music roll. *
This instrument combines in a single case BOTH of the
above methods of playing the piano. The hitherto unused
space inside an upright piano has been utilized to contain the
mechanism of a Metrostyle Pianola.
The Pianola Piano is first of all A PERFECT PIANO,
being played by the fingers on the keyboard in the ordinary
way. But open a slide in the front of the case, insert a per
forated roll of music, and you may play it by means of foot
pedals and expression levers. No one who is contemplating
the purchase of either a piano or a piano-player should fail to
see this wonderful instrument. Otherwise he will find he has
purchased a piano of yesterday rather than the piano of to
morrow.
Call and see this new piano.

fHE SAM FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 29, 1905.
SCANDAL STIRS
MERCED COUNTY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MERCED, Jan. 28.âA tremendous
scandal has arisen in Merced County.
Seven public officials have been in
dicted on felony charges, and accusa
tions of bribery and corruption are
spread broadcast The superintend
ent of construction of the new County
Hospital is on trial for alleged whole
sale graft, and the Grand Jury is
openly declared to have been packed
in the interest of certain politicians.
Members of the Board of Supervisors
are in danger of going to the peniten
tiary and the District Attorney has
been committed to jail. The people of
the county are all agog over the ex
posures, and there, may be bloodshed
before the trouble is ended.
The difficulties have arisen over the
building of a county hospital. The ex
pense of construction has been so great
| and the results so incommensurate
i that charges of theft have been bruited
about for weeks. Superintendent of
â  Construction F. W. Robinson was the
j first one called upon to explain when it
was discovered that the county was
purchasing iron and stone for about
their weight in gold. Robinson was
placed under arrest to render further
explanations to a jury.
Then it was rumored that some of
the Supervisors were in on the alleged
theft. Four of them were Indicted.
The accused said that the Grand Jury
was packed for political purposes and
nine members of the inquisitorial
body were summoned as witnesses for
the prosecution. A new venire was de
manded and then the fight was on in
earnest.
Robinson was placed on trial and
District Attorney Hoar partly, it is
said, showed his hand to the defense
and was immediately placed on the
witness stand himself by the defend
ant's lawyers to show that an illegal
conspiracy had been formed between
public officials for the purpose of send
ing the indicted men to the peniten- '
tiary.
Attorney Ostrander for the defense 1
put the question openly to Hoar in
court and he refused to answer After
much argument the Distriot Attorney
was ordered to Jail for contempt-
Hoar's lawyers immediately went to
San Francisco and applied to the Su
preme Court for a writ of habeas cor- '
pus. An alternative writ was granted,
returnable Monday morning. The
court at that time will hear what rea
sons the prisoner has for thinking he
should be released. Attorney Ostran
der has also gone to San Francisco to
be present at the hearing and to at
tempt to have Hoar kept in jail until
he chooses to answer the Important
question. Meanwhile the county is on
tiptoe with expectancy.
ROUVTER CABINET SEEMS
j TO BE FIRMLY INTRENCHED
PARIS, Jan. 28.âThe Rouvier Cabinet
has begun work under favorable cir
cumstances. Its overwhelming major
ity of 893 ln the Chamber of Deputies
last night is almost without precedent
and ln marked contrast with the ma
jority of about forty on which the
Combes Cabinet has struggled along
for the last two years.
Placing the income tax debate before
the debate on the proposed separation
of church and state gives time for ani
mosities to cool. Therefore it is expect
ed Rouvier will carry out the separa
tion, to which.he has pledged the Min
istry. J

i CANNOT GET CHARTER FOR HAY.
Half of Russia's Big Order Remains
in San Francisco.
Owing to the fear of capture by!
! thÂ© Japanese the shipment of the 8000 j
; tons of hay that the Russian Oovern- j
' ment recently purchased in San Fran- ;
'â¢ Cisco has been seriously Interrupted.
AbOttt 4000 tons have been loaded for
Vladivostok, but the agents of the
Czar have been unable to get charters
for the remaining 4000 tons.
The hay was secretly purchased ln
the local market by H. H. Hart of the
Napa Valley Packing Company, which
has offices on California street. He
was employed to negotiate the deal
by direct agents of the Russian Gov
ernment. The contract for filling the
order was awarded to Scott & Man
ner at about $17 a ton, and the firm
has been compelled to ask the help of
every other dealer in the city to dou- ,
bly compress the hay and to fill the
I gigantic order.
The feed is intended for the horses
with the Russian forces and the plan
is to ship it by rail from Vladivostok, 1
entrance to which is made by means
,of the ice breakers.
The Japanese Consul is authority
' for the statement that his Government
1 will soon seek to place large orders ;
i for horses, hay and grain in the San
' Francisco market. The fall of Port
Arthur has facilitated the transporta
i tion of supplies to the army facing
Kuropatkin ln Northern Manchuria,
i and the Japanese are expected to
! make heavy purchases ln San Fran
! Cisco soon. Dealers are keenly watch
ing for the orders.

possible did it seem for the rickety
structure of hidebound bones to
breathe, much more so to display
physical strength, that the uniformed
spectator rubbed his eyes several times
before he regained confidence in their
reliability. Then he subjected the
equine phenomenon to closer inspec
tion, and when satisfied that it actually
lived and was not a cleverly con
structed and ingeniously animated j
imitation of a debilitated horse, he ar
rested its custodian, F. Magarty, for j
violation of the ordinance cherished
by the Humane Society.
Describing the horse to Police
Judge Mogan, the veracious policeman
said that never in all his days had he
witnessed its equal in all-round ram
shackleness. His attention was first
attracted to it while he was patroll
ing Montgomery street, near Sac
ramento. From the latter thorough
fare emanated a series of dull, musical
sounds, and when he peeped around
the corner he saw the horse. It tot
teringly stood close to the sidewalk.
Alongside it was a small boy. Indus
triously tapping its projecting ribs
with two short sticks, and the im
provised xylophone solo was faintly
suggestive of the popular air, "Ah
May Be Crazy, but Ah Ain't No Fule."
The soloist fled when the policeman
approached, but the horse remained
there ln all Its external hideousness.
Such ribs! They were *o many sharp
ridges partitioning deep defiles. The
legs were bowed at the knees and the
neck was so slender that the hammer
head hung low. When the awestruck
officer was pursuing his survey and
marveling how such an anatomical
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
j freak could exist, Mr. Magarty
\ emerged from a nearby store, and,
in authoritative tone shouted, "Gitap,
there:" The horse obeyed by moving
forward and l ulling the wagon to
which it was attached. Then the ar
rest of Mr. Magarty was made.
'It was the thinnest horse you ever
saw?" remarked the Judge, by way of
at knowledging receipt of the police
man's testimony.
"Well," was the answer, after a mo
ment's reflection, "I've seen thinner,
but they were wooden and used for
clothes drying."
A $10 fine for Mr. Magarty and
death for the hor-po.
In his energetic Japanese way, S.
Marimoto decided to bring to his
lodging-house the business that
seemed reluctant to go there of its
own initiative, and thus intentioned
he hied him to the Ferry station to
pick up such compatriots as might
arrive and have no sleeping place def
initely chosen. Among the human
freight brought in by a boat from
Alameda was a little brown man to
whom the city seemed to be strange,
for he stood hesitatingly and glanced
around him in semi-bewilderment.
Toward him gleefully hastened S.
Marimoto, but he was preceded by A.
Hackmeyer, a duly licensed boarding
house touter, who had the stranger
fairly ln hand when S. M. arrived.
"Come with me, oh, most honor
able child of Nippon," said S. M. in the
vernacular, "else this no-good kid
naper will conduct you to places that
are of desplsement, may be of Slavonic
sympathy."
The stranger endeavored to shake
: off his Caucasian captor, but that gen
tleman demurred and challengede S.
ISMAR.
SCARCELY a man, woman or child in this western
country that has not heard of Ismar, that strange
woman who exerts such mysterious and wonderful
powers in the disclosing of hidden secrets, solving of
mysteries, foretelling of events and in the locating and
healing of diseases. In treating diseases she positively
uses no medicines or drugs, and yet many of the cases
she cures were' long thought to be incurable.
M. to show legal authority for his
touting*. S. M. responded by tri
umphantly producing his lodging
house license and declined to believe
Mr. Hackmeyer's assertion that it
merely permitted its possessor to house
people, not to solicit their patronage.
Then began a struggle for possession
of the stranger's person, in which he
got much the worse of the injuries.
He was hauled and pulled between the
contestants until his clothing was rent
and disarranged and his arms bruised
-Â°nd dislocated. It waif Patrolman P.
Burns who finally rescued him and ar
j rested S. M. for soliciting without a
i license.
In the court of Judge Mogan the de
i fendant obdurately claimed that he
i had as much right to capture trade at
I the ferry as had Mr. Hackmeyer or
, any one else, so the case was continued
tili February 3 to enable his Honor to
re-digest the ordinance and consult au
thorities.

IS RECAPTURED
Swindler Whiteman Caught
by Detectives at Moth
er s Home in New York
ESCAPED IS SEPTEjIBER
Remarkable History of Eelon
Known tis One of the Clev
erest Rascals in Country
BUFFALOy Jan. 38.âAlonzo J. White
man, who made a sensational escape |
from detectives by jumping through j
the window of & moving train at Dun- '
kirk on September 27, was recaptured
at the home of his mother at Dansville !
to-day. He was taken sifter an exciting
chase and submitted to arrest only j
when covered by revolvers. Whiteman j
in charged with forgery and grand lax
ceny.
Whiteman la the principal of the)
Knox-Whiteman band of draft raisers, '
forgers and bank swindlers.
The particular orinie with which
Whitman la charged was committed |
last July in Buffalo, when a messenger
called at the Fidelity Trust Company
with a letter, typewritten on what pur
ported to be- the business paper of an
East Aurora, N. V., firm, and signed I
F. H. Hubbard, who appeared to be Â«SJ
member of the firm. Inclosed with the
letter was a draft for 19000 to Hub- j
bardÂ°*s order by the cashier of the Na- j
tional Hudson River Bank, Hudson, N. j
V.. OS the Leather Manufacturers' Bank!
of New York City, with which the
writer expressed the wish to open an
account. He claimed he was an in
valid, seldom left Fast Aurora and re- j
quested that a bank and check book
he sent him by the bearer of the letter. I
The Fidelity Trust Company of Buffalo, j
after allowing what it considered j
suSJclent time to elapse for the draft j
to pUss through the exchanges and not
Velng advised that it was irregular,
permitted Hubbard to check against j
. tho account to the extent of $3850 by j
the issuing bank. The Trust Company
was subsequently advised that the
draft for $9000 accepted by them from
Hubbard was originally issued for $9,
frvjm which amount it was raised.
Whiteman was the prime mover ln
â¢ all .the bank swindles committed by
this band, by which it obtained more
than $30,000. The drafts were pur
chased from country banks for small
amounts and raised to large ones.
Altogether Whiteman has been ar-
Tufted on charges of felony twenty
three times. Indicted seventeen times,
tried four times and sentenced to an
agHregate Of sixteen years' imprison
ment; has laid in Jail three years
awaiting trials or appeals. He has
served only one year's actual sentence.
He originally came from Dansville, X.
T- where his father was at one time
a prominent banker and lumberman.
Is his younger days he attended the
Hamilton College, near Utica, N. V.,
from which he graduated with high
honors and took up the legal profes
sion. Leaving DansvUle, he migrated
to Minnesota, became Mayor of Duluth,
a member of the State Senate of Mmâ¢
-â¢ nesot a, president of two banks in
Duluth, the owner of two dally news
papers published in tbat city arid at
one time the backer of'Courtney, the
oarsman; He spent an inheritance of
tiree- quarters of a million and sacri-
ficed his position of honor and dis
tinction to become a forger, swindler
and all-round rascaL He Is one of the
moet remarkable criminals in this
country, and because of his suave man
ners and intimate knowledge of the
rrfminal law has many times defeat
ed tbe ends of Justice.
The recapture of Whiteman and tha
breaking up of this band of draft rais
ers, forgers and bank swindlers re
flects great credit on the protective
committee of the American Bankers*
Association, for which this work was
undertaken by the Pinkertons.

OBJECTS TO DEIiAY IN
STREET IMPROVEMENT*
Mission Federation Asks Supervisors
to Have the Works Board
Show More Activity.
The Federation of Mission Clubs
filed a communication with the Super
visors yesterday calling attention to
the delay of the Board of Works in
expending the of
$430,000 for street improvements and
asking that it be requested to show
more activity in forwarding the im
provements. The letter says:
"The paving of Mission road, for
which $80,000 is available, has been
hanging fire because of an ef
fort of the Board of Works to
change the specifications and substi
tute bitumen for the asphalt pavement
ordered by your honorable body. This
work is of utmost necessity, as the road
south of Onandago avenue to the
county line is Impassable and a dis
grace to our city.
"Among the other improvements
that are being delayed by the dilatory
policy of the Board of Works is the
construction of a salt water system on
Twin Peaks for protection against fire,

I STUDENTS OF UNIVERSITY
OF NEVADA ARE AROUSED
Protest Against Order Compelling
Them to Wear Uniform, and Also
Against Proposed Legislation.
RENO, Nev., Jan. 28.âThe Regents of
the University of Nevada have issued
an order that all students in the college
must wear their uniforms on all occa
sions and notified the cadets yesterday
that they were also arranging to have
a law passed requiring cadets over 18
years of age to enlist in the National
Guard of the State. The regents claim
that in this way the students would be
able to purchase their uniforms at a
cheap rate.
The students have declared that they
will not join the National Guard and
are vigorously opposing the measure
which will compel them to wear mili
tary clothes at all times. A rebellion
is threatened and if tne order is en
forced the students may leave the col
lege in a body.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSON, Ariz., Jan. 28.âSeveral roy- |
ing bands of Yaqui Indians making a
rendezvous in the Mazatlan Mountains
have joined forces to resist the Mexican
force sent out against them. Near San
Jose de Pimas, east of Minas Prletas
and a short distance from Cobachi, the
savages attacked a wagon train belong
ing to Rafael Pesquira, securing a large
supply of provisions and ammunition.
The teamsters were stripped naked and
left tied to trees.
General Torres, who was at Mlnas
Prletas with upwards of 400 men, set
out In pursuit of the band when the
alarm was given. He was joined Fri
day by Governor Ysabel and 100 mount
ed rurales. They have established a
base at Represo de Verde in anticipa
tion of a hot campaign, as the Indians
are now said to number 800. Torres
divided his force into two detachments
of cavalry, commanded by Captain Luis
Barren and Governor Ysabel. General
Peinado and Colonel Corona, both ex
perienced Indian fighters, have com
mand of the Infantry detachments. An
armed guard has been stationed at
every ranch for many miles around and
at the smaller towns, and travelers do
not venture on the highroad without
an escort. Cutting off every avenue of
escape, the forces commanded by Tor
res hemmed ln the Indian band, and
according to advices from Pietas a run
ner reached that camp with the report
that Torres had completely surrounded
the Yaquis near the famous Uvalama
Canyon, where they were caught In a
death trap several years ago. Reports
of a decisive engagement are expected
hourly at Mlnas Prletas.

HANGS HERSELF
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE. Wash.. Jan. 28.âWhen
Edward Rusk returned to Coeur d'Alene
City, Idaho, from a few hours' business
trip to Spokane this evening he found
no wife to greet him at the door. Pass
ing into the kitchen he discovered the
body of his bride of two weeks hanging
at the end of a short rope. She had
been dead several hours.
Not much is known about the Rusks
in Coeur d'Alene. It is said the young
couple were married at Wallace. Idaho,
January. 10, and that both formerly
lived at Coulee City, Wash. They j
rented a cottage at Coeur d'Alene,
which they fitted in luxurious style, '
and appeared to be a most devoted I
couple. Their devotion to each other l
was so marked as to cause comment.
Rusk arose about 5 o'clock this morn
ing and took the first electric car to
Spokane, and on returning this evening
he found his wife dead. She had taken
a short piece of clothesline, made an
ordinary knot in one end and a common
slip knot in the other. She had hung
the small knot over a nail in the kitch
en door jamb, stood on a chair, placed
the noose about her neck and then
kicked the chair away and strangled to ;
death. She was about 26 years old and
her husband is about the same age.
He is nearly distracted with grief and
can assign no cause for his wife's self
destruction.

With Congress' Permission.
HONOLULU, Jan. 10.âWhen Prince
Fushlnit of Japan passed through '
Honolulu on his way to the United
States he was received with fitting
ceremony by Governor Carter and Sec- |
retary Atkinson, and recently on the
returning of the Prince he left presents
for the Governor, the Secretary and all
others who had been charged his
entertainment. The Governor's present
consisted of a massive silver punch- '
bowl, which has been much admired, i
As Secretary- Atkinson is away in i
Washington, his present has not yet
been opened.
I* now transpires that in accepting a I
gift from the Prince the Governor vlo- 1
lated the constitution of the United
States, which expressly forbids the re- ;
ceiving of such presents. Just what
the Governor is going to do remains to
be seen, but it is expected that he will
ask permission of Congress to accept i
the gift.

Weekly Call, $1 per YearVI hat Sulphur Docs
lor the Human Body la Health and
Disease.
The mentioa of sulphur will recall to
many of us the early days when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us our
daily dose of sulphur and molasses
every spring and fall.
It was the universal spring and 'fall
"blood puritier," tonic and cure-all, and
;nind you. this old-fashioned remedy
was not without merit.
The idea was good, but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con
centrated form, so that a single grain
is far more effective than a tablespoon
ful of the crude sulphur.
in recent yejws, research and experi
ment have proven that the best sulphur
tor medicinal use is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold in
drug stores under the name of Stuart's
Calcium Wafers. They are small cho
colate coated pellets and contain the
active medicinal principle of sulphur in
a highly concentrated, effective form
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health;
sulphur acts directly on the liver, and
excretory organs and purifies and en
riches the biood by the prompt elimina
tion of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo
lasses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary flow
ere of sulphur were often worse than
the disease, and cannot compare with
the modern co-ncentrated preparations
ot sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
Wafers is undoubtedly the best and
most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for liv
er and kidney troubles and cure consti
pation and purify the blood in a way
that often surprises patient and physi
cian alike.
Dr. R. M. Wilkins while experiment
ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles, i
â¢specially when resulting from consti
pation or malaria, I have been sur
prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from bolls and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have le
peatedly seen them dry up and disap
pear in four or five days, leaving the
skin clear and smooth. Although Stu
art's Calcium Wafers is a proprietary \
article, and sold by druggists, and for !
that reason tabooed by many physi
clans, yet I know of nothing so sate i
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially in all !
forms of skin disease as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of !
pills, cathartics and so-called blood i
"purifiers," will find ln Stuart's Cal
cium Wafers, a far safer, more pala
table and effective preparation.

Begin Search for the Bill!
That Gives Western Pacific
lioad a Terminal Here
VIOLENT SPECULATING
Incline to the Belief That
Harbor Board 3leasure May
Be in Interest of Company
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 28.âThe an
nouncement from Chicago that con
struction on the Western Pacific road
Will begin within two months and that
the company has secured rights of way
through California and a terminal in j
San Francisco "without fear of inter- |
ferenee" has set a majority of the leg- j
islators speculating violently. They are
conscious of the fact that the Board
of Harbor Commissioners of San Fran
cisco must first be'authorized to lease
a terminal before it can legally grant
the Western Pacific the right it seeks.
With uampened thumbs the solons
are skurrying through the leaves of
their bill riles, searching for some pos
sible measure introduced, perhaps in j
disguise, that would grant the San
Francisco terminal to the Western Pa
cific when put in force. The statement ;
of the Western Pacific managers, how- j
ever, that they will come into the open
and demand the rights they seek, ap
pealing to the people for the exercise of
moral force if need be, does not lend
color to the theory that the corporation
ia proceeding under cover.
This leaves but one line of argument
and that is that a bill recently Intro
duced by Assemblyman Treadwell em
powering the Board of Harbor Com- 1
missioners of San Francisco to lease I
certain described water front blocks is
the much sought measure, though the
Western Pacific is not named in the
bill.
When asked regarding the bill Tread
well said that he did not think it had
anything to do with the granting of a
terminal to the Western Pacific. The
bill, he said, was handed him by the
attorney of the San Francisco Harbor
Commission, who informed him that it
was simply in line with other measures
that had been adopted, giving the com
mission the right to lease unused
blocks, and that no specific object was
in view or dependent upon the passage
of the billâin other words, that it was
simply a "red tape" measure empow
ering the board to fulfill functions in
no wise extraordinary. The bill is now
in committee, however, and it is prob
able that its purpose will be more fully
explained before it is reported back to
the House.
TRYING TO LOCATE BILL.
Shortly after the , Legislature con
vened Harbor Commissioner Spear ar
rived here one morning, and within half
an hour after his arrival the word went
out that he had come to secure the
Governor's views on the question of a
terminal for the Western Pacific,
Spear, however, said that he was tak
ing no interest in any measure either
for or against the Western Pacific;
that he would take no action whatever
regarding the terminal until such time
as the company appeared before the
board of which he was a member and
made known its wants.
The fact stands, nevertheless, that
the Chicago office of the road an
nounces that it has procured right to a
terminal in San Francisco "without
fear of interference." It is quite prob
able that it knows whereof it speaks,
and the question that now remains is
for the Legislature to locate the bill
that is going to empower It to enter
San Francisco with its lines.
The Merchants' Association of San
Francisco has sent a letter to every
Assemblyman asking him to support
Beardslee'B bill providing that the
property of the wife shall be liable for
all debts for the necessaries of life con
/ tracted by the husband. The bill was
beaten on its third reading Tuesday,
' but notice of reconsideration was given.
Assemblyman Beardslee at once se
cured promise of enough votes for its
passage upon suggesting certain

by transferring his property to his

There is to be a fight over the final
passage of a bill before the Assembly
providing that 60 per cent of all money
apportioned counties by the State for
school purposes shall be expended for
teachers' salaries. When It was called
up for second reading Chandler opposed
It, saying he did not believe ln fixing
an arbitrary rate, as extraordinary cir
cumstances might arise at some time
in some district that would work a
harm under such a law. The bill was
withdrawn temporarily. It was framed
to prevent trustees underpaying teach
ers and hoarding up money that should
go to them to build schoolhouses with.
The bill appropriating 5250.000 for an
agricultural college will be reported on
by the Ways and Means Committee of
the Assembly at the same time as that
carrying an appropriation for $250,000
for a university farm. At present there
are two bills providing for the farm.
The object ln Introducing both of these
was that the Committees on Agricul
ture and Education might consider
them at the same time and expedite the
course of the one to be pressed. One
of them will be withdrawn after they
reach the Ways and Means Committee.
A bill introduced ln the Assembly by
Treadwell establishes the position of
official appraiser of estates of deceased
persons in the various counties and
provides for the appointment of such
appraisers by the Superior benches.
Treadwell's bill provides that the com
pensation of all appraisers created by
It shall" be $5 a day.

OB OF COACH
OPEN TO ALL
During the next four years the Uni
versity of California and Stanford Uni
versity may hire professional coaches
or amateur coaches or any kind of
coaches they see At. This decision was
reached last night, after a long confer- ;
ence between the members of the Inter- I
collegiate rules committee, consisting!
of Everett Brown, L. J. Bishop and
Ezra Decoto of California, and Charles
M. Fickert, J. J. Barrett and John T.
Nourse of Stanford.
The question of coaches has been an
Important factor for the rules commit
tee to decide for a long time, and the
verdict will be received in the usual
manner âwith Joy by some and sorrow \
by others. The Stanford men fought
the measure to a standstill and favored
the old system, limiting the selecting I
of coaches to the alumni of the two col
leges. The blue and gold representa
tives wanted an open system, and af
ter a long and a tedious discussion the
latter system was adopted. It is only
a recommendation, however, as the
question will be brought up before both
colleges. It is a foregone conclusion
that its adoption Is assured.
Another important ruling was made
regarding the varsity ball players. The
committee decided the ball players from
each college may hereafter engage in
contests with professionals and others
where admission fee Is charged pro
viding they receive the sanction of the
university authorities. This lets down
the barrier to a certain extent and
gives the college ball tosser much more
leeway than he has enjoyed in the past.
It does not make for that strict ama
teurism for which the universities are
supposed to stand.
After a stubborn contest the commit
tee decided to eliminate intercolleiate
freshman baseball, although Stanford
has already made arrangements to put
a team ln the field. Intercollegiate
freshman track meets will be in order
ln the next four years. This was
adopted as a substitute for the fresh
man baseball. This was also fought
against bitterly by some of the com
mittee, who seemed strongly opposed to
freshman sports in general.
The big football game this year will
be held on the Stanford campus on the
second Saturday in November, while
the freshman game will take place on
the Berkeley campus at a date to be
named later. The two colleges will al
ternate each year. The field day this
year will take place at Berkeley and

alternations will occur regularly there
after.
The varsity, baseball games are to be
played on the first and second Satur
days ln April. In case of a tie the final
game will take place on the fourth Sat
urday. The tennis match is to be de
cided on the morning of the third Sun
day in April, while the annual regatta
will take place on the first Saturday in
May, or the date may be changed later.
No student shall compete in any in
tercollegiate event after being in col
lege for four years. Should he remain
out of athletics or stay away from
college for one year of that time it will
be deducted and will not count against
him.
Both Litigants Lose.
F. A. de Lucca .brought suit against
W. M. Price, Justice of the Peace of
San Diego, to see if the latter had
any legal right to Issue a search war
rant. There was rto claim for dam
ages, as the warrant had not been
used, but the contestants simply
sought information. The Supreme
Court refuses to delve into its tomes
to satisfy the curiosity of the San Die
gans and dismisses the case. The lit
igants both lose. To see who will pay
the costs they will have to go over
the line into Mexico and fight it out.

McCOMB'S MIND
Son of the Ex-W r arden of
state Prisons in Custody
Pending His Examination
MAKES WRECK OF HOME
Living With His Aged Moth
er His Malady Eeturns and
Brother Reports the Case
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 28.
The cloud that came over the mind
of John McComb, son of the late Gen
eral John McComb, at one time Warden
of Folsom and later of San Quentin
prison, and caused his confinement for
a time in the Ukiah Insane Asylum
about five years ago, has returned. This
afternoon he was taken into custody
and is now detained in the insane ward
of the Receiving Hospital here pending
his examination. He has been living
with his aged mother, now 82 years of
age, at 2445 Derby street, Berkeley.
General McComb, the father, was one
of the most famous Wardens. For the
last few years Mrs. McComb, his
widow, has been living quietly in
Berkeley. One of her sons, George, is
a Justice Court clerk in San Francisco,
and it was he who to-day swore to the
complaint on which his brother was
taken into custody. It is stated that
John has been drinking some of late,
and this morning he made a wreck of
the house, breaking the furniture, and
pnded by trying to set his clothes on
fire.
A3 soon as the papers could be made
out Deputy Sheriff Fred Murdock was
sent out to the house and took the un
fortunate man into custody. He will be
examined Monday. He is 45 years of
age.
FIRST POSTMISTRESS
OF ALAMEDA DIES
Miss Matilda A. Morris Will Be Oar-
ried to Grave by Her Four
Nephews.
ALAMEDA. Jan. 28. âMiss Matilda
Ann Morris, first postmistress of Ala*
meda. sister of Rev. George Morrisi
and aunt of former Justice of the
Peace Henry T. Morris and George T.
Morris, passed away to-day at th*
home of her brother, 631 Railroad
avenue. Her funeral will be held on
Monday afternoon, the seventy-eighth
anniversary of her birth, and her body
will be borne to its resting place in
Evergreen Cemetery by four nephews
of the deceased. Burial services will
be conducted by her brother.
Miss Morris was born in England
and came to the Pacific Coast in 1870.
With the Rev. George Morris, she was
prominent in the organization of the
First Congregational Church of this
city more than a quarter of a century
ago. Miss Morris was a woman of
intellectual attainments and was
widely known among the early resi
dents of Alameda. She spent several
years in Southern California with a
niece, returning to this city four
months ago. Her health has since
failed rapidly and death was due to a
complication of ailments.
BOXING BOUTS TO BE HELD
AT THE RELIANCE CLUB
OAKLAND, Jan. 28. âThe directors
of the Reliance Athletic Club have de
cided to give boxing exhibitions at the
club, but these contests will be be
tween recognized amateurs and will be
the regular four-round events sanc
tioned by amateur rules. Admission to
the contests will be granted only to
members of the club and to represen
tatives of the press. Under the present
city ordinance governing boxing con
tests the Reliance Club will not have
to obtain a permit to hold these shows
and the resumption of boxing will no
doubt largely increase the club mem
bership. The first contests will be held
about the end of February or early in
March.
The Board of Police and Fire Com
missioners granted a permit yesterday
afternoon to the West Oakland Ath

contest on Friday evening. Febru

MECHANICS ARE AFTER
PAY FOR THEIR LABOR
OAKLAND. Jan. 28.âWhether a
trust deed takes priority over a me
chanic's Hen is a matter interesting a
number of persons who are parties to
a suit brought by the Humboldt Lum
ber Company, Hugh Hogan, et al.,
against the Phoenix Building and
Loan Association to recover 8995 for
material and labor furnished In the
erection of two houses on Harmon
street near Telegraph avenue.
The houses were erected by L. E.
Campbell, who got the lots from
Woodward, Watson & Co. and then
gave a trust deed to the Phoenix
Building and Loan Association for a
sufficient sum to erect the houses. The
sum was not sufficient to satisfy the
claim and the loan association under
their deed sold the property and says
that it is not responsible for the debts.
More Trouble for Fred Cox.
OAKLAND, Jan. 28.âFred Cox,
who is held by the police here on a

Muskogee, O. T., for defrauding N.
Miesch Jr. out of merchandise by
means of bogus checks. Cox claims to
own valuable property In Oklahoma
and it is reported that he does own
considerable real estate, but that it
is tied up ln litigation. The young
man will be turned over to a United
States Marshal to be taken back for

FACES DANGER
TO SAVE LIFE
Bravery of Sanitary Inspec
tor Edward J. Smith Pre
vents a Fatal Accident
PLUMBER FACES DEATH
John Gelder Owes His Escape
to the Prompt Action of
Popular Oakland Athlete
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 28.
Hanging helpless from the eaves of
a house from the roof of which he
had slipped while at Work, John Gel
der, a plumber, who lives at 1511
Fairview street, Berkeley, was saved
from serious injury or death yester
day by Deputy Sanitary Inspector E.
J. Smith. At the risk of his own life
Smith crept along the slippery roof
until he could reach the imperiled
I plumber and, catching him by the
collar, dragged him to a place of safe
ty.
The accident happened at a house
in course of construction on Thirty
second street, near San Pablo avenue.
Gelder had finished the plumbing on
j the building, which was ready for mi
i spection and on the arrival of Smith
went to the roof to turn the water
Into the pipes. The roof was wet and
very steep. The plumber lost his hold
and a moment later shot down the
steep incline and over the edge. He
caught the gutter and managed to
save himself from a fall.
Smith, who was on the roof at the
time, saw that Gelder was helpless.
He at once slid down to the edge,
making his way along the gutter to
where he could reach Gelder. A mo
ment later he had grasped the plumb
er and as the latter's hold relaxed for
an instant it seemed as if Smith would
be dragged over the edge, but he held
on and swung Gelder up beside him.
"Eddie" Smith, as he is best known,
is one of the most popular athletes in
Oakland. He is the instructor of box
ing at the Reliance Athletic Club.

VETERAN ARCHITECT
DIES AT SANTA BARBARA
P. J. Barber, one of the pioneer
architects of the coast and formerly
Mayor and postmaster at Santa Bar
bara, died from heart disease yester
day morning at his home in that city.
Mr. Barber came to California in
1852 and for some years lived in San
Francisco, where many of the best
early buildings were planned by him.
It Is recalled that he built the first
bay-window house in the city. The
Nevada Bank block was one of his
more important buildings. In 1868
he went to Santa Barbara, where the
Arlington Hotel and many other struc
tures were of his design. He was twice
elected Mayor of that city and served
for some years as it postmaster.
Mr. Barber was an active Repub
lican and a prominent Odd Fellow.
Four children survive himâMrs. Wal
ter J. Andrews and Mrs. R. M. Wood
of San Francisco and Mrs. H. A.
Rogers and Samuel Barber of Santa
Barbara.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 29, 1905.
STRUGGLE FOR SUPREMACY
IN POLITICAL ARENA.
Oakland Republicans Active,
Other Parties Dormant.
Divided Over Choice for Mayor
OAKLAND, Jan- 88.âThe general
-primaries for the city of Oakland will
be held on Tuesday next, and to-night
all is activity among the different fac
tions. The only actual headquarters
that have been opened are those of
Frank K. Mott, in rooms 28 and 29 of
the Canning block, at the corner of
Broadway and Thirteenth street The
other candidates for Mayor have been
satisfied to conduct their campaign
from their homes and offices.
It is a peculiar fact that the great
struggle is for the Republican nomina
j tion for the different offices. The Dem
ocrats have not made the slightest
move and there is no indication that
they will put a ticket in the field. The
Union Labor party has been silent,
other than to apply for a place on the
ticket The Municipal League seems to
have no fights on its hands. The fight
centers on the Republican party ticket.
The different tickets have been gen
erally announced and the situation is
now known as far as the different
ward contests are concerned. An anal
ysis by wards shows that there are five
avowed candidates for the Republican
nomination for Mayor: Frank K. Mott,
George K. Randolph, R. H. Chamber
lain, D. C. Brown and George F. Neece.
In the First Ward Frank K. Mott
has made a combination with Alexan
der McAdam, who desires to succeed
himself as Councilman. D. C. Brown
will probably put a ticket in this ward
for himself for Mayor.
In the Second Ward Mott has made a
combination with A. H. Elliott, who
wants to succeed himself as Council
man, and it is understood that Brown
will put a ticket in the field in opposi
tion.
The Third Ward will have a fight on
its hands, though it was expected that
George Fitzgerald would be permitted
to take this delegation into the conven
tion in the interests of himself for
Councilman and George E. Randolph
for Mayor. Frank K. Mott has put a
ticket in this ward and will make a
fight for the delegation for himself, but
not opposing Fitzgerald's ambition to
again be a Councilman.
The Fourth Ward is one of the storm
centers of Oakland. One ticket is is
sued by Frank K. Mott for Mayor and
will stand for the ward candidates of
Edwin Meese for Councilman-at-large,
C. H. Redington for School Dlrector-at
large and Daniel Robertson for School
Director from the ward. The other
ticket will be for the same ward offi
cers, but will be for Randolph for
Mayor.
The same general condition exists in
the Fifth Ward, where both tickets are
for Felton Taylor for Treasurer, B. H.
Pendleton for Councilman, John D.
Isaacs for School Director and HL P.
Carleton for Library Trustee. One
ticket, however, is avowedly for Frank
K. Mott for Mayor and the other is for
Randolph.
In the Sixth Ward is one of the most
bitter fights in Oakland. M. F. Kelly
has put a ticket in the field which he
declares for Frank K. Mott for Mayor
and Victor Chloupek for Councilman.
The other ticket is for W. J. Baccus for
Councilman and is backed by Dan
Moody and Frank Barnett and will
probably support Randolph for Mayor.
The Seventh Ward presents slightly
different conditions from any other
ward in the town. There will be one
ticket that will be for Randolph for
Mayor, and another for R H. Cham
berlain, the Chamberlain ticket being
headed by John Yule. In a statement
Issued to-night Mr. Chamberlain says
that this ticket is absolutely for him
and not for Mott. It can be said, how
ever, that should Chamberlain retire
from the fight that it is practically cer
tain that most of his strength would
go to Mott and that the Mott men in
the Seventh Ward will generally sup
port the Chamberlain ticket *
The exact situation in Oakland poli
tics is that the fight is not half as much
between the various candidates for
Mayor as it is between factions In the
Republican party. It is practically the
old fight between John Mitchell ana>
George E. Randolph for Supervisor,
when Guy C. Earl, Regent of the Uni
versity; Charles E. Snook, attorney for
the Regents; Charles E. Spear, presi
dent of the State Board of Harbor Com
missioners, and others who are sup
posed to have the ear of the adminis
tration at Sacramento, lined up against
J. Cal Ewlng, secretary of the Bank
Commission; J. P. Cook, County Clerk,
and others for the control of the party.
EXPERTS MAKE TESTS
OF POWER OF SALT
Results of Researches at the Univer
sity's Physiological Laboratory
Are Related.
BERKELEY, Jan. 28. âExperi-
ments made in the physiological
laboratory under the general super
vision of Dr. Jacques Loeb are de*
scribed In a bulletin from John B.
MacCallum Just Issued by the uni
versity press. The experiments were
made to test the action on the intes
tine of solutions containing two salts
and the action of purgatives on a
crustacean.
A rabbit was used as the subject of
the first experiment. Portions of its
organs were removed and operated
upon in the laboratory.
In experiments already made the
university scientists had demonstrated
that salts produce remarkable results
ln peristaltic activity and in secretion
when applied to intestines, when in
jected subcutaneously or intravenously
or directly applied to the peritoneal
surfaces of the intestine.
The later experiments dealt with
the differences in the behavior of
loops of the intestine which retain
their normal connection in the body
and loops which have been removed
from the body, when subjected to the
action of the same solution.

cial Figures for December
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28.âAn Im
mense, almost startling, increase ln im
migration is shown by the figures for
the month of December which have
been compiled by Commissioner of Im
migration Sargent. The increase in the
number of immigrants from both Rus

SCOTTISH BOWLERS RESUME
PLAY AT GOLDEN GATE PARK
For the first time in several weeks
the bowling green at Golden Gate
Park was dry enough to play on and
a few good practice games were
played by the Scottish bowlers. The
closest match was that between Rob
ert Park and G. W. Elder and the
Rev. Mr. Logan and M. L. Crowe. The
latter won by a score of 21 to 17.
Joseph Black and Dr. Gunn won
rather easily from Thomas McNaught
and James Toman. The score was 21
to 14. J. C. Moffatt and John T. Dare
were in fine form when they beat A.
Foreman and H. L. Tickner, 21 to 12.
G. W. Patterson and John Duncan
proved no match for James Gray and
John McLachlan. The latter did some
clever bowling and won by a score of
21 to 8.
SANTA CLARA NINE WINS.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 28.
âThe Stanford baseball team played Its
first preliminary game of the season
to-day at Santa Clara. Although de
feated by the score of 5 to 0, the con
test gave Coach Cowden an excellent
opportunity to size up the new baseball
material. Sixteen men played for Stan
ford, five of whom were pitchers. One
scratch hit, that by Stott, was all these
men could find in Walters, Santa
Clara's twirler. The fielding of the car
dinal team was of high order, the fea
ture being a fast double play ln the
second inning. Santa Clara fielded per
fectly and hit well. Walters, who oc
cupied the box for the Catholic colle
gians, had perfect control and plenty of
speed, striking out fifteen of the cardi
nal batsmen.
Stanford used four untried pitchers
before the veteran Sales was called on.
Of these, Rook, from Case School, In
diana, showed good form, allowing one
run in two Innings. Menardi, a Los
Angeles high school lad, gave one hit
and no runs during his two-inning re
lay. Thiele, a freshman from Illinois,
was not so fortunate, allowing four
runs on four hits in the fifth. Coach
Cowden then sent in Johnson, a tosser
from the Multnomah Club of Portland.
He kept the Santa Clara sluggers
guessing during the sixth and seventh.
Sales, who followed, was up to form,
displaying all his speed and the perfect
control of his underhand shoots. He
allowed neither hits nor runs. '
The game showed that Stanford will
have a fast fielding: team again this
season, but the customary weakness In
batting is still present. To improve his
stickers Coach Cowden will give them
daily batting practice from now until
the end of the season. It is also evi
dent that the cardinal has as yet but
one first-class pitcher, Sales, but any
of the freshmen tried to-day may de
velop into varsity form as the season
progresses. The line-up of the teams
and the score by innings Is as follows:
StanfordâPitchers, Rook, Menardi,
Thlele, Johnson, Sales; catchers, Stott,
Daily; first base, Colbert; second base,
Lewis, Presley, Luce; third base. Pen
ton; shortstop, Trowbridge; left field,
Chalmers; center field, Cadwalader;
right field, Dudley.
Santa Clara â Pitcher, Walters;
catcher, Collins; first base, Feeney;
second base, Russell; third base,
Byrnes; shortstop, Dreggan; left field,
Slgwart; center field, Durfee; right
field, Feme.

Preparations by Chairman of
Central Body to Put in
Field Conflicting Tickets
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 28.
The action of the Republican City
Central Committee in deciding that del
egates to the coming city convention
shall be selected by the committee has
provoked action by rival political lead
ers, who now announce that ln several
wards the committee's sets of delegates
will be opposed by men chosen by pre
cinct or ward clubs.
Chairman C. E. Thomas of the City
Central Committee, who favored the
choosing of delegates by clubs instead
of by the committee, is furthering the
project to contest the committee's
men. At a meeting of the Republican
club in the Tenth Precinct of the Third
Ward Thursday night Thomas dis
cussed the matter, urging all to take
an active Interest in politics and set
ting forth their rights to a voice in
party councils. W. J. Phillips was
chairman of the meeting. It is proposed
to organize such a club in each precinct
and caucus for delegates to be voted
on at the primaries next month ln op
position to the-central committee's del-
egates.
The Ashby Republican Club is plan
ning to do the same. Trustee Redmond
C. Staats, who expects to be a candi
date for Town Attorney, says that the
Republican club of South Berkeley
probably will take similar action. Con
tests are not looked for in the First,
Second, Sixth and Seventh wards,
where candidates for offices are not ln
evidence.

This offer Itself should convince you
that Liquozone does as we claim. We
would certainly not buy a bottle and
give it to you if there was any doubt
of results. You want those results;
you want to be well and to keep well.
And you can't do thatânobody can

SOCIETY AGAIN
WELCOMED AT
ARBOR VILLA
BY ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE.
OAKLAND, Jan. 28.âSince the re
turn of the F. M. Smiths to Arbor
Villa after their long stay in New
York, their beautiful home ln East
Oakland is again the center of the
merry throng of young people who de
light to congregate there, for Miss
Marlon Smith, the only daughter, is
very popular, and is, besides, always
planning some pleasant affair for the
of her friends.
Last night the "vaudeville dance,"
planned by Miss Smith as a compli
ment to three young brides-elect and
their fiancesâMiss Crellin and Roger
Friend, Miss Bishop and Dr. Alderson
and Miss Gasklll and Roy McC'abe â
was enjoyed by fifty or more society
maids and men.
The whole affair was quite informal,
and took place in the ballroom at Ar
bor Villa. The early part of the even
ing was devoted to a programme par
ticipated in by Lowell Redfleld, Miss
Smith and the sextet of girls that is
rapidly winning laurels for itself, con
sisting of Miss Carolyn Oliver. Miss
Anita Oliver, Miss Crlssie Taft, Miss
Cordelia Bishop, Miss May Coogan and
Miss Smith.
The young hostess, who haa a very
sweet soprano, sang "Springtime" and
"Beams From Yonder Star," the lat
ter an encore.
The programme closed with that
clever little sketch, "A West Point
Regulation," ln which Miss Georgia
Cope played the leading part, assisted
by Rosslter Mikel and Rupert Smith.
The remainder of the evening was
given over to dancing, and the guests
all declare they had a "perfectly love
ly time."
Miss Smith received her guests in
a very handsome white lace gown, and
among those who were present were:
Miss Anne McElrath. Miss Edith Selby,
Miss Coralie Selby, Miss Mollle Mathes,
Miss Marie Hopps, Miss Ndelle de
Golia, Miss Marietta Havens, Miss
Helen Chase, Miss Edith Gasklll, Miss
Jane Crellin, Miss Ethel Crellln, Miss
Jean Clift, Miss Gertrude Gould, Miss
Jessie Craig, Miss Bessie Fillmore, Miss
Bessie Sinclair, Miss Anita Oliver, Miss
Carolyn Oliver, Miss Katherine Brown,
Miss Cordelia Bishop. Miss May
Coogan, Miss Lucretia Burnham, Miss
Edith Beck. Miss Claire Chabot and
Miss Pauline Fore.
Next Tuesday Mrs. F. M. Smith will
entertain the cottage trustees at dinner
âa pleasant annual custom that she
follows religiously. The dinner is al
ways a very elaborate affair.
A dinner is being planned by Miss
Anita Oliver for next Monday evening
which will be ln the nature of a com
pliment to Miss Marie Hopps, Miss de
Golla's guest, and as a farewell to Miss
Carolyn Oliver, who leaves next
Wednesday for New York. Miss Oliver
will be greatly missed during the ex
tended visit she contemplates, for no
society girl ln Oakland has more real,
sincere admirers. It is to be hoped that
no gallant young New Yorker will suc
ceed In stealing her heart while away,
for the Eastern metropolis is a long
cry from Oakland, and too many of our
popular maids have already desert
ed us.
Miss Ada Brydges celebrated her
eighteenth birthday this evening, and
that important event was made thor
oughly enjoyable by the young lady's
mother, Mrs. V. M. Green, and a score
or more friends. The residence was
elaborately decorated and the late sup
per was also quite an elaborate affair.
A musical programme, in wheih Miss
Brydges, Frank King, Martin Kettles
and others participated, was enjoyed
during the evening. The young guest
of honor received several very hand
some presents, among them being a
locket set with diamonds that had been
willed to Miss Brydges by her aunt, the
late Kate Castleton, to be given to her
on her eighteenth birthday. Miss
Brydges seems to have inherited much
of her relative's talent, for she is a
pianist as well as vocalist and has ap
peared before the public a number of
times.

does. It is a nerve food and blood
foodâthe most helpful thing in the
world to you. Its effects are exhilar
ating, vitalizing, purifying. Yet it is
a germicide so certain that we publish
on every bottle an offer of $1000 for a
disease germ that it cannot kill. The
reason is that germs are vegetables,
and Liquozoneâlike an excess of
oxygenâis deadly to vegetal matter.
There lies the great value of Liquo
zone. It is the only way known to
kill germs in the body without killing
the tissues, too. Any drug that kills
germs is a poison, and it cannot oe
taken internally. Every physician
knows that medicine is almost help
less in- any germ disease.
Germ Diseases.
Th ese are the known germ diseases.
All that medicine can do for these
troubles is to help Nature overcome
the germs, and such results are indi
rect and uncertain. Liquozone attacks
the germs, wherever they are. And
when the germs which cause a disease
are destrpryed the disease must end,
and forever. That is inevitable.

PREPARATIONS
ARE MADE FOR A
WOMEN'S DAY
BERKELEY, Jan. 28.âThe Asso
ciated Women Students of the univer
sity have decided to set aside Febru
ary 22, Washington's birthday, as a
"women's day," when the "co-eds" of
the university may celebrate in such
fashion as seems best to them.
During the week of February 22 the
Occident magazine is to be edited by
women students. Miss Katherine Her
shey, a Junior, has been elected editor
in chief for that week. The "women s
day" will be opened with a tennis tpur
ney, beginning at 9:30 o'clock a. m. A
basket-ball game will be played at 10:80
o'clock. In the afternoon the "co-ed '
boating club will hold a regatta on the
estuary. The culmination of the day's
celebration will come at night, when a
grand colonial ball Is to be given at
Hearst Hall. The minuet will be danced
at that time, and a bazaar will be held
in connection with the ball.

Astronomer R. G. Altken of Lick Ob
servatory has published his observa
tions made in the,last few weeks of
comet 1904 (Giancobinl), together with
the computations of the elements and
ephemeris. The comet, he says, is
small, faint and under the atmospheric
conditions prevailing here on December
19. December 27 and January 9, the
dates of observation, a difficult object
to measure. In the same bulletin he
concludes a series of observations of
"comet 1889 V, 1896 VI" (Brooks), made
with the thirty-six-inch telescope at
Mount Hamilton. He says that the
comet after fading ln October gained
very perceptibly in brightness during
December, and was not very difficult
to observe in January, when the stormy
weather ceased enough to permit obser
vations.
SAN FRANCISCO YOUTH
IS ROBBED IN PORTLAN1
Runs Away From Parents' Home and
Is Relieved of Small Sum of
Money by Stranger.
PORTLAND, Jan. 28.âTwelve-year
old John McKenzie of San Francisco
reported to the Portland police to-day
that he had been robbed of $10 last
night by a man who shared a berth
with him on a sleeping car on the
Southern Pacific en route from San
Francisco to Portland. McKenzie was
tired and hungry, and was turned over
to the care of the Boys' and Girls' Aid
Society until his family could be com
municated with. He stated that his
father is a motorman employed upon
the Eddy street car line in San Fran
cisco, and that he lives at 1398 Pine

Young McKenzie is the son of O. J.

had saved up $20 and was going to
see the world. He has run away sev
eral times before.

TOU CAN INTEREST HTM.
Any Man Over Fifty.
You can interest any man over fifty
j-p.ars .of'age in anything that will
c him feel better, because while he
ay not as yet have any positive or
ganic disease he no longer feels the
j ancy and vigor of twenty-five nor
the freedom from aches and pains he
enjoyed in earlier years, and he very
naturally examines with Interest any
.'Siticv*. looking to the improvement
I preservation of his health,
lie will notice among other things
1 the stomach of fifty Is a very dlf
â¢ renf one from the stomach he pos
sessed at twenty-five. That greatest
care must be exercised as to what is
, ; -m and how much ,of it, and even
% Jth the best of care there will be in
creasing digestive weakness with ad
vancing years.
; A proposition to perfect or improve
the digestion and assimilation of food
â¢;-> one which interests not only every 1
an of fifty, but every man, woman
nnd Child of any age, because the
vrhole secret of good health, good blood,
strong nerves, is to have a stomach
which w ill promptly and thoroughly di
gest wholesome food, because brood,
.perves, brain- tissue and every other
constitutent of the body are entirely
the product of digestion, and no medi
cine or "health" food can possibly cre
ate, pure blood or restore shaky nerves
when a .weak stomach is replenishing
the daily wear and tear of the body
from .a mass of fermenting half-digest
ed food.
No, the stomach itself wants help
and. hi no rpund-about way, either; It
wants direct, unmistakable assistance,
such as is given by one or two Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets after each meal.
These- tablets cure stomach trouble,
because their use gives the stomach a
chance to res* and recuperate; one of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contains di
gestive elements sufficient to digest
f 8000 graifts of ordinary food, such as
r bread, meat, eggs, etc.
The plan of dieting is simply another
najne for starvation, and the use of
prepared foods and new-fangled break
fast' foods simply makes matters
worse, as" any dyspeptic who has tried
them knows. ,
As Dr. Bennett sayÃ, the only reason
I can imagine why Stuart's Dyspepsia
â¢Tablets are not universally used by
everybody who Is troubled In any way
'. with poor digestion is because many
. people seem to think that because a
iroedfelne Is advertised or is sold in drug
stores or Is protected by a trade mark
fnust be a humbug, whereas as a mat
,(er of ttuth any druggist who Is ob
'.pervant knows that Stuart's Dyspepsia
'. 'Tablets have cured more people of in
' digestion, heart burn, heart trouble,
. j ervottfl prostration and run-down con
â  â¢ dltlon generally than all the patent
'medicines and doctors', prescriptions

Uricsol cure* rheumatism in thÂ«

Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
of Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be
â  fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and
tones up the system, stimulates the

drives them from the system.
Uricsol is harmless, and no injuri

SAY ITS SCHEME
IS TO DEFRAUD
Suit Begun Against Realty
Syndicate by Six Hold
ers of Its Certificates
I RECEIVER IS WANTED
Plaintiffs Charge the Board i
With Misrepresentation I
and Misuse of Property;
Allegations such as would delight 1 J
Tom Lawson in a chapter on "frenzied !
finance" are contained ln a'complaint 4
filed in the Superior Court yesterday 4
against the Oakland Realty Syndicate <
by Attorney Frank W. Sawyer on be- J
half of 'a half-dozen persona who in- '
vested in the corporation's certificates J
with the expectation of earning good J
Interest and big dividends. The ap- J
pointment of % receiver for the syndi- j
cate is demanded and a commission to J
expert its books, to which is added a J
prayer for judgment for the restoration ,
of property which, it is said, wrong- ,
fully has been taken from the syndi- <
cate. The burden of the complaint is <
that misrepresentations have been |
made for the purpose of defrauding in- <
vestors. I
The plaintiffs are A. S. Hooe, J. H. ! <
McCauley, Mrs. Annie E. Dungan, L. ; 1
H. Bither. M. Lucid and W. F. Malone. 1
The defendants, besides the corpora- . 1
tion, are its officers and directors âJohn 1
M. Chase, E. D. Harris, Will C. Wal- !
lace, F. C. Havens, J. C. Wanans, Aid- 1
en H. Clough, George Sterling and 1
Samuel T. Taylor. It is first recited 1
that the syndicate was incorporated on 1
September 5, 1865, with a capital stock 1
of $5,000,000. of which only $700 was sub- I
scribed. ! 1
It Is stated that the corporation rep
resented it was of great financial
strength and wealth and was managed
and operaed by men of strength and
wealth; that it has a paid-up capital
of $4,600,000. assets in realty worth $6,
--560,526 22. stocks and bonds in other
corporations valued at $3,988,172 48. bills
receivable $291,413 02. cash in bank $290,
--783 61, and that all of its certificate
holders were fully protected.
Upon the belief of investors that they
were buying of value, it is
alleged, the company has been enabled
to sell more than 20,000 certificates upon
which it has collected more than $4,000,
--000. The complaint declares that each
and all of the reoresentatlons above
quoted were false and made for the
sole purpose of defrauding the plain
tiffs and other certificate purchasers,
and that the certificates were inten
tionally and cunningly designed to de
ceive investors.
It is set forth that the company
promised to pay six per cent per an
num and an equal rate based upon
excess dividends, but that it has never
paid other than the six per cent and
has taken the principal paid in by cer
tificate purchasers to pay the interest
instead of paying it from profits of in
vestments. It is alleged that the com
pany employed many solicitors and
paid them twenty per cent for the
sales of certificates. Further, It is
charged that the officers and directors
have voted themselves large salaries
and incomes aggregating more than
$1,000,000.
The complaint declares that the com
pany, after having obtained large
sums, caused it to be reported that
the certificates were not of any value
and payments were not protected. This
created alarm and the defendants were
able to buy back certificates at a dis
count of over fifty per cent âa great
secret profit to the directors. And, too,
it is alleged that the directors wrong
fully purchased, in their own and their
agents' nameÃ, large areas of real es
tate in Alameda County, paying for it
out of the money of the corporation
and pretending to sell it to the cor
poration at an increased price.
It is charged also that the directors
of the syndicate incorporated other
companies and sold their shares to the
syndicate at par, when they were worth
much less; that they caused to be
transferred to themselves and these
companies nearly all the real estate of
the syndicate, and reported that it had
been sold at a great profit.
Finally, it is alleged that the com
pany is insolvent and has no assets
with which to pay the certificate hold
ers.

The crisis in Russian affairs which
developed last Sunday has been a dom
inant influence this week on all the
world's securities markets, and New

shock. Monday's outlook seemed to
threaten immediate revolution in Rus
sia. Whatever miÂ«ht be the opinion of
the ultimate results to flow from such
an event, its immediate effects could
not be contemplated with equanimity
in the world of finance. Holdings in
this country of Russian securities, out
side of some of the great insurance

United Railroads Wants the
Public to Give Its Views
as to a Proper System
' ISSUES A STATEMENT
i . _
i Management Gives Reasons
1 Why an Underground Elee-
I trie Plant Is Impossible
The present condition or tne esutter
atreet cable car system, which has late
ly provoked much criticism and left in
some quarters the impression that
the United Railroads has been neglect
ful of the comforts of the traveling
public, has resulted in a statement in
which the company says it is ready to
undertake the reconstruction of the
entire system. In fact it declares that
it has been considering plans for re
construction for many months and
only suspended further proceedings
when the management was besieged
with petitions from residents and busi
ness men along the streets through
which the line extends asking that the
company transform the entire road
into an electric one. In view of the
fact that many people have been argu
ing that the road shoulid be recon
structed for an underground instead of
an overhead electric- system, the man
agement now presents many reasons
why it will be impossible to build ari
underground system, and prefaces its
argument with facts showing that there
are many people who keenly appreciate
the obstacles in the way of this sys
tem and are in favor of an overhead
system. The statement of the com
pany reads as follows:
"Many numerously signed petitions
have been presented to this company
expressing a preference for the over
head trolley rather than cable in the
reconstruction of the so-called Sutter
street cable system and asking that the
overhead trolley system be installed.
The petitioners include residents, mer
chants and property owners along the
lines cf this systemâthat is to say,
along Sutter, Ninth, Larkin and Polk
streets and Pacific avenue; also bank
ing houses, real estate firms, insurance
companies, leading members of the
clergy and a large number of patrons
of the system. In addition to these
petitions a number of communications
have been received expressing a sim
ilar preference. A due respect for the
wishes and preferences thus expressed
demands of this company a full, frank
and fair statement of its attitude and
intentions.
PLANS ARE PERFECTED.
"This company has for more than a
year past been carefully considering
the reconstruction of the Sutter-street
system, and is now ready to proceed
with the necessary work. Indeed the
plans had already been perfected and
the estimates made for cable recon
struction when the petitions and com
munications above referred to caused
the company to suspend further pro
ceedings in that direction until it could
ascertain the wishes of its patrons.
This company intends to rebuild the
entire Sutter-street system, including
the so-called Polk and Larkin cross
town line. It will rebuild and continue
it as a cable system, which it may now
of right do, or, if its patrons prefer and
the city authorities will permit, it will
construct and equip an overhead elec
tric system. In either event, the con
struction and equipment will be new
and modern in every respect.
"We are not unmindful of the fact
that many of our patrons would prefer
the underground electric, but this, we
regret to say, is entirely out of the
question. The short time our franchise
has to run (now less than twenty-five
years), coupled with the physical dif
ficulties that would .be encountered and
which are peculiar to the topographical
conditions of San Francisco, are pro
hibitive of this character of construc
tion. This matter has had the careful
attention of the best expert minds ob
tainable, and the conclusion has been
reached that the physical and financial
difficulties prohibit underground elec
tric construction on the Sutter street
system under prevailing conditions.
"It is impossible to operate an un
derground electric system with the
conduit under water or in a wet place.
One overflowed section suspends opera
tions the entire length of that particu
lar circuit. The conduits must be
drained, and for this purpose they are
connected with and drain into the city
sewers. There is no other way to drain
them. During heavy storms large vol
umes of water rush from adjoining hill
sides into the low places, with the re
sult that the flat-lying sewers on the
cross streets are unable to dispose of
the water as rapidly as it accumulates.
Topographical conditions in San Fran
cisco are peculiar and are duplicated in
but few cities.
"Whether, in the presence of the hills
and hollows through which the lines in
question pass, a perfect municipal sew
er system would remedy the conditions
now prevailing can at this time be only
a matter of more or less intelligent con
jecture. A present certainty, however,
is the clear and patent fact that an in
vestment of nearly $1,000,000 upon the
theory that a sewer system of doubtful
reputation would perform the work
which it has hitherto failed to perform
would not be justified.
FAVOR OVERHEAD TROLLEY.
"These under a short franchise are
not such that, Irrespective of any
physical obstacles, no man or com
pany could prudently make the heavy
additional expenditure called for by
underground electric operation, for
the term is too short to justify the
outlay required with provision for de
preciation and maintenance. Without
going further into the difficulties that
prohibit underground electric con
struction and operation, suffice It to
say that after a most careful and
painstaking examination of every
phase of the problem it has been fin
ally and definitely abandoned. We
come, then, to the only question pre
sented to the company and to its pa
trons, namely: Should the Sutter
street system be operated by a cable
or overhead trolley?
"Overhead electric construction will
cost about $110,000 more than cable
construction. This added expenditure,
however, the company is willing to
make if the people so desire. And the
company desires to frankly add that,
so far as operation and service are
concerned, the overhead electric has
many advantages over cable.
"With the overhead electric new
lines could be developed in connection
with the crosstown lines, thus bring
ing new travel into Sutter street. This
could not be done with either cable
or underground electric on Sutter
street. A cable road could not take
cars from any electric line and an un
derground electric could not take
electric cars that are equipped for
overhead construction only. The re
sult, therefore, of either cable or un
derground electric construction would
be to confine Sutter street to a fixed,
rigid and immobile line without pos
sibility of through lines into new ter
ritory.

Few People Know How Useful It Ist
ln Preserving Health and Beauty. :
Nearly everybody knows that, char- I
coal is the safest and most efficient i
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but *
few realize Its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans- j
ing puroose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a j
drug at all, but simply absorbs the 1
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
then out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after |
smoking, drinking or after eating 1
onions and other odorous vegetables. j
Charcoal effectually clears and im- j
proves the complexion, it whitens the '
teeth and further acts as a natural and ;
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which J
collect in the stomach and bowels; it |
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh;
All druggists charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best I
charcoal and the most for the money I
Is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they j
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal, and other harmless !
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz- !
enges, the charcoal being mixed with ]
honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will j
soon tell in a much improved condition
Of the general health, better complex- |
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it is, that no possible
harm can result from their continued
use. but on the contrary, great benefit. ;
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stom
ach and bowels, and to clear the com
plexion and purify the breath, mouth
and throat; I also believe the liver is 1
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them; they cost but 25 cents a box at
drug stores, and although ln some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal ln Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

NINE TEACHERS
ARE APPOINTED
Board of Education Places
Some Eligible Tutors on
the Day Substitute List
The Board of Education yesterday
appointed nine new teachers in the
Public- School Department by adopting
a resolution providing that the follow
ing persons, being the next in order in
the competitive examination held June
31, 1904,. be ordered placed on the day
substitute list in- the order of their
Handing, to take effect February 1,
3905: Anna Harter, Beatrice Wilmans,
Katherine Stack, Mary E. Moser,
Helena HofTinghoff, Minnie Mirsky,
Emma Eobenstein, Agnes Carroll and
Emma Wehrli. This makes six|y-six
teachers appointed from the latest eli
gible list.
The resignation of Miss Lizzie H.
Bush, a regular teacher in the Pacific
Heights Grammar School, was accept
ed, to take effect January 23, 1905.
The following transfers and assign
ments of teachers in the department
were ordered, to take effect February
1, 1905, subject to the usual probation- i
ary period of two years: Mrs. M. S.
Wright, from the Everett Grammar to
the Park Primary School, new class;
Miss N. A. Morse, from the James Lick
Grammar to the Everett Grammar,
vice Mrs. M. S. Wright, transferred;
Miss Lillian Skahaen, from the day
substitute list to the James Lick Gram
mar, vice Mrs. N. A. Morse, trans
ferred; Miss Mary V. Croughwell, from
the day substitute list to the Franklin
Grammar, new class; Miss Marie Dono
hue, from the day substitute list to the
Pacific Heights Grammar, vice Miss
Bush, resigned.
The members of the board held a
consultation with Supervisor d'Ancona
and Expert H. A. Mason regarding the
presentation of some data to the Legis
lature relative to the compromise
measure on the proposed change in the
State apportionment of the school
funds. The first measure introduced
would result in a loss of $215,000 to the
San Francisco schools, and it is de
sired to continue the present method of
allowing the school income on a basis
of the number of school census chil
dren, but so arranged as to make 10 per
cent of the income immediately avail
able, which would materially aid the
poorer school districts.
Mason prepared a table showing the
amount each county would be entitled
to receive under the new plan, and he
will present it to the legislative com
mittee having the bills under considera
tion.

THE 4& CALL
WIFE'S SUPPORT
AND MILLINERY
Judge Coffey Says There Is
a Difference in Amount
of Money Needed for Each
After a serio-comic hearing of about
j twenty minutes' duration yesterday
| afternoon Judge Coffey decided that
I Ruth Jackson Baird should be given a
j monthly allowance of $125 from the
i estate of her husband. Miles Baird,
j who has been adjudged incompetent
I and is now under the guardianship of
bis mother, Mrs. Veronica Baird. The
! younger MrS. Paird applied for $200 a
| month, which was the amount she said
: that had been allowed her by her hus-
I band. Mrs. Baird Sr. thought $75 suf
! ncieht, and Judge Coffey suggested
111 compromise of $196, which seemed
I satisfactory to the guardian, but was
n< i agreed to by Attorney Heggerty,
representing the young wife.
-Mrs. Baird, the mother, gave some
evidence regarding her son's financial
circumstances, and said that $110 a
month was needed for his treatment
and board at the Livermore sanita
rium. More was required to pay tin,
interest upon his debts and she thought
something should remain to apply to
a reduction of his heavy obligations.
His regular income from his share in
the Baird Estate Con.pany is $306 a
month, but Mr. Heggerty was certain
th-re was frequently greater sums in
dividends, and he thought that ered
itors should not be considered to the
exclusion of the wife and child.
Judge Coffey delivered a homily on
family allowances. He said he had had
a thousand such cases and they were
all alike. This young man's estate
was in jeopardy through his own con
duct. "Why, he would be cured in a
weel: if they would take every cent
away from him. There is too much
richness in his blood from the deposit
of wealth on his system. He would be
far better off as a tramp, and would
be a hot pacer down the road instead
of down the line.
"1 know men who can support a wife
and five children as good as the per
sons on both sides of this case on $100
a month. , I think it is enough for any
woman and her child, but she cannot
support a milliner on it at the same
time," remarked the Judge, gazing
critically at the handsome hat adorn
ing the head of the fair applicant. Heg
gerty at once took exceptions to this
remark.
"It Is not fair nor Just for vow Honor
to say that," he cried. "A pretty wom
an in her youth has a right to wear a
pretty bonnet, and it should not
criticized more than the smaller, mo*
somber headwear of an older'woman.*
The Judge confessed his admiration
for "millinery compositions, or what
ever you call them," but insisted that
even in these days of prosperity $100
a month was a sufficient amount for*
the maintenance of a woman ahd child.

Author Winning
Laurels From
Corelli. .
Special Dispatch tdk The Call.
LONDON, Jan. 2S.â"Rita," as Mrs.
Desmond Humphrey is known in the j
literary world, is making things live- j
ty in the English smart set by her tilts ,
at tlieii shams, their slangs, their gam- I
blings and their other vices, which
have gone from bad to worse so rapid
ly of late. She is running Marie Corelli !
a dose race in this respect, and has \
the r.dvantaee of far more grace of
style and vivacity. There is as much
difference between them as there is
between a bludgeon and a rapier.
Although "RJfta" moves about in
smart society rather more than her
livai, she has kept her personality out
of the public View, as a lule, and lit
tle lies been written about her. One
s--o naturally expects these sharp as
sailants of fashionable society to be
dowdy frumps that I confess 1 was a
bit surprised on meeting "Rita" to find
that she was a bright-eyed, attractive
and tastefully dressed little woman,
auick witted, well poised and business -
like. She told me she was busy at pres
ent completing a novel, of which she
didn't mind telling me the name, al
though it had not been divulged be
fore. Tt was to be called "The Queer
Lady Judas," and was suggested t"
her by a character that had appeared
in her recent slashing series of essays
entitled "The Confessions of a Beauty
Doctor." The author was inclined to
think that this novel would make a
sensation, both in England and Amer
ica; for it was going to give a view of
the frivolous, careless, scandal-loving
side of society from behind the inner
most cvi tain.
Jt seems to have been Ritas* hatred
Of shams and hypocrisies that has led
to her greatest success. "Souls,',' her
best known book hitherto, marked her
departure from the usual sort of ro
mance into the field of satire. "The
Masqueraders" attracted wide atten
tion, tool and having been published
cnly last year, may yet surpass
"Souls" in success.
Although "Rita" has traveled all over
the world until she has become a cos
mopolitan, and you would never guess
that she came from an old Scotch line,
yet she was born in Inverness-shire.
She went to Australia when she was 4
years old. shared a tutor with her
brothers and learned to ride and play
cricket and lÂ° ve out-of-doors and dis
like city life. Even then she wrote
poems and short stories in secret and
dreamed of the time when she would
be a novelist. She returned to England
when she was 14, and kept on writing
until on one tremendous and never-to
be-forgotten day she found herself in
print. It was Charles Dickens the
younger, who was then the editor of
Household Words and All the Year
Round, established by his distinguished
father, who seems to have discovered
"Rita's" possibilities, however. He ob
tained from her the serial rights of the
first stories by which she became
known to fame.
London never had much fascination
for Mrs. Humphreys, and she has usu
ally lived in the country. A few months
j ago she moved into a charming home
i in Parkstone, one of the prettiest towns
iin Dorsetshire. She is by no means
what 's supposed to be the typical lit
erary woman, who neglects her per
sonal appearance, is at the mercy of
moods and always behindhand with her
"copy." On the contrary, "Rita" is as
prompt, businesslike and systematic as
can be. She keeps her promises as care
fully as if she were a business man.
If you want to see her brown eyes
snap get her to talking about shoddy
society and the efforts of the newly
rich to break into it. "Some of you
Americans," she said, "are not guilt
less, ether. It has been said that there
were one or two women in London who
enabled themselves to pay their debts
and speculate on 'change from the fees
they obtained for introducing rich
Americans into London society. I can
tell ( ycru that instead of one or two,
there are half a dozen, and perhaps
more, and that some of them get any
where from $10,000 to $50,000 a season. < >f
course, those are exceptional fees, but
the average Is higher than you would
i suppose. Of course, it Is only the vul-
I gar who try in this manner to buy
their way in, and equally, of course,
they do not get their moneys worth.
But there are just as many newly rich
English families who do the same
thing, so it is not a question of na
tionality."

BERGEfl HUKT
IN AUTO WRECK
Well Known Clubman Has
Ribs and Legs Fractured
in, a Fell Street Accident
MOTOR STRIKES WAGON
Machine Driven by Charles
Stove! Runs Into a
Team and Kills a Horse
Albert L. Bergevin, the well known
clubman, residing at the Palace Hotel,
was seriously injured last night in an
automobile accident at the corner of
Fell street and Masonic avenue. The ac -
cident took place at 7 o'clock. Charles
J. Stove!, an insurance man of 122 San
some street, was driving the machine
and his brother Roy and Bergevin
were riding in the rear seat.
The auto was going at a good speed
down Fell street, on its return from
the park. As the vehicle neared Ma
sonic avenue, a lumber wagon, be
longing to J. H. Kruse of Twenty-third
and Folsom, driven by Charles Hinds,
rounded into Fell street.
Stovel attempted to pilot the car
past the w agon, but the auto struck a
loose plank in the street. The heavy
piece of board was thrown against one
of the leading horses of the lumber
wagon. At the same time it caught
the wheel of the auto and swerved
that vehicle into the team. Bergevin
was thrown from his seat and landed
heavily on the stone curb. Four of his
ribs were broken, his right patella and
right leg bone were fractured and his
body generally contused. One of the
horses was so badly injured that it had
to be shot by the police.
Bergevin was hurried to the Park
Hospital, where Dr. Pinkham set the
broken bones. The injured man suf
fered extreme pain and may have pos
sibly been injured internally. After
his wounds were dressed he was re
moved to his apartments at the Palace.
The auto was not damaged.
JOLLY BROKERS
PLAN FOR FFN
Would Relax and Cultivate
Amenity by Club Formed
to Promote Sociability
The men who are active in the trans
action of business in connection with
the Merchants' of this city
took preliminary steps yesterday to
form a club for the promotion of good
fellowship among all members of the
exchange and thtir representatives.
Each firm or individual holding a cer
tilk ate of membership in the Mer
chants' Exchange is entitled to have
one representative in the exchange.
Men lead a strenuous life in the grain
board and in the marine department
of the exchange. Representatives of
business houses are busy and have lit
tle time to get well acquainted. Asper
ities resulting from business transac
tions have little chance to be healed.
This condition of affairs led H. G.
Stindt to call together the younger men
connected with the exchange and to
explain to them what Jolly times the
members of the Hay (Exchange have
whenever they go Off on a picnic, which
is once a year at least.
"The effect of the hay men's picnic
does not wear off," said Stindt. "They
get well acquainted, and business runs
with less friction for that reason. There
is no reacon why the people about the
Merchants' Exchange should not have
jjst at- good times as the hay men."
Further than this, Stindt explained,
there several sorts of functions in
whu b the grain brokers, all connected
with the produce business, and others,
could profitably take part. The entire
matter was threshed out yesterday. H.
G. Stindt was elected temporary presi
dent and Arthur Nelson temporary sec
retary, it was voted to have another
meeting next Saturday, when by-laws
and a constitution may be provided fes
and permanent officers will be named.
Representatives of about twenty-five
business houses were present at the
iirst meeting. The idea grew out of
a dinner that was held a week ago
yesterdayâthe day that the Merchants'
Exchange was formally dedicated by
its members. There was so much fun
on that occasion that certain of the
young brokers believed that "more
fun" is a good thing to promote.
FRUIT SHIPPERS WILL
TEST OBNOXIOUS LAW
E. H. Hayden of Watsonville Is Ar
rested and Brought Before Su
preme Court.
The Supreme Court was called upon
yesterday to decide the constitution
ality of the law which provides that
shippers of all varieties of fruit must
print on each package in letters one
quarter of an inch high in what town
and county the contents were grown.
Charles E. Hayden of Watsonville was
arrested as a test for violating the
provision mentioned and the case is
brought to the State's highest tribunal
on a petition for a writ of habeas cor
pus. The matter will come up for ar
gument to-morrow morning.
The penalty for breaking the law in
question is a fine of not less than $200
nor more than $500. The opponents
of the measure claim that big con
cerns receive fruit from several coun
ties, sort and pack it and ship it away
without being able to know from just
where the contents of each package
came.

PRETTY MARIE WELLS
NOW MRS. HANNA.
POPULAR SOCIETY' BELLE WEDS
POPULAR SOCIETY BEAUTY WHO WAS MARRIED LAST NIGHT AND HER
MATRON OF HONOR. THE CEREMONY BEING PERFORMED BY BISHOP
NICHOLS AT THE HOME OF THE BRIDE'S PARENTS.
Last night in the nuiet of her draw
ing-room, surrounded only by friends
of closest ties, lovely Marie Wells
plighted her troth to John Selby
Hanna.
In all the big West there's not a
fairer maid, nor tenderer, nor wittier,
and lucky is the chap who has won
her for himself âthrice lucky!
In her nuptial robe the bride was a
picture not' socn forgot.
Her gown was a splendid affair of
point lace over white satin, whose sil
very shimmer was veiled with chiffon.
From her soft, brown hair fell a maps
of tulle, held fast by the half wreath
of orange blossoms, and at her throat
she wore a rope of pearls. White roses
rested upon her arm.
The piquant little sister of the bride,
Miss Juanita Wells, served as maid
of honor, wearing an exquisite white
chiffon frock, gayly spangled; in her
hair she wore a half wreath of pink
roses, her bouquet matching them in
color. In all truth she was a pretty
thing, giving promise of be'ng as great
a beauty as her sister.
Mrs. Truxtun Beale, cousin and
dearest friend of the bride, was ma
tron of honor. Herself a famous
beauty, it was a fair trio that stood
beneath the nuptial bower.
Mrs. Beale was gowned in white
silk, incrusted with rare old lace, and
carried Bridesmaid roses.
Mrs. Wells, mother of the bride,
wore an exquisite lace robe over white
satin, looking more the elder sister
of the bride than mother.
The bride was given into the keep
ing of the groom by her father, George
C. Wells.
Bishop Nichols read the impressive
Episcopal service.
The home of the bride was made
glad with a profusion of pink roses
and pink carnations, with masses of
greens from the forest.
This morning Mr. Hanna and his
bride will start for Southern Califor
nia, to remain for two weeks.
After a short visit here with their
friends the happy pair will start for
Europe, going by way of the Straits
of Magellan.
The Old World is not a new story
to Mr. Hanna, who spent two years
after his graduation from the Univer
sity of California in wandering about.
As to the return of the travelers,
they will come only when fancy dic
tates âand it may be many years ere
the well-beloved bride returns to us.
Meanwhile, may joys and blessings
attend them!

MEMBERS GIVE RECEPTION
0 TO REV. \V. P. SULLIVAN
Bid Farewell on the Departure of the
Popular Priest From St.
Theresa's Church.
The Immaculate Conception Sodality
of St. Theresa's parish gave a recep
tion to Rev. Father W. P. Sullivan
last Friday evening. Father Sullivan
is about to leave St. Theresa's In or
der to assume duties at St. Mary's
Cathedral. An elaborate programme
was arranged under the direction of
Miss Janie M. Quinn, containing selec
tions by the Misses Coonan and the
Misses Bahrs. Frances and Eddie
Dougherty were clever in specialties,
and Miss Kannitz rendered a beautiful
vocal solo, accompanied by Miss May
Quinn.
After a short address by Miss Anna
Ward, president of the sodality, she
presented a handsome surplice and
stole to Father Sullivan as a token of
the esteem in which he is held by the
members of the sodality. In a few ap
propriate words Father Sullivan re
sponded. I
Many well-known members of the
clergy and others were present at the
reception. Among them were Rev.
Father O'Connell, pastor of St.
Theresa's Church; Rev. Father Har
rington, who will succeed Father Sul
livan; Rev. Father Stark of the Paul
ist Church, Rev. Father Grant of Sfe.
Brigid's Church and Brothers Zeno
phon and Timothy of Sacred Heart
College. Much disappointment was
expressed at the inability of Mrs. Sul
livan, mother of Father Sullivan, to
attend the meeting, as she was con
fined to her home by Illness.
During the repast short addresses
were made by the clergymen and
others. At the conclusion the mem
bers and guests bid farewell to the de
parting priest and wished him the best
of success in his new field of labor.

PARDEE TAKES
HIS OWN TIME
Lawyers Hope That Judges
Will Soon Be Appointed
for New Courts of Appeal
PRISON MANAGEMENT
Term of One of the State
Harbor Commissioners Is
to Expire on March 20
Governor George C. Pardee is tak
ing his own time in the matter of ap
pointing Judges of the new courts of
appeal. He may resolve to defer ac
tion until the Legislature has provided
means for maintaining the courts, In
cluding appropriations for rent, fuel,
stationery and clerical hire.
The lawyers, however, express the
opinion that the appointments are al
ready framed up in the Governor's
mind and will shortly be announced.
The duty of appointing a Supervisor
to fill a vacancy in Merced County Is
said to be giving the chief executive
no little concern.
The general trend of rumor con
cerning prison management is to the
effect that Warden Tompkins' admin
istration of affairs at San Quentin
hardly meets the approval of the gov
erning body. The Warden's Integrity
is not questioned and It is freely ad
mitted that he is not lacking in per
sonal energy. It is said, however,
that his lack of knowledge in prison
affairs is lamentable and that his tem
perament is such that the directors
have about given up hope that he will
ever acquire the influence that will
render his administration effective for
good. It would not be surprising if
the directors should take up the sub
ject of selecting a new Warden for the
penitentiary in Marin County.
Colonel John C. Kirkpatrick's four
years' term as State Harbor Commis
sioner will expire on March 20, 190fi.
Politicians and others are already dis
cussing the question whether Gover
nor Pardee will reappoint the man
ager of the Palace Hotel or name a
new man. Commissioner John D.
Mackenzie's term will not expire until
March 14, 1906. Both of these Com
missioners were appointed by Gover
nor Cage, but their nominations were
sent to the Senate by Governor Par
dee two years ago. It Is said that
they could easily present the technical
point that they were appointed by
Governor Pardee for a term of four
years, but there are no indications
that such a point will be raised.
RAILROAD NEEDS
ROOM TO CROW
Southern Pacific Company
Sues for Condemnation ol
Valuable Martin Holdings
The Southern Pacific Company, set
ting forth the inadequacy of its present
yard facilities at Third and Townsend
btreets and the need for more ground
for tracks and freight sheds, yester
day brought suit for the condemnation
of two-thirds of the property between
Mtfth and Sixth and King and P.erry
streets. A map of the ground, attach
ed to the complaint, shows the pro
posed construction of freight sheds $25
feet long, with trackage between.
The middle of the block is already
owned by the railroad, and the two
pieces sought at the east and west ends
are the property of Eleanor Martin. J.
Downey Harvey, Peter D. Martin,
Walter S. Martin and Genevieve (load
Reilly. Officially the plat is known as
South Beach biock No. 21. At the east
erly end that sought to be condemned
has a frontage of 240 feet on Fifth
street and a depth of 251 feet on King
and Berry s tree is. At the west end
there is a like frontage on Sixth
avenue and a uniform depth of 275
feet, making an aggregate depth of
526 feet upon which the railroad com
pany asks the court to fix a reasonable
value.
Benefit for Mrs. La Fontaine.
At the Columbia Theater next Sun
day afternoon, February 6, a special
matinee performance will be given by
the Alameda Lustspiel Ensemble in aid
of the well-known old German actress
and prompter of notable German per
formances at the old Baldwin, Mrs.
Jcsephone La Fontaine. The company
has arranged to stage Blumenthal &
Kadelburg's comedy, "Grossstadtluft,"
on that afternoon, the comedy having
proved so pronounced a success when
recently produced and there being
quite a number of requests for its
repetition. Mrs. La Fontaine is well
known among the German population,
especially that portion of it which
has enjoyed the German performances
given during the Sunday night sea*

City Lota Accurately and Officially Surveyed.
CHARGES REASONABLE.
My field books, diagrams show, by actual
measurements, the exact points from which
your lot was surveyed, whlcn is Imperatively
necessary, a* the City Surveyor and other sur
veyors do not show that, and also because all
the original monuments were taken out when
the streets were formed In the early days of
the city, since which time the different City
Surveyors, extending to the present time, have
made Innumerable errors ln their street and
lot surveys, and to conceal such errors they
have moved the monument lines away from
their original correct positions without legal
authority from the people, causing blocks and
streets to measure Incorrectly, creating excess
measurements In blocks of the most valuable
portion of the city, which they do not distrib
ute proportionately throughout the block, but
often give the entire excess of sometimes 12
Inches or more to one person, thereby Interfer
ing with the deed distance* of the people and
the absolute security of boundary lines.
Consult me before moving your valuable
buildings on such unfair surveys. Work guar
anteed.

BY FRED E. MULHOJjI/AND
The Tichenor & Co. stable now en
gaged In a purse gathering expedition
at Ascot Park, Los Angeles, sent up
some canned horseflesh labeled ta
basco sauce, to be opened in the Cal
ifornia Oaks, decided yesterday at
Oakland track.
The package contained none other
than Loretta M, a black filly by Pi
rate of Penzance-Fertile. Trainer
Henry McDaniel and Jockey Prior
came along to chaperon the brunette
Miss. Loretta M capured the Oaks,
also the $2240 which represents the
winner's share of the rich prize, was
tucked away aboard her car and is
now speeding homeward. Reaching
there she will'no doubt be met by the
Mayor and a silver cornet band, be
tendered the freedom of the city and
have an orange wreath placed on her
classic brow. That's all right, as the
visitor from the southland won, but it
cannot be admitted that she showed
to be better than an ordinary piece of
racing material. She was installed an
odds-on favorite and trudged along
through the heavy going for one and
an eighth miles, hand ridden by Prior
most of the way, without being head
ed.
LORETTA M IN THE LEAD.
At the paddock Prior grew anxious,
striking his mount once with the
whip. Passing the Judges she had a
length and a half lead over Del Ca
rino, a 16 to 1 shot, with Lady Good
rich third, two lengths away. Sea
Air and Morita, the only other start
ers, were beaten off. Del Carina has
been acting as crabbed and sour of
late as a left-over maiden lady of 33
and past, and wore blinkers for the
first time. On her form of a month
ago she could have won handily. Sea
Air on her best form could have
scored without effort, but the filly is
stale and again ran out. Morita is a
maiden with apparently no fondness
for a heavy track.
A large attendance viewed the rac
ing and the books did a thriving busi
ness. Following the rule of late, four
favorite again met defeat. Big Beach,

Won driving and going away. Balance stopping rode a vigorous race on the
winner. Alarie possibly took matters too quietly on the favorite, as he is apt to do.
True Wing ran an excellent race. Bob Ragon possessed the action and resiliency of a
busted automobile tire going to the post.
jat 30 to 1, furnlÃhed the big- surprise
i by disposing of the even-money favor
ite, Albert Fir.
Meada, the black Ally from the
stable of Bianchi & Co., scored an
easy victory in the introductory flve
furlong scramble. Ridden by Sulli
van, she was played down from 8 to 5
to 13 to 10 and led Fay Templeton out
with considerable to spare. After be
ing carried wide ln the stretch by Ma
cene, Charley McCafferty's San Jose
then finished third.
Bob Smith's Waterspout, a 15 to 1
shot ln the ring, captured the five and
a half furlong selling dash which fol
lowed. Educate made all the run
ning and was then beaten out easily 1
by the outsider, astride which Sam
j Greenfield rode a clever race. Pres
tano, another outsider, dropped ln
' third. McÃride got away poorly with
I the favorite, Emma Reubold, and after
the mare had shown speed for half a
block she disappeared from public
view.
Following this came the undoing of
! Sol Lichtenstein, favorite at 6 to 5 for
I the seven-furlong selling recital. Sol
kept himself prominent until almost
within stone's throw of the wire, when
his calcium light apparatus or some
other part of his propelling machinery !
gave out. Cinclnnatus. which receded |
in the betting from 2% to 5% to 1, was
never headed, winning hands down
after bearing in to the rail by five
lengths. Anvil, a 16 to 1 chance,
nosed the favorite out for place ,
honors.
Probably G. W. Trahern doesn't like
a heavy, holding track. This conclu- j
eion must be reached after the showing
mad* by the Summers entry in the mile
and a sixteenth selling fixture. The bay i
i gelding looked to have dropped Into *
somebody's flower garden and opened
jan 8 to 6 favorite. He was as free from
I speed as an eel Is of scales, finishing
!an enrapturing third. Major Tenny,
I with Anderson up, shaped out the pace, j
[ and with little more left than the peo
! pie had who backed Albert Fir In the
j last, won. hard pressed by Modicum.
Esherln and Matt Hogan never had a
look ln.
Like all unreliable platers, Big Beach
did the right thing at the wrong time.
| Of all the entries in the different events
Albert Fir stood out like a cigar stand
â  statue to win the closing event, at six
| and a half furlongs, for two-year-olds.
} A world of coin went into the books on
I the Jones & Lusk entry at evens, and
in a driving finish McCafferty's Big
Beach, a 30 to 1 shot, downed the first
choice by more than two lengths. This
I disaster placed a crimp In the talent
that a steam flatiron couldn't straight
en out. True Wing beat Bob Ragon
out of the show.

guished party of sporting men at his
training quarters at the Ocean Beach
yesterday morning and gave them
some food for thought. He had the
I valuable services of Battling Nelson as
1 a sparring partner, and the two rugged
fighters had a merry time for four
rounds. Hyland seems tireless in his
work and is always boring ln and try
ing to land a decisive blow. Â«
The rest he will have between this
j time and the night of the fight Is ex
, pected to store up a big supply of vl-
I tality, which will make him one of the
j most formidable opponents Nell has
J ever met. Whether he will be out
| classed ln speed remains for the fight
jto determine.
i There were a few small bets made
j yesterday, the prevailing price being 2
' to 1 with Nell the public choice. Wager
ing Is expected to commence in earnest
to-morrow when the price will quickly
: settle down to Its proper level, accord
: ing to the commissions sent in.
Frankie Neil spent a quiet day at
I his training camp near San Rafael yes
; terday. Trainer McDonald has the llt
' tie bantam in tip-top condition and 1b
, ready to send him into the ring at a
. moment's notice.
i Frankie is a glutton for work, and
the minute he arose yesterday morning
!he started to exercise. McDonald In
sisted that he rest, but Frankie per
, sists in jumping around.
The regular programme was varied,
the gymnasium work being dispensed
with.
â¢ Road work was indulged ln both
morning and afternoon. Young Corbett
accompanied Frank. Corbett has work
ed faithfully for a month, and is well
j down to weight.
Neil will hit the road this morning,
; but will rest ln the afternoon.
A large number of spectators are ex-
I pected, so Frankie may go a few
rounds with the punching bag, to give
his admirers a line on his form.
Frankie says he never was in better
shape for a fight, and feels as strong
as an ox. His muscles are hard and
his skin has a healthy glow. He
weighed about 117 pounds to-day.
Young Corbett and Battling NelÃon
did not sign yesterday for their pro
posed match next month. Nelson still
has a longing for Britt and is making
all kinds of offers to draw the Call
fornian into a return match. Britt is
exercising regularly ln the Olympic
Club so that he will not be taken un
awares if a match he likes Is presented
to him.

ASCOT HANDICAP
WON BT OXFORD
The Gray Son of Faraday
Beats Schoolmate a Head
in a Sensational Finish
HORATIUS' GAME EFFORT
Comes Like a Whirlwind
Through Stretch and at
Judges' Stand Is Third
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 28.âCleverly
ridden by Fuller, carrying 110 pounds
â¢ and coupled In the betting with Pasa
: dena and quoted at 2 to 1, Oxford,
James McLaughlin's great three-year
old, won the Ascot handicap to-day at
Ascot Park, worth $3550 to the winner.
Schoolmate was but a short head be
hind the winner, and Horatius, coming
like a whirlwind, a length behind the
place horse. The time, 2:06, is a new
I record for the track. â¢The race was the
best ever seen at Ascot, and the per
' feet weather and a fine card drew one
of the largest crowds of the season.
There were thirteen starters in the
handicap, with the McLaughlin pair
ruling strong favorites at 2 to L Every
horse ln the race was well played at
liberal odds, as it looked an open af
fair.
The big field was sent away to a per
fect start, with Pasadena and Oxford
in front. Pasadena set a terrific pace
for seven furlongs, with Oxford Flo
Bob, High Chancellor, Fossil, Requlter,
, Schoolmate, Watercure and Horatius
| almost ln the order named for most
jof that distance. Horatius was badly
j outrun the first six furlongs, but finally
[ got into his stride and moved ud fast.
Rounding the far turn Pasadena,
> which had done all that was expected
of him, dropped back and Oxford took
!up the lead. Into the stretch they
i swung, with Oxford a length ln front
of Fossil and High Chancellor, Re
qulter and Schoolmate close up. High
Chancellor had enough of It and
dropped back beaten, as did also Fossil,
Flo Bob and Requlter. Schoolmate
came on with a rush, however, and at
the last sixteenth pole Fuller went to
work on Oxford. He rode with all his
skill and energy, but Schoolmate
gained, and it seemed the big bay
would nip out the gray on the wire.
Fuller persevered, however, and landed
Oxford a winner by a head.
While the crowd watched the struggle
between the leaders Horatius came like
a whlrlwnld down the stretch, passing
almost the entire field within an eighth
of a mile. He finished third, a length
behind Schoolmate. The victory of Ox
ford was a popular one and the crowd
: cheered both Fuller and the horse.
The day was a hard one for the book
makers, every winner being heavily
played by the public. Three favorites, ;
two close second choices and a popular
outsider were the victors. Weather
clear, track fast. Summary t

Fiery liniments, drawing plasters and penetrating oils never cured a case of Rheumatism; because it is not
a local or ski . disease, but a disease of the blood caused by a sour, acid condition of that vital fluid The kidneys
and bowels get weak, the liver torpid, and the poisonous accumulation* that should pass off through the usual
channels of nature are absorbed by the blood and distributed into the muscles, joints and nerves through the circu

greeable symptoms of the disease. Rheumatism sufferers look with dread upon the winter season with its damp
cold, changing weather, for the first alight exposure is liable to bring ou an attack, and the sharp, cutting paina and
feverish, swollen joints and muscles make life miserable with almost unbearable torture. Local applications will

FLAMES RACING
IN OMAHA CITY
OMAHA, Jan. 29. âA Are that started
at 11:30 o'clock last night threatens to
cause great damage in the wholesale
district. The three commission firms
of Snider, Bingham and Mullen and
four floors occupied by the M. E. Smith
Dry Goods Company had been de
stroyed up to midnight, with a loss of
$250,000. The fire Is still spreading.
At 1 o'clock this morning it was es
timated the loss was already (500,000
and the flames were still beyond con
trol. It Is believed the entire block
containing several substantial buildings
will be destroyed.
2 o'clockâThe flames have destroyed
a half block of five-story buildings
containing valuable stocks of whole
sale and commission firms and at thai
hours were burning with increased fury.
Despite the efforts of the entire fire
department with half a hundred
streams playing on the flames they
continue to spread.
STANFORD ATHLETES PERFORM.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 28.
Stanford's first field day of the season
was run on a sodden track and the
time of most of the events was slow,
but the cardinal athletes, especially
the freshmen, performed ln such good
style that Trainer "Dad" Moulton
smiled joyfully and said he had never
trained so likely a bunch. The meet
was interdepartmental and law won
with 61 points. Geology and mining
was second with 25 points, civil en
gineering followed with 21 and me
chanical next with 10 points. The
chemistry and zoology departments
also had 10 points and the electrical
engineering 8. There were no sur
prises, but the men ran well up to
form, and it seems likely the cardinal
will have as fast a team this year as
the famous one of last season. The
only weak point is the two-mile, but
Trainer Moulton has several good men
who may develop into first-class point
winners before the season ends.
Miller, the freshman from Bakers
field, captured the mile event easily.
Horton, a Uklah freshman, was first
ln the low hurdles. "With Lanagan.
McFarland and Horton," said Moulton
after the race, "we have the best
hurdlers on the coast. They don't
Jump, they spread over the hurdles
like scissors."
Probably the beet feature of the day
was the quarter-mile event. Severy
and Davis, freshmen from Southern
California, won heats ln 66 seconds,
remarkably fast time for the muddy
track. Edwards, a sophomore, ran
second ln 56 1-6 seconds. The per
formance of these men will give Stan
ford a strong relay team as well aa
two fast quarter-milers. The events
were as follows:
100 yardsâQartzmann, '08, first;
Woods, '07, second; West, '06, third.

of Tropical Products lor
This Market.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Mariposa, Captain Lawless, ar
rived yesterday morning* from Tahiti,
with twenty-nine passengers and 1363
tons of cargo. Among the passengers
were travelers for health and pleasure*
ouslness men and gome of Tahiti's
most distinguished residents. The oargo
was made up of tropical products, and
included copra, fruit, vanilla, cocoa
nuts, fungus and dried fish.
Cadet Charles Yen, who was left be
hind in the Tahiti government hospital
by the cruiser Protet, was a passenger
ori, the Mariposa. He has come here to
undergo an operation for appendicitis,
and upon the rapidity of his recovery
wiÃ depend whether he rejoins his ship
here before she leaves for France or
goes back to Tahiti for duty on the
Protet's successor.
The Miss T. Pomare of the passenger
list is in Tahiti a real Princess. She is
a daughter of old King Pomare and is a
leader in the small but brilliant society
world of the South Sea island. Princess
Pomare accompanied her uncle. T. Sal
mon, a prominent man of affairs in the
South Seas and well known In local
clubdom. The Princess while here will
be the guest of Mrs. Atwatcr, whose
husband was once American Consul at
Tahiti.
W. F. Doty, United States Consul at
Tahiti, was a passenger on the Mari
posa. He says the copra crop will fall
about 2000 tons short and that consid
erably less of the product than usual
was shipped here, because four big car
goes were taken away by German sail
ing vessels.
The Mariposa brings word of the
wreck of the schooner Tamarae-Marae
on the island of Hereheretia, about 200
miles south of Tahiti. The schooner

The captain and three sailors, who left
In a small boat in search of assistance,
are thought to have perished. The
French gunboat Zelee, which went to
the scene of the wreck, took off seven
natives who had been left on board and
made a fruitless search ln the vicinity
for the captain and the crew in the
small boat.
A number of other small vessels were
damaged in/ the storm which wrecked
the Tamarae-Marae. A cutter belong

on a coral reef near Riates. Leeward

BAYONNE FINALLY ARRIVES.
The French ship Bayonne finally
reached port last night after being out
577 days from Dunkirk, France. The
vessel arrived off the. port Friday
night, but it was about 9 o'clock last
night when she dropped anchor off
Melggs wharf.
Captain Grondes, who brought the
vessel out of Dunkirk, was drowned
during a storm off Cape Horn. The
vessel put back to Montevideo for re
pairs and to wait for a new comman
der, who was sent from France to
bring the vessel into this port, and this
accounts for her very long passage,
although her run from Montevideo to
this port shows that she is a leisurely
going windjammer. She took 115 daya
in her run from Montevideo to San
Francisco. The Bayonne has a con
signment of merchandise for W. R.
Grace of this city.
Pilot Johnson and Captain Marshall
of the tug Relief say the master of
the French ship is the most stubborn
man they ever met. It is probable
that if the Relief had not towed the
ship into this port last night she might
now be lying on the rocks. Captain
Johnson says that when he went
aboard the vessel Hourdel ignored
him. He refused to listen to the
pilot's advice.
When the ship was passing in she
was in a perilous position. The Re
lief offered to tow her in for $100.
Hourdel expected the pilot to pay for
the tow. Marshall finally threw a line
to the French ship and towed her to
an anchorage. He did not want to
see the vessel lost and he decided to
leave the matter of paying for the
tow to be settled by arbitration.

Futnr e Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 28.âReflecting lower price*
at Liverpool, the market her* was easy at the
opening. May started %c to %c off at $1 15%
to $1 15%. The decline abroad was said to be
dv* to increased shipments from Austral**
At th* start there was considerable scattered
selling, commission houses and pit traders be
ing prominent t, that side of the market.
Th* slight decline, however, brought out a
fair demand from shorts. In consequence there
was soon a firmer undertone. May advancing to
$1 16. Receipts ln the Northwest to-day were
quite small, and the news of the cash situa
tion at Minneapolis waa rather Bullish. A re
vised estimate made by an English crop expert
regarding the exportable surplus of wheat from
Argentina and Australia materially reduced
former figures. Thl* gave com* anxiety to
shorts and resulted In additional covering.
Trading, however, waa comparatively light
throughout the entire session. Th* market
closed Arm, with May at 81 18%.
Selling by cash houses and scalper* caused
a rather weak corn market. May opened un
changed to %c lower at 45%0 to 46% 0 mx.2.
closed at 45c
Larger receipt* than expected waa partly
responsible for a small decline In th* price of
cat*. May opened a shade to %o lower at 31a
to 810*31 %c and closed at 80% a
A decline of 10c ln the price of hogs started
moderate profit-taking ln provision* and re
sulted ln lower pries* throughout th* list. At

prices for fresh, with stocks well cleaned up.
Th* position of the market at th* moment 1*
one of strength, mm the first-class storage stock
Is all cleaned up and receipts of fresh product
are not large enough to supply the demand.
The street ha* been predicting a decline for
some day* back, but It has not yet appeared.
Cold-storage Butter Is higher.
Eggs, like Butter, are well cleaned up and
steady. Dealers continue to predict larger re
ceipts and resulting lower price*, but neither
condition has thus far materialised. Buyers
are still careful in their purchases, as the
production generally increases rapidly at this
time of th* year and nobody wanta to be
caught with stock on a falling market.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Trade ln fresh fruit* was quiet during the
early morning hours owing to the cool, foggy
weather, which discouraged buyers, and the
market continued dull during the rest of the
day. Citrus and Tropical fruits were ln free
supply and the market was devoid of feature.
The Apple market was weak except for extra
fancy offerings of Eplteenbergs and Newtown
Pippins, which were held at a substantia! pre
mium. All other seasonal varieties were la
excessive supply, with price* ruling ln favor
of buyer*.

Hints of Beautiful Spring Waists and Dresses Peep Out Through the Threads of These
New Cotton Dress Stuffs
The Arnold Print Works Has Sent Us
A fine, full showing to be seen to-morrow, illustrated in three big windows to-day. So dainty
and different, and economical, they mark a new era in cotton wash stuffs. We are glad to have
Tale's first to bring them to San Francisco. They're the fabrics maybe you have been wondering
about and wanting to see, for they're being told about in the magazines.
Many of them look just like wool, even "close to," yet with all the lightness and beauty and comfort of
cotton. Others are dainty, filmy weaves in the lighter colors, with flowers, leaves, so natural they seem to have
been pressed into the threads. You will be glad to see them. It isn't a bit too early to start on the spring dress
or waist or gown. Many of them wijl make up into beautiful tailor suits. We will be as glad to show them to
you, even if you aren't ready to buy just now. To give you an idea:
