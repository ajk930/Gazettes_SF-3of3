and will probably be taken further In

outside the town are flocking in. The

SAN MATEO, Mav 19.â Mrs.. Green,
wife of J. C. Green, and her sister.
Miss Gibbons, had ' a marvelous escape
from death here, this morning while
driving on B street in a low back open
buggy.
A runaway horse attached ' to a
wagon came upon them and instead of
going around their â¢ buggy, which had
drawn to one side, the maddened ani
mal leaped directly, upon top of them,
dragging the wagon.
The first stroke of the animal's hoofs
tore away the seat and the next in
stant the buggy was overturned and
for several . seconds the unfortunate
women were, struggling beneath both
vehicles.
Then both horses dashed away, leav
ing the injured women lying under a
laprobe. Those who witnessed the af
fair, and rushed to the rescue expected
that both women were killed outright,
but they had escaped death. Dr. Nor
ris, who attended them, found that no
bores were broken, but the shock and
bruises will confine them to their
homes for some time. Miss Gibbons
was painfully injured.

It is affirmed that, the British and
United States Governments have be
gun negotiations with Fraissouli, and
that they are asking the French Gov
ernment to ask for the protection of
the prisoners. "European residents ex
pect that France will send warships
here immediately, but In consequence
of the native feeling, such a step would
be likely to arouse anger.
PARIS. May 19. â The French Gov
ernment has not received a report of
the capture of Perdicaris and Variley
by the brigands near Tangier. The
Fraissouli has notified Mohamed El
Torres, the representative at Tangier
for .foreign affairs of the Sultan of
Morocco, that he requires the removal
of th* Sultan's troops from his dis
trict, the removal of the Governor of
Tangier and the release of a number
of imprisoned bandits. When these
conditions are complied with Fraissou
1: will notify Mohamed El Torres of the
course he proposes to pursue with the
captives.
Fraissouli, who is already more than
twenty hours' march from Tangier
with his prisoners, has announced that
he will impose further conditions for
their release
Perdicaris, who Is 70 years old, is In
ill health.
Perdlcaris is of Greek origin, but is
a naturalized citizen of the United
States. He is very wealthy and has
lived in Tangier for years. He married
an English woman; whose eon Is his
companion in captivity.
Foreigners are much excited by this
bold raid so near Tangier, and attri
bute it to the supineness of the Gov
ernment in failing to punish the ban
dits, who last year captured Walter B.
Harris, the correspondent in Morocco
of the London Times, and their fail
ure to deal with general lawlessness.
FRAISSOULI NAMES TERMS.
This means that the United States
and Great Britain expect the Sultan to
pay a ransom, should FraLssouli de
mand it, and there should be afforded
no other way to save the lives of the
captives. It is expected that two or
three days will bring forth a demand
for a ransom from the bandits, accom
panied by the usual alternative that
the captives will be shot at a certain
lime unless the price of liberty is forth
coming. The case is not unlike that of
Miss Ellen Stone, the missionary who
was kidnaped in Bulgaria.
TANGIER, Morocco, May 19.â An
American citizen named Perdicaris and
his stepson, a British subject, were car
ried off by the bandit Fraissouli 'and his
followers last night and doubtless will
be held for a heavy ransom. The cap
tives were staying at Perdicaris' sum
mer residence, only three miles from
Tangier, when the bandits attacked
and captured them.
Gummere, upon being informed of
the outrage, conferred with the British
Minister, who also had been appealed
to. They acted with great prompti
tude. Deeming the Government re
sponsible for such a violation of public
Kecurity, they at once sent a runner to
request the Sultan's deputy to accede
to the demands of the brigands and at
once obtain the release of the prison
ers.
PROMPT ACTION OF CONSUL.
The State Department was advised of
the kidnaping in a dispatch received
this morning from Gummere.' He
jsiated that Perdicaris and his stepson,
an Englishman named Variley, were
seated in the dfawing-room of their
bummer house, three miles from Tan
gier, when the place was raided by
brigands. The two men were seized
and carried way. The women of the
party were left terror stricken behind.
In all probability Rear Admiral
Chadwick will Bend the Atlanta ahead
to report to the Consul.
'CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON. Slav 19.â As a result
of the kidnaping of Perdicaris, an
American citizen, and his stepson by
Moroccoan brigands, an American war
rtiip'wili be frowning on Tangier by
May 2% and on May 20 an entire
squadron will be there to give force to
the jiemand of United States Consul
Gummere that the Sultan obtain the
release of Perdicaris and his stepson.
Orders were sent from the Navy De

Keur Admiral Chadwick, commander
in chief of the South Atlantic squad
run, now en route to the Canaries, to
etnd one ship immediately to Tangier
and to follow with the remainder of
the scuadron. The squadron left San
Juan several dais ago and is due at
the Canaries on May 24 â two ships to
lenerifte and two to Las Palmas. The
squadron consists of the armored
cruiser Brooklyn, the protected cruiser
Atlanta and the gunboats Castine and
Marietta.
gpecial I>iÂ£j>atch to The Call.
Miss Lefevre claims that Mrs. Speck
man picked up a butcher knife and that
she used the scissors â¢ to defend her
self. This knife was ftnnd by the po
lice and has been booked as evidence.
Beth has lived long at the Cole street
number. Some time ago Miss Lefevre
became, he says, his housekeeper. Mrs.
Speckman smiles when the title of a
menial is given the other woman. She
asserts that her father is in love with
the fair Miss Lefevre and that the two
have been living together. Although
Mrs. Speckman lives with her husband.
Richard Speckman, who is connected
with poolrooms in Sausalito. she re
sented the companionship of her father
and the other wgman. Many spirited
Interviews have taken place between
Beth and his daughter, but they ac
complished little, and life went on in
the same old way. Miss Lefevre re
maining In the Cole-street home and
Beth sanctioning her sojourn.
DAUGHTER CE-VSCRES FATHER.
Mrs. Speckman says she -often re
monstrated with her parent. She
begged him to abandon the woman and
turn her from his door. He remained
obdurate In his determination to have
his sweetheart with him and when the
pleadings of his daughter became irk
some to him he ordered her to cease.
Her persistency finally became unbear
able to the Louvre proprietor and it
ended* in the father disowning his
daughter, so the latter says, that he
might escape the frown of her disap
proval. This last act only served to fire
Mrs. Speckman to a Intense
loathing for Miss Lefevre until their
meeting yesterday seemed inevitable.
Mrs. Speckman did not want to dis
cuss many of the details that led up
to the encounter. In the statement she
made to the police she avers that she
went to the home of her father for the
purpose of securing 1 some trinkets she
had left there. She was met at tha
door by Miss Lefevre, who refused her
admittance. When she attempted to
force her way to one of the interior
rooms, she claims Miss Lefevre at
tacked her with a pair of scissors. A
struggle followed In which she threw
her father's friend to the floor and dis
armed her. Then she says Miss Le
fevre startedfto run away and she
threw the scissors after her. She de
nies that she had a weapon of any
kind.
The stories of tse women regarding
the commencement of the affair vary
greatly. Each blames the other and
each would have it understood that
she herself was on the defensive. Just
who struck the first blow is a matter
for the courts to determine, and this
will be done, if possible, at the pre
liminary examination of Mrs. Speck
man.
The women attacked each other with
the ferocity of tigers and it is strange
that, murder was not done. The evi
dence of war was In the rooms. Chairs
were disarranged and furniture over
turned. The appearance of the women
with their faces torn, hair matted with
gore and bodies bruised and cut told
better than any words what had oc
curred when rage and Jealousy over
whelmed them and they matched their
strength. Then, when they were sepa
rated and they stood facing each other,
their bitterness was not allayed. Even
on the way to the hospital with a po
liceman between them they displayed
vlndlctlveness of an order not to be
mistaken.
Daughter and sweetheart fought a
fierce duel yesterday afternoon for
the affection of Adolph H. Betlu one
of the proprietors of the Old Louvre
cafe, in the latter'* home at 799 Cole
street. The daughter of the restau
rant man was Mrs. Anna Speckman,
who figured in the sensational mur
der of a former husband in Alamed;i
about five years ago. In yesterd iy's
battle she was armed with a large
knife. Miss Clara Lefevre. who ttnds
shelter under Beth's roof, chose as her
weapon a pair of scissors. Bitter Jeal
ousy animated the daughter. She had
tried in vain to rid her father of her
adversary's companionship. When all
remonstrance failed she gave vent to
her passion and the fight was on. It
ended in a call for the ambulance and
the removal of both women to the
Park Emergency Hospital. Later Mrs.
Speckraan was taken to the City Pris
on and booked on a charge of as
sault to commit murder. The com
plainant was her father.
In the dining-room of the Beth horns
the two^women met. Anger and hatred
surged in both hearts and words were
as fragile as straws in settling the dif
ferences between them. No one wit
nessed the combat until its force* had
been spent and the two principals were
exhausted and making but a feeble ef
fort to continue it. While it lasted,
however. It was terrific, as the blood
spotted walls testified.

Colonel - Henrv Watterson of Â¦ Louis

part: . .
The editorial page is valuable In the degree
that It aids the reader to digest the news. It
should either bÂ« reformed or abandoned. Un
der a certain opell which has crept upon the
modern newspaper It is becoming, if it has not
already become,- a rather useless appendage â '
not even ornamental. I
Disinterestedness- being the soul, good humor
is the solar system of the editorial page, which
should be held subject to these precepts:
Write of a man nothing you would not say'
to his face and might not say in the hearing of
decent people. ' . . Â¦ â¢ Â¦ , ' ~ '-
..Avoid equally intimation . and Intimidation,
making no^ suggestion you are not prepared to
reduce to assertion and to sustain with proof.
The "leading article," being the rationale of
the most Important and interesting piece of the
day's news, should have a beginning, a middle
and an end; should be concise and Incisive,
seeking to assist tne reader, In hi* effort to
comprehend the situation.
| Satire should keep within the bounds of ' the j
probable; wit under the restraint of sense, and
even Invective â shorn of adjective and adverb. .
and stripped " to the waist â should strike out
from the shoulder to hit only above the belt. i
The pert paragraph should be allowed to die 1
a natural death: No flowers.
The editorial page thus conceived and exe- |
cuted. thu3 Inspired and partitioned, could not ;
fall to Impress Itself upon the thought of the

Following the Council o'f Ministers.
Foreign Minister Delcasse telegraphed
to M. Nisard. asking for full details Qf
the protest pent by the Pope to the
foreign powers. It Is expected that the
answer will Dermlt final action to be
taken on his recall within a day or
two.
PARIS. May 19.â The Council of Min
isters assembled in extraordinary ses
sion to-day to consider the action to
be taken relative to the Pope's protest
against President Loubefs visit to
Rome. As the version of the protest
forwarded to the governments having
relations with the Vatican differ from
that forwarded to the French Govern
ment, it was decided to first ascertain
definitely what representations thÂ«Â»
Vatican made to the foreign govern
ments. The Council also agreed on the
steps to be, taken when the exact char
acter of the protest is ascertained.
The recall of Nisard. the Embassador
of France to the Vatican, has been de
cided upon, if the authenticity of the
protest "forwarded to the foreign pow
ers is established. This practically aa
sures the Embassador's recall, as little
or no doubt exists relative to the pro
test. â¢ 'Â«
It is stated in official circles that the
recall of M. Nisard does not mean the
complete severance of diplomatic rela
tions with the Vatican, but the in
definite suspension of M. Nisard's ser
vice. Besides an Embassador, France
has a Minister at the Vatican. Count de
Navenne. who will continue to carry
out formal business.

At the conclusion of the address Sir

With there miraculous facilities, with this
unlimited power, comes also an enormoug re
epcnt=lbility In the face of God and man. I
am not here to preach to you a Bosnel whose
leÂ»;sons are known to you far better than to
me. I am not calling sinners to repentence,
but I am following a good tradition in stirring
up the pure minds of the righteous by way
of remembrance. It is well for us to reflect
on the' vast Import,' the endless chain cf' re
eulttt, of that globe-encircling speech you ad
dress each day to the world. Your winged
words have no fixed flight; like the lightning,
tlH-y traveree the ether according to laws of
their own. They lljrht in every clime; they
Influence i thousand different varieties of

Is It, then, that the sentiments they convey
st:r*uld be tho*? of good will rather than of
malevolence, those of national .concord rather
than of prejudice, those of peace rather than
ol hostility. The temptation to the contrary
Is almost irresistible. I acknowledge with
ccntrltlon how often I have fallen by the way.
It is far more amusing to attack than to
defend, to excite than to soothe. But the
highest victory of great power is that of self
restraint, and It would be a beneficent result
of this memorable meeting, thta ecumenical
ccundl of the pres?. If It taught us allâ the
brethren of thiÂ» mighty priesthood â that mu
tual knowledge of each other which should

and expression, and tend In some degree to

of President Roosevelt
Secretary Hay Delivers an
Afl-houeh I>pckstader*s destination is
rot knov.n it is presumed that he went
to Now York.
Dockstader with three friends quiet
ly came to town Wednesday and spent
the day preparing for the act they car
ried out this morning. Shortly after
the occurrence the whole party left for
parts unknown.
Major Sylvester. Chief of Police, sent
out . telegraphic inquiries toy several
â¢ Â¦lties this evening. among them
New York, and possibly Dockstad
*Â»r rnay have to make some ex
planations, although it is not thought
probable that any action will be taken
unless the pictures should be exhibited
with the statement that the man who
assisted the negro was actually the
President.
Buttons and photographs have been
freely circulated throughout the South
for the last few months representing
the President at the dinner table with
Booker T. Washington and also the
President and Mrs. Roosevelt dining
at the same board with a negro. On
this account it was easy for many to
believe the incident on the Capitol
plaza was intended to have the same
effect.
Urtanwhile the kinetoscope appa
ratus, which had been set up near the
Washington Ftatue, was working and
a mi.vins picture of the whole scene
was taken. In order to make sure of
the negative, the who!*- act was re
peated and thx-n the party drove away.
By the time the second picture was
niched a large crowd had gathered
about the scene and formed the neces
eaTy background.
The storv soon spread throughout
the city and many people, not know
ing that it was Dockstader himself,
imagined the act was intended to put
the President in the attitude of show
ing over politenÂ«*ss to a negro to em
phasize the Booker Washington dinner
incident for campaign purposes.
i It all occurred Just before S o'clock
this morning. The curtain rose on an
open barouche from which Lew Dock;
stader stepped and immediately fell to
the asphalt. Another open barouche
representing the White House car
riage, horses, coachman and . footman,
drove up and from it stepped a man
resembling Roosevelt. He was dresstd
*in a frt)ck coat and high hat, wore eye
glasses and was otherwise made up
to represent the chief executive. With
the aid Â«>f his footman he assisted
Doekstader into the 'White House" car
liace, tipped his hat to the minstrel,
off?mi him a cigar, and then drove off
with him.

ST. PAUL, Minn., May 19. â Mrs.
Stella Hammond of Seattle, Wash.,
dropped dead here at the home of her
sister, Mrs. J. N. Savard, after thÂ« lat
ter had undergone a dangerous opera
tion for cancer of the stomach. Mrs.
Hammond apparently was in good
health. The nervous strain of assist
ing at the operation is supposed to
have brought on a stroke of apoplexy.
The operation on Mrs. Savard, it is
said, was one of the most difficult In
surgical science and included a re
moval of a part of the patient's stom
ach. Five surgeons worked four
hours to perform the operation.

NEW YORK, May 19. â A piece of
slate pencil two and a half inches
long and sharpened .to a needle-like
point has been removed from the right
hand of Rosalie Layko, a nine-year
old Brooklyn schoolgirl. The pencil
had been working its way about the
child's body since January last, when
she swallowed it while at play. Ef
forts to remove it from her stomach
then proved of no avail and for sev
eral weeks she has complained of
pains in the side and shoulder. Fin
ally the object moved down through
her arm and caused the hand to swell.
The doctors were greatly astonished
upon applying the lancet and encoun
tering the hard piece of slate. They
say there is no record of so large a
substance passing through the human
body in a similar manner.

Two State tickets, the one headed by

vage a war that will not end until the
last vote is counted In November. Both
conventions were characterized by or

careful were the anti-third termers to
preserve the standing of Wisconsin in
the National Republican ranks that
they chose electors identical with those
'picked by the La Follette men. This

EUREKA LIBRARY.
The recent successful/ art and loan
exhibit given at the Santa Cruz Pub
lic Library reveals the hold secured by
this library upon the people of Santa
Cruz. They have always extended to
their library an unwavering and gen
erous support. When the $20,000 gift
was obtained from Mr. Carnegie it
became the ambition of the library
trustees, the librarian and architect to
produce the most convenient and ac
ceptable building that was possible.
More than sixty meetings of the li
brary board have been held, criticisms
of the building plans were freely asked
and given and the generous enthusi
asm of the public has lately provided
equipments and many beautiful orna
ments for the rooms. The site for the
building was purchased upon terms
which are easv for the board to meet:
$40 per month for ten years.
One of the libraries of San Fran
cisco of which the public hears but lit
tle, but whSch is accomplishing val
uable work, is that of the Academy of
Sciences. It is not a circulating library
and Its 12,000 volumes of scientific
works are purely for reference use.
They are in fourteen different lan
guages. Among: the publications may
be found the proceedings of most of
the important scientific societies of the
world. The majority of the patrons of
this library are instructors and pro
fessors.

The feeling of unrest found vent in
the introduction of a resolution pro
viding that the convention proceed to
the nomination of candidates for office
other than Governor, but the propo
sition was defeated. None of the
gubernatorial candidates wanted the
resolution to go through, and the candi
dates for minor offices were too timid
to insist upon it, fearing such action
would hurt their chances. The pro
longed fight is bearing heavily on the
men who want the smaller places._ All
of them have been maintaining head
quarters which cost them from $50 to
$100 a day. As the salaries of State
officers in Illinois are very small, even
the successful candidates will be behind
in a financial way when the convention
adjourns. Some of them closed their
headquarters to-day.
The ballots taken to-day were with
out change in the result. Sherman's
men continued to vote for Deneen
throughout the day, but he made no
further gains, and on the last ballot
to-night Sherman's men returned to
him.
The result of the last ballot taken
to-night, the fifty-seventh, was: Tates

burglary. Judge Wiest says that the

and is again convicted he may be sen

"Since Oliver was first sentenced in
1881," said the Judge, "he has been
under arrest more times than he can

of ridding society of just such men as
I consider Oliver to be."

The achievements of the Republican party

have made it world wide are the marvelous
business successes of this great nation of ours.
When the Republican party assumed control
of the affairs of the nation there was less mon

found In the banks of Sacramento to-day. Our
industries were paralyzed. A war was immi

Korean Government Annuls Timber
. Concessions on the Yalu.
SEOUL. May 19.â The Korean Gov

Yalu and Tumen rivers timber con
cessions granted in 1896. The Rus
sian companies Interested were backed
by BezobrarofT, the friend of Viceroy
Alexieff, and reputed moving spirit of
the Russian war party and many Rus
sian noblemen. There have been fre
quent differences between Russian
semi-official concerns and the private
Japanese lumbermen, which consti
tuted one of the annoyances which In
directly led to the war. Korea, in
several diplomatic relations with St.
Petersburg, has not felt bound to re
spect Russian commercial- contracts.
WASHINGTON, May 19.â Minister
Allen cables the State Department
from Seoul to-day as follows: â¢
"The Korean Government by an
Imperial decree Issued last night, has
annulled all treaties and agreements
with the Russian Government. This
annulment comprises the Yalu. timber
concessions."
This Yalu timber concession Is said
to have been one of the principal fac
tors In bringing about the present war.
So long 'as the Russians remained on
the western bank of the Yalu the Jap
anese, â¢ though very much discontented
at the failure to evacuate Manchuria
were not willing to plunge into hos
tilities, but the procurement by
Russia of a large concession of
land on the Korean . side of
the Yalu precipitated the crisis.

ber concession was really, intended for
military purposes, and they were con
firmed in their suspicion by Russian

WEIHAIWEI. May 20. â The British

Newchwang to protect British inter

The Russian statements in regard to
th> situation are absolutely unreliable.
Many Japanese spies are here or In
this neighborhood. One spy has been
executed. It is believed he was an
officer In the Japanese army.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 19. â The
Admiralty denies that it has been offi
cially advised of the" Japanese occupa
tion of Newchwang. The fact that
nothing has been received convinces
the Admiralty that a small Russian
force is still at Newchwang.
NEWCHWANG, Mav 19.â A courier
of the Associated Press, who arrived
here shortly before midnight, reports
that the Japanese fleet was sighted
from Tower Hill, ten miles north of
Kaiochau, on Monday. The bombard
ment of the coast was extensive, cov
ering a distance of twenty-five miles.
Only the Japanese marines, it was re
ported, were landed. This, however,
is not confirmed. The Japanese force
marched several miles inland, destroy
ed four miles of railroad and other
property, captured a Russian commis
sary train and returned with a number
of carts, animals and native drivers.
The Japanese then re-embarked and
left the vicinity of their landing place.
The transports shortly afterward could
not be seen from Tower Hill, but their
course was southward. It is believed
now that the landing was a feint to
cover movements elsewhere.
A regiment of Russian Infantry re
turned here yesterday afternoon. It
was reported at 10 o'clock last night
that batteries of artillery would readh

left here (though their personal bag

later and began directing the work of
building intrenchments a mile south
of here, but this task was abandoned

that the Russian authorities at Muk

which had been dismantled and loaded
with wood and oil In order to destroy
her, as well as two small river boats
I in the mud dock.
Japanese destroyers have laid many
mines outside Port Arthur, hoping to
catch the Russian destroyers in the
attempt to return to Port Arthur.
Many of these mines were improperly
anchored and are adrift. They are re
ported to be all over the gulf.
Refugees coming in say that the town
suffered no damage from the bombard
ment and that considerable land fight
ing Is going on to the north of Dalny.
Two Russian destroyers have escaped
from Port Arthur and are still at large.
The Russians are using Chinese junks
to place mines in the path of the Jap
anese fleet patrolling the peninsula
coast. The Japanese have sunk a tug
and several Junks that were discovered
placing mines.
The Russian Consul personally had a
telegram from Dalny saying that It
was rumored there that two Japanese
battleships had been sunk off Port Ar
thur.
. The battleship Fuji (not the cruiser
Asama), which struck the mine on the
port bow had a heavy list and also
was down by' the bow, but was righted
and went off in tow of two cruisers.
It is believed impossible. However, that
she could reach port.
The rumor at Dalny to the effect that
the Asama had sunk in Kerr Bay
probably refers to the sinking of the
steel cruiser Miyaka, which took place
there recently, through contact with a
submarine mine.
CHEFU. May 19.â Persons just ar
rived here from' Dalny have reported
to the Russian Consul that the Japan
ese battleship Shikishima sank within
two minutes after contact with the
submarine! mine and that there was
no time to save the crew. The accident
occurred, it is said, within sight of Port
Arthur.

It is to be noted that, besides

being no mention of a fog.

FULL EXTENT
OF DISASTER
IS IN DOUBT
The isolated Russian forces north

to Port Arthur and it is reported that
the Japanese are withdrawing from
the vicinity of Kaichau and are ad

and Liaoyang.
MIANDOHA (a station on the Man

for Mukden. Several officers of his
staff are under orders to proceed to
Mukden and Vladivostok, whither Ad
miral Skrydloff will follow.
The foggy weather prevailing at
Vladivostok will facilitate torpedo boat
operations and may cause the Japanese
to hesitate about loitering In the neigh

The task of safeguarding the rail
road against the constant and deter

Russian fleet. It has really lost only
one battleship, the Petropavlovsk. It
is true- that the Retviran and the Ce

towed Into Port Arthur. The damage
they sustained was serious, particu

The Cesnreviteh is still undergoing re

she can put to sea.
Prior to the isolation of Port Arthur
several thousand shipwrights entered
the city and they have since been rush
ing the work of repairing the ships.
The favorite point selected by the
Japanese for bombarding is Liaoshan
Promontory, and the water there has
been thickly sown with Russian mines.
Other points besido Liaoshan have been
mined, and it has become dangerous
for the Japanese ships to cruise in

PARIS. May 20.â The St. Peters
burg correspondent of the Echo de

"Itr is persistently rumored that ne
gotiations are going on with Germany,
the object of which is to effect a re
appfoachment and the reconstltutlon
of the triple alliance whereby Russia
would obtain Germany's diplomatic
support in a settlement of the Far
Eastern question. An understanding
with Germany would prevent British
intervention in favor of Japan and
Russia would, as an immediate pledge,
concede a settlement of pending eco
nomic and customs questions.
"The attempt to form a Russo.Ger
man entente is due to the Anglo-
French entente, which produced a de
plorable effect here. The Russians
consider that French official, if not
popular sympathy is not standing the
strain of the war and that it will make
possible a Russo-German entente re
stricted to a special point which will
not affect the Franco-Rus3ian alliance,
but must evidently wreck it.
"This news surely will be denied,
but I have reason to believe it well

nounced officially with a view to meet

Well, in every battleship, cruiser and
torpedo-boat there are tubes, like so
many large gun barrels, built into the
ship, some above, but mostly below the
water, and from these tubes the tor
pedoes are discharged at the enemy's
ship. A small charge of cordite or
compressed air, at a pressure of 500
pounds or more to the square inch,
shoots the torpedo out of the tube
along a guiding bar, which directs it
until well clear of the ship. When it
leaves the guiding bar the propellers
get to work and the projectile is off,
straight as a. bullet, to the target at
which it has been aimed.
The original Whitehead torpedo had
a speed of 'eight knots an hour and an
outside range of a quarter of a mile;
the torpedo of to-dayâ and I am de
scribing the very weapon the Japanese
are using with such deadly effectâ will
run as straight as, a dart for a mile
(thanks to the gyroscope) at a speed of
pretty well, forty miles an hour. It
can be aimed as accurately as a rifle,
and what is most wonderful is that it
can be adjusted from the conning tower
of a ship and discharged simply by
pressing an electric . key. , When the

'.'It's an ill wind that blows nobody
. any good." As far as Japan and Rus
sia- are away from Maine and the At
lantic coast, the war now going on
between them will affect that part of
the- country in no email degree, and
cause a scarcity of good steamers all
* along the coast. Calvin Austin of Bos
ton, the vice president and general
manager of the Eastern Steamship
Company, says: ; f:~~
"For some time past negotiations
have been under way between the
'Eastern Steamship Company and a Pa
cific concern for the purchase of the
"Fteamer St. Croix of the international
division of our service, but these have
not yet come to any conclusion. Now
the demands for boats on the Pacific
have become more urgent than ever
because of the war between Japan and
Russia.
"Every boat that can .possibly be
bought by these nations will be
snapped up for transports. No large
steamers will be left for freight and
passenger carrying on the Pacific, and
the heads of steamship . companies
there will then have to come to the
Atlantic to get steamers here. To sup
ply the demand for boats on the Pa
cific Coast the different companies on
this eide of the United States may be
called upon to supply the demand."

A farmer who drove into Iola, Kans.,
some time ago found all of the hitch

horse to an empty boxcar standing on
a sidetrack in an alley. A few minutes
later a switch engine coupled on to
the car and started up the alley. The
hltchstrap in this instance was a rope

neck. The horse did fairly well until
he encountered a telephone pole. The
buggy was demolished there. The en

A special to the- New York Sun from
South Bend, Ind., says: Because of an
experiment of Dr. J. W. Hill, one of
the well-known physicians and sur
geons of Indiana, in trying to prevent
infants born of negro parents from
turning dark in color soon after birth,
the attention of the scientific world it
Is expected will be fixed on South Bend
during the next few months. All ar
rangements have been completed for
Dr. Hill's experiment on the color
scheme of the human race. â¢
An expectant mother has consented
to act as the patient and will enter the
hospital as soon as the rooms are fin
ished in the manner necessary for the
scientific event. According to Dr. Hill
the negro's skin is more positive than
that of any other human being, and i
for that reason more pigment is thrown i
out to protect him under the climatic \
conditions in which his forefathers
were born, the intense heat of the trop
ics making this necessary.
By preventing pigmentation Dr. Hill
believes the child of negro parents,
which is generally born white, turning
dark under the sun's rays, will become'
even whiter than that of the Cauca-
Indiania Physician Will Try to Pre
vent Them From Turning

Section Is Very Slow hi Turning
Out the Finer Grade of
Goods.
The rapid growth of cotton manufac
turing in the South has become a
source of frequent comment, conclud
ing mostly with the remark that while
we are doing much and doing well in
this particular we should do more and
do better. In other words, intelligent
observers of the So'uth's progress ln
the turning of the staple into mer
chantable fabrics are struck with the
fact that, as yet, but few attempts
have been made to produce cotton
goods of the finer grades by Southern
j romoters of cotton manufacturing
plants.
Two-thirds of the South's crop of
cotton finds its way abroad, absorbed
as it is by nations that have learned
to convert a pound of raw material
Â¦worth 10 cents into a pound of finish
ed goods worth fifteen .times that
Â¦amount and over. France, for in-
Ftance, makes high-priced lace out of I
the product of our cotton field, while
Â¦Re are confining ourselves to the pro
duction of cheap, coarse fabrics. Other
rations have acquired the knack of
transforming it into expensive under
wear and hosiery for our consumption,
whereas we are lagging behind, appar
ently without ambition, to cover the
most profitable ground in the cotton
manufacturing field. ,
It may be objected that the South
Is not as yet prepared to compete in
the .manufacture of cotton goods of
the highest grade; that it must feel
It? way to the top of the ladder of
troduciion In this particular. Ad
mitting, for the sake of argument,
that there is something in this, there
is no good reason for not making a
. few steps into the domain of finer
manufacture as a beginning. No one
; will seriously contend that the South
is not ultimately destined to work up
the* bulk of its raw cotton. Why, then,
should there be further delay in the
promotion of industry in its higher
branches? â Houston Post.

LINERS ADDED
TO CZAR'S NAVY
NEW YORK, May 19. â An
nouncement was mude to-day of
the sale to the Russian Govern
ment by the Hamburg-Ameri
can Steamship Company of
three of its flnest steamships.
They are the Augusta Victoria,
the Columbia and the Puerst
Bismarck, the latter being a new
vessel.
It was reported. / several
months ago that the Russians
were negotiating for the pur
chase of a number of fast lin
ers, among them being the three
crack steamships of the Ham
burg-American line, the sale of
which is now de.nnltely an
nounced.
The vessels are large and
swift and will be valuable acqui
feltions to the sea forces of the
Czar when converted for use hi
the war with the Japanese. The
price at which the Hamburg-
American Company disposed of
the liners to the Russians was
not made public.
"It is the worst kind of war," says
the expert, "since it is cloaked by
hypocritical neutrality. Russia is now
warring in a hostile country.
St. Petersburg had a holiday to-day
in honor of the birthday of Emperor
Nicholas. The city was ablaze, with
color, the principal streets were "gayly
decorated, the street cars, displaying
flags, moved slowly on the Neysky and
other thoroughfares, the ships moored
in the sparkling Neva were dressed
and the churches were thronged during
the morning, with officials and other
persons offering prayers for the Em
peror and the success of the Russian
arms in the Far East. At noon the
fortress on the banks of the Neva fired
an imperial salute of 121 guns.
Peasants, in holiday attire, were
grouped at the street corners, studying
General Kuropatkin's bulletins report-
Ing that the, Japanese were falling
back, but the news apparently did not
occasion satisfaction, because it was
known, even to the lowliest, that Kur
opatkln would not strike, and that some
time must elapse before Russia could
make her might felt. Therefore, no
impatience was displayed at the failure
of the Russian commander in chief to
follow up his advantage. There was
only muttered approval of the policy
of waiting until the reinforcements, to
which the Emperor was bidding fare
well, reached Manchuria.
The military expert of the Novoe

with representatives' of the great
powers, laid particular emphasis- upon
the attitude of the Chinese. He re
ferred to the necessity for all the Gov
ernments continuing' the policy of con
stantly impressing Peking with the ad
visability of preserving strict neutral
ity. The Foreign Minister desires that
China shall not only be officially neu
tral, but that there shall be no Inter
ference on the part of her people, and
he believes the latter point can be as
sured if violations of the imperial
proclamations are swiftly punished.
The Minister has not forgotten the
suppineness of the Imperial Govern
ment in 1900, which permitted the
Boxer movement to spread until it Im
plicated the court and required inter
national intervention.
The views of the Russian Foreign
Minister are regarded as significant,
especially as they follow the renewed
assurances of the Chinese Minister.

Judge Waymire testified that the
claims, when he and Baggett bought
them in IS SO. were twenty years old.
They paid Castro Vallejo and Alviso
about $3000. From the Mexican Gov
ernment they m&naged to get $16,000
worth of bonds, -which were worth 11
cents on the dollar, and thev were
thus out J12S0 on the transaction.
The defense Alleges that Alviso. the
plaintiff, knows this." but uses the old
claim for the. purpose of other suits.
In 1SS9 he signed a receipt, for $45
for any claim he might have asainÂ«t
his brother Valentine.
OAKLAND, May 19. â From testi
mony Introduced to-day in the trial
of the suit of Jose Guadaiupe Alviso
against his brother, Valentine Alviso,
Judge James A. Way mire and W. T.
Bagsett. it appears that Jose Guada
iupe Alviso's pretended claim to an
interest in an old Mexican loan oi
â¢ 600.000 is worthless and has been
for twenty years. The statute of lim
itations bars the claim. Furthermore,
AlyfM sold all his interest in it to
Waymire and Bagsett and also a sec
ond time to his brother for a song. He.
however, has used the claim as a ba
sis for different civil actions during
the last fifteen years. .*

As a result of a strike yesterday
among the painters employed by Jabez
Swan, he has declared himself in favor
of the open shop and announced his
intention of maintaining one hereafter.
Delegates from the Painters* Union
yesterday called on Swan and demand
ed that he discharge a painter named
Brundage. Upon his refusal to do so,
the men in his shop were called out.
It is claimed that a similar order was
sent to men employed by Swan on out
side jobs, but they refused to strike.
The objection to Brundage Is said to
have developed out of a recent fight
in the Buildiag Trades Council between
him and P. H. McCarthy.

his arrest. He emphatically denied the
charge and said that Lartisis had been

One line has already been run from
Livermore. by the little settlement of
Dublin, through the Haywards Pass,
into Â¦ Castro Valley, up the Redwood
Canyon. Then it divides, one branch
going over the hills to Fruitvale and
thence to Oaklnnd. and the other run
ning to Walnut Creek and on toward
Sacramento.
Not satisfied with this line, one party
of surveyors is now at work in"* the
Xlles Canyon running a line from
Livermore to San Jose, parallel with
the line of the Southern Pacific Com
pany." Another party o\ surveyors has
run a line from Walnut Creek down the
San Pablo Creek Canyon to Point Rich
mond and is at present surveying in
that section. The third party la work
ing between Black Diamond on the
Sacramento River, and Sacramento.
Rumors In any quantity can be had
In regard ,to this road, but the fact re
mains that the .surveying: parties are
still In the field, and that they are still
working away in spite' of the stories
that the road has sold out."
One party Is working In Alameda
County In the Nlles Canyon. A second
party is on the bay shore in the neigh
borhood of Point Richmond and San
Pablo. The third party is working
along the Sacramento River from the
river shore near Black Diamond in
Contra Costa County north 'through
Solano County.
While these parties maintain ?silence
In regard to their objective points, it
is evident, from their line of work, that
they have not definitely decided upon
the details of their surveys. They are
working through every pass in the
hills and are running lines In every
direction.
Despite all stories to the contrary,
the surveyors of the Western Pacific
Hailroad are still working through Ala-r
meda and Contra Costa counties.
There are at present three surveying
parties for this railroad working
around the eastern bay shore, and none
of them has been called in.
Oakland Office Sari Francisco Call,

The Council to-night began its in
quiry into the value or tne plant of
the Contra Costa Water Company for
the purpose of fixing water rates. On
motion of President Dornin a commit
i.-.r of three was appointed to obtain
the services of two bankers from out
side the city of Oakland to give their
c-pinion of a fair rate of Interest to be
allowed the company. Chairman El
liott appointed upon this committee
Councilman Altken, Pendleton and
Meese. The work of checking up the
value of tools, offices, appliances .and
supplies was loft to City Engineer Tur
ner. On motion of President Dornin
it was decided to secure the service of
two competent real estate men to check
up the appraisement of the Contra Cos
ta Water Company's real estate. This
consists of about twenty-five different
pieces and is valued by the company
at approximately $125,000.
Th* cost of th<Â» construction of the
plant was then gone into, Consulting
Engineer A. L. Adams of the Contra
Costa Water Company answering the
questions put to him by the different
memtxTS ff the Council. This branch

his 5ide of the Storv.
D. B. Dias was another of those she
had mentioned in her letters as living
at the boarding .house at Ninth and
Center streets. She said Dias was
"her's." It was' discovered in the
cross-examination that she> had sent
him a pin cushion at Christmas in the
shape of a leg. Attorneys were curious
to know whv she should have sent
Dias the cushion.
She said she was nice to a Air de
Witt because he , would roll her baby
buggy. She denied that he had ever
spent any money on her. but thought
he was "easy."
Then there was a Mr. Aldrlch she
had written about. He .used to put
stamps on her letters. She said she
was merelv grateful to him for this.
The ghost of the letters could not be
driven away.
The letters written by Mrs. Florence
Richards to her friend Miss Annie
Fennlng, and which' are now figuring
prominently in the hearing of the
Hichards* divorce action, were the sub
ject of the entire day's investigation.
Explain how she would, the missives
which fell unopportunely into the
hands of her husband will not down,
and what she said about her male as
sociates has been the subject of ex
haustless inquiry.
In her letters she said she fancied
George D. Cotton, a yard foreman in
the employ of the Southern Pacific,
and when the attorneys seemed at all
short of questioning they made her tell
just what she meant by it. She said
that what she had written was in a
jocular strain and that It did not indi
cate that she would have done any
thing wrong in the pursuit of a harm
less flirtation.

SALT LAKE. May 19.â For fully a
quarter of an hour Dr. C. F. Wllcox.
City Health Commissioner, fought In
the dark for his life with a white bull
dogr last night. The encounter took
place on a short thorougnfare that i3
dark at night, there being no lights on
It. As Dr. WUcox was walking along
the sidewalk with his heavy walking
stick in his hand, he approached a
beam of light thrown across his path
from a lamp shining through an unob
structed window in a house standing
next to the home he was to visit. Just
as he reached the gate of the house
from which the light came a bulldog
seized him by the leg and threw him to
the ground. Knowing that a bulldog's
favorite hold is at the throat, the phy
sician threw up his left arm to pro
tect his throat. He had not thrown up
his heavily coated arm an instant too
soon, for the dog made a grab at his
throat, ripping the doctor's overcoat
from elbow to wrist. Then began a
fight for life.
Dr. Wilcox still retained his hold
upon his walking stick as he lay flat
upon the jrround with the dog on top
of him. With all his strength, and the
doctor Is a powerful man, he struck
the animal on the head. Over and
over they rolled, the dog biting the
physician, who was striking him with
his stick. Time and again the brute
barely missed seizing "Wilcox's throat.
At the end of about fifteen minutes
Dr. Wilcox was nearly exhausted. Re
alizing that he must make one more
attempt. Dr. Wilcox used his cane with
renewed vigor. The "blows delivered
with the force of despair had the de
sired effect. The bulldog finally gave
up the fight and retreated into the
darkness. When Dr. Wilcox reached
the home of his patient he was found
to be so seriously lacerated and bruised
that he had to be taken home in a
carriage. He is confined to his bed.
His clothes were in shreds. The dog.
when taken to the pound to-day to be
shot, was covered with welts and
bruises made by the cane, and his head
was one mass of cuts, the skull being
exposed in several places. .

Late Shipping Intelligence.
Leon Soeder, accused of the murder
of his . brother-in-law, .Joseph Blaise,
on the night of 10 of this year,
was called to the stand yesterday
morning. His examination was ex
tremely brief. General Salomon, his
chief counsel, gave as a reason for its
brevity that he did not wish to allow
the prosecution to disclose the former
character of his client.
Soeder made a good witness for him
self. He was not in any way nervous
and he answered all questions, in a
convincing manner.
"Did you murder your brother-in-law,
Joseph Blaise, on the night of January
10?" asked General Salomon.
"I never did it," exclaimed the de
fendant with a show of passion.
"Did you ever tell Cooper that you
murdered \ Blaise?" asked Salomon.
"I did not," said Soeder, positively.
On cross-examination by District At
torney Byington, the defendant gave
general denials to most of the questions
asked him and was never drawn into
a controversy. It was evident that he
was observing strictly the injunction
of his chief counselâ not to talk.
TESTIMONY EXCLUDED.
In rebuttal In the. afternoon Captain
Sullivan of the branch County Jail on
Broadway was called by the prosecu
tion to testify that Soeder personally
arranged the joint occupation of a cell
with Cooper, who testified that Soeder
had confessed â¢ to him regarding the
murder of Blaise. On objection to Sul
livan'B testimony Judge Cook ruled that
it was irrelevant.
Arthur Blake, an inmate of the Coun
ty Jail, was called by the defense to
testify to a conspiracy on the part of
Cooper and another prisoner to convict
Soeder and' thus escape punishment for
their own crimes.' Judge Cook held
that such testimony was not relevant
to the case.
At the conclusion of the testimony
R. Porter Ashe, who has ably assisted
District Attorney Byington in the trial
of Soeder, made the opening address to
the jury.
He covered the evidence fully and
dwelt strongly on the motive that im
pelled Soeder to commit the crime. His
peroration was a strong piece of ora
tory.'. : .
| Picturing a â¢ peasant who I was lured
to 1 California by promises of riches, he
dilated on the fact that these were the
men who drew from the/ earth ; ; their
productions and were the 'mainstay of
the State. Fervidly he pleaded for the
maintenance of national '. and , State
honor, In order that none should fear
a journey, to California, even though he
might come from across the seas. Such
men as Blaise, he, declared,- had made
the Golden State.
FOR HONOR OF THE . STATE.
Ashe said: that he believed that the
prosecution had shown that. Soeder had
murdered Blaise and had : proved thÂ©
crime as .far as the officers of the law
were able. Most strongly. he insisted
.. Major Zeph T. Hill, commanding
the military forces, decided on the pol
icy of registering all the 3000 idle
xnen fn the county in consequence of
a number of fires that have occurred
in the vicinity of strikers' camps.
TRINIDAD. Colo., May 19. â One
hundred striking union coal miners
â¢who refused to be registered by the
military authorities of Las Animas
County, which Is under martial law,
?vere brought to this city to-day as
military prisoners from the strikers*
rajnps near Ludlow. They were forced
tp march eighteen miles under cavalry
escort. As the county jail is already
;Xull a "bull pen" will be constructed
in. which the strikers will be herded.
Miners Are Imprisoned for Refusing
to Obey Orders of 31ilitary.
.The registration committee of the
Pacific Athletic Association met last
night to consider the bout between
Sam Berger and William Itodenbach.
The committee had such a bitter ex
perience over the last fight in which
Berger took part that the members
are throwing every possible safeguard
about the present affair. Thirteen hun
dren dollars vanished into thin air
after the last bout and its final resting
place was not traced.
There is a general desire that Wil
liam Greer Harrison be one of the
judges for this bout. President Hinch
man and Manager Coffroth will call
upon him to-day and will request him
to serve. Should he decline the regis
tration committee decided that the
two judges shall be chosen from Rob
ert McArthur, Phil Wand and E. J.
Smith. Eddie Graney will referee.

PRESIDENT HARRISON
ASKED TO ACT AS JUDGE
As ever, Mr. Mansfield commands the
utmost sympathy in the role. His
fashionable boredom is delicious, his in
solence exquisite. . With the lightest,
nay imperceptible touches, he suggests
again the sincerity, the real depth of
hip feeling for the city lass that the
Beau first woos for her gold. Incom
parable is the Chesterfieldian â nay, one
bogs the Beau's pardonâ the Brummel
way in which he informs himself that
he loves Mariana "madly." : And in
Calais, when foresaken by court-favor,
old, broken down, starving, Brummel
puts aside the girl's offer to marry him
as her father dictates and turns aside
to leave her In' her Jover's, arms, there
was a bit^oX acting that brought sud
den, biting tears to' the eyes. As fine
in its reserve, in its potent suggestion
was the death scene. But the whole
portrait â¢ was consistently delightful,
highest of high comedy.
In the support A. G. Andrews as the
valet and Miss Conquest as Mariana
were pleasantly prominent.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Beau Brummel, in Richard Mans
field's edition de luxe of the exquisite
at the Columbia, again set the mode
on the mall last night, again asked
Sheridan as the Prince of Wales cut
him: "Who is your fat friend?" again
died his gently ignoble death in Calais.
Perhaps Mr. Mansfield is never more
purely delightful than here. His op
portunity is an exquisite one, and he
takes exquisitely its every advantage.
I think it is his dignity of conviction
that makes the Beau plausible to-day.
Like most artistsâ he is the Watteau
of mannersâ he is -Ineradlcably con
vinced that the world owes him a liv
ing. JCot debts, but a breach of good
form, Is disgrace. To pay was Impru
dent, to lend imperative. Duns were
unpleasant people of bad manners.
Product of a time when business was
the unforgivable sin, the Beau Is, In
short, the perfect parasite. And he be
lieves so thoroughly in his right so to
be. He is so amiably convinced that his
part in life is simply to set the fashion.
He so graciously, so earnestly, with a
so utterly fine conscience lives up to
his ideal, that one comes at last to
take him at his own valuation.
One feels the fine manners are deeper
than skin deep, a habit of gentle and
courteous thought. . Even, when to re
pair his damaged fortunes he seeks the
hand of a wealthy merchant's daugh
ter, one sees the action only as a
vaguely noble sacrifice to his religion
of the mode. And when, a parasite with
a dependent parasite, we find him
starving t# death in a garret rather
than soil his fingers with work, he
seems still lovably and pathetically
credible. >K'S : :

the unavenged murder of Blaise would
ruin the fair name of California as a
law abiding State and give to the
world the . impression that murder

YOSEMITE
APRIL-MAYÂ« JUNE
"In ths spring, after all the avalanches are down and the snow is
melting fast, it is glorious to hear the streams sing out in the moun-
tains." â John Muir's Description of Yoscmite Valley 1
â¢ ''-'â¢*, f.
YOSEMITE is thrice beautiful in the early year. The
clear, cool air imparts vigor and life to plants and trees.
Great rocks, clean washed and fresh, are still snow-
covered in the higher reaches. And the thundering falls, in
full volume and grandeur, are pouring over their precipitous
cliffs as at no other time.
Those who have learned the secret make their pilgrimage
early. They enter the Valley at the awakening time and are
themselves awakened. Later, they come back, with shining
eyes filled with that inspiration which Nature alone can give.
The road into Yosemite from Merced passes through
historic gold-diggings, groves of Big Trees, beautiful
forests of pine and balsam, and so on up to the Valley along the
same way the river comes down: There are many wonderful
sights on the way, but all the merest introduction to a single
glimpse of even a part of the transcendently wonderful sight
beyond.
Yosemite is easily visited from San Francisco. $49.00
will cover a ten days' trip. The round trip fare is $28.50.
Information as to. stages, accommodations in the Valley,
what to wear and: probable expenses, may be had at the

PRAGERSTHE comprehensive review of crop conditions in all
parts of the State, collected and published by The
Call, shows a gratifying promise of. a full year.
These reports are not hearsay matters, but are gathered
at first hands by this paper. â¢ To the reader outside of
the State they present, the great and interesting variety
of the products of the soil made possible here by our
climatic conditions. In the same counties we can re
port the condition of oranges and lemons, pears, peaches,
grapes and all deciduous fruits; of wheat, rye, oats, bar-
Icy, sugar beets, olives, figs, alfalfa, almonds and wal
nuts. .\*.'^
It will be seen that while in one county some kind of
fruit' is a light crop in another it is heavy. Where
grain is light hay is heavy, and so on. to the end of the
list. This means a full year for the whole State. There
is a prospect -of good prices and an .absorptive market.
Air crops are well past any possible accident, and the
fruit harvest -is already on. - The cherries and apricots
THE STATE'S CROPS.
An Easy Rescue.
A story is told in the Youth's Com
panion of an old seaman on one of the
United States cruisers in the North At
lantic squadron. He was not a person
of wide affectations, but he had a warm
place in/ his heart for a young ensign
who had been kind to him in many lit
tle ways.
One day a landsman fell from the
rigging to the water, and as he could
not swim he would have been drowned
but for a young officer who sprang in
after him and held him up till assist
ance came.
Later thÂ» young officer received a
complimentary letter from the Secre
tary of the Navy. Every one rejoiced
but the old seaman; he coveted the let
ter for his ensign.
"That's a nice thing to have, a letter
like that," he said a few days later.
"You ought to have one."
"I don't quite eee how I can get one,"
laughed the ensign.
"Well, see here," said the old man
eagerly. "*To-morrow night I'll be In
the main chains, fussing with some
thing or other, and I might fall in, and
you could jump after me."
. "That would be very good of you,"
said the ensign, gravely, "but, you see,
I'm not a good swimmer by any
means.*
"Ho! That's no matter," said the old
seaman. "I'll hold you up till the boat
comes.*
In 18 S3 a great disaster befell the
islander*. Fifteen- men. comprising
nearly the whole adult male popula
tion, were lost in a boat that left the
island to board a passing vessel, mak
ing of Tristan, as one of the survivors
expressed it, "an island of widows and
children." But the women an Ct the
boys and girls had been trained ilTthe
rugged school of self-help and ".instead
of abandoning themselves to weeping
and moping they set to work to make
the best of the situation and with the
aid of tsome supplies from the British
Government stuck it out, triumphing
of the little community so remark
able (or does it really furnish one ex
planation of it?) is the fact that the
original stock was by no means
"picked" as is the case with many
more ambitious attempts to establish
ideal colonies which have signally
failed. The male progenitors were
just plain, ordinary, rough and ready
men. the nationalities represented
among them being Scotch, Irish, Eng
lish and Dutch. They married col
ored women, one being of African
birth and three others Asiatics. But
in their descendants there are little
signs of the "tar brush."
Tristan da Cuhna was discovered in
1506 by the Portuguese navigator
Â¦whose name it bears. Great Britain
took possession of it some three hun
dred years later and while Napoleon
was imprisoned on St. Helena, 1300
miles distant, placed a detachment of
British soldiers there as a sort of out
post garrison. On the death of Na
poleon in 1S21 the soldiers were with
drawn, but a certain Corporal Glass
with his wife and family and a few
other men were allowed to remain. In
IS 3 3 the population numbered forty
souls and in 1652 had risen to eighty
Â«ve. In the course of the next two
decades twenty-five left the island for
the United States and forty-five mi
grated to the Cape, reducing the num
ber of those remaining on the island
to thirty-six. An enumeration made
in 1SS0 showed 109 living there and
these figures have remained the high
water mark of population. There have
been two violent deaths, but they were
cases of suicide due to mental de
rangement.
What makes the high moral record
The outsider who recently visited this
later day Arcadia did so for the pur
pose of finding out' whether its inhab
itants really wanted to leave it. Tris
tan da Cuhna belongs to England, and
in January, 1903. a British man of war
called at the island and afterward re
ported that most of the people were
weary of their life of isolation and
wanted to get away from" the place.
So the Government of Cape Colony
Bent a representative to offer the isl
anders free transportation to that
country if they wished IU as well as
the means of making a new start in
life. But when the agent explained to
the folk of Tristan da Cuhna how dif
ferent the outside world was from their
island home the little community of
seventy-seven decided to let well
enough alone. And the visiting official
thinks they have acted wisely, for he
says that "having lost the instincts of
suspicion and circumspection they
would fare ill if set adrift in any civil
ized community where each man plays
a lone hand in the game of life and
cares little who loses so long as he
himself wins."
Just as there are no newspapers in
Tristan da Cuhna, no postofllces, no
churches and no schools there also are
no shops. The only time, in fact, when
the inhabitants think of anything like
bargaining is when they trade with ships
passing the island. Even then, how
ever, there iÂ« no competition among
them. All provisions or produce of
any kind supplied to ships are re
garded as the common property of the
community and the proceeds of their
sale in clothing or stores are dis
tributed equally among the several
households, the blowing of a horn
summoning a representative of each
family to the division. To make the
system work out fairly each family
takes its turn in supplying what a
nhip needs.

who- hold that money is the root of all

cantly enough, there also is no wrong
doing of any description. Wrote a re

would be useless, for there is nothing
to buy." And he continued. "Living in
honesty, sobriety and harmony, free
apparently from all crime, vice, dissen

of Tristan da Cuhna seem unconscious

themselves "beyond the reach of chi
canery and ordinary misfortune.' They
have no written laws. All being law
abiding, they need none, each doing
"what seemeth right in his own eyes.
They have no jail. Crime among them
being unknown, such an institution
would be a superfluity. They have no
form of government and pay no taxes.
They enjoy perfect independence and
freedom, which never degenerates into
license. The community is absolutely
moral."

Justice of the Peace Lawson has had
a number of very peculiar experiences
since his election to the bench. He is
brimful of stories that serve to show
that the office of Justice of the Peace
is not a sinecure, and he can also tell
a number that show that at times the
office may be quite an easy place to
nil. Some of the latter also show that
a Justice of the Peace can be equally
"easy." This is his latest:
"Just after I had adjourned court the
other morning I went to my chambers
to do a little work. I found awaiting
me there a very handsome young
woman, stylishly dressed, and a young
man whose clothes indicated that he
was fairly well-to-do. He was also
good-looking and when he stepped for
ward. Introduced himself and asked me
to make the young lady his wife, I
cheerfully assented. They really did
look good to me. Well, to make a long
story short, I performed the ceremony,
gave them the usual good wishes and
the 'thank you' I gave the groom when
he handed me a sealed envelope con
taining something that weighed quite
heavy, was heartfelt. I dropped the en
velope on the desk. The sound It made
almost made me feel like saying 'thank
you' again, but I refrained and walked
to the door with them and ushered
them out. I gave them another bunch
of good wishes and then went over y>
my desk. Naturally the envelope at
tracted my eye, so I picked it up and
proceded to tear it open. I found five
dollars in silverâ but the dollars had
been made in Mexico."

A Bohemian Graft.
An action recently brought by the
Bohemian town of Deutsch-Landsberg
against the Bohemian provincial
authorities revealed the astonishing
fact that a tramp named Waselowsky
had been kept in the local prison for
three years while Inquiries as to his
Identity were being made.
In this country the parish authori
ties of the place where a man is born
are responsible for the cost of parochial
relief or imprisonment anywhere else.
Waselowsky presumably found the
prison at Deutsch-Landsberg to his
taste, refused all information as to his
origin, and was detained by the pa
rochial authorities for inquiries three
whole years without any result.
They now claimed, but unsuccessful
ly, the cost of his keep from the pro

'As the Registrar Sees Us.

call the man who came Just before the

qualify to vote for Schmitz for Presi

thinking that the Mayoralty candidate
.had higher aspirations than he was
credited with. Then again there was the
man who had landed here from a for
eign steamer only the day before and
wanted to vote right away. He was
sadly disappointed when told that he
would have to wait several years before
he could acquire the elective fran

"Yesterday a pompous individual ap
peared at the office and informed us In
a loud voice that he desired to get reg

that 'it was a shame to put a citizen
to all the trouble of coming out to the
City Hall and opined that the registra

manner as that of taking the school
census, that is, qualified deputies
should call at houses and register the
voters.
" 'Is this the place where I register?'
asked the aforesaid citizen.
" 'Well, the office Is right down stairs.

'The Innocents Abroad.' I read it night

the story himselfâ bought a copy of
Darwin's biography to learn what
might be said there about himself. The
only possible allusion to his works, he
says, was the statement that Darwin
in # his later years suffered from a spe

OUR city officials whose duty it is to keep a vigilant
eye upon the food offered for consumption in our
markets have inaugurated a crusade against impure
and adulterated milk which has an immediate- pertinence
to public health. Recently the Board of Supervisors
passed an ordinance raising the standard of butter fat
required in milk by fixing the percentage- at 3.3 from Jan
uary 1 to April 30, and 3.4 from May 1 to December 31.
More important still is the report that Health Officer
Ragan is preparing upon the unsanitary condition of
dairies and milk ranches from which the city's supply is
drawn. â¢ .
The recent disclosures of criminal fraud and negli
gence in the milk supply of Chicr.go should put us here
in San Francisco upon our guard- In that city it was
shown that the milk sold at exorbitant rates that made
it almost prohibitive to the poorer classes was of such
low grade of nutriment as to be no food at all. Compar
isons of the statistics of infant mortality in Chicago
with those of other cities of the East led to the discov
ery that many of the young in the tenements, whose
only food consisted of this diluted milk, actually starved
for want of proper nourishment.
By setting the standard of butter fat in milk offered
for consumption here in this city at the figures noted
the Board of Supervisors has done much to insure a
wholesome supply of the commodity. The dairymen's
plaint that the scarcity of feed in the winter months
prohibits the output of rich milk has been met by a
iower standard required for the first four months of the
3'ear by the ruling of the Supervisors, with a corre
spondingly higher percentage demanded during the
months of good feeding. No dairyman can justly cavil
at this last standard set for his goods, lower, indeed, than
that required in many Eastern cities.
In the matter of unsanitary sources of supply, to be
noted by Health Officer Ragan in his report, a danger
far more grave has to be met. "From my personal ob
servation," says Ragan, "I am constrained to say that
not one of the dairies is fulfilling the requirements de
manded by the sanitary laws. I venture to say that
there are no absolutely clean dairies within the city
limits^ notwithstanding the evidence before the Super
visors that some of them are models of cleanliness."
The officer goes on to show just how bad some of the
milk ranches are by reciting evidences of uncleanliness
which had come under his observation.
This city does not want a typhoid epidemic such as
devastated the town of Butler, Pennsylvania, on account
of its bad water, or Palo Alto through the contamination
spread by one vender of bad milk. The sale of diluted
or germ-laden milk is as criminal a proceeding as the
offer of tainted meat upon the market, and one calcu
lated to bring more widespread harm. The Board of
Supervisors should prosecute their precautionary meas
ures without cease until our milk is as pure and whole
some as the most exacting standards of health demand.

For many reasons it would seem to
be eminently desirable that the exist
ence of this inland Arcadia should be
perpetuated. As an object lesson In the
solution of some of the most vexed
problems of sociology, the little com
munity may some day be deemed
worthy of the study of some of our
learned professors who have evolved
various theories as to how the greatest
happiness may be attained by the
greatest number.
They have troubles of their own, like
all other peoples. The worst of them
came from the outside world. Over
two score vears ago a schooner was
wrecked on the island and a lot of rats
escaped from her to the shore, multi
plying so fast that they soon overran
the island, rendering the cultivation of
grain impossible and sweeping bare the
hillside where grew the Tussock grass
with which they used to thatch their
cottages. Now each householder has to
raise what he needs of It in a walled-
In inclosure_from which the rats can
be kept at bay. The rats are the curse
of the Msland. The Tristanites will
erect a monument to the memory of
anybody who will rid them of the pest.
Nature has been at no pains to pre
pare an earthly paradise on this lone
ly isle. Its remoteness from the world
of strife and unrest is what has con
tributed most to the establishment of
an Arcadia there. The island is a
vast volcanic cone almost 8000 feet in
height, which was hurled up out of
the sea aeons ago. The base is a
rough circle, the circumference of
which, something over twenty miles
in extent, is defined by steep clfffs
from 1000 to 2000 feet high. -On
Ihe northwest a plateau yonie
five miles long and about a mile
broad. Intervenes between these cliffs'
and the sea, and this also drops ab
ruptly about 100 feet to the actual
sea beach.^ It is on this low lying:
stretch of ground that the little com
munity dwells and cultivates what
crops they can obtain, mostly potatoes.
A copious stream "of fresh water
bursts out at the foot of the lofty
cliffs running across the northern end
cf the plateau and falling over the
lower cliffs Into the sea, making a pic
turesque cascade and a refreshing:

need replenishing. ;
Near this rivulet the fifteen or six

grouped. Some years ago a part of the
spring was diverted near Its source by
cutting a furrow, so that a tributary
stream now passes by the door of near
ly every one of the houses to reunite
Just above the cascade. The houses
are built of soft stone obtained from
the high slopes of the mountain,
dressed to flt so exactly that the
scanty mortar nsed is scarcely needed.
They are all built on substantially the
same plan, about thirty feet long and
ten broad, and onlv one storey in
height. One-half of each house is de
voted to the sitting room, with a large
fireplace and chimney in the gable,
the remainder being divided into two
or more smaller, rooms, with communi
cating passages. The wood used In the
partitions has been obtained from ships

IT is impossible to avoid notice of the contrasts be
tween the Republican and Democratic State conven
tions. At Santa Cruz the talk was all about the per
sonal ambitions of men. Oratory found its sole inspira
tion in the promotion of personal partisan interests.
The welfare of the people and the promotion of their
progress had no place in the speeches.
All around were the evidences of the thrift and enter
prise of the State. Plainly manifest everywhere were
the signs written by nature and enhanced by man, ex
pressing the greatness of achievement and the glory of
California. But .the Santa Cruz orators saw it all with
jaundiced eye, and their vision conjured evils where
none exist in order to give play to frothy denunciation
and make appeals to the spirit of class and faction. That
convention tramped around in a narrow circle, and was
not enlivened with a single great and unselfish utterance.
Its contests were to make good accumulated greeds and
grudges, and its most impassioned nights of speech
were indulged to glorify enmities or further the schemes
of selfish and unworthy ambition.
At the Republican Convention - in Sacramento there
was the same setting of the gifts of nature and the'
achievements of man, but how different the effect of
these and how different the expression of -purpose! The
speakers found their inspiration in the State, the prog
ress of its people, its material greatness and the prosper
ity of its cities. The Republican Convention from the
falling of the chairman's gavel resembled a meeting of
the representatives of the material interests whereon
the enterprise of the people is wrought, and upon which
they depend for the rewards of thrift which build their
homes, fill their tables and enlarge and refine their lives.
Among the delegates were the agriculturists and hor
ticulturists, the miners, dairymen, irrigators, shipbuilders,
merchants, bankers and business men of * California.
They honestly recognized a connection between politics
and the public welfare, between public policies and the
even-handed progress of the people. As all vocations
were represented, those who spoke for, them knew that
there can be no partial prosperity. To be real, prosper
ity must be general and within the reach of every man's
industry, thrift, temperance and genius. Representing
all the interests that make California what it is, the dele
gates stood for equality of opportunity, without chasing
after patent plans for making all men equal in their
capacity to use opportunity.
As might have been expected in an assembly so con
stituted, there was no bitterness of partisanship nor de
nial of patriotic motives to others. The chairman,
Judge Burnett, in his speech of acceptance said: "No
intelligent man believes and no honest man would assert
that the foundations of the Government are in danger or
the institutions of liberty imperiled. There are too
many honest, intelligent, liberty-loving, .God-fearing, law
respecting and patriotic citizens in both the political
parties to tolerate any policy that would jeopardize our
national integrity or break down the bulwarks of our
constitutional rights. We abate nothing of our admira
tion for the ability/honor and patriotism of thousands
of our political opponents, and pay willing tribute, to
the value erf their services in promoting the highest wel
fare of the nation; yet we declare that no other political
organization than the one we represent since the world
began has so thoroughly demonstrated its capacity to
administer in the highest degree of efficiency the affairs
of a great government."
There is the true note of Americanism. It is a poor
use to make of party spirit for one set of Americans to
charge their countrymen with the intention of destroying
the constitution and subverting liberty. The constructive
nature of the Republican motive never had better expres
sion than at Sacramento; while the opposite motive,
the destructive, aimed at the material interests of the
country, was voiced at Santa Cruz.
California is a microcosm of the whole country. The
Republican party has enacted the gold standard, made
our money the best and most plentiful in the world. It
has fought another successful war, and is bearing the
burdens that resulted in a spirit of philosophy and op
timism. It has made sure of accomplishment the world's
greatest work in the building of an isthmian canal. It
has entered world politics as the defender of justice,
the promoter of equal rights of commerce in Asia, the
protector of the integrity of China against selfish ag
pression, and has established the standard of fair play
wherever an American man-of-war can defend it or ah
American soldier fight for it. To say that all this has
been done without making some mistakes would be to
claim supernatural attributes for an organization of
mere men. But to say that it must be destroyed because
of those mistakes is like saying that the winds must not
blow nor the showers fall because gales sink some ships
and the rains cause some floods.
Perhaps there is no more prejudiced Democratic par
tisan in the country than Governor Garvin of Rhode
Island. But under the husk of his partisanship there
are some grains of American common sense. In a re
cent" address he said of President Roosevelt, after at
tacking by misrepresentation his foreign policy, charg
ing him with disregard of international law and with
ignorance of^political economy, that, "after all, the Presi
dent is really desirous of serving the people of the
United States." To this Governor Garvin added: "Presi
dent Roosevelt is the idol of that majority of the Re
publican party which at heart is Democratic."
That is merely one way of saying that at lieart the
people all have the same patriotic purpose, and the Pres
ident is as deserving of the support of Democrats as of
Republicans who can see the interests of their country
as paramount to mere party selfishness.
are going to market, and peaches and figs will follow
before the end of the month. Grapes will appear in
June, followed closely by melons, and the movement will
be ceaseless until oranges meet cherries again next year.
Our . reports of crop conditions will be found good
matter to send to Eastern people. They are still buffeted
between winter and spring, and have suffered from frosts
that have cut off the fruit and early vegetables. This
puts them in a condition to long for a State where the
wheat is in head, the oranges in bloom and the cherries
ripe, and where strawberries and shad are on the table
eleven months in the year. They want to know about
a country where* January and June are much alike, and
the land yields four and a half tons of sugar to the
acre, and men can grow their own wine and oil, and en
joy both under their own vine and fig tree. They will
note that on the day we publish these reports Boston
had a temperature of 52, with an east wind; Cincinnati
48, Washington 58. That is cold for the East. Here we
were enjoying a summer temperature and eating cher
ries, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries and apricots,
with no frost bites to doctor and no chilblains to swear
about.

men of Charge of Dispos

The Board of Public Works is wroth
over a communication received yester
d'ay from Health Officer Ragan to the
effect that certain employes of the
board named have sold sand and
gravel belonging to the city.
. The charge is groundless, as ascer
tained after investigation. Ragan's
letter follows:
Complaint has beÂ«Â»n made to thiÂ« department
that employe* of the Board of Public Works
are eelling to private parties the sand and
pravel that are taken from the tsewer on
Division ptre^t. between Flrfenth and Seven

SUPERVISORS' FIXANCE
COMMITTEE SAYS XO
Refuses to Appropriate Money to Aid
in the Proposed Reception to
Philippine Commissioners.
The members of the Supervisors'
Finance Committee held a conference
yesterday in the Mayor's office with
George A. Newhall, J. H. Scott* and
Frank Symmes representing various
commercial organizations relative to
the proposed recc-tion to be tendered
the Philippine Commissioners upon
their arrival here next month. It
was desired that the city appropriate
$1000 and another $1000 be raised by
subscription. The Finance Committee,
however, did not consider it good policy
to appropriate money for such a pur
pose, as it would establish a precedent
for future affairs of the kind. The
committee refused to make the appro
priation and the conference ended.
the Bureau of Streets, which directed
Inspector Brandon to investigate.
Brandon filed a report that all gravel
from the sewer described was removed
to the Sixteenth street corporation
yard. Workmen labored 53 days re
moving 144 loads of gravel and all was
duly accounted for. The only feature
that might have caused the complaint
was that the keeper of the corporation
yard loaned one load of the gravel to
C. S. Harney, a contractor, to start a
paving job.
The beard consented to the transfer
of a portion of the school lot on Ken
tucky and Twentieth streets to the Fire
Department for an engine house site.
Leaves of absence were granted to
Misses Belle M. Stanford, Rebecca Ja
cobs, Mirma A. Steele and N. F. Sulli
van, with the right to their respective
schools on their return.
Professor Espina, who was delegated
to submit an improved medial system
of handwriting for the schools, re
ported that he had visited 117 classes
and found the writing in general very
unsatisfactory. With few exceptions,
both teachers and pupils welcome the
change from the vertical to the slant
and the interest in the subject is grati
fying. Many of the teachers are both
capable and talented and will become
valuable assistants in remedying the
injury caused by the vertical system.
Thirty-three applications, were re
ceived from those desiring, to take the
teachers' examination on June 11.
Demands aggregating $4S99 05 were
ordered paid to school census marshals.
The Board of Education yesterday
adopted a resolution requesting the
Board of Works, through the City
Architect, to prepare plans and esti
mates of cost for constructing neces
sary additions to the Hamilton, Mis
sion and Lafayette school buildings.
It is proposed to build another wing
on the westerly wing of the Hamilton
school containing three rooms, a wing
of six rooms on the Mission Grammar
School and four additional rooms on
the Lafayette school. This will do
away with necessity of renting outside
rooms.
Thirteen More Rooms Will lie Added

DIES ON THE SIDEWALK.â A. Obujen,
proprietor of a restaurant at 1W7-1649 Devlsa
dero street, died suddenly yesterday morning
at 5:50 o'clock while on his way from his
home, 916% Vallejo street. He nai taken sick
in a street car and was removed by Policeman
King from the car to the sidewalk In front of
102414 Washington street, where he expired.
Heart failure Is ascribed as the cause.
The committee will sit again this
morning, when the Fire Commissioners
will again be heard.
The Park Commission, represented by
Commissioners Lloyd and Sullivan, oc
cupied the afternoon session. Lloyd
made an interesting and eloquent ap
peal asking that every cent allowable
by the charter be given to the Park
Commissioners. He reported the work
accomplished by the Commission this
year.
Fire Commissioners J. S. Parry and
J. G. Boyne occupied the next hour of
the morning's session. Parry talked to
the committee on behalf of his depart
ment, urging a large appropriation. He
argued that two new fire houses must
be built Immediately in order to give
the city a proper protection from fire.
One of the houses, should the appro
priation permit, will be immediately
installed in the Richmond district. Par
ry further asked for enough money to
employ thirty mere men. This would
enable the firemen to work six days in
the week instead of seven. Parry said
that the amount needed for the extra
men would be $7500.
Brandenstein and d'Ancona simul
taneously spoke up asking what was
done with the $7500 given the Commis
sioners last year for that purpose. Par
ry replied that the money was spent in
keeping additional watchmen at the
different theaters and playhouses at
the time following the Chicago disaster.
Chief Hewitt of the Department of
Electricity was asked by the commit
tee as to the number of feet of wire
ncrw laid underground; when it was
laid; how much money was expended;
how much wire still remained over
head and how long it would be neces
sary for him to complete the work of
taking down the overhead wires. Hew
itt was decidedly non-committal. He
was questioned for^an hour and fifteen
minutes, and during that time answer
ed one question, saying that he was
not through with his work. He was
dismissed with considerable laughter
and a second attempt will be made on
him this morning. Several of the Su
pervisors said after the meeting that
Hewitt was a good man in his office,
but not the best financier in the world
nor satisfactory in answering ques
tions.
Yesterday morning Superintendent
Lewis of the Boys' and Girls' Aid So
ciety informed the Finance Committee
of the Board of Supervisors of the
amount of money needed to properly
carry that institution over the follow
ing fiscal year. Lewis asked for $10,
000, or $2500 more than was allowed last
year to the combined non-sectarian in
stitutions of the kind in the city. The
matter was taken under advisement.
The Board of Works was requested
to prevent the sweeping of streets in
an unsanitary manner and that the
contractors be compelled to use water
to allay the dust.
The Finance Commitee was requested
to add $10 monthly to the salary of
Chief Steward Bucher.
Dr. C. L. Gregory was appointed
Volunteer School Inspecting- Physician
for the Edison School in place of Dr.
F. C. Keck, granted a leave of absence.
The Board of Supervisors was re
quested to pass an ordinance making
it unlawful to beat carpets or rugs on
the public streets, as the same Is a
menace to public health.
Drs. Harvey and Poheim were ap
pointed a committee to investigate and
report on the affairs of the City Hospi
tal and associated institutions.
The request of the wholesale fish
dealers that the hour for removal of
garbage from their premises be
changed from 5 to 3 p. m., was referred
to the Health Officer for report.
Dr. E. Schmool was appointed In
structor of Clinical Medicine at the
City Hospital.
The Excelsior Homestead Association
called attention to the need of a sewer
in the district east of Mission road from
Silver to Amazon avenues, and the
Health Officer was directed to In
vestigate.
Amy A. Hart was appointed night
superintendent of nurses at the City
Hospital.
A letter was ordered sent to those
persons maintaining maternity homes,
foundling asylums and baby farms, in
structing them to secure a permit from
the Health Board.
SWEEPING OP STREETS.
"This condition in other counties,"
said Dr. Ward, "may be met by con
demning the milk that comes from
there and is sold in this city. The
committee will take steps in that
direction in connection with its pro
posed crusade." .
The appointment of Dr. J. I. Stephen
as Chief Emergency Surgeon was rati
fied by formal resolution of the board.
The Supervisors will be asked . to
appropriate $4200 yearly for transpor
tation of four plumbing inspectors, two
disinfectors, one bakery inspector, two
dairy inspectors and one chief food
inspector.
I would also Insist that besides the arrests
which would follow a violation of our require
ments that a bulletin of the condition of all
the dairies supplying milk to San Francisco be
publicly exposed In the Hoard of Health rooms,
no that- Information Â°* n *â¢* BÂ»ven to the public
regarding the condition of the different dairies.
I would also suggent that the report be given
monthly at each meeting of the .Board of
Health so that the press may give publicity
to this and. further. I suggest that the reports
of the sanitation and conluc: of dairies be pub
lished In our Monthly Bulletin.
I am sure that the Insuguratlon of such a
movement would result In wholesome good. At
the next meeting of the board I will furnish a
system of rules to be adopted by your board
and which will form ' a 'groundwork of a pro
posed ordinance to be Â«ubmltted to the 'Board of
Supervisors.
There are consumed by the public In our city
some 80,000 gallons of milk per day, only one
third of which, say about 20.000 or 30,000 gal
lons, comes from dairies within our county^ so
that we face the problem of dealing with the
milk supply outside our city and county. My
Information about dairies In the adjacent coun
ties leads me to believe that similar condi
tions as I have described above exist In these
dairies also, with but few exceptions.. To bring
these outside dairies with our own dairies un
der the surveillance of the Health Department
I would euggest an Increase In the corps of
milk inspectors, so that we can have an accu
rate history of the condition and conduct of all
dairies supplying milk to the public of our city.
I suggest that this can be conducted without
the cost of a Bingle dollar to the public of San
Francisco by Imposing a email tax upon each
gallon of milk sold In the city.
TO GIVE PUBLICITY.
There Is not within the city and county of
San Franclscd a single dairy conducted on sani
tary or hygienic principles. The gospel of
cleanliness has not been preached, ncr are Its
precepts practiced in any dairy; but the reign
of filth flourishes throughout our dairy system.
The dairy barns are as a rule dilapidated
shacks, Illy constructed and totally Inadequate
to carry out the simple principles of cleanness.
The floors are filthy, covered with the lncrusted
accumulations of months and even years. The
walls and Joi6ts which constitute the celling
are begrimed and covered .with layers of dirt,
cobwebs, etc.
NO SANITARY DAIRIES..
I regret to srlve publicity to the report that
the dairies are In' a very unsanitary condition,
and drastic measures should be employed by
the board to remedy the existing evil. Pub
licity Is riecesfmry to brlngr the dairymen to a
proper realization of their duties to the public
and to place before the public the facts con
nected with the dairy industry In the city and
county. This report Is not In the nature of a
oensaticn. Is not distorted or unduly colored,
but ie the result of an earnest, unbiased and
careful examination of the different dairies.
Health Officer Ragan yesterday
formally filed his report relative to his
inspection of dairies, which he found
in an unsanitary condition, with the
Board of Health. So bad are the
conditions as reported by Dr. Ra
gan and Drs. Harvey and Hughes,
members of the board, were appointed
a committee to inaugurate a crusade
against such dairies and to take steps
as they may deem necessary to compel
them to be placed in sanitary condition.
Dr. Ward, president of the board,
declared that the only way to force
owners of dairies to keep them clean
was to publish their names broadcast
when they did not fulfill sanitary re
quirements, as a warning to the public
whom it is desired to protect. Dr.
Ragan's report follows:
Gossip was rife around the City Hall
yesterday relative to the probable
successor to Commissioner of Public
Works Woodward, who will resign his
office to-day to assume that of City
Engineer, to which he has already
been appointed.
It was stated by the wise ones that
Frank Maestretti, at present FirÂ«
Commissioner, will be promoted to the
position of Works Commissioner.
When Mayor Schmitz was asked about
the rumor he was non-committal and
said that he had not taken up the
matter and would not make the ap
pointment until next Monday. His
Honor further stated that neither
Maestretti nor any one else had been
considered for appointment.
. The rumor, however, would not
down, notwithstanding the Mayor's
declaration. The wise ones went so
far as to predict that John Daughney
would take Maestretti's place when
the latter is promoted. They base
their conclusions on the fact that up
to the last monent Daughney was to
have gone on the Fire Commission last
January. â¢
Daughney, however, had to give way
to Boyne, but refused to accept a
place on the Election Commission in
stead. Daughney was promised at the
time that he would be taken care of
an 'I if Maestretti is put on the Biard
of Works the promise will in all like
lihood be kept and the Mayor's polit
ical obligation to him may thus be
fulfilled.
Another man who stands a koo.1
chance of appointment as Works
Commissioner should Maestretti not
secure the plum is Jeremiah DlneÂ«Â»n,
a retired contractor and a warm per
sonal friend of the Mayor.

Most folk who-eat
" FORCE " think it tastes
the best of all breakfast
foods. They say, "It goes
right to the spot."
That's because Nature
is on the spot. She knows
at the first taste what she
can make the best blood,

Â¦ Young women may avoid much sick- .1
ness and pain, says Miss Alma Pratt, if
they will only have faith in the use of
Lydia K Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
' "Deab Mrs. PrxKHAM : â I feel it my duty to tell all young women
how much Lydia E. Pinkhani'a wonderful Vegetable Compound has
done for me. I was completely run down, unable to attend school, and
iiid not care for any kind of society, but now I feel like a new person,
and have gained seven pounds of flesh in three months.
" I recommend it to all young women who suffer from female Wftak-
Dess."-â Miss Alsia Pbatt, Holly, Mich.
FREE 3IEDICAI, ADVICE TO YOUNG GIRLS/
All younjr jrirls at this period of life are earnestly invited to
Trrite Mrs. Pinkham for advice; she has guided in a motherly way-
hundreds of young women; her advice is freely and cheerfully
(given, and her address is Lynn, Mass.
Judging 1 from the letters she is receiving from so many young 1 girls Mrs.
Pinkham believes that our girls are often pushed altogether too near the
limit of their endurance nowadays in our public schools and seminaries.
. . Nothing is allowed to interfere "with studies, the girl must be pushed to
the front and graduated with honor ; often physical collapse follows, and ;Lt
takes years to recover the lost vitality, â often it is never recovered.
A Young Chicago Girl Saved from Despair.
"Deab Mrs. Pinkiiam: â I wish to thank you for the help and ben-
efit I have received through the use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound and Liver Pills. When I was about seventeen
â¢ vears Â°*d I suddenly seemed to lose my usual good
' 'vZ^Z&g^g^*^^ health and vitality. Father said I studied too
hard, but the doctor thought different and
fflraÂ£sfg|Â§^Â§iÂ§ggBÂ£^ prescribed tonics, which I took by the
â¢ Quart without relief Reading one day in
THf^^^^^^^^^y^raftC^ the paper of Mrs. Pinkham's great cures,
\^^^W j&k and finding the symptoms described an-
. ) S* swered mine, I decided I would give Lydia
/ llf^&ssirazTH E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound a
Â¦ V^ triaL I did not say a word to the doctor;
4 fcA? 7 * .â¢''flalsiiSr bought it myself, and took it according
H&SL Xrf-^^Ms&^i to directions "regularly for two months,
!BliS8W^5i??Â»@i^r and * * oun(1 that I gradually improved,
V Â»v>v^ ri*. an< * l^ afc a^ P 11 " 13 * e * L me ' anc * I, was m y
ifM\V^ ly fjr old self once more. â Lili.ie E. Sinclair,
* f 17 K 22d St*, Chicago I1L"
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is the one sure rem-
edy to be relied upon at this important period in a young girl's
life ; with it she can go through with courage and safety the work
she must accomplish, and fortify her physical well being so that
her future life may be insured against sickness and suffering.

A XOSE IX LATOXIA DERBY
YACHT DETROIT. WITH WHICH
f , SAN DIEX3O SPORTSMEN BX-
I PECT TO WIN LIPTON CUP.
SAN DIEGO, May 19.â Somewhere
along the line of the Santa Fe railroad,
between this city and the metropolis
of the lakes, is the craft on which the
yachtsmen of\this city pin their hope
that they will be able to keep the Lip
ton cup in San Diego. It is In the
possession of the Corinthian Yacht
Club of thie city in trust for the suc
cessful yacht of the thirty-foot class,
owned on the Pacific Coast, which shall
prove a winner in two of the three
races to be held off the mouth of the
harbor on the 13th, 15th, and 16th of
August next.
The Detroit, which is being brought
across the continent to race for the
beautiful cup, was built by the Michi
gan Yacht and Power Company for a
syndicate of Detroit .yachtsmen. They
wanted a vessel to represent that city
in 1 the competition for the honor of de
fending Canada's cup, which has been
won by the yacht Genesee of Roches
ter, New York, and held by the Chi
cago Yacht Club, under .whose auspi
ces the Genesee went over, to Toronto
and won the cup the year- before.
There were nine In the competition, all
of .which were built that year for the
express" purpose of competing for the
honor. The' judges took time to decide
and for two days debated as tÂ« whether
the Detroit or the Cadillac should be
the defender, finally fixing upon the
latter by a close vote.
At that time the Detroit had never
been even tried out, having been ship
ped from Detroit to Chicago within a
few days of the time she was turned
over to the syndicate rrom the hands
of the builders. Since that time the
Detroit and the Cadillac have had
many races and in many close contests
tried to settle the supremacy of the
lakes for boats of that class, but found
that they could not determine it- They
were planning for another season of
trials this year, had not the Detroit
been sold to come to California.
Yacht Detroit Is on. the
, , Rail En Route to
San Diego.
Mr. Jeunness had retired on his la.u- j
rels as an umpire and the. players wise- |
ly refrained from questioning the. de- i
clsions of Jim McDonald. >'. The absence
of Jud Smith, too, perhaps contributed
to the Sunday school aspect of the aft
ernoon, that gentleman having con
cluded to nurse some physical ailment.
Whether or not his bellicose disposl^"
tion was under treatment. could not be
gleaned from ; the bulletin issued by
Dr. Newton. Â¦ . 'â¢/Â¦.'. ...
Oscar Graham, the .erstwhile blonde
pltcher # of the quasi-locals, furnished
the only mild sensation of the day.
Oscar appeared in ; the slab' disguised
as a decided brunette, to the bewilder
ment qf some of. his admirers. "Phe ex
planation furnished by Pete Lbhman
was that Graham' had recentlv met a
strange colored . barber and that his
hair had turned black in a single night.
Oakland got a slight grip on the lead
in the fifth,, after tielng the score in
the previous inning, and held the head
of the Darade until the eighth, when
the struggle took on- a citrus tinge.
Graham up to this period had been
holding down the Angels effectively,
but the eunning^went out of his curves
after Ross had been given a walk.
Chase ; swatted th'e sphere with a
forceful swing and when the outfield
ers in center territory had finished
theii* romp he. was puffing on third.
Spies lifted -the ball over second
among. a. bunch of fielders who got tan
gled up in "the confusion of orders
shouted at them, and the leather
dropped into the grass.
Two runs in and Hank at second.
Hall made It three for the inning by
punching a straight one to left field
for two bases.
There was a brief period of suspense
in the last of the ninth, when a hit
meant two runs and a tied score for
Oakland, Francks having singled and
Schlafly doubled. Devereaux was
given the opportunity to distinguish
himself, hut he went up into the air.
The score:

Peaceful as a ladles' tennis tourna

ball diamond yesterday afternoon/ and
the contrast to the previous day was
like unto that between a mill pond" and
a troubled sea. t ... â¢ Â¦Â¦'/
The latter has done all that has been
asked of him, but his work does not
blur the impressive showing made by
Canole when he fought here last win
ter. The prediction is freely made that
before the end of next year he will bo
the champion lightweight.
The contest will be interesting in
many respects and -that it will attract
a big crowd is evident from the large
numDer of seats already sold. It will
be interesting first because the result
will establish a man who is apt to be
the champion lightweight some day
and then it will show the great differ
ence in the styles of*he distinct "classes
of pugilists, the boxer "and the fighter.
It should result in a good battle.
Canole's cleverness will be pitted
against the gameness and strength and
hitting powers of Nelson. The weigh
ing in will be done at 3 o'clock this
afternoon, the men^meetlng at Greg
gains' place shortly'before that time.
Jack Welch has been selected to ref
eree the contest and his selection meets
with the approval of the public who
bet their money on boxing contests.
Welch's decisions have always been
fair and impartial. The contestants
and their representatives had several
conferences over the referee question,
neither side caring to accept any one
but a fair, honest official. After the
names of Eddie Graney, Arthur Eck
art, Phil Wand, Eddie Smith and Billy
Roche had been discussed It was final
ly decided that Welch would be ac
ceptable to both sides and to the pub
lic as well.
It is the general impression that Nel
son Vr ill surprise a good many people
in this contest. It is being whispered
about that he is being underrated by
Canole and his people and that he will
not only beat the latter, but that he
will do it decisively. Nel3on will have
to be all that is claimed of him to
beat Canole.
The betting public cannot get away
from class and. apparently figuring
that Canole is the class of to-night a
contest in Woodward's Pavilion, the
Fall Kiver boxer has been made a 2 to
1 choice over Battling Nelson.

The biggest carving knife ever
manufactured is thirty feet in length
and has an edge as sharp as a razor.
It is made out of the finest steel and
the handle is a masterpiece of the cut
ler's art, elaborately carved and beau
tifully polished. It would take a veri
table giant to wield a knife like this.
The blade is altogether of American
manufacture and it is expected, to
show that American cutlery has now
reached a point of perfection where it
fears no rivalry. The giant carving
knife cost several - thousand dollars
and special machinery had to be made
before its construction could begin.
No such knife was ever before manu
factured. â Jewelers' Circular Weekly.

Several days ago there was an ex
cursion train run from Guthrle to El
Reno over the St. Louis, El Reno and
Western. A number of society belles
were aboard. Everybody was having
a good time, and Just after the train
left Piedmont the conductor noticed
two of the Klrls smoking cigarettes.
He ordered the train stopped in the
country, and put the girls off the train.
They had to walk a number of miles
to a olace where they could hire a
team, and It took them all day and
part of the succeeding night to make
the trip overland to Guthrle. The girls
employed attorneys to sue the road for
damages. This news reached the gen
eral manager, and the matter was set
tled by the railroad company out of
court The manager said that the con
ductor should know that a person with
a paid ticket could not be put off the,
train.â Kansas City Journal.

At a recent meeting of an agricul

speaker gave some Interesting details
regarding the deadly native intoxicant
made from treacle.
An analysis of this drink â which is
called Isltshlmiyana â by an eminent
doctor showed that it was 50 per cent
stronger than any known alcohol. Four
milk-tins full given to a pig produced
death in half an hour. This poisonous
stuff is taking the place of Kaffir beer,
and is exterminating the population on
the coast. Whole kraals, including
women and little children of four years

said the speaker, according to the Na

HONOLULU. May 19. â The United
States cruiser Tacoma is about to start
from here for San Francisco by a
roundabout route. She will go first
to a location between here and Pan
ama In search of an unknown island,
which has been reported many times.
J. D. Hague of New York is on
board the Tacoma and will conduct
the soundings. He says he believes it
probable that the warship Levant,
which disappeared after leaving Hilo
in August. 1860, was wrecked on this
island. He expects to find traces of
this vessel and thinks it possible that
there may still be some of her sur
vivors on the island. This view was
presented by Hague to Secretary of
the Navy Moody, and he finally in
duced Moody to order the Tacoma to
go in search of the island.
Hague avers that there is strong
evidence of the existence of the island
and he thinks it probably is habitable,
as was reported by Captain John De
greaves in 1859. There are also cir
cumstantial indications that the Le
vant was wrecked there and that she
did not founder at sea. Hague has
been conducting investigations here.
He has found a spar which drifted to
Hawaii in 1861 and says he believes
it belonged to the Levant.

BUFFALO, 1ST. Y., May 19.â The Gen
eral Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church in the United States was this
afternoon stampeded for Rev. J. Addi
son Henry of Philadelphia for modera
tor. Dr. Henry was elected unani
mously" almost before the other lead
ing candidates for the position knew
what was going on.. Three minutes
before Dr. Henry was chosen It was
thought Rev. James R. Moftatt of
Washington-Jefferson College would be
elected on the second ballot at least.
The other prominent candidate was
Rev. Dr. Howard A. Johnston of New
York. It was while the friends of Dr.
Moffatt and Dr. Johnston were prepar
ing to nominate their respective candi
dates that the stampede for Dr. Henry
started and he was elected within
twenty minutes. Dr. Moffatt's cam
paign had been carefully conducted for
months by his friends, whereas Dr.
Henry did not come Into the contest
until the last few days.
Pre-destination and the educational
qualifications for the ministry were
among the questions discussed to-day.
The plan of the proposed union with
the Cumberland faction will give rise
to' an Interesting debate. While the
Presbyterian Assembly is meeting here
the General Assembly of the Cumber

Upon their decisions depend the ques
tion-whether the Cumberland Church
shall be restored' to Christian fellow

MOTHER AND CHILD FALL FROM CAR.
â rMrs. Harrington of 114 Twelfth street and
her baby girl were thrown off a Fillmdre-street
car at Church and Thirteenth streets last
night. Both were badly injured.
This ballot resulted in the election of
Dr. Burt of Rome, but the vote will not
be stated before it is announced at to
morrow's session of the conference.
Drs. Cook. Neely and Wilson lacked
only a few votes of election and their
friends predict that to-morrow's ballot
ing , will result in their election.
There has been a growing conviction
that the South must be honored and it
appears that a colored Bishop is out of
the question. â¢ . '
About the corridors of the hotels to
night there were loud protests uttered
on every hand against Dr. Day's with
drawal, and a conclusion was reached
to revive his boom to-morrow morning.
Besides these strong leaders Dr. Jen
nings, the successful agent of the West
ern Book Concern, and Dr. George P.
Eckman, the representative pastor of
the great metropolis of the East, must
be reckoned with.
A feature of .this ballot 'was the sur
prising gain made by Dr. L. B. Wilson
of Baltimore. On the third ballot he
received ?77 and on the fourth 345. The
fifth ballot was taken immediately after
the result of the fourth had been an
nounced and the conference adjourned
until ' to-morrow morning. Meantime
the tellers worked until after midnight
counting the votes. -
This fact is a great surprise to the
delegates themselves. It required a
week's balloting four years ago to
elect two in Chicago.
. On the third ballot, the first taken
to-day, Dr. Bashford received 480 votes,
Dr. T. B. Neely 407, Dr. Burt 389, Dr.
R. J. Cook 3S4 and Dr. James R. Day,'
chancellor of the Syracuse University,
297. These were the leaders in the
voting, but as 489 votes were necessary
to elect, the ballot resulted In no elec
tion and another ballot was ordered. .
Dr. Day arose and withdrew from
the contest, begging his friends not to
vote for him again. In the fourth bal
lot it was announced that 483 votes
were necessary to a choice. Dr. J. W.
Bashford received 525 and wa,s declared
elected. Dr. William Burt received 452,
Dr. T. B. Neely 440 and Dr. R. J. Cook

BAKERSFIELD, May 19.â Besides
the election of grand officers for the
ensuing year the most important ac
tion taken by the Pythian Grand Lodge
to-day was. the adoption of a resolu-"
tion instructing the supreme repre
sentatives to use their influence when
the Supreme. Lodge meets at Louisville",
Ky., in August, to obtain such legisla
tion as will enable the Rathbone Sis
ters to receive official recognition at
the hands of the parent order an'd to
change their name to Pythian Sisters,
at the same time retaining the Knights
as members. This matter has been be
fore the supreme body several times,
but as the value of the order as an aux
iliary is becoming recognized more
every year, it is thought that the ef
fort may be successful. . The resolu
tion was introduced by the Grand Tem
ple. An unsuccessful, effort was also
made to repeal the law enacted last
session making the term of officers in
subordinate lodges one year instead of
six months. After a long ' discussion
the resolution was withdrawn, the
chief argument being that the new
rule had not been fairly tried. The
only contest of importance for the of
fice of grand prelate .was won by M.
L. Short^of Hanford, Superior Judge of

It was nearly 2 o'clock yesterday
afternoon before the Pacific Mail Com
pany's liner China, bound for the
Orient, cast off her lines and started
the voyage scheduled to begin at 1
o'clock. Waiting for the "office mail"
was given as the reason for the delay.
The arrival of this "office mail" is one
ot the star features of the departure
of Pacific Mail boats. It is alway3
last to arrive and usually late. It
is sent to the wharf in a light wai?on
drawn bv a sleek white horse. From
the Pacific Mail Company's office to
the dock gate and half way down the
wharf this white horse ambles at a
dignified gait, which all the urging of
Driver Burns cannot change. The
white horne is interested in the un
usual and if. never in such a hurry
that ilio cannot stop and study such
IK-culiariiies as. may be encountered on
the trip from office to wharf. He likes
to sample the- hay on passing truck3,
is extremely sociable, never passing ;i
fiiend vvthout a solicitous neigh or
two, and loves to poke his -snow- white
nose . in every watering trough along
the route.
When half way down the wharf,
however, Blanco wakes up. He
knows that crowded liner is awaiting
the canvas bags in the wagon behind
h'm and he knows that wall of wait
ing people must open. up and give him
and his wagon a clear road to the
gangway.
"Out of the way, there!" yells
Driver Burns.
Up goes Blanco's head. The amble
changes to a frantic gallop and when
Burns cries "whoa" there is white
foam dripping from Blanco's mouth.
The China carried a large number
of passengers and 3300 tons of cargo,
most of which was for Japan.
Among the passengers were many
United States Government employes
bound for Manila. Those that sailed

CHICAGO. May 19.â The rapid appearance
of cash wheat tn local elevators arid the near
approach of the delivery day served to start
a general demand for May. With- the rush
for that option stiffened, the. ideas, of holders
of July and September stiffened accordingly.
Starting with a gain of "ic to %e at 87%c,
July advanced steadily to 69%c, with but one
setback of sufficient weight to carry the price
under the opening. A disposition on the part
of tbe pit traders to play for a break after
the early advance carried July back 'to 87%c
and September to 81%c. The large owners
of the deferred options, however, held aloof
and the clamor for Â¦ May shows the. popular
sentiments as to the present scarcity < and
prospective supplies of grain. The result was
a gain of V4c r to %c In -July at 88*i6S8%c
and of %Â©%c In September to 62c. the latter,,
having sold up to 82%c at its best. Outside
of the weather outlook and a decline In for
eign markets, the bulk of the' news, was
bullish Â¦ .' ~

LONDON, May 19. â The third series of wool
auction sales closed to-day. - The offerings
numbered 9100. There was a good attendance
and the demand was brisk owing to American
competition for Merinos, i The advance was
pronounced in fine scoureds and greasles. In
heavy greasies the improvement was less gen
eral. Fine crossbred* ruled 4 per cent higher
when the series opened. Later the better
trades showed an advance of 7>< per cent
above the March sales. Americans operated
freely and the competition for Geelong greasles
and good medium crossbreds was a feature of
the sales. â¢

The report cf Edward A. Urals, section di
rector United States Weather Bureau, for th?
Oregon Crop Bulletin for the week ended May
1Â«. U as .follows:
The 'past t .-.â¢",. has been dry and. although
i{ averaged wanner than the wÂ«*k previous.
It was too ,cool for rapid growth and ger
nslnattcn. The bulk of fall wheat is In ex
ci>H*nt condition, but in a few places in Uma
tilla!.County the freeze of the week previous
did material darr.atre. which very likely will
t>e greaUy retrieved should warm rains occur
during the next week or so. Spring wheat
seeding U nearly completed, and the stands
Â«>vcryÂ»here are reported above the avrage.
In favored localities fall barley and fall rye
are beginning to head. Range grass and for
tge crop* continue doing splr-ndldly. and stock
is beginning to get fat. â¢ Corn and potato
i :.-:r :::.c 'are general, and in some of the
j-outhÂ«rn counties corn planting is r^arly com
pi'-tfd. Gardens also are nearly ail planted.
but the growth of vegetables has beÂ«n slow. â¢
Hops are healthy and promising, and the
cultivation cf the yards has proceeded unin
terruptedly during the week. The condition
of fruit l"s somewhat uncertain, but nearly all
<-tirrÂ«>Â«riot.'5Â» > ni6 apree that Italian prunes will
be almost a failure. Har'y cherries, pears and
reaches have fuff<Â»r*d some injury from the
late- frosts! but it Is believed they will yÂ»t
fTive satisfactory yields. Apples are promis
ing and strawberries and bush fruits will be
plentiful.

continued, almost lifeless to-iay. Whenever
eny activity developed the toni of the market
became soft, showing the predominance of eell
ini over buying orders In the very narrow
market. When prices ceased their slow down
ward tendency the market fell Into profound
dullness and neglect, thus reflecting the un
Â»Miriness of any buyers to take stocks un
an upward- scale of prices. So argued the
room traders, whose ojÂ« rations are devoted to
following the movements of larger operators.
As the meager dealings were almost wholly
made up of the room traders' transactions,
they were drawing deductions from their own
operations. The trading etarted at some
slight gains due to the sympathetic Influence
of the London market. In which rumors were

the coming of peace in the Far East. The
resumption of selling of United States Steel

tic reports from the iron trade was the first
dra* uoon the market. But the heav tone
spread to other quarters. ' The sub-treaeury
statement showed gains at the expense of the
banks for the week of $IL290,<XÂ«. promising
another formidable Inroad upon the surplus
reserve of the banks, the more so as the $21.

As previously mentioned, the Potato market
was badly, congested with old Oregon Bnr
banks, which continued Ho arrive freely by
rail and there were 4G52 sacks received by
steamer. Strictly fancy lot* met with prompt
salt- at the top quotation, but for the general
market $1 50 was an extreme figure and deal
ers were willing to make concessions on poor
lots., Receipts of new, Potatoes were 774 sacks
from across the bay and 200 boxes from the
river. The river stock cleaned up well at
2@2Mc per pound, but the train with supplies
from across the bay arrived) too late for the
regular trade and thÂ» bulk of' the receipts were
still unsold at the close. Receipts of new Red
Onions were over 1000 sacks, and as there was
an abundance of . carried-over ; stock prices
ranged lower on the wharf. '
Supplies of most kinds of vegetables were
well up to requirements and prices showed but
slight variation. The train with fresh supplies
Of Peas and Rhubarb was delayed and did not
arrive until late in the forenoon, but there was
sufficient carried-over stock on hand to meet
the demand. The bulk of the belated arrivals
of Peas went to the canners at lc per pound,
equivalent to 65@75c per sack. Asparagus,
too was purchased freely by the canners, who
paid 4%<&5c per pound. '
Receipts of vegetables included 1010 boxes
of Asparagus,' 2SS boxes of Rhubarb and 128S
sacks of Peas. -^ .

'â¢ SUMMARY- OF THE MARKETS.
"I am Inclined to the opinion that we shall
grow in Oregon, If nothing unforseen happens.
105.000 to -110.000 bales, which will bÂ» about
20.OUO bales more than last year. . Taking Into
consideration the Increase In California and
Washington, we might get an output pn the
Pacific Coast of 210,000 bales. Figuring New
York State wltb 60. 0C0 .bales, the crop of the
United States In 1904 might reach 270iOOO
bales, which Is far in excess of the demand
Of our breweries. Of course, we are dependent
on exports to England, which might come up
to 5O.COO bales, leaving for home consumption
about 220.000 bales. Figuring the output of
beer for 1904-1905 at 50.000.COO barrels would
leave us apparently a surplus of 30,000 bales.
Of course this calculation Is baaed on the re
turns of the acreage In the four Hop- growing
States and is barring accidents."

Mrs. Mary Trigs, a widow, 40 years
of age, committed suicide at her home,
1805 Page street, yesterday afternoon
by taking a quantity of strychnine.
The cause for the deed, as told by the
daughters of the deceased to the offi
cials of the Coroner's office, was that
their mother had lapsed into a melan
choly mood.
Mrs. Trigg went out for a walk dur
ing the morning and returned, about
noon. Her queer, actions were noted
by, her children and other inmates of
the house. - About 1 o'clock she
informed one of her daughters that
she had taken strychnine, but the
latter believed she was not . in
earnest and paid little heed to the
matter , for a time. Soon after Mrs.
Trigs went to her room her condition
became rapidly worse and her groans
attracted attention. A physician was
called,- but he could render little assist
ance and the patient died about half an
hour later. ;Mrs. Trigg's husband, who

These met later on the brldtre across
the- John Day River and engeged in a
duel, using their spurs as weapons.
The duel ended with the killing of one
of the braves. This sobered the rest of
the Indians and, binding the dead war

a baby which had been killed in the

The wills of two prominent pioneer

Leona F. Schultz Is seeking a' divorce
from George F. Schultz, an engineer,
to whom she was married in September,
1902. She alleges that only a few days
ago at their home at 53 Albion avenue,
Schultz tried ,lo kill her by using force
to keep her In a room, the doors and
windows of which he had closed after
dragging her in and turning on the gas.
She says she begged for her life, but
he refused 1 to let her go, remarking, as
he firmly held her that "he was going
to end it all." Mrs. Schultz says that
Judge Kerrigan gave John W. Rock
lin a divorce from Margaret Rocklin
for cruelty and Judge Murasky di
vorced Lavlnia McKay from T. C. Mc-
Kay for cruelty. Judge Murasky also
gave Alice O. Arnold -a divorce from
Herbert R. Arnold. Mrs. Arnold, who
testified that she is a variety actress,
proved' that she had been abandoned
by her spouse.
Anna I. King from whom James E.
King obtained a . decree of divorce a
few days ago, in an affidavit filed yes
terday charges. that King swore falsely
that she had been served with a sum
mons on May 2, and therefore deceived
the court when* he procured an order
entering her default. She says she was
not served until May 4, and therefore
asks that the default be set. aside. She
says she has a good defense to the ac
tion.
The marriage of Annie Ried to Fred
erick Rled was annulled -yesterday by
Judge' Kerrigan and Judge Sloss an
nulled tnV marriage of Elmer Worden
to Jane Worden. In each case ignor
ance of the law requiring divorced peo
ple to wait a year, before again assum
ing the-matrimonial yoke was pleaded.
In the Rled case the testimony showed
that she had become the wife of Ried
three davs after she had secured her
divorce from her first husband.
. Judge Sea well's well-known caution
In handing down decisions severing
the matrimonial knot stood in the way
yesterday of W. T. Ebbetts, an actor.
Ebbetts must, in consequence, walt^
a few days before he can leaxn
whether he Is freed from pretty Martha
Jane Ebbetts, better known as Mattle
Beauford, ai- actress. Meantime Judge
Seawell will try to solve - the prob
lem, "Did \lattie desert Ebbetts or
Ebbetts lei'.-ve her?" He. will also
decide whether Ebbetts is a resident of
this city. ;
â¢ Ebbetts is the plaintiff in the action.
He charges in his complaint that short
ly after his marriage in Boston, in 1894,
to Mattie- Beauford she refused to live
with him an^i that since then they have
met but seldom and then only when
the- companies with which they, were
playing haDfeened to strike a town at
the same time. He so testified when
called as a witness and so did' Edwin
H. Neill and Jacob R. Shattuck, a
New York theatrical manager, who has
known the couple for,, a number of
years. . ; The last two were unable to
state, however, that they knew of their
own knowledge that Mrs. Ebbetts had
left her husband or" that Ebbetts had
not left. her. They could only state
that they knew the couple did not live
together. This admission practically
left Ebbett's testimony uncorroborated,
so Judge Seawell took the case under
submission. In announcing his decis
ion he also took, occasion to express
his opinion that Ebbetts' claim to a
residence here was- hardly as clear as
It might be. , . â¢
"The migratory and nomadic lifet led
by theatrical folk." said the court,
"makes the cuestion of residence a
hard point to decide."

unbosomed himself to Special Officer

"Will you kindly inform us.V remark

"Well, I don't know," mused his
Honor, "that a' bad cold wouldn't be
preferable to some of the things you
inhale through that pipe. From what
the complaining policeman has stated
about your dwelling place, I infer that
the circumambient atmosphere Is
neither odorous nor free from filth-bred
germs."
Close to where a wide sewer vomits
Its unsavory accumulations on King
street, between Sixth and Seventh, a
prowling policeman ran across a queer
looking hovel, with a one-inch metal
pipe projecting from its roof. Entering
the den, the officer found a small man
lying face upward upon a pile of gun
nybags, his mouth covered by the re
ceiving end of a funnel such as is used
fdr bottle filling, while the spout was*
attached to the pipe wh\ch pierced the
ceiling. He was asleep and when
awakened by the uninvited, visitor he
denounced the intrusion in' fractured
English. "Albert Frank, native of
France; vagrancy," was the summons
to which he responded In Judge Mo
gan's court. Very ragged and very
dirty he was and he listened to the po
liceman's story with ebullient indigna
tion.
A Jury in Judge Fritz's court was un
able to decide whether it was Mrs. An
nie. Snow or Miss May Clune that pur
loined from a Hayes street car a
satchel containing $45 worth of valu
ables which had been left there by a
lady. The conductor of the vehicle and
another witness swore positively that
Annie Snow took the bag and .May
Clune testified that it was she herself
who carried It away, and kept it two
weeks awaiting a claimant. The Judge
hinted that somebody was committing"
perjury. After the jury was discharged
his Honor announced that on Satur
day he would set the case of Annie
Snow for rehearing.
Mary Hurley, who cooked for a liveli
hood and washed dishes for recreation
at 2526 Ocean boulevard, owned by
Mrs. Drexler, absentee, and occupied
by Miss Christopherson, .housekeeper
pro tern., and Mr. and Mrs. C. S. Cross
ley and Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Rus
sell, lodgers, declined dismissal at the
hands of the temporary chatelaine and
held the kitchen against terrific odds
from 7 o'clock p. m. Wednesday till 2
a. m. Thursday, when she voluntarily
marched out v.ith^ flying colors and
drums beating, escorted by the bluer
coated reinforcement that the besiegers
had summoned.
"This person," said the cook lady to
Judge Mogan, and alluding to Miss
Christopherson, "had no authority to
discharge me. and it was only to avoid
further trouble that I surrendered. I
was engaged by Mrs. Drexler and when
she returns and hears of this outrage
there'll be something doing."
"You gave them quite a stand-.off,"
said his Honor, "but you disturbed the
peace, and it Is my duty to punish even
an Amazonian fracture of the law. I'll
sentence you to-morrow."
"Just wait till Mrs. Drexler comes
back," said Mary, warningly.
"Sorry I can't accommodate you,"
quoth the court, "as the date of the
lady's return is Indefinite, and justice
dislikes to be kept in suspense."
Continuing the case of Dr. T. F.
Brennan, accused of embezzling $38,000
intrusted to his keeping by the Rev.
Father Grey, until next Wednesday,
Judge Fritz Intimated that he will then
hold the defendant to the Superior
Court, as the conflicting character of
the testimony makes it advisable that
it be weighed by a jury. Attorney
Cannon for the defense stated that as
soon as the testimony is written he will
test the legality of the Magistrate's
decision by means of a writ of habeas
corpus.-
The charge of embezzling a watch
and chalice, the property of the same
complainant, was dismissed, Judge
Fritz holding that the evidence was
not sufficient to show dishonest intent.
According to the story told by the
complainant, Halsey was engaged to
marry her when he was forced to wed
another girl, and after the infant was
born he acknowledged it was his and
promised to pay for its keeping, but
has since neglected to do so. He is 26
years of age, resides with his wife and
baby and mother on Lincoln avenue,
and Is employed In a tile factory on
Mission street pending his appointment
as a policeman, for which he has
passed the civil service examination.

sible position in the office of the Union
Cracker Company when approaching

whose wages scarcely suffice to keep

Judge Cabaniss is doubtful that the
law enables him to grant the complain
ant's petition, even if she proves its al
legations, and has given himself until
next Thursday to consult the statutes.
James F. Halsey, who was a Deputy
County Clerk during the Mahoney re
gime and now Is among' the duly-qual
ified eligibles for appointment to the
police force, denies paternity of the 2

The doctor denied that he had Uttered
threats or brandished either of the
weapons alleged. "The only knife I
handled," he said, "besides the one I
ate with was a corn-cutter, and I offer
ed it to my former wife as a gift."
The case was taken under advise
ment for a week. /
. "Why did you invite him to dinner?"
the Judge asked the complainant.
"Because he was broke and 1 didn't
like to think of him being hungry,"
was the answer.
It showed that since she assumed
single harness two months ago Ma
dame Richstein has. frequently Invited
her former spouse to dine with her, and
that they have had several amicable

"I feel it my dnty to try to help those
â¢nflering from skin diseases. My case
Â¦vras a Very bad one, covering all of one
side of my face and had reached my
eye. I had two or three doctors pre-
scribe without 1 any relief. They, said
my disease was Epithclioma. I was
then advised to go to one of oar hos-
pitals, which I did, taking their treat-
ment for some time. I had given np all
hope when my husband asked me to try
the Caticnra Remedies. My face being
In . such . a very. . bad .* state, . I . used \ the
Cuticara Soap with lake- warm water,
and a small Milk sponge and then" applied
the Cuticura Ointment. I took one tea-
spoonful of the Resolvent four times a
day. .They, acted. like a charm, and In
one week's time my face was cured en-
tirely and has remained so. I certainly
can recommend the Coticura Remedies
as infallible." â¢ . ,

The purity and sweetness, the power
to afford immediate relief," the certainty
of speedy and permanent cure, the ab-
solute safety and fgreat economy have
made Cntlcura -Remedies the , standard
skin cures, blood purifiers and humor
remedies of the world. .Â»
Here is another of those remarkabla
cores of torturing, disfiguring akin hu-
mors dally made by Cnticnra Resolv-
ent, assisted by Caticnra Ointment and
8oap, after physicians, hospitals and all
else had failed. 1 '?};Â¦'
