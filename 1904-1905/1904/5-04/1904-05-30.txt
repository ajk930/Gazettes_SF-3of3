LOS ANGELES, May 29.â Henry T.
Oxnard's announcement that his name
will be presented to the next Legisla
ture for the United States Senatorship
has not come as a surprise. It was
not needed to inform the public of
Oxnard's aspirations. In fact, in var
ious counties in this section of the
State his campaign had been launched
months ago and workers in his Interest
have been sounding prospective candi
dates of the Legislature. This work
has been guardedly done, however,
and the Oxnard workers have been
careful not to take any action which
would in any manner compromise their
candidate or make It impossible for
him to withdraw if so desired. What
encouragement these workers have re
ceived cannot . now be stated, but it
has been " sufficient to precipitate the
announcement which Mr. Oxnard made
yesterday. From now on there will be
no doubt as to his position, and he will
make an open fight 1 throughout South
ern California, 'in which he has enlist
ed the services of some of the most
astute politicians in this section.
When asked for a further expression
upon the subject, Mr. Oxnard said that
his official announcement incorporated
all that he had to "say at present. He
added that he ' believes the people
know his views upon the great ques
tions which are now before the public
and which have to do with such offices
as that to which he aspires. His an
nouncement carries with it the state
ment, that he will use all honorable
means to secure the support of a ma
jority In the Legislature, but the work
in that; direction will be done more by
his friends - than by any active can
vas made by himself.
Despite his seeming reluctance to en
ter. an open : fight for the office which
he has held, the name of Senator* Bard
will also be presented to the Legisla
ture. There will be a spirited contest

time had arrived for Murphy to cease
his war upon Parker's candidacy, and
that unless the opposition of .Tammany

that : the . nomination of Parker meant
the "disruption of Tammany- and the

NEW YORK, Hay 30.â Seven freight
and coal piers of the Delaware, Lack
awanna and Western Railroad in Jer
sey City were destroyed to-day by a
fire that started on the barge 'Allen C.
Churchill, which lay alongside Pier No.
12, on which a lot of barrels of oil were
stored. The lose is estimated at $1,000,
000. The flames spread rapidly. Pier
No. 12 was 800 feet long and was soon
ablaze its entire length, and the fire
men who were trying to fight the fire
from the shore were able to accomplish
but little. The flames swept across to
Pier No. 11 and beyond, being finally
checked at Pier No. 5, which is a new
coal trestle, steel framed and iron clad.
â¢Here the firemen and fireboats made a
desperate stand and stayed the ad
vance of the fire until the burning
piers crumbled and fell into the water.
Although there was little wind, sparks
fell all along the water front for near
ly a mile, endangering the Lackawan
na station and even the Hamburg-
American and Bremen Line piers,
where the firemen were kept busy
playing streams of water upon build
ings and over ships at their docks.
A number of canal boats and several
tugs were burned, the loss of small
boats being variously estimated at
from thirty, to 200. The number of
freight cars is not known, but the loss
on this class of rolling stock will be
heavy. The Lackawanna road moved
its passenger coaches out to the Mead
ows and one- train of freight cars was
moved out and saved.
Piers 11 and 12 were full of general
merchandies: Piers 7, 8, 9 and 10 were
used for coal and Pier No. 6 was a
grain-loading pier. No person was se
riously injured.
Vice President Lewis of the Lack
awanna placed the total loss by the
fire at $5,000,000, based on the original
cost of the piers burned, on the freight
stored upon them, and, to some extent,
on the resultant* business loss. This
estimate also includes the burning of
the canal boats and barges. The Lack
awanna Company carries its . own in
surance.

Judge Parker remains now, as he has

"Some months ago conservative

took no stock in the Hearst candidacy
myself, but realizing the necessity for

gave out a statement favoring Judge
Parker' for the nomination. I pretend
to no right in the direction of party af
fairs, nor even the right to advise the
party upon men or measures, but in
order to stifle the Hearst movement I
gave up thought of either Olney or

The Novoe \; remya says that what
ever the Port Arthur squadron does, it

"The Japanese now before Port Ar
thur," said Novesky, "may proceed in
three waysâ first, an open attack after
preparatory artillery fire; second, a
progressive siege. 1 and third, a block
ade. I think thÂ« Japanese will adopt
the first course, as it Is- not to their
advantage to wait while Russian re
inforcements are arriving-. The second
method is a long and complicated oper
ation that might last months.
"Port Arthur, generally speaking, is
impregnable, but impregnability ' is a
relative term. Nothing in fortification
is really invincible. (Tuns will destroy
any structure. Cannon â¢ will defeat
each other.* Sappers can remove im
pediments outside and fill ditches. Scal
ing ladders will overcome any walls.
Mine can be met with countermine.
Colonel Novesky of the general staff,
in an interview, points out that Port
Arthur, although generally denominat
ed a~fortressj -is" 'm reality an intrench
ed camp, whereof Kinchou was only an
advanced improvised position. It would
be unwise to JudKe of the strength tof
the permanent cennected fortifications
around Port Arthur by Kinchou. These
fortifications, hie 'said, supported each
other scientifically. Operations against
them would require the most careful,
systematic preparations.
The impression In army circles Is that
the Japanese \v,'II puBh operations
against Port Arthur with the greatest
energy, but It Is also believed a month
or more will be required to bring up
siege guns.In the Chino-Japanese war,
although Kinchou was taken practical
ly without opposition, eleven days were
necessary to prepare for the storming
of Port Arthur.
Both the Admiralty and the War Of
fice are without news and frankly con
fess they do not expect to hear from
the beleaguered garrison in Port Ar
thur again directly except by accident
until the fortress has been relieved or
surrendered or the war ended. Some
native reports thut drifted into head
quarters at Liaoyang and were for
warded here say vhat the Japanese lost
many thousands.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 29.â Intense
interest is displayed in the Japanese
reports of the Kinchou battle. The peo
ple in the streets almost mob newsboys
to procure extras containing the dis
patches. â¢
Crowds stood around the official bul
letin boards awaiting the Russian ver
sions, but none arrived. The official
world, as well as the public, is entirely
dependent upon the Japanese for news.
Further details are eagerly looked for,
especially regarding losses. The pre
vailing conviction here Is that the
Japanese must have carried Nanshan
at a tremendous sacrifice. The accounts
of the heroically stubborn defense
made by the Russians, notwithstanding
their position being subject to the fire
of artillery from the front and from
warships on the flank, are a source of
much satisfaction. Their own reports,
the Russians eay, could not have placed
the fighting qualities of their soldiers
In a better light than do those of the
Japanese'.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 30. â The
correspondent of the" Russky Invalid
(the army organ) with General Mist
chenko's division of 5000 Transbaikal
Cossacks, sent to Korea, ; to keep -}n
touch with the enemy, gives a detailed
account of a ride destined to become
classic in cavalry annals. - - â¢Â¦ .r:
The command rode 400 miles In a-fort
night. It approached to within a day's
march of Seoul and was anxious, to
capture the town, which would have
been an exploit, the correspondent says,
to. thrill Europe; but imperative orders
reached them to retire, and they.re
luctantly rode back to Wlju.
General Mistchenko Is now eastward
of Fengwangcheng. It is believed here
that the men Â¦ who wanted to capture
Seoul are capable of seriously hamper
ing the Japanese movement.
General Mistchenko's division is In
dependent of General Rennenkampff's,
which is now north of Fengwangcheng.
The. Cossack raiders in Korea are com
manded by Madritoff.
- It Is understood that the formation of
an.Eighteenth Army Corps will be an
nounced shortly.
- The War Office says that many of the
guns lost at Kinchou were Chinese
guns captured during the Boxer rising.

achievements at Kinchou they regard
as proving the absolute military equal

Conspicuous features of the cortege
were a dozen white-robed * Shinto
prieets, who conducted the religious
ceremonial, and the widows and female
relatives of the deceased, clad in pure
white, who rode behind the gun car
riages.
The entire naval staff, representa

tions from the schools, guild.s and labor
unions joined in the procession. The
foreign naval attaches joined the cor
tege at Aoyama. Crowds which filled
the streets along the line of the proces-
Fion bowed their heads in prayer when
the caskets passed.
A solemn religious and military cere
mony In honor cf the fifteen officers,
residents of Tokio, who lost their lives
when the battleshiD Hatsuse and the
cruiser Yoshino were sunk was held
here to-day. A procession was formed
at the naval college 'and marched
through the city to the Aoyama Ceme
tery. Four small caskets containing
the relics of the deceased officers were
borne on gun carriages, battalions of
bluejackets acting as an escort. Rest
ing on pillows on top of the caskets
were the posthumous decorations
awarded the dead officers by the Em
peror.. :^.':.; '~V~-:i
Captain Eayeki remained on the
bridge and cried "Banzai" to the sailors
as they were entering the boats.' When
last seen he was shaking hands with
Commander Hirowatari and bidding
him farewell.
At this moment Lieutenant Nalto
eprang overboard and swam to the only
cutter which had escaped from the
wreck. He rowed to the cruiser Ka
saga and returned â¢with "three boats,
but no trace of tiie Yoshino or her crew
could be found, with the exception of
six men who had already been rescued
by boats from the cruiser Chltose. The
fog was so dense that the searchlight
of the Kasaga, though not more than
6CÂ»0 metres distant, was I only faintly
discernible.
The Kasagxi struck the Yoshino on
the port side near the engines, and the
force of the blow was so great that the
dynamos cf her lighting plant were de
stroyed, leaving the ship in darkness.
The portrait of the Emperor aboard
the- Yoshino was rescued and carried
to the Kasaga. .'
Commander Honda, who -commanded
the fire ship Totoml Maru in the suc
cessful sealing of Port Arthur, arrived
here to-day. Honda and the entire crew
of the Totomi Maru were deafened by
tÂ£eir terrible experience. The explo
sions and awful cannonade ruptured
the tympanum of their ears. Com
mander Honda may recover hearing In
one ear. but he will be permanently
deaf in the other. Honda and his com
rades did not discover their unfortunate
rendition until they we^e leaving the
ehip. .He shouted his orders to his men,
yet he failed to hear his own voice, and
he was forced to make signs indicating
his ordors in order to successfully
bring the crew back to Vice Admiral
Togo's squadron.
TRIBUTE TO HERO DEAD.
The Sixth Japanese squadron, which.
r,as blockading Port Arthur, over
hauled ar.d searched a junk and seized
a number of letters written by Russian
officers. One letter said that a torpedo
boat destroyer had successfully placed
a series of mines during the night
v.hich preceded the loss of the Hatsuse,
and, continuing, told of the loss of
eome Russian torpedo boat destroyers.
How many is not mentioned, but it is
Indicated that there were at least two.
The heavy lews of life which- accom
panied the sinking of the Japanese
cruiser Yoshino, as a result of colliding
with the cruiser Kasaga, on May 15,
was due to the smashing of five of her
boats by falling masts. When the ships
rame together, collision mats were used
and a tarpaulin was placed over the
hole, but it was impossible to stop the
Inrush of water. The ship- settled
quickly, listing to the starboard. Cap
tain Gin Sayekl ordered the crew to
the upper deck, where it manned the
boats. Five boats were lowered on the
etarboard side and one on the port side,
but before they were cleared the ship
lurched to the starboard and com
menced to sink. The .masts and davits
Einashed all five of the boats on the
starboard Fide.
CAPTAIN DIES AT HIS POST.

that some Russian torpedo boat de

Captured Correspondence
Reveals Disasters at
Port Arthur.
General Oku estimates that the
force of the enemy consisted of one
line division, two batteries of field ar
tillery, some fortress artillery and ma
rines. General Oku telegraphs his
opinion that the Russians intended to
check the Japanese advance at Nan
shan in order to protect Fort Arthur.
Besides the big guns, a miscellane
ous assortment of Russian property
was captured.
General Oku concluded his report
by heartily thanking the navy for-lta
co-operation. â¢ 'Â¦
The Japanese captured a number of
Russian officers and- men.
left and its noisy awakening was suc
ceeded by the onslaught of the fourth
division on the demoralized left wing
of the defenders and the victory was
won.
The beaten forces, badly shattered,
retreated toward Port Arthur, explod
ing the Tafangchen magazines as they
retired. A detachment of Japanese
infantry pursued the retreating Rus
sians far into the night.
Â¦;.- â¢ During this time the Fourth â¢' Regi
ment Artillery had been pounding the
Russian lefj. /.
. Suddenly the Japanese squadron'be
gan pouring shells into the Russian
General Oku reports that he knew
he could not hope to continue to bat
tle much - longer, so he " decided to
make an assault in force, regardless
of casualties. Then the artillery open
ed fire with the remaining ammunition
and the first division courageously as
saulted the Russian center, only to be
beaten back. '
5 In the meantime the Russians had
reinforced their right under cover of
two field batteries > previously with
drawn from Nanshan, with fresh in
fantry, whose fire enfiladed a consid
erable portion of the entire Japanese
line.
DEFEAT TURNS INTO VICTORY.
Very critical at this time was the
situation for General Oku's forces, for,
with the wavering of the line under
the reinforced" fire " of the Russian' in
fantry came .the reports from the
Japanese ' batteries that ammunition
was almost exhausted. - â¢'
The cessation of the firing from the
hill was a signal for the"fdrward move
ment of the troops, below and the at
tacking batteries changed their post
tions to secure better range. At 11
o'clock a zone varying from 300 to 550
yards In width separated the Japanese
and Russian linen and the rest of the
day was spent by the assailing Â¦ forces
in crossing the fire-swept zone.
RUSSIAN GUNBOAT OPENS FIRE.
A Russian gunboat in Talienwan Bay
opened fire on the Japanese left at 10
o'clock In the forenoon and continued
firing for. five hours. . Five Russian
steamships attempted to land their
crews near Hungtual, but the Third
Division stopped them. In the mean
time four heavy guns at Tafangchen
found the range of the Third Division
and kept shelling it until 7 o'clock in
the evening. The artillery with the
Third Division ..vainly endeavored to
reach these guns, but failed on account
of the darkness.
In the main attack the Japanese ar
tillery continued . shelling Nanshan
Hill, seeking to destroy, the entangle
ments and otherwise clear the way for
the infantry, but every time the infan
try advanced the awful Russian fire
drove them back.
The gunners on the fortified heights
were not slow in giving smart response
to the Japanese attack, and soon a vig
orous fire and counter-fire was in pro
press, to which the big guns of the
Japanese squadron lent noisy chime at
6 o'clock, when the atmosphere had
cleared up sufficiently for the naval
marksmen to work effectively. For
three hours the shelling from bay and
shore and the replying from the forts
continued without interruption and
then the Russian fire abated.
General Oku, in command of the
Japanese, began his aggressive move
ment on the Russian position at mid
night on Wednesday. He assigned the
Fourth. Division to the right, with in
structions to swing around Kinchou
and move southward. He gave the
First Division the center and the left
was allotted to the Third Division.
During the night a terrible thunder
storm,, accompanied by a heavy rain,
broke over the advancing army and
impeded the movements of the men. It
had been planned to begin the fire at
4:30 o'clock in the morning, but a dense
fog had followed the storm, and it was
an hour later before all of the artillery,
under General Uchiyama, opened on
Xanshan Hill. A detachment seized
Kinchou Castle, and then the entire in
fantry force gradually moved forward.
It was the Fourth Division of the
Osaka men that stormed the Russian
left. It had once been said that Osaka
men were not brave. It will never be
said again.
The First Division of Tokio. which
had the center, and the Third Division
of Nagoya, occupying the left and
which had been exposed all day to the
Russian fire against the front flank,
now followed the example of the Osaka
men, rushed forward and the battle
became transformed from an artillery
duel into one of personal conflict, with
the bayonet as the instrument of war
fare. On every parapet the resistless,
death-defying Japanese surged for
ward in increasing numbers, and hust
ling the Russians from their intrench
ments swept over the hill, and at 7:30
o'clock, as the sun was sinking beneath
the horizon, the flag of the land of the
rising sun floated above the blood-sod
den Nanshau Hill, while the shouts of
"Banzai" swelled from hilltop to shore
and re-echoed from squadron to port.
Japan pCdTfor' her Victory in 3500
killed and wounded. To the Russians
the humiliation of defeat was intensi
fied fcy the loss of sixty-eight cannon
and ten machine guns, while lying dead
in the forts and trenches were 600 men,
the victims of the accuracy of Japanese
long distance marksmanship and of
close-range fighting.
STORM DELAYS ATTACK.
OSAKA MEX PROVE VALOR.
The Japanese left throughout the
entire action until night was exposed
to an enfilading fire from- the Rus
sian infantry, a gunboat on Talienwan
Bay and four nine-centimeter guns
posted at Tafangchen. At a critlon.1
moment the ammunition of the artil
lery ran low and it was decided to
cast the remaining ammunition\into
one final desperate assault Fortu
nately, however, at the moment this
decision was reached the Japanese
squadron in Kinchou Bay, which had
ceased bombarding when the infantry
had first moved forward, suddenly re
sumed the shelling of Xanshan Hill.
.Then it was that the issues of the
day were determined. At a moment
when the outcome was hovering be
tween success and defeat for Japan â
at that moment was an almost certain
repulse converted into victory so suc
cessful that the forces of the Czar
were swept into confusion and dis
orderly retreat. With every Japanese
gun centering its fire upon the Xan
ehan forts and trenches, the Nippon
infantry sprang over the bodies of the
dead who. had sacrificed their lives
in the previous fruitless charges; the
entire line rushed forward toward the
Russian left, where the fire of the Jap
anese squadron had proved most dead
ly and which was the first to weaken
under the bombardment. It was there
that the first breach was made in the
human wall that all day had been an
invincible barrier to the impetuous
assaults of the brown men.
TOKIO, May 29.â The details of- the
fighting at Kinchou emphasize the
heroic tenacity of the ..Japanese in
their conduct at Xanshan Hill. Nine
successive times. the Japanese infantry
charged the fortified heights in the
face* of a Etorm of death-dealing
missiles, and in their last effort they
carried the forts and trenches only
after a bayonet conflict with the Rus
sians, who made a desperate, despair
ing struggle to .beat back the oncom
ing horde.
The final assault of the Japanese,
in which they at last succeeded in tak
ing possession, was marked by the
most desperate hand-to-hand encoun
ter that has thus far occurred during
the war.

\FRAMCISCO k - _^- V^^Z\â. .The most probable story is the one
that Don Cameron is to fill the unex
pired. term of Senator Quay. This
was told by Richard Quay to one of
his associates. Â¦ â¢
Senator Quay tried to make a poli
tician of Richard Quay and failed, and
then sent "Dick" Into business with the
American Tin .Plate Company.. Since
then "Dick"- Quay has made millions
of dollars and is a richer man than
was his father. Much of his money
was made in enterprises in which Don
Cameron was associated. They are
now associated in vast land schemes
in New Mexico and other Western Ter
ritories and States.
It Is surmised that Senator Quay
died with an ambition to perpetuate
his family name in the upper House.
Hence, it was gossiped to-day that
Cameron would fill the unexpired term
of Senator Quay and would be succeed
ed, if possible, by Richard Quay, with
Don Cameron's assistance.
It is estimated by William Montgom
ery, cashier of the Alleghany National
Bank, that Quay's estate Is worth
about $800,000. This is divided among
his wife's children. His insurance pol
icies matured several years ago and
he collected the cash; hence he car
ried no insurance at the time of bis
death.

they are all local lights, excepting Don
Cameron.

AFTER LEAVING CHURCH
Not long after his : arrival in New
York Father Scanlan, was, stricken
down: with pneumonia and was cared
for 'With the "greatest solicitude at : St.
.Vincent's Hospital, where,* for a while,
he showed signs of , marked improve
ment. The change for the worse came
quite suddenly yesterday.**:
Father Scanlan left San Francisco
April 7 with the intention of making a
tour in Europe, which was to last nine
months. He looked with' great inter
est and. pleasure to a visit to Rome
and it was also his hope to see his
former home in County Kerry, Ire
land, which he left forty years ago. -
News was received by Father Kane
from New York last night that the
Rev. Father P. "Scanlan's illness had
taken a critical turn, and, while there
had been occasional signs of slight im
pVovement, the doctors nevertheless
could hold out -but little hope of the
reverend father's recovery.
The news was received with the
deepest regret by all at St." Joseph's
Church, of which Father "Scanlan has
been pastor for more than twenty
years.

ENGINEERS GATHER*
AT BIER OF TNGRAHAM
SA^T LAKE. Utah, May 29.â After
being ridden by children for many
months Satan, a sleepy little mule of
Salt Lake, succeeded in throwing some
of the best broncho "busters" of the
West this afternoon. The animal be
longs to Joel Barlow and has been a
plaything for the children of the neigh
borhood, but it has persistently made
clear its refusal to permit a grown per
son to ride it. Barlow sprang on , its
back yesterday and was immediately
thrown out through the stable door.
Several other men tried to ride Satan,
but none succeeded. Billy Morgan,
formerly a rider In Buffalo Bill's show,
was offered $25 to make the attempt,
but after watching the mule's work de
clined the offer, i
During yesterday and to-day a dozen
expert riders have undertaken to stick
to the little mule, but none have suc
ceeded. The animal is gentle In every
particular, except that it will not allow
a man to ride it. In order to persuade
the riders to mount Satan, Barlow goes
into the paddock with the mule, pulls
its tail, oinches it, kicks it and mauls
it about without objection from the
mule, which stands in a half-doze while
he plagues it. The instant he shows
signs of mounting, however, the animal
becomes alert, and when he essays to
get on its back it begins a- series of
jumps that never fail to elicit the
warmest commendation from old-time
cowboys and other riders.
Its experience with the men has not
changed Satan's attitude toward the
children. The little folks are still wel
come to ride at any time. The muie
made several trips around the block
with three or four children on its back
this afternoon. Barlow has hung up a
purse of $25 for the man who, will suc
cessfully ride the mule. It Is not be
lieved any one in Salt Lake will be
able to capture the money.
8peclal Dispatch to The Call
In discussing Bishop Satterlee's view
of society. Rev. Roland Cotton Smith,
rector of St. John'? Episcopal Church,
the most fashionable place of worship
htre, Mrs. Roosevelt being a member
of his congregation, eaid to-day:
"It Is true, there is great laxity in
morals in this day and generation, and
this is as true in Washington as else
where. Wealth has* come to stay, and
the only way to avert the threatened
evil in its wake is for people who stand
for order and right living to array
themselves against those who stand for
other things."
Rev. Teunls S. Hamlin. pastor of a
leading Presbyterian Church here,
said:
"There is a small element In Wash
ington who devote themselves to
amusement. Such a class has been,
and is still, un-American. There seems
no doubt that some such excess pre
vails in this city. It Is evidenced in
sundry dinners and receptions and in
devotion to cards and other amuse
ments." -
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTOX,
WASHINGTON, May 29.â Bishop Sat
tcrlee, of this Episcopal diocese, recent
ly expressed the opinion in a public
address that society in the national
capital was becoming: a menace to the
country. He believed that the great in
'flux of the wealthy, with their ten
dency to igmore the poorer classes and
to abandon simplicity in IWng, at the
same time devoting the Sabbath to re
ceptions and dinners, thus overthrow
; Ins the foundations of religion, threat
ened our national existence.

The testimonial benefit tendered to
Rabbi Isadore Myers by his many
friends at Golden Gate Hall last even
ing was attended by a host of admirers
that filled the auditorium to its utmost
capacity. It was a testimonial of af
fection lh every way and was a proof
of the esteem in which Rabbi Myers is
held in this community. During the
evening a beautiful silver loving-cup
was presented to him by Albert Gold
berg on behalf of the different commit
tees. The Inscription on the cup is as
follows: "To the Rev. Isadore Myers
as a token of affection and esteem from
numerous friends and admirers." .,
Rabbi Myers was much affected by
the beautiful testimonial. He replied in
words well chosen to suit the sentiment
of the occasion and fervently thanked
the donors for their beautiful gift. He
hoped that he would be with his friends
for many years to come. He spoke of
the circumstances which had caused
his resignation as rabbi of the Bush
street congregation without any bitter
ness, but by certain well-directed allu
sions to Captain Dreyfus showed that
he felt that, like the French martyr, he
had been tried and condemned without
a hearing. At the conclusion of his
speech an enthusiastic . demonstration
In his favor took place.
The programme from beginning to
end was well rendered. It was as fol
lows:
Overture. . LackÂ«Â»nback's orchestra.; Juat a
few remarks, Abe Mayer; xylophone solo, Sam
Samuels; Fjx-claltlcp. Will Ktern; violin nolo
("Russian Avis." by II. Wtenlawaki). Miss

the evening. ; ;

cf applause with which the veterans
grated her. The Misses Pauline Lord
and Helfn Darling did the comical part
of. the show to perfection when they
appeared in their sketch "Through a
, Matrimonial Bureau." Miss Jennie
Morrow Long gave George Ade's "Mr.
Lindsay on San Juan" with euch in

astic recall. The recitations of Miss

The' conference just closed has &c-
VoinpHshed much for the interest of
the Methodist church and will go
Cown in church history as one of the
mpst important in the point of legis
lative action.
. The action of the General Confer
ence in retiring five Bishops and elect
ing eleven others probably attracted
the widest attention of any other
single happening; but there were
many other subjects that affected the
great membership of the Methodist
church and which were watched with
deep interest. Among these were: The
decision to stand by the present atti
tude of the church on the subject of
prohibited amusements; the refusal to
return to the time limit of pastoral
service; the exonerating of certain
'toeologieal schools of the charge of
heretical teachings; the unification of
the Methodist publishing hpuses;fthe
Â« oneolidation of the boards of church
benevolences; providing means of sup
port for superannuated ministers; fix
:rfg the status of superannuated
jBishops; craating a commission to re
vise the ritual of the church; continu
ing the commission appointed four
years ago to bring the various
branches of Methodism closer together
in the use of common prayer book,
hymnal and catechism; a referendum
of the much discussed question of a
colored Bishop, and many other mat
ters of smaller importance.
When the final roll call was taken
last night COO of the 750 accredited
<JÂ«Â«egates tvere in their seats. The de
cision to. adjourn was not arrived at
until late last evening: and in order to
finish the business before the assem
4Â»)y it was necessary to run over into
*he Sabbath in the work of calling the
roll. ,
LOS ANGELES, May 29. â It was
aftec midnight when the General Con
ference of the Methodist Episcopal

memorable gathering in the history of

BERKELEY. May 29.â The loan exhibition
of the Hillside Club yesterday afternoon and
evening In the Hillside schoolhouse was all of
the success that the club wished it to he.
There was a large attendance throughout. The
rerret la that the exhibition could not havÂ«
been spread over two or three days so that
many more people coald have had the oppor
tunity to see the collection of rare ornament.*.
It would be hard to estimate the educational
value of the- exhibit. Seventy-five famines
contributed the relics and heirlooms of a cen
tury and naturally they were all worth seeing.
There were rich tapestries aÂ»J embroideries.
rare collections of china and valuable pieces
of pottery. These were all Â»Tanged as nearly
aa possible according tn the lands from which
they came, so that visitors could readily note
the kind of work each country produces. To
a committee of laAlea of the club, assisted hv
the suggestions of Charles Keeler. Its presi
dent. Is due the success of the exhibition.

City Attorney McElroy has an
nounced that the many changes that
have been made in the bond ordi
nances force a delay. In view of these
conditions the decision has been
reached that it will be very . unwise to
call the election to be held during the
summer vacation, when many Inter
ested persons will be away from the
city. Rather than endanger the vote
on the bonds it is thought advisable to
wait until August.
City officials who have been exerting
themselves to hasten the preliminary
proceedings have canvassed the situa
tion and have settled upon a provi
sional date, about August 1, for the
election. The intention had been to
hold the election June 20, but postpone
ment is absolutely necessary that the
required legal procedure shall be ob
served.
The" municipal bond .election will not
be hejld uptil after the summer vaca
tion. "Various causes have contributed
to further delay In the preliminary
proceedings, most important of which
are the changes In some of the plans
that have _ been made concerning the
items to be submitted.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
A. R. Denke â Real property and buildln*
are booming at the West End, and I am now
completing four cottages in the vicinity of
Fifth street and Halght avenue, and can either
rent or sell them, as I have had many in
quiries from prospective tenants and pur
chasers. These cottages cost from $1*000 tt.
$2500 each, and plans are ready for the con
struction of several more by. owners of prop
erty adjacent to the tract on which the houses
are located. The demand for nouses to rent
furnished and unfurnished for the summer iÂ»
as large as It usually Is at this season but
I notice that our local property owners and
real estate agents are not In a hurry to cater
to this "butterfly" business, as we* call it.
What we need here is permanent home-makers
They are the persons that build up a city

Charles Adams of Charles Adams & Co â
Business with us has been lively during thÂ»
last week. We have had more demands for
houses to rent than we could meet. Many 01
these have been for cottages located through
the central section of the city, between Mas
tick and Grand-street stations. Any capital
ist with money to Invest could reap a good
Interest by Investing; some of his surplus cash
in the construction of modern cottages.' They
always rent for good money and are easy to
eelL 1 >i'Â«rt 111HI-1 liy'IIIM*<i'MÂ»MllÂ» 1 .1
Concerning the condition of the real
estate business local agents expressed
themselves as follows:*
William Hammond Jr. of Hammond & Ham
mondâ We have had numerous inquiries for
building sites for homes, and most of these
have bt>en for lots of fifty feee or more front-
Age. The majority of the seekers after thes*
lots plan to build, and are not speculating In
property. We look for an Increase In the
building boom that Is now on. Any one that
erects a modern cottage will ha\-e a host of
people seeking: to rent it when It is completed.
During the week we sold the residence of Dr.
C. W. R. von Radesky on San Jose avenue
and Oak street, and we have other deals In
process of negotiation.
Frank N. Dodd of the Alameda Land Com
panyâAlthough this Is the season of the yea.
when one expects realty deals and building to
be light, there is much doing In Alameda.
Many homes are In course of erection, and ad
ditional contracts are to be recorded. We ar*
building an eight-room house on St. Charles
street for Mr. Newton, a colonial cottage for
XV. E. Bowdltch. a five-room cottage on San
Joea avenue, a six-room House on Briggs
avenue, two two-story residences on Central
avenue, a six-room cottage of Paru street, ana
are closing a deal for the transfer of a $12,000
residence on Grand street. â¢
ALAMEDA, May 28.â There has been
a noticeable improvement in the tone
of the local realty market during the
last week, especially in the demand for
houses to rent. This in a measure Is
due to the annual hegira of people
from San Francisco and other places to
Alameda to spend the warm season, as
this city in many ways offers all the
pleasures of a seaside resort and. has
the advantage of being close to the me
tropolis of the Pacific Coast. The de
mand for houses to rent from others
seeking permanent residences here has
also been brisk, and to the latter the
real estate men have given preference
as against the "butterfly tourists"
who Just flit in for a short time and
flit away again when the summer days
are over. "-..=;'
other lots have been sold by Mr. Law
ton to people intending to build on
Grove street, which is now being
looked upon with favor by many new
comers to Berkeley.

EDUCATORS TO
TALK AT FAIR
Xow. my comrades. In view of the truth
that our time is short, and the end of the
march in sight. let us get ready for the home
going. Let us be certain of our peace with
God and sure that our names are on hi*
muster-rcll. Let us put on the uniform of
righteousness when we put off our faded suits
of blue. Our time is short. Next year sur
viving comrades may place Cowers on some
of our graves. Taps will soon sound for us;
lights will soon be out. Some of us may even
now be very near to the sergeant who calls
the roll in heaven. It Is called loud there
and can be heard on earth. On the battle
field of Antletam a soldier lay dying from
wounds. A chaplain passing near by heard
the familiar words: "Here! Here!" and turn-
Ing to the prostrate man be asked "What do
you want? Can I help you?" "No," re
spended the brave fellow whose life was ebbing
away. "I Just heard my name called In heaven
and was answering to It. Good by. chaplain."
They had come from the Influences of good
homes; they had been born of parents In
whom the elements of patriotism Innately re
posed: they had been raised amid the Influences
of splendid religious training and they had not
been effeminated by the slave system. They
fought, bled and died, true to God, to home
and to native land.
TUUE TO NATIVE LAXD.
In making these references God forbid that
I should by any word or insinuation belittle
the veterans of the South. No. far be It from
me to do so. They were worthy of our steel.
They fought under more unfavorable conditions
than did our men; they put their all upon the
altar and got nothing in return for what they
contended. They were brave foes and we had
to sorrowfully acknowledge It on many battle
field*. Their officers were In the main, gen
tlemen, brave, efficient and capable. It would
be wrong to rank them below our men. for
they were onr brethren. American citizens,
and have since that awful strife proved their
loyalty by standing sidÂ« by side with our men
from the North In the Spanish-American War.
For our departed comrades I will say they
were part of the most magnificent army ever
mustered on our globe and the like of which
the world may never see again.
TVe believe that the hand of God> wrote the
emancipation proclamation. which forever
settled the question of human slavery on earth.
a:id that Abraham Lincoln, acting as his
divinely appointed private secretary, put it
on pap?r and proclaimed It to the world.
There wero some very significant matters
In connection with the Civil War in which we
observe the hand of God clearly manifested.
First. In the frenzy and Impatience of the
people of the South to open the fight and
precipitate their undoing. There la an old say-
Ing "that whom the gods would destroy, they
first make mad." The people of the South were
mad for the strife and so they hastily fired
the shot that began the terrible war and
abolished their, pet Institution from America.
Seconi, their arms were almost generally
victorious up to the time of the Issuing of the
emancipation proclamation. But after that
the I'nion forces prevailed mightily. This
signified that the hand of God was upon the
nation, and that If we did not put away
slavery he would wipe us from the face of the
earth.
GOD ENDED SLAVERY.
What shall we say in memory of our fallen
comrades and of the grÂ»at struggle in which
they so nobly figured? The hand of which wÂ«
have spoken was manifestly with them, work
ing out the great purposes of the Almighty and
the destiny of the nation. Surely In the light of
the present greatness of our country among
tho nations cf the world we may find words
of pnise for the men that sacrificed their
lives for the j reservation of liberty in America.
Thero Is a supreme God that watches over
the affalni of men, an infinite will that has
to do with the destiny of nations, a master
mind that shapes all things toward a definite
em* with an eternal purpose and builds all
things after a perfect plan. His hand, which
is the emblem of Infinite power ana omnipo
tence. Is stretched out over the nations of the
earth.
Rev. Gilman Parker's sermon was en
titled "The Hand That Is Stretched Out
Upon Nations." In delivering it he said
in part:
1 Â¦ ALAMEDA, May 29.â Memorial ser
vices for the nation's departed defend
ers held in the First Baptist Church
this morning were made notable by the
attendance in a body of the members
"of Joe Hooker Post No. 11. O. A. R..
and of the delivery of a sermon by the
Rev. Gilman Parker, pastor of the
church and himself a veteran of the
Civil War. Patriotic hymns were In
cluded In the selections rendered by a
special choir, and there were also songs
by a class of children, each little singer
holding a small flag. An address to an
old battle flag. "Touch Lightly the
Tatters," was recited by Mrs. E. G.
Smith.
A number of lots in the Berry-Bangs
Tract have been sold recently by F. H.
Lawton. This tract is in the neighbor
hood of a lot of handsome residences
and is very desirable. One of these
Jots was sold to T. E. Hicks, an East
ern lumber merchant, who will build a
J5000 residence at the corner on Russell
street and Benvenue â¢ avenue. - Five
Joseph J. Mason has Just 'sold four
Iota in the same district to purchasers
who promise to build fine homes on
them. The lots front on Webster
street and are near Judge Garber's
beautiful country home. The purchas
ers are Alexander Bowmann. Mrs.
Shrout, Mrs. Fannie Martens tein and
Lorin Bricker. Mr. Mason has ' also
Bold to Mrs. F. H. Lee of Chlco the res
idence at 2204 Dwight way, the pur
chase price being $5500. Mrs. Lee is
coming to Berkeley, to stay while her
eon attends the university.
F. C. Johnson, a San Francisco lum
ber merchant, has Just arranged
through Juster &. Baird for the build
ing; of a residence of the colonial type
of architecture on Benvenue avenue
It is to adorn one of those tracts spo
ken of in southeast Berkeley, at the
foot of the hills. The cost is going to
be about J6000.
BERKELEY, Mav 29.â In conse
quence of the approach of the summer
months there is a slowing up in the
number, of real estate transactions.
This does not mean, however, that
there is not still considerable buying
and selling. Some people are shrewd
enough to know that the best time to
buy is when trade is a little slack and
they are Just now driving the best bar
gains. A number of people have al
ready purchased in anticipation of the
reopening of the college year in Aug
ust, having planned to get their fami
lies well settled before then.
Buyers are manifestly more inter
ested in the north and south extremes
of Berkeley than in the other parts.
Thye seem to think that the most de
eirahle portions of town are away from
the business center. Therefore the
tracts of land that have hitherto re
mained almost barren are now being
filled up with residences of the most
desirable kind.
BERKELEY SITUATION*.
F. F. Porter of Oakland: Business baa
been good for the last month, with a good
outlook for the coming month. We experience
more trouble In finding desirable property at
reasonable prices than finding buyers. The
Inquiry for medium-priced property is espe
cially rood. With the advent of the "Key"
Route into Oakland to Fourteenth street the
Â»Â«w hotel proposition and other substantial
ttnprovements about to be realized, Oakland
will enter into an era of prosperity equaled by
no other city on the Pacific Coast, and it
will not be of the mushroom variety. Any in
vestment In Oakland realty, properly made.
Is as safe as United States bonds, with the
income quadrupled, and now Is the time to
buy, for after the November election and va
cation time have passed the present prices are
cure to advance. .
L.. L. M. Salisbury of Frultvale: All the
real ectatÂ« men in Frultvale have all the
business they can attend to. Many Eastern
people are purchasing lots in that vicinity
lor the purpose of erecting homes, and almost
all of these sales are cash inFtead of instali
tner.t. es formerly. There are practically no
houses for rent anywhere In Frultvale. We
have calli for houses for rent every day, but
tt Is impossible to secure houEÂ«Â«s at any price.
The proposed change of the Southern Pacific
Company's Seventh street local line to a fact
â¢lectrlc road will materially increase the
value cf 'Fruitvale property; In fact, the an
nouncement that such a change would be
made ha* already caused a slight advance. 1
have had several Inquiries for factory ' sites
on the casal front lately, and I think that be
fore long several factories will be started in
frulrvaJe. I believe that the organization of
the Board of Trade of Frultvale will also
hare a stimulating effect on the real estate
tnarkrt. â¢ %
in ail parts < f Oakland and valuer in En. t
Oakland property are steadily advancing. AVe
have had a larte number of Inquiries for loca
tions for wholesale business houses and the
)â¢â¢ Â¦Â¦; 'Â¦(Â¦ making these inquiries nearly all wish
to lease for ten years or more. Nearly ail
of the people seeking business locations want
rites "either on North Broadway or on Lower
Iiroadway. We ar* at present receiving a
large number of Inquiries for Boulevard
Heights property, which comprises a tract
Â©f two hundred lota. Within the last montn
we have placed on the market "a large tract
facing Lake Merrltt.
or business daring the rummer. There Is a
rtcady d/pmand for vacant residence property
Taylor Brothers & Co.: We are thoroughly
satisfied with the present condition of the mar
ket and everything points to an excellent run
The following statements by real es
tate men in various parts of Oakland,
Berkeley and Alameda prove that pre
eent conditions are satisfactory:
The present situation in the local real
estate market is most encouraging and
dealers are well satisfied that the sum
mer of 1904 will be the best so far ex
perienced. Large numbers of Eastern
homeseekers are purchasing property in
this city, and are erecting handsome
houses and co'ry cottages, proving that
they intend to make Oakland their
home. This, of course, will result In an
Increase in business of all kinds, and
if the present rate of increase in popu
lation is maintained during the next
four months, Oakland will have good
cause to be proud of its record at the
close of the summer.
Tfce merchant* of Frultvale believe that the
crr&nizuUcn Â¦ cf a Board of Trade h^re will
rerult In a treat deal of rood, and will ma
terially hasten the development of this com
munity. It will at aa)' rat* serve to bring
the business men Into clow touch v.iih each
other and thii alone cannot but result in ben
efiting- all of us. ' There are already fifty
members in the organization and after the
f.-fi meeting* we hope to enroll many mere.
REAL ESTATE 31ARKET.
The merchants and business men of
FirultvaJe have recently completed the
organization of a commercial body
-*'hiÂ«h Is to be known aa the Board of
Trade of Fruitvale, and the first regu
lar meeting, at which officers and di
rector* will be elected, will .be held next
Tuesday evening. Fifty prominent
merchants and firms In the vicinity of
Frultvale are already members of the
organization and it to expected that a*
coon as permanent organization Is ef
fected* xa any others will become mem
bers.
The work" of organtring the Board of
Trade was first taken up by W. E. Ru
dell and Da Loss Pratt, and as soon as
the project 'was fairly launched others
quickly became advocates of the new
organization and little difficulty was
experienced in securing members. It is
expected that Adolph Lorsbach will be
elected president of the new organiza
tion a* the meeting next Tuesday even-
Ing. The other officers have not yet
been selected. The first meeting will
be held at the office of W. E. Rudell,
corner of FruitvaJe avenue and Wash
ington street. Mr. Rudell. a prominent
real estate dealer of Frultvale, in dis
cussing the new organization, said:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 29.
Abbie Sherlock, 21 years old, commit
ted eutcide this afternoon by drinking
carbolic acid at her father's horse-trad
ing camp. East Twelfth street and
Twentieth avenue. The young woman
had quarreled during- the afternoon
with her parents, and piqued by the
differences went behind the camp
wagon and took the fatal draught.
Miss Sherlock had desired jto leave
her parents, but her father hid her
trunk and refused to allow his daugh
ter to get her clothing. It was after
this disturbance that she drank the
poison.
Just before the desperate girl quaffed
the fatal dose she kissed her baby Bis
ter, affectionately bidding the little one
good-by. Other younger members of
the family witnessed the scene, but did
not give the young woman's action spe
cial thought. They did not realize It
was the girl's last farewell.
There was a scurrying for assistance
when the girl's condition was discov
ered by her people. They found Dr. W.
W. Kergan and Dr. Holmes. But the
physicians could not save the patient's
life. The young woman died at 5:15
o'clock, less than an hour after she
took the Doison. Coroner Mehrmann
has charge of the case.
The family, composed of Martin
Sherlock and his wife and ten chil
dren, came here three weeks ago from
Los Angeles. They are itinerants, mov
ing from place to place as fancy and
business, that of horse dealing, dictate.
The dead girl was a native of Iowa.

Numerous Alarms in City

Crimes of an Incendiary
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA. May 23.â This city has
recently suffered from an alarming
number of incendiary fires. Almost In
variably during the past eight months
the department has been called to save
property to which a match had been
deliberately applied. In some instances
oil-soaked rags have been used.
Robert Ross' blacksmith shop seems
to be the' favorite spot of the incen
diary, and six alarms have come from
the corner of First and Main streets,
where his shop is situated. Two at
tempts have been made on the property
of A. E. Chartrand, at Fourth and A
streets, one In the Star Feed Mills,
where a blaze was kindled on a pile cÂ£
hay. and another last night in the store
of M. Saunders.
Three separate attempts were made
to burn as many empty houses in the
"red light" district, and. taken alto

kept busy to thwart the attempted de
struction of property. The police de

prints on the wall, and things are be
,ing said â things not exactly in the na
ture of compliments, either to the
board, the building committee or the
architect. Now. it might be well to
pause here to extend your sympathies
to the architect. It Is said to be a
satanic task to please one woman in
building a house. Then what must It
be to please 450? However. Mr. Pissis
is a diplomat as well as a clever archi
tect, and -he has informed the women
that talked with him sanely that he
stood ready to make any changes that
the club should decide upon. Alas!
Alas! Will these dear women ever
unite in a decision? They are much
in the same position as the University
Club fo'und itself recently â some would,
and some .wouldn't. And now comes
the saucy bank people, they of the Mu
tual Savings Bank, . who politely de
cline to lend the $35,000. with the lot as
security, as they had promised. Now,
it Is whispered abroad that some Mrs.
Energetic confided to the bank the lit
tle bubbles of trouble in the club, thus
causing its sudden change of view. But
finances are not controlled by gossip,
and the ladies are firm in the belief
that another bank will advance the
money needed on the plain basis of a
business proposition. As soon as Mr.
Plseis gets his plans nearer the idealty
of the knockers â alas! for the knocker
dwelleth nighâ all will be well, and the
cornerstone be laid some day.
But herein lies a lesson for women. In
club and out. Women do not think
that Is, not until the day .after. Now,
these women went through the legisla
tive work months ago, and now they
"didn't know what they were voting
for." It is a fact, lamentable though it
be, that two-thirds of the women who
Vote in their club affairs vote like
sheepâ just follow their friends, who* in
turn follow their friends. Then when a
matter of vital importance goes
through 'and is half-way along toward
consummation they awaken from their
trance and ask "why" and "whence."
However, we're learning. But in the
learning we ofttlmes act pretty foolish.

i The biennial has come and gone, but
unlike the Arabs, It has not silently
I stolen away.
j None but the deaf would have call-
I cd the last hours of the General, Fed
1 oration of Women's Clubs a silent af
fair â the air was heavily charged with
volubility and of a kind, by the way,
j to indicate kangaroo strides- from the
' Says of our grandmothers â the bless
i ed old ladies- who were more skilled
I in working sa/mplers than in working
out policies* and reform's* and discuss
ing them from platforms. Ah! But
i that's progression. Women grapple
with live propositions now, where they
fainted at them and there is
'less sham, and more intelligence now
among women than the world ever
knew before-r-the male misanthrope
notwithstanding.
As to the election of the officers, the
slate was carried out. the nomination
from the floor falling into desuetude.
Mrs. Sarah Platt Decker of Colorado
is now at the head of the^reatest ag
gregation of clever women in the
country â an easy prophecy to the
wise, they who knew how the club
leaders of the West felt as to her eli
gibility â and it was commonly con
ceded to be a -Western year. How
ever, had Mrs. Bob Burdette contin
ued her canvass for the office as clev
erly as she had begun it, and she had
the California delegation practically
with her, she would have given the
handsome Coloradoan a close run.
There were, however, some dissensions
in the home contingent, and it is sup
posed that Mrs. Burdette was advised
of them. " But the fact is of record
that the delegates from the State Fed
eration went on instructed to stand
solidly, first, last and all the time for
Mrs." Burdette, who. at that time, was
an avowed candidate.
On her withdrawal on the plea of
preferring to remain at home to assist
her husband In his new. pastoral du
ties, the united strength of the Califor
nia delegation was thrown to Mrs.
Decker, who won with colors 'flying.
But California must be regarded by
the governing body as not quite "be
longing," as no place was awarded her
leaders on the speech programme.
Now, that would be a hard slam at our
men politicians from California, but
what think you of our women being
thus ignored? And they talk so well,
too!
However, California was heard from,
the omission notwithstanding. A very
clever talk was given, and under very
tactful and charming circumstances, by
the president of the California Federa
tion, Mrs. George Law Smith, on "Trav
eling Libraries," ? so our lovely State
was not quite lost In the scrimmage.
And by the way, we Californians
captured one of the directorates â Mrs.
Jcsiah Cowles of Los Angeles, a re
markably fit selection. \
But what rebuke the federation de
livered to a former presidentâ she who
presided at Los Angeles with such
charming tact as to win the admiration
of even the stony-hearted men who
chanced to blow in at the sessions.
' While there, the pretty widow â who,
by the way,- was an exquisite in gown
ing â was fairly shadowed by an ador
ing chap from New York. No one
blamed him, but rather commended,
until it was bruited about that he was
hardly free to wed â having already the
legal allotment of one wife. 'Twas not
long after, however, that a divorce was
asked for and obtained, and lo â the
handsome widow and her lingering
lover were soon made one â and a happy
pair they are.
But "consistency Is a Jewel" to club
women, who usually are terribly right
eous, and how, pray, could the federa
tion go on record as a foe to divorce,
indorsing uniform divorce laws, with
an honorary* president wedded through
the sweet provisions of divorce?' And
so they consistently eliminated the
clause in the constitution that provides
for past presidents becoming honorary
presidents. And thus did the federa
tion remove the "blot on the 'scutch
ion" â if one there was.

The Emperor of Germany usually

to be found in his workroom' at 6. First
there is served to him a cup of tea or
bouillon and a sandwich. Then, light

pings from newspapers and magazines
published all over the world as are
deemed worthy of his attention. At 7
o'clock the Emperor is ready to receive
the reports of his adjutants and the
ministers of state, and to this work he
usually devotes some three hours.
When the person who is to have an
audience is admitted to the room and
makes his bow, the Emperor, who re

Inclines his head in repose, and says
"Please," as a signal for his visitor to
begin, listens attentively to what he
has to communicate, but never makes
any comment. The substance of all the
visitor has said, however, is contained
in the paper that he invariably hands
to the Emperor's secretary at the close
of the audience. These papers are num

their receipt, and after the visitor has
departed the Emperor usually writes
upon the former's communication a

The woman who will do the honors
at the Chinese building at St. Louis
is the wife of the Vice Imperial Com
missioner, Wong Kai Kah. Mrs. Wong
accompanied her husband to America
In time to have a hand in the arrange
ment of the Chinese exhibit. Indeed, to
Mrs. Wong almost . entirely was left
the decorailon of the interior of the

Chinese custom when a member of the
imperial family is to be tn,e occupant,
for the Imperial Commissioner, Prince
Pu Lun, is no less a personage than
the nephew of the Emperor.
Mrs. Wong could not speak English
when she landed in San Francisco, but
she is gradually overcoming this diffi
culty. She is a keen observer of the
social conditions and customs of the
United States, hoping to make her visit
one of profit to her countrywomen as
well, as to herself. She is a little-foot
woman, because her feet were bound
Â»vhile she. was yet too young to have a
voice in the matter. On this, her first
visit outside of China, she has become
even more fully aware than she waa
before of the disadvantages of the cus
tom, although she had long since given
over the absurd tradition of her class
and made declaration of independence
by leaving the feet or her daughters
unbound.
Already she has voiced the wish that
the women of China should be kept
less closely at home, that they should
travel more and study things of which
they now know nothing. Mrs. Wong
believe3 it quite important that women
should study music and embroidery
and house decoration, in all of which
arts she is herself quite accomplished.
It was because of her knowledge -of
house decoration that she was intrust
ed with the interior furnishing of the
Chinese building at St. Louis.â The

A fact that may have considerable

ADVICES from Washington state that Secretary
Hay has sent to the courts of St. Petersburg and
Tokio, through our respective Embassadors at
those places, informal notice that the President of the
United States stands willing to tender his good offices in
the services of peace when the moment for such action
seems auspicious to the warring powers. The note of
Secretary Hay, though couched informally, is, in the
usages of diplomacy, definite and indicative of the strong
desire on the part of this Government to play the part
of mediator.
This is pre-eminently a good stroke on the part of
Hay and the President. It must carry conviction to the
court of St. Petersburg of, the strict fairness and impar
tiality which our Government maintains in the present
war, and it must assure the Czar's Ministers of their
mistake in reckoning with anything but unswerving neu
trality on the part of the United States. To Japan the
offer of pur good offices can have no ulterior meaning
and can bear no more significance than if has in the eyes
of the Russians.
Viewed strictly from the standards of diplomacy the
United States is in a better position to offer itself as a
mediator than any other power. We have no* treaties of
alliance binding us to either of the belligerents. We
have no pacts with China save those relating to the regu-.
lation of trade and the freedom of her open ports. No
past diplomatic act of ours allies us more closely to one
of the warring nations than to the other. Our interest
in the destinies: of the East and the control of the Pacific
is no stronger than that of^ England, of France or of
Germany. Not an inch of territory on the mainland of
Asia is' ours either by treaty rights or by conquest. From
the viewpoint of landed interests, then, we arc absolutely
without the circle of interested nations; the future of
the Asiatic trade has no more momentous significance to
us than to any of the other maritime nations of the
world.
When the time comes for peace preliminaries the lead
ing powers of Europe manifestly cannot play the part
of the dove. England, bound to Japan in alliance,
France tied to the Russian cause, are disqualified. Ger
many is resting under too strong a suspicion of being an
"honest broker" in affairs of the Far East Jo gain the
confidence of Japan at least; Russia would probably
gladly delegate the Kaiser to act as his peacemaker.
Italy is in too delicate a position with regard to her own
status in the sublime concert of powers to attempt any
such delicate role as that of tribune in the war game.
Austria has joint interests with Russia in the Balkans
that would not make for impartiality in judgment.
Of course peace is probably a long way off in the
Orient. Neither the United States nor any other nation
is likely to be called in the very near future to be the
bearer, of the olive branch. To the\ favorable impression
of Hay's joint note to the powers on the limiting of the
field of war there will be added, however, further respect
on the part of our friends across the water for our diplo
matic finesse in thus offering ourselves as arbiters. Hay's
last note adds strength to the already stable prestige of
our diplomacy.
PRESIDENT AS MEDIATOR.
It is quite clear that the recent bril
liant successes of the Japanese have
come upon the peoples of the Con
tinent as lightning from a clear sky.
The comments of the foreign press
display an amazement not a little sur
prising to the Englishman who has
been accustomed for years to look
upon the Japanese as a great nation.
In this matter the British people
have been well served by the press and
by their instinct of travel. They knew
Japan; the Continent did not. While
Frenchmen and Russians appear but
yesterday to have regarded the Jap
anese as a race of uncivilized and
timid dwarfs, the English have been
able to appreciate the Intense strenu
ousness of purpose and heroic aspira
tions of this gifted people. An Asiatic
power ourselves, we knew of â¢vhat
things the Ghoorka was capable, and
the Japanese, it has been well said,
are "Ghoorkas with brains." Eng
land would rather have been surprised
if her ally had failed in this war, for
her seamen and BOldlers since the alli
ance have been in close and intimate
relation with the Japanese.
In France it is becoming recognized
that the task before General Kuro
patkin is one which no general, how
ever great, could accomplish. The
organ of the French general staff, .the
Echo de Paris, declares that the longer
General Kuropatkin delays the graver
will be his peril, and that not the
Japanese but the Russians are in dan
ger of being cut off from' their base.
The conclusion is correct, but it is
evident that it comes as a terrible
shock to Frenchmen, who have always
believed in Russian invincibility. They
are loyal to their ally, as we to ours;
but they might well remember that
even if Russia has to recoil from Man
churia she yet remains a very great
power, and that what she sought,
when she refused in February to ac
cede to the reasonable requests of
Japan, meant the virtual destruction
of Japanese independence â the end of
Japan not only as a great power, but
as a state, and the sub
jection of all Asia by Russia. â London

Target practice is obviously a sub

lent as to details, and. therefore, very
little has been made public concerning
a most remarkable target practice held
by order of the French Government off
Toulon. The turret of "the battleship
Sufi'ren was subjected to the fire of
two shots from a 9.2 Inch gun of the
Massena. A battleship in commission
fully manned and equipped, represent
ing millions of dollars, was thus delib
erately made a target for another ship.
The idea was to ascertain what would
be the effect of impact of shots upon
the turret of a modern battleship. The
range was short in order to minimize
the possibility of not hitting the tur
ret, and^ the turret waa covered witn
additional plating so that there was
no risk of penetration. The report of

The flirt of the six acts is purely
preparatory, Bernhardt making no ap
pearance in it. The scene Is laid at the
Hotel de Noallles, the residence of Gen
eral Lafayete in Paris; time, June, 179L
General Lafayette, the Deputy Barnave
end Count Axel de Fersen discuss the
rumors that the royal family intend to
â¢scape from Paris. Fersen, the devoted
but purely platonic adorer of the
Queen, has made all the plans for the
flight. Of course, he reveals nothing.
But the dot has been discovered by
Madame de Rochereul, a lady in wait-
Ing to the Queen, who is in love with
Fersen. Jealous of Fersen's devotion to
her royal mistress, the resolves to frus
trate the scheme that would bring
them together, and warns Lafayette.
The second act shows the flight from
the Tullleries, and Bernhardt makes
her first entrance on the stage as the
imperious Queen, saddened by the
shadow of her impending fate, present
ing a etriking contrast to the King,
placid, phlegmatic, excellently acted by
M. Chameroy. There is a touching
scene when the royal children are
awakened and dressed by the Queen,
Â«ho embraces them passionately. All
leave Â»the palace disguised â the Queen
as a governess to a Russian nobleman,
the King as her attendant. At the last
moment the noblewoman falls ill and
her place is taken by the traitress,
Madame de Rochereul. Fersen plays
bis part in the escape as a postillion on
one of the four horses which drags the
famous "berline," a â¢species of Noah's
ark on wheels, which the fatuous Louis
Insisted on having built for the purpose.
Sainte Menehould in the evening is
the scene of the third act, which pre
sents a series of vivid pictures. The
suspicions of the crowd are awakened
by the presence of M. de Choiseul's
troops, designed to cover the King's
escape, and the passage of a chaise in
Leonard, the court hairdresser,
travels in advance with the Queen's
casket of Jewels and her secret papers.
Then arrives the immense berline.
Drouet, the local postmaster, a typical
revolutionary patriot, suspicious of
everything and everybody, flashes his
lantern for a moment on the face of the
King. Surely, he thinks, he has seen
that face before. After the carriage
has left he scans a banknote. The face
engraved on it is the same that was re
vealed to him by the light of the Ian
tern â the King's. With a howl of rage
Drouet dashes off on horseback for
Varennes to arouse the town and stay
the flight of the royal fugitives.
It is at Verennes that the fourth act
occurs. Drouet has arrived there be
fore the royal party. When the car
riage arrives and the occupants are
compelled to descend, it is Drouet who
questions them, Drouet who refuses
to be satisfied, Dxouet who tells the
traveling lady's "lieutenant," the King
in dieguise, that he is very like "some
body else." But Drouet's zeal would
have been baffled had it not been for
the perfidious Mme. de Itochereul,
who contrives to reveal an informal
ity in the passport which affords
grounds for delaying the progress of
the party. Then is brought forward
an old Royalist, whose loyalty com
pletes the betrayaL Recognizing the
King, he falls on his knees, exclaim
ing "Ah, sire!" and kisses the royal
band, to which the King replies with
simple dignity. "Yes, I am your King,"
and then, being hungry, sits down to
discuss a pie and a bottle of burgundy
while the indignant Queen displays
her haughty disdain and, contempt for
the rabble. She has still some hopes
of escape. The royal cavalry may/ar
rive In time. But in Its place comes
the National Guard, dispatched from
Paris to arrest the party and the his
toric flight comes to an abrupt end.
In the fifth act the spectators are
suddenly transported from spectacu
lar tableau* to the realms of simple
tragedy in which Bernhardt reveal*
the intensity of her powers and
Â¦cores her crowning- triumph. On the
way back to Paris the royal family
has stopped for the night at the pal
ace of the Bishop of Meaux. The
Queen, foreseeing tho end, abandons
herself to agonized reflections. Bar
nave, who has been sent by the Na
tional 'Assembly to bring back the
sovereigns, obtains an audience with
her. instead of the insolent, plebe
ian ruffian whom she had expected
to encounter he stands before- her a

IN many respects last week was the most unsatisfactory
one yet since -the current recession in trade com
menced. The reports were almost uniformly, un
favorable and included some features which are not at all
liked by the financial interests. Chief among these is the
steadily increasing abundance of money, which is now a
drug in the market.
For several weeks currency has been flowing from
rural districts into the large trade centers and thence
into New York. This tide, which became evident a short
time ago, has now grown to large proportions. It U
taken to indicate a falling- off in business In the country
at large, as the decrease in trade is diminishing the de
mand for funds in corresponding degrees. The currency
redemption of bank notes at the New York sub-treasury
thus far in May is running at the rate of nearly $1,000,000
per day. Ordinarily much of this money would. find its
way into investment in standard railway and industrial
shares in rhe stock market, but very little of it is'fol
lowing that course now, for there is no disposition to
invest in anything which bears the Wall-street brand.
People are leaving stocks alone, but the large and
growing accumulations of capital must be got out into
circulation somehow or other to earn something for their
possessors, so they are being employed in gathering in
blocks of reasonably safe bonds. This is^[Uustrated by
the demand for the recent Russian and Japanese loans,
the New York City bond issue of $37,000,000 and the
subscription of $167,000,000 for $35,000,000 Cuban bonds,
taking the aggregate as subscribed in this country and
Europe, for this country is not the only one by any
means that has a surplus of funds. The fact is, Eng
land and France also have large lines of funds to spare.
The gold holdings of the Bank of France, with last week's
increase of $28,760,000, have risen to $546,860,000, which
is far beyond anything in the previous history of the
bank, according to statements received from New York.
There is another unfavorable feature attracting atten
tion, which is the number of small banking establishments
which' are suspending here and there every few days.
None of these institutions are large and they are mostly
in country districts., but they are good representatives of
the condition of business in their different sections, and
this new condition is therefore being watched by the
larger financial interests of the great cities to which these
institutions are tributary.
Still another unsatisfactory condition is the continued
decline in railway earnings, which- has become a set
tled current, and which, with the reductions in expendir
tu/es by the railways, is taken as a convincing affirma
tion of the decrease' in distributive trade throughout the
country. The decrease in these earnings is slight, being
only 3.3 per cent in May compared with the same month
in 1003, but it is its continuity that gives it its importance.
The steady decrease in the bank clearings is also at
tracting attention. The decrease last week was 14.6 per
cent, compared with the .same week in 1903, and every
city of importance in the country except St. Louis and
Minneapolis was on the wrong side of the exhibit. The
former city showed an increase of 11 pef cent, but this is
a local condition, explainable by the exposition, which
is bringing a good deal of cash into the town. Minne
apolis has been reporting rather more demand for flour
during the past week', which probably gives that place its
small gain of two per cent over last year. The failures
for the week were S26, against 206 last year, but included
none of serious importance.
Commercial reports last week called attention to a
perceptible increase in jobbing and retail business in
many sections of the West, owing to '-nproved weather,
though the movement of merchandise was admittedly be
hind that of last year. The same improvement in the
weather helped the cereal crops along materially and
gave the crop prospects of the country a brighter aspect.
It looks now as if we were to have plenty of money and
grain .during the rest of the year, though there will be.no
overproduction of the latter, as the general aggregate
of the crops, according to current estimates, will be
rather below that of last year owing^to the cold, wet
and backward spring. 1 - _ . . â¢ " .
The industrial conditions are not making a very-fa
vorable exhibit. Many of the leading industries show a
gradual slowing down, with frequent closing of factories
here and there and an increasing number of men* losing
their employment. Some woolen and footwear mills are
reporting conditions rather better, and raw wool has
been moving oft very, well of late, but more idle cotton
machinery is reported.
The staples show very little variation from conditions
which have prevailed for some weeks. Provisions con
tinue in large supply all over the country, and while a
better buying demand at Chicago has been observable,
little confidence in its continuance is expressed. The
iron and steel trades continue to send in poor reports;
and conditions in this industry-are vastly different from
those* which prevailed last year and for several years pre
vious. Buyers now find no trouble in getting prompt de
liveries. In fact, the trouble now is to find buyers
enough to deliver to.
As already mentioned, the three Pacific Coast States
are thus far showing very little of the falling off in busi
ness characteristic of the situation over the mountains.
We have this advantage, and it ~iHs fair to stay with us
indefinitely, that we are the supply area for a great deal
of produce used by the Orient, particularly when two of
its nations are at war, as at present. They want our
grain, hay and other forms of feed arid forage, and they
will continue to want them, which we will find a very
important factor in our coast business henceforth. This
imparts a good deal of confidence to financial and trade
interests and makes the outlook for us very cheerful.
As long as we can supply large quantities of our field
produce to tlje Orient we need not look for any serious
hard times, {"hough those lines which depend upon the
East will of course sympathize with the rise and fall
of trade conditions there. At present some complaint of
less demand for goods is heard in the wholesale districts,
but it must not be forgotten that summer is now practi
cally upon us and that midsummer - is always a quiet
period, even when business is lively. We on this coast
are all right.
cautions against accidents due to natural causes alone,
Lynde has something to say regarding the fatal results
of criminal negligence and inattention on the part of
employes whose hands are heavy with the responsibilities
of human life placed in them. Â»
' "Here and there," says Lynde, "in the list of accidents
caused by sheer inadequateness on the part of the human
agent is the wreck due to criminal negligence. The man
who 'thinks'he is right does not mean to take chances;
his intentions are good and may lack nothing but
the priceless quality of thoroughness. But the man who
deliberately jeopardizes the lives of others rather than
endure a little personal discomfort or take a little extra
trouble is a moral as. well as a mental degenerate and
the adjustment of his case asks for the impaneling of a
murder jury."
The writer- 1 goes on to assert that such cases can
only be weeded out when public sentiment demands a
rigid enforcement of the law in the punishment . of
offenders or when the railroad itself exerts such a fine
power of discretion in the selection of its employes
that the admission of such a man to service on its lines
will be impossible. This latter remedy can never enter
into effect until the railroads establish regularly graded
schools for the training of their operatives, just as the
Northern Pacific has a college for the instruction of its
corps of clerical workers. At the present time the man
who is taken into the employ of the railroad straight
from the farm or the shop has to work out his own
salvation in the way that seems to him the easiest;
there is no delegated central authority to have direct
supervision over his training, and his competency or
otherwise cannot be fully determined until he is brought
face to face with the test;
The other check uport railroad disasters due to crim
inal negligence that Lynde mentions â the rigid inquiry
into the causes by the law and the - punishment of
offenders â is the surest safeguard as long as the present
conditions, of employing operatives obtain. 'Too often
the power of the railroad over a country jury, either
actually exerted or greatly feared, brings about a careful
glossing over of the facts of the case in their findings
and the power of punishment remains solely with the
railroad. Our grim roster of 8000 odd killed every year
in railroad travel must surely call for remedial measures
of no uncertain character; the Coroner's jury called to
sit upon cases arising out of disaster on the rails is not
the least factor of prevention that needs strengthening.

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
6SAX DIEGO. May 28. â This city of
*m&Â£iifest destiny has attracted much
attention from the outside in the last
year. Its growth has been satisfac
tory and its future is very bright. A
campaign of education has drawn peo
ple to San Diego and crowded trains
and hotels during all seasons of the
year give evidence of the wide-spread
fame of the community. Ideal con
ditions insure growth and interest.
Climate stands first; situation on a
ei'lendid harbor is an advantage that
has incalculable value. Work, ener
getic and public spirited work, has
been the leverage to add prosperity
that is now manifest
Among the organizations in Cali
fornia that have toiled to make good
t:mes for their respective communi
ties, the San Diego Chamber of Cam
merce holds strong position. Very
largely through the efforts of the
Chamber of Commerce and especially
of its harbor improvements commit
tf-e, the national Government has been
induced 10 spend money in the mak
ing of San Diego Bay the finest har
bor on the coast, next to San Francis
co. The people and the Government
ranted a greater depth of water on
the outer bar, but no appropriation
for deepening it was passed until the
Chamber of Commerce raised a fund
cf $1000 and with a dredger went out
on the bar to spend that amount of
money in proving that with the bar
Â©nee cut away it would not again fill
in. That experiment brought the ap
propriation and now the harbor can
boast of thirty feet of water over the
'â¢outer bar at low water, where, be
fore the efforts of the Government,
seconded by the Chamber of Com
merce, therf? was formerly but twenty
one and a haJf feet. In eomething the
tame way have come the appropria
tions for the outer Jetty and for the
dredging of the middle ground, both
of which improvements are now in
j-rogress.
The dredging of the outer bar was
carried on several miles out >to sea
from the tnd of the jetty. The middle
ground dredging will take out some
of the eand bar formed inside the bay
where there is a depth of eighteen
to twenty feet of water, and where
thirty feet are desired. The entrance
from Ballast Point across to Xorth,
I&I&hd, near the shore end of the Jet
ty, is only 1600 feet. Through that en
trance the tide water for twenty-two
square miles of bay passes four times
each twenty-four hours.
GREAT PARK AREA.
The special committee on park im
provement of the Chamber of Com
merce is largely to be credited for
originating work on the large public
park of 1400 acres, larger by a Email
amount than Golden Gate Park in
San Francisco. Again the support of
the people v.as asked for and was
given. A fund of $20,000 was secured
by subscription and the committee was
placed in charge of the work. The
special permission of the Council and
Board of Works 'authorized this. Mr.
Mansion supplied a fund almost as
large as that raised by the people, and
Samnel Parsons & Company, land
scape architects in the country, came
Â¦west to assist with presence and ad
vica* -The entire plan of improve
ment from the entire 1400 acres has
been made out and hundreds of trees
end shrubs have been Mt out The
park committee baa from time to
tim> reported progress to the Cham
ber, but the work has been done by
and under the supervision of the com
mittee, and it has been well done. In
future years the improvement of the
Immense area will take large suras. of
money, but through the efforts of this
committee of the/Chamber of Com
merce a start has/t>een well made.
Â«fhe Improvement of the park by,
thvt committee end its chairman with
out calling upon the city for funds led
to an offer by John H. Gay. to supply
I the oil fcr making two oiled boulevards 1
through the park and out beyond the j
I saoie to the Normal School. The offer ;
was accompanied with the condition
that the city or some one else should
prepare the roads and oil them. The
tender to the city was made through
I the Chamber of Commerce and it was
j accepted by the city. Ttie park com
j m!Â»tee of the Chamber of Commerce
j took care of the proposition as to the
. two bc-ulevards through the park, a
distance of about two and two-thirds
! miles. The portion of the drive out-Â»
j side of the park was prepared for the
j oil by the city's street force, but In
order that the expense sliould not be
too great a drain on the street fund
of the city the Chamber of Commerce,
j through its committee on roads and
I boulevards, raised money to be ex
! pended in labor on this particular
j driveway. The offer of Mr. Gay, to
simply furnish the oil, has cost him
close to $4500, for the driveway is seven
miles long, and through the Chamber
of Commerce he directed that enough
oil be used to make the beat oiled drive
in Southern California. -
IMPROVING THF. DRIVES.
Another offer of a somewhat similar.
character was made through the
Chamber .of Commerce by Colonel Al
G. Spalding, known to every Amer
ican who ever played baseball, whose
home is now at Point Ixrnia. The drive
to and along Point Loma is the most '
sightly Â«n earth, not excepting that
around the heights overlooking the bay
of Naples. r ;;.
In order to add to its attractiveness
Mr. Spalding. through the Chamber of
Commerce, offered to Improve the drive
and oil it thoroughly from the Rose
ville Postofflce, through the portion of
the Point owned and occupied by the
Theosophlcal Society and Universal
Brotherhood, to the military reserva
tion, if the city would likewise improve
the roadway from the Courthouse in
the city of San Diego proper to the
postoffice mentioned. Once more the
Chamber of Commerce - came forward
to assist in the acceptance of the offer
which had been made through it, and
the committee on roads and boule
vards secured between $1800 and $2000
with which to assist the city in carry
ing out Its portion of the improvement
proposed. The work on both boule
vards is now going on." The chairman
of the. Chamber of Commerce commit
tee on roads. Dr. Grove. Is not the
least watchful of the superintendents
of the work for which he has raised
close to $3500. * 'â¢'Â¦Â¦; -*â¢?'''.*
Through the efforts of the chamber
six improvement club3 were formed by
the citizens of as many sections of the
city. These c!ubs are looking out for the
little improvements of their particular
sections. Committees are appointed
by the clubs on the different streets
and in ways best known to themselves
they succeed in getting, the streets
cleaned up, vacant lots freed' of their
collected rubbish and. start the. resi
dents to aek that their street be grad
ed, curbed and sldewalk*,ed. TbÂ« work
has proven quite Inexpensive but ex
ceedingly effective for the amount of
outlay. /
The suggestion was made that the
University of California would like to
have its biological school located here,
and a special committee of the cham
ber took hold of the work with the re
sult that the school is now open and
a local corporation formed to support
It for three years, by which time the
Regents of the University are expected
to t>e in position to take care of it
The committee having charge of this
particular piece of work Is at present
laying plans to secure government aid
for the station and the attendance for
at least a portion of the time of the
Fish Commission steamer Albatross.
In this the 'chamber will succeed,' for it
has formed the "habit of success" in
what it undertakes.
GUARDS ITS INTERESTS.
AH of the committees are working
committees and they accomplish some
thing all the time. Â¦ To the committee
on horticulture of the San Diego Cham-
ber of Commerce the entire lemon
growing portion of the State owes
thanks for the continuation this year
of the $1 rate on lemc-ns until the loth
of June, instead, as the railroads
planned, to have the rate go out
of existence on the 31st day. of March.
Because of the excessively cold winter
In the East the lemon growers were
getting no advantage of what was
termed the winter rate on lemons, as
there was not the least demand for
them. The fact came to the attention
of the Chamber of Commerce and Mr.
Akerman of the committee on horticul
ture took it up. * In the board of direct
ors' room of the San Diego Chamber
of Commerce Vice President Paul Mor
ton and Messrs. Biasell, Biddle and
Chambers of the Santa Fe road heard
the arguments that convinced them
that an extension of the 51 rate would
be the proper thing. It was extended
further even than was requested.
It is not often that a Chamber of
Commerce Is called upon to go into
the field of sports, but when the San
Diego Institution is called upon to do
so, it does It with no more hesitation
than it would look into a transporta
tion problem in which the community
Is Interested. Last summer Sir
Thomas Lipton sent a $1500 trophy to
the Corinthian Yacht Club of San
Diego to be raced for by the thirty
footers .of the Pacific Coast annually
off the mouth of San Diego harbor.
It was necessary for San Diego to have
a yacht to compete in the race and
the Corinthians' had none capable. of
protecting the trophy. Such races off
the bay will certainly prove an adver
tising ca*cd for San Diego, while the
failure of San Diego to have a yacht
in the race would be an advertisement
with a minus sign in front of it. There
fore Grant Conard of the advertising
committee took charge of matters and
twice formed a syndicate to purchase
a yacht. Once he was going to pur
chase the Cadillac of Detroit, but some
one got ahead of him. When Presi
dent Peters of the chamber went East
and found that the Detroit, which
was the only rival of the Cadillac,
could be purchased, he w!red'-the fact
to Mr. Conard and in two hours a sec
ond syndicate was formed and tbe
yacht was bought by wire. The yacht
Is now on the way out here and it is
confidently expected that she will
prove what Chamber of Commerce un
dertakings down this way have al
ways proved â a success, j
AN* ENERGETIC BODY.
Recently the members of the board
of directors have been considering
the advisability of seeking a new home
for the chamber, and a special com
mittee, with William Clayton as chair
man, has been named to make what
investigations seem to be necessary.
The committee has but just got organ
ized, with a sub-committee or two
named. The outlook is bright, the
prospects for plenty of work for the
chamber are good and the chances
that there ever will be a lack of inter
est in that work are exceedingly slim.
What work will present itself can only
be guessed. One aim of the year is a
membership of 1000. That will be ac
complished and whatever tasks come
to the front will be undertaken with
confidence that : success : will continue
to wait upon the efforts of this or
ganization of San Diego business men.
The, railroad committee has been a
hard working committee and it has
accomplished much. From the loyal
citizens who believed that the cham
ber should be supported, a subscription
of $30,000 was raised, and with that
amount of cash a survey was pushed
through to Yuma and a reconnoissance
survey was carried through Arizona
and Xew Mexico. The result of the
work of the committee brought C. W.
French here,' through whom < it ' is ex
pected, that the road will be built and
other enterprises started, including the

There are no open meetings of the
members for the transaction of busi

ADVERTISES RESOURCES.
The chamber carries on the publica
tion of Homeland, embellished with
much illustration and devoted to San
Diego County affairs. It has run
through a half-dozen editions of 50,000
each, and has become known as one. of
the best publications for the purpose
intended â to reach the people anfl com
pel perusal. Since the first of the year
an edition of 50,000 of Homeland has
been printed, besides 50.000 pamphlets on
San Diego County. 50,000 small circu
lars and 5000 cards. These particular
editions will be used largely for distri
bution at the World's Fair. Between
January 1 and April 30 the chamber
received -1550 letters and sent out 1394
specially written letters, besides 21,037
pieces of literature by mail or express.
During those four months there were
30,000 visitors in the Chamber of Com
merce rooms and 25,000 pieces of litera
ture-were-distributed from the secre
tary's office.
The work of the chamber has not
been devoted to hot-air booming of the
city. On the other hand its poliev and
practice have been verv conservative.
It has set forth the climatic advan
tages of the section as a place of resi
dence. It has given prominence to
ways in which money may be made,
but health and happiness rather than
immense wealth have been the strong
points in all arguments for residence
here.
The result of this campaign of educa
tion has been to draw attention to San
Diego as a resort at all seasons of the
year and to a very striking degree. Tha
crowded trains and hotels during both
summer and winter give evidence of
the wide spread of the city's fame, and
the arrival of hundreds of new resi
dents gives more evidence that adver
tising pays, for the Chamber of Com
merce has not limited its advertising
to the pamphlets sent out, but has
prepared and paid for page advertise
ments at a time in the Sunday issues
of Eastern dailies, all of which made
for the good of both San Diego and the
whole of California, for the San Diego
Chamber of Commerce has never lost
sight of the fact that the advancement
of the State is the advancement of San
Diego and the progress of the city is
the progress of California to an ex
tent.
The Chamber of Commerce maintains
two exhibits, the one already described
as located in the rooms here, and. an
exhibit almost as large at the rooms of
the Los Angeles Chamber of Com
merce. For the remainder of the pres
ent year the chamber will ship fresh
exhibits, at least twice a week, to St.
Louis. The country people, even to
many miles away, are warm friends or
the Chamber of Commerce, realizing
that it is doing good for them as well
as for the city of San Diego.

PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarion's treatise that is
so electrifying the world to-day. Ha is no
imitator. His work Is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you wbai
you deelre to know and works in the open
light. /
He is as conspicuous for his wonderful oo-
cult analysis as he Is for his original ex-
pression and vfvid truthfulness.
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE h* will
griye you a full life readrng for $1. A test is
of little value; when the mind is troubled you
need more substantial aid and advice. This
is JuBt what PROF. LIVINGSTONE gives
you when you call on him for a first-class
clairvoyant reading.
He aeks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let PROF.
LIVINOSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
' suggest the remedy. - > ' Â¦

G. H. WILLSON. Local 'Forecaster.-
G. Schmeser turned up at the Harbor Hos
pital yesterday and wanted to have a long
cut near his jugular vein dressed. HÂ« said
that he Is a porter at tha Hotel Royal. 126
Ellis street, and that he resides at 25>i Moss
street. He stated that on Saturday night he
was walking down Keamy street when he met
a friend of his named "Joe." They wandered
together along the .purloins of the North End
and imbibed a few. In fact they imbibed a
good many "fews."
Finally Joe invited Schmeser up to his room,
on the corner of Sutter street and Grant
avenue, and there, ac-'v-dlng to the allegation^
Joe tried to slash Schmeser with a razor, and
during the operation stole. $15 from Schmeser' s
pocket and disappeared with it.
Schmeser says he doesn't know Joe's last

Tfcs Oceanic Steamship Company's steamer*
Marlpoaa, J. Reunle, commander, sailed for
Tahiti yesterday at 11 a. m. Sha had a royal
sendoff from a large bunch of friends of the
passengers who were going to the. island. This
trip Is growing to be very popular, and every
voyage sees on increase in the passenger list.
On the present voyagp are a number of tourists
from tha | East who came to San Francisco
especially to .take t&ls trip.
Following Is a list of the passengers: Mrs.

The Colby family opened at the Or
pheum yesterday afternoon In their
clever musical entertainment. They
introduce new specialties, and their
quartet work is good. Ferrar, Cole &
Co. present an original comedy sketch,
"His College Chum," which* offers
complications and fun. . Gaston and
Stone in "A Whiff of the Briny" ap
pear in grotesque makeup, and present
their turn In the same : fashion. Pow
ers Brothers as Gaston and Alphonse
do trick bicycle riding.
Marcel's living art studies and bas
reliefs still hold interest, and some of
the settings have been changed for this
week. Charles H. Burke, Grace La Rue
and their "inky" boys repeat' their act
of last week and are rewarded, with ap
plause. Belle Gordon,, the phenomenal
nthlete, in an. exhibition of bagpunch-
Ing. and Al Lawrence,' who is a mimic
above the ordinary/ complete, the pro
gramme.
Robert Elliott as'Zaccario was satis
fyingly villainous and quite acceptable,
but for his habit of galloping to the
ends of his lines. Of the others in the
cast there was little requiring com
ment. The presentation is worth see-
Ing and will hold the boards until Sat
urday night.
The play Is not one that gives Mac-
Dowell full Bcope for any of his pow
ers except the passive ones. Only twice
or thrice was he permitted to raise his
large voice above the attention com
manded by the poses of his larger
form.
Melbourne MacDowell's bill for the
week at the Grand is "Gismonda,"'an
other of the Sardou plays. It opened
at a matinee yesterday to a fair
crowd, but last night the house was
small. The play did not arouse the re
sponse it deserved. Al uc Do well had the
sympathies of his auditors, but the
honors all went to Miss Ethel Fuller,
in the title role. Those who have com
plained that Miss Fuller is "cold"
would enjoy her Gismonda, ,
Lee Johnson has. provided plenty of
attractive tunes. Carleton! some tune
ful lyrics and there .is a' pretty and
well-dresssed chorus to the good.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
'..; Miss' *Aug' has .chic and originality in
large degree, and ; her- act was the hit
bf.the evening. .Mr. Clark, who replac-
en'Mr. Blake, is also a noteworthy ad :
dUion;t<f the Fischer forces. He sings
.'a 1 fine song, 'and has dash and ease"and
good ."stage" presence. ; Miss Hull "also
has, : a ; very; prettily set r song,- t'Star/.
light,'-' and" the rest of the act Is thor
oughly, enjoyable.- .The .famous-/'Ra
dium" dance,. .owing to " a ." breakdown'
of the .machinery,' was 'not given 'and
will not be -put" pn until -next '.Sunday
night. "The singers Â«were laden' with
flowers. â¢'.Â¦.Â¦Â¦â¢'â¢â¢ ' "
Mr. Judson C. Brusie, who is the au
thor of "U.- S.," has not kept on his
"I. O. U." level, nor was the new com
pany able to fill up the gaps. Pointless,
weatherworn as tq fun, and with not
even the hemi-demi-semi realism im
perative even to 'the elastic illusion of
burlesque, the whole act left one bored.
It had moments, however. MJss
Aug's French song was mildly good,
but set me to fearing as to the fate of
my prophecy as to her hit. Ben Dillon,
who 'was thunderously welcomed, also
distinguished himself by the shortest
speech on record in reply â "Thanks."
Then Roy Alton showed a pleasant
tenor in "The Sweet Ambered Juice"â
whatever that may be. (You drink it
in cups.)
Fischer's new dancers, the Garrity
sisters, also debuted â as Blanche
Bates would have said if she had
thought 'of. it. They are asrile.if not
particularly graceful, as their kind
runs to at the moment, and they do
not suggest the necessity of a head
rest, as pretty Hope and Emerson
sometimes . did. > No doubt f they
would seem more graceful If they did
not sing. They trv to, and one feels
that they are really givinp enough for
the money without. The climax of the
act Is finished by the appearance of
Miss Caroline Hull, the current lead
ing lady, in "Look Out for the Coon in
the Moon." Nor did Miss Hull make a
deep, deep mark on things. The ne>
leading lady has a basso contralto, and
rather vague ideas as to tts use. but she
has again something of the aplomb and
presence that made Maude Amber such
a useful person for the position.
As to the Dutch and Hebrew combi
nation, up to date the bone and sinew
of the Fischer organization, Mr. Brusie
gave. them nothing worth doing. And
the combination Is a new one. As Mr.
Clark sang, "We have two Jews and
one . Dutchman." Al Fields, . well
known In Orpheum circle's, has the part
of .the long;Dutchman'and.Torke. and
Adams V are -the â¢ two ;â¢Â¦ .Hebrews, ' and

It looked at the end of the first act
of ".U.'S." last night, rather as though
the new exits were about the nicest
things about Fischer's reopening. The
exits are all there. In fact the frpnt
of the house is all exit. The theater
can, it is claimed, be emptied in two
and a half minutes. And it was only
the hope that springs eternal that pre
vented a sudden jam on the O'Farrell
street sidewalk last night. A large
house, of cours'e, attended the reopen
ing of the burlesqueries. TPiece, com
pany and part of the theater were
new, and Fischer's has a faithful con
gregation. But this,, and the two hun
dred and fifty new members that the
enlargement of the theater permits,
were unable to make the piece go as
to its first installment.
With his brother, Martin left home
February 19, expecting to return in
two or three days. The peculiar ac
tions of his dog: "were responsible for
the finding of the body by M. T. Jones,
who was fishing in Dickey River. He
followed the dog a few rods into the
woods and soon came upon the body.
The cane- of the dying man had drop
ped- and lay at his feet. A few yards
away was a cave scooped out under
a fallen log where Martin Ertle had
probably epent the night before his
death.
TACOMA. May 2?.â Martin and John
Ertle perished in February of hunger
and exposure in the Qulllayute forest
of Clallam County. They owned a
rench near the Mora postomce, went
out hunting and never returned.
The body of Martin Ertle was found
Bitting upright against a hemlock tree
on the banks of Dickey River. He had
evidently become lost, sat down ex
hausted and died from hunger. The
body of John Ertle is Bald to have
been located.

.â¢ -The.. French, torpedo transport
Foudre .left -.Toulon April 23 for the
â¢Asiatic station, carrying three torpedo
vedettes for service in Chinese waters.
These boats are 60 fe<Â»t in length. 8.5
feet beam, and, drawing 4 feet Jl
inches, displace 14.6 tons. The en
gines are of 250 horsepower, develop
ing a speed of seventeen knots, under
which their coal supply of nine tons
will last for forty-three knots. The
boats have one torpedo tube and carry
one officer and six men. Nine of these
boats were built by Creujzot in 1890-94.
The Foudre was built in 1895 to cor
respond with â¢ the British torpedo
transport Vulcan. â¢ She is of 6086 tons
and about eighteen knots speed. The
ship can carry ten sixty-feet vedettes,
or small torpedo-boats, on galiows
frames^ and has her workshops and
machine tools for, Repairs of torpedo
appliances. Torpedoes, mines and ex
plosives are stowed lu storerooms un
der a protective deck 4.6 inches thick
on the slopes and 2.6 inches on the
flatj^ and . large subdivided cofferdams
are built around the sides. The Foudre
is well adapted for the service intend
ed and the idea of transforming her
into a cruiser some years ago was
abandoned, as the lofty and unpro
tected sides would have made a failure
for cruising and fighting purposes.
There is a case before the United
States Supreme Court, which, if decided
adversely to the Navy Department, is'
likely to. cost this country several mil
lions of dollars. John Smith, an en
listed man, was tried ana convicted
by courtmartial, and part of his sen
tence was. forfeiture of pay. He "sued
in the Court of Claims for the loss of
pay and got judgment on the grounds
that the sentence was illegal because
he had not been furnisned with the
charges and specifications at the time
of his arrest, as prescribed by the Re
vised Statutes and paragraph 1839 of
the Navy Regulations. John Smith
was not furnished with the charges
until four days before his trial. The
object of the'law, which is to give the
accused opportunity. to prepare his de
fense, was thus defeated through the
ignorance or. arbitrariness of the court,
and it is * feared that a large
number of officers and enlisted men
have been . courtmartialed during the
past forty years whose cases are simi
lar to that of John Smith. The' hear
ing comes up before the Supreme Court
during the October term.

$33,000, making a total of $461,000. The
cost of commission varies, of course,
according to the service of the ship,
but, judging from the expenditure of
coal, it is quite apparent that , the
British battleship spends more time at
sea than the American ship. The
highest coal bill during 1902-03 of any
United States vessel of war was that
of the armored cruiser New York of
about $100,000.
The British cruiser Medea is still
carrying out the competitive trials of
the Yarrow boilers, with which she is
fitted, against the Durr boilers in the
Medusa. The Medea's latest perform
ances under service conditions was a
trip from Portsmouth to Gibraltar at
its highest speed, which was made at
an average of twenty knots. On the
return voyage the ship encountered a
heavy storm in the Bay of Biscay,
which reduced her average hours' run
to 16% knots! The Medea and three
others of the same type, were built in
1888, but none of them came up to the
calculated speed of twenty knots dur
ing the, four hours' -steam trial : and
the - highest." speed reached 'was only
eighteen;. knots.\ The", performance .of

, The two battleships building in Eng
land for the Japanese navy have been
named Katori and Kashima. Their ar
mament is to consist of four 12-inch
guns, two in each turret forward and
aft; four 10-inch, placed singly in tur
rets-in the broadside; twelve 6-inch,
of which ten are in the citadel and two
on the upper deck. The secondary
battery is composed of twelve 12
pounders, three 3-pounders and six ma
chine guns. The elevation of the 12
inch guns is 26 feet above the water
line, the 10-inch guns are 22 feet and
the 6-inch battery guns are at a height
of 13 feet 2 inches. The projectiles
weigh 850, 500 and 100 pounds, in the
order named. ' The- weight of the
12-inch gun, of 4 6.7 caliber length, is
59 tons; that of the 10-inch is 30 tons,
and the 6-inch gun, of 47 caliber
length weigh 8Va tons each. The tor
pedo outfit consists of five under-water
tubes, and in addition provision Is
made for carrying two 56-foot torpedo
boats in cradles.
MAINTENANCE OP WARSHIPS.
A. torpedo boat destroyed was seized
by the British Government at Palmer's
yard, .Yarrow-on-the^Tyne, on Hay 6.
it being feared that the boat was about
to be sold to' either Japan or Russia.
The commissioner of customs is keep
ing a sharp lookout for all vessels that
are suitable for war purposes in order
not to experience a repetition of the
Alabama award by which England had
to pay $16,000,000 for its violation of the
neutrality laws. The boat seized was
built on speculation, five of the type
having been constructed for the Brit
ish navy two years ago. The Admi
ralty then changed the type from 30
knots to 25% knots and the boat was
awaiting a foreign purchaser. It is
conceded, however, that the Govern
ment will pay for the boat it has con
fiscated.

San Francisco will play two games with
Portland to-day before going to Los Angeles
for a week. The games will be called accord
ing to the usual Sunday schedule â at Oakland
this morning and at Recreation Park at 2:30
this afternoon. Dugdale may try a youngster
named Connor in the morning, but may decide
on Druhot. Jones will serve the slants for
the locals. In the afternoon Phil Knell will
oppose -Â«+ther Ike Butler or Ham Iburg.
San Francisco won its first Sunday game of
the season yesterday and Captain Irwin con
siders the hoodoo has been dispelled.
Umpire Tom Brown has been sent transpor
tation" to Washington. D. C. by President
Bert and will proceed West at once. Brown is
the famous player of former days who used to
speed around the bases In such rare form for
Oakland. In the last few seasons his connec
tion with baseball baa been confined to umpir
ing I nthe National League. Probably McDon
ald or Huston will retire when Brown arrives.
Massey will go to Los Angeles with the
locals, but will not be called upon to plajr ex
cept in case of emergency. His slowness
around the bag has not been offset by redeem
ing in the National League. Probably McDon
doomed. tor release. Personally Massey is a
crand chap, but -he does not " appear fast
enough for tbla league.
Manager Harrim, is delighted with Htnry
Reljz and with good cause. The reformed
player has done great service since his return.
Miller and Yerkes will not go on the trip.
The former Is confined to the house as a result
' of belnz struclc on the head with a pitched
ball and Yerkes is suffering from a slashed
flnsrer on his pitching hand, sustained while
shaving himself. Â» ; â¢ . â¢

DELMAR SELECTIONS.
The special event between . South
Side Jack ' O'Brien and Abe Label
promises to be almost as Interesting
as the main bout.
Walter Moreno and Joe Long, two
amateur heavy weights, will clash to
morrow night before the Bay City
Club at the Mechanics' Pavilion An
nex. The men are in good shape and
are evenly matched in every . particu
lar and much interest is centered in
the contest. Long is a slight favorite
in the betting, but there are many who
believe Moreno will be awarded the
decision after a hard contest.
Walter Moreno and Joe Ix>ng Are
* Carded for Bay City Club's
Main Event.
HEAVY WEIGHTS TO MEET
IN A FOUR-ROUND BOUT
in ths first inning with two men on
bases. In the third the locals opened
up on Overall arid drove him to the
bench. Jay Hughes was back iii the
game for the first time in several
weeks and 'had everything his own
way when hits meant runs.
In the morning game at Tacoma
Umpire O'Connell was chased off the
lot by an angry .crowd whose dis
pleasure he had incurred by calling a
hit made by Sheehan a foul. The ball
struck the left field fence Just inside
the pole, but the umpire could not
see it At this stage the Tigers were
making a hard up-hill fight and would
likely have won had the hit been al
lowed. Effan made two home runs.

The shÂ«Â»rtenders were In great luck
yesterday 'at Ingleside Coursing Park,
where' a general of the favor
ites was the feature of an ideal day
for sport. The cool, bracing weather
was probably the only thing that
saved the life of more than one dog,
for the hares proved an unusually wild
lot and wore out some of the best
hounds entered. More than a score
of courses were of two minutes'-dura
tion, requiring relief dogs for the kill
ing. In half a dozen cases it 1 took
three mniutes or more to end Mr.
Jack and one course closed with six
dogs \n the field. The natural upshot
of such fierce tests of canine stamina
was a fist full of surprises for the
talent.

tators witnessed the swift sport of the
first day's shooting. The opening shot
was fired by Dr. W. S. George of An
tioch, Cal., president of the associa
tion. More than 12,000 blue rocks were
trapped.
The tournament will continue this
morning and afternoon, the most In
teresting of the day's contests being
the 100- bird race, In which J. W. Brod
erick challenges Clarence Nauman to

eral events. .

on a basis of 120 birds shot at were as
follows: Broderlck broke 108; Forster

The series of Gaelic football games
btJns played each Sunday at the Pre
sidio athletic grounds attracted -a
larger crowd than usual yesterday, and
these in attendance were amply re
warded by the sport they witnessed.
There were two games during the af
tetr.oon, the first resulting in a tie be
tween the McBrides and the Wolfe
Tones by a score of 3 to 3. The second
game v as won by the Parnells from the
Kmeralus by a score of 8 to 1. â¢
When time was called for the first
half of the game between the Mc-
Brides and the Wolfe Tones there was
general prediction that the game would
b<Â» hotly contested. The prophecy
proved true, for the teams were evenly
matched and both sides put up a good
game. Following was the line-up:
McBrides â C. Desmond, D. S. EcanneH, J.
Cochran. J. Corcoran. P. Golien, V. Donlne,

The best game of the afternoon was
between the Parnells and the Emeralds.
The first half resulted in a tie. Both
teams, played rapidly, but they scored
only one point each. In the second
half the Parnells appeared to have put
new life into their playing and by hard
work prevented their opponents from
scoring. The following was the line
up:

Lost Chord, the black and white
daughter of the English greyhound
Fetter Free, won the open stake yes
terday at Union Coursing Park from
Haphazard by default. The hares
proved an unusually strong lot and
caused the withdrawal of a number of
greyhounds.
Lost Chord defeated in turn Rene
gade Apache, Charter Member. Ruby
Sankey. the Referee and Duhallow. Sea
Lion was withdrawn in the semi-final
round and Haphazard secured a bye.
The hare proved a strong one and ran
two minutes and twenty-two seconds.
Haphazard was then withdrawn, as he
could make no showing in the deciding
course.
The green feed having, disappeared
from the fields, it is expected the hares
will show more stamina from this time
on.

-There was some excellent tennis and
also some surprises. The biggest sur
prise of the day was the defeat of
George Baker, the Golden Gate Club's
strongest player, the hands of Her
bert Schmidt of the California Club.
Baker was thought to be the strongest
man in the tournament, and his defeat
was a great disappointment to his club
mates. Schmidt played a great game
and his victory could not be called a
nuke, as he won on clean aces rather
than on his opponent's errors.
Schmidt's speed at the net broke up
Baker's steady game. He was out
played both at the net and In the back
court. Schmidt made almost Impossible
kills, and in the back court passed his
opponent at will. Schmidt beat his op
ponent ill straight sets, 6 â t, 6â2. ,
Herbert Long, a young player of the
California Club and probably the most
promising youngster on the coast for
years, was the star of the day. In his
match with Frank Mitchell Long
played a game the best man In the
State would have no easy time beating.
Mitchell played a fine game, but Long's
clever back and fore hand drives and
excellent overhead work proved too
much for him. After finishing off
Mitchell, Long took on Charles Dun
lap, one of the best players at the
park, and beat him with ease. Dunlap
tried hard to stave off defeat, but
Long was not to be denied and took
the second set without losing a game.
The score was 6â3, 6â0.
After playing an almost perfect game
against Baker, young Schmidt fell down
miserably in his match with Allen. This
has always been Schmidt's failing 1 . He
plays a wonderful game at times, but
is erratic. Allen is in poor form, and
two weeks ago was easily beaten by
Baker.
The third annual tennis tournament
for the championship of San Francisco
commenced yesterday on the California
Club courts. Forty-nine players en- v
tered the event, and at the call of time,
late In the alternoon, but four re
mained. The successful players were
Carl Gardner of the park. Percy Mur
dock of Alameda, Will Allen and Her
bert Long, both of the California Club.
These players will meet at 10 o'clock
this morning. Gardner will be opposed
to Murdock and Allen will meet Long.
In the meantime, Irwin was tearing
around those bags llkfe a house on fire.
He had just reached third when the
ball dropped safely and would have
been pinned dead at the plate on any
kind of a throw. But Mr. Nadeau was
not there. He made a weak attempt
to wing the ball to Shea, but it never
reached him and so that was the finish.
Portland started off in the first with
two runs, made on two hits and Ander
son's wide throw to first. San Francis
co came back with two more in the
second when Murphy allowed Steel
man's throw to travel into the bleach
ers. Then Reitz hit and Whalen hit
and the deadlock was on.
Portland nosed into the lead with
another pair in round four, but San
Francisco did not stop. In the fifth,
Ham Iberg came in for a walloping
that sent three runners over the jumps.
Iberg's double, followed by Drennan's
bingler over second, made it a tie for
the third time in the sixth inning.
It did not stop there. Portland
squeezed another through the lines in
the seventh, when Jones came in to
relieve Whalen of his burden. Beck
bit off a hurricane drive through sec
ond and advanced on two outs to third.
Irwin's bad throw of Steelman's
grounder let him in with the big one
that put Portland in the lead for a few
seconds. Henry's gang kicked through
with another in the same half on
Meany's double and Irwin's single. The
score :

The final Btruggle of the day was a
real fan's dream. J It was one of those
games that the crank likes to tell about,
when he grows old and is too feeblÂ«
to walk to the ball park and see it
repeated. Bingling there was in
plenty, with good throws and daring
chances on the bases to make it good,
to view. There was also some bad
work both in the field and at the bat,
so bad it finally offset the genuine ar
ticle.
The finish came suddenly and was
aided by Nadeau's poor work in left.
Meany was given a lifetm an error by
Murphy, after "Waldron had flown to
left. Irwin forced Pat at second, mak
ing the second down for the inning.
Then along came Leahy with a high
fly to left infield. Drennan Insisted on
taking the ball, but Nadeau would have
none of that. He must be the man to
execute that catch. They both flopped
around for a while and finally, the ball
became tired c/f being too long in the
air and dropped gracefully between
them.
The Brownies took two swift rides
down the baseball toboggan yesterday.
They landed at the bottom Just a tally
behind In each Instance and made a
fight for the place, but, even determina
tion canncrt survive when bad baseball
crops up every now aad then. This
sort of thing always loses games and
the rule held good yesterday. Scores:
Morning game San Francisco 4, Port
land 3. Afternoon game San Francisco

CHICAGO. May 23.â Interest in rac
ing he* decreased to a marked desrree
during the past week, principally be
,caus<! cS the efforts of the Hawthorne
track officials to close downtown pool
rooKxs, thus compelling the devotees of
the sport to place their money at the
track or not at all.
* The report vai freely circulated and
published in some of the papers that
the Western Union had voluntarily
withdrawn its wires from the track.
Coming at a tirhe when the telegraph
company had decided to cease fur
nishing information to imolrooms, the
rumor was received with credence by
many followers of horse racing. Now
the people know the telegraph com
pany was forced to remove its wires.
If was a scheme of the track officials
to force bettors to ra>' - an admission
fee In -order to place their money, and
they resent it.
As* a natural consequence, genuine
lovers of horse racing are looking for
ward t6 the opening of Hariem next
Faturday with much interest. A larger
field than last year's record of nine
teen horses may go to the post for the
Harlem National Handicap which is to
be run on opening day. The race has
a guaranteed value of $15,000. The
distance is a mile and three-six
teenths. Gold Heels and Dick Welles
are the top weights of nearly three
dozen possible starters.
"We may have a larger field than be
fore." said Secretary Nathanson to
day, "but it Is be?t to be conservative,
fo I am figuring on eighteen starter?.
We ought to Up pure of that number."
Among the probable starters are Lit

The police were notified yesterday
afternoon that Strom could not live,
and. Assistant Bond and Warrant Clerk
Flood, accompanied by Detectives
Whitaker and O'Dea, went to the hos
pital to take his ante-mortem state
ment. He refused to say that he be
lieved he was going to die. but made a
statement different from that givien by
him before. In his first statement he
said hl3 name was Henry Marshall, and
that he was a sailor on the ship Spar
ttn. He gave his right name to Flood
and said he was on his way to his room
at 523 Kearny* street when he passed
two men on the .sidewalk opposite the
Hall of Justice.
They appeared to be quarreling, and
one of them said to the other, "I
will kill you/' They began sparring at
each other and Strom went up to them,
when the smaller of the two said. "I'll
kill, you too." The other grabbed the
smaller man 6y the shoulder and said.
"Don't kill him; he has done nothing."
Strom turned to walk away, when tha
Assistant Bond and .Wan-ant Clerk T.
J. Kennedy, accompanied by Detective
Whitaker, who is working 1 on the case,
went to the hospital and took Strom's
statement. He said he was standing
on Jackson street, near Montgomery,
when two young men came up, and one
of them said, "This Is the man." and
stabbed him. One of the two was be
tween 16 and 17 years of are. If it had
not been for some soldiers, he believed
he would have been cut to pieces. Â¦ If
he saw the man that stabled him he
would not know him. He w,ts so weak
that he was unable to sign" the state
ment.
A few minutes after the atabblnjr a
woman named Maggie Osterdall
pointed out a man at Kearny- and
Commercial streets to Policeman
Brown. The man had a knife in his
hand and the woman said he had
stabbed some one. He had asked her
where the Park House was and Bhe
showed it to him. When the man saw
the woman talking to Brown he fled
to Clay street, and Brown started in
pursuit down Clay to Leidesdorff
street, where the man disappeared In
the darkness. He dropped the knife,
which was picked up by Brown.

description of the man who did the
stabbing, and his arrest is expected
soon.
Strom was found lying on the side
walk in front of 807 Kearny street by
Policeman A: E. Holmes, and was sent
to the Harbor Emergency Hospital. He
was suffering from a knife wound over
the left breast, near the heart, and a
lacerated wound on the forehead, over
the left eye. He was later sent- to the
Central Emergency â¢ Hospital, where
Drs. Stephens and Hill found on ex
amination that the point of the knife
had touched' the heart, and that the pa
tient was in a critical condition.

place of worship was added to the
city's sacred structures yesterday when
the new building of the West Sid?

prayer and song.
The ceremonies began with the morn-
Ing service, and in the afternoon there
were addresses, a sermon, a choir of
twenty voices and an attendance that
was estimated to be more than 1000.
The evening service was also largely
attended, and again there was singing
of beautiful and Joyous hymns, a dedi
catory prayer by the Rev. B. W. Darst
and a sermon by the Rev. Frank S.

ing was conducted by Judge E. H.

the sermon by the Ilev. Walter M.

clergy was made evident by the pres
ence of many of other denominations
than that of the Christian church.
The Rev. E. Nelander, Ph. D., of the
First English Lutheran Church spoke
the invocation, and the Scripture was
read by the Rev. Louis J. Sawyer of
the Hamilton-square Baptist Church,
and while the Rev. Thomas A. Boyer
