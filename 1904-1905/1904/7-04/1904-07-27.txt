CANDIDACY OF FLINT.
DUNLAP AND 3IUENTER
The screams of a frightened woman
and her children startled ahe neighbor
hood in the 2200 block on McAllister
street last evening. Samuel H. Keyes,
who caused the disturbance. Is now
held on the detinue book pending the
issuance of a warrant for threats
against life and disturbing the peace.
Keyes went to the house where his
wife lives and for more than an hour
roused the neighborhood in an en
deavor to break into the place. He
and his wife have been separated for
some time, but Keyes has persistently
followed her and tried to persuade her
to return to him.
While Keyes attempted to break
down the door Mrs. Keyes telephoned
for the police. Policeman Cleaver of
the Park station responded and placed
the man under arrest.
At the station Keyes said that his
wife alleged that he was Insane,
though to the officers his mind appear
ed sound. He denied that he had at
tempted to take her life, or had threat
ened her.
Mrs. Keyes said that she married
Keyes six years ago in the East. He
was at the head of a large department
store in Philadelphia. At the time of
the marriage, Keyes had eight chil
dren, his wife had three. Difficulties
arose. In March she took her children
and left for this city. She made her
residence at 2267 McAllister street.
Ke â s repeatedly wrote, pleading for a
reconciliation, but his pleas were un
availing.
Two weeks ago he resigned his posi
tion in the East and arrived in San
Francisco last Saturday. Every at
tempt to meet his wife proved fruitless
and he became desperate.
Mrs. Keyes feared that he would at
tempt her life, as he had intimated In
his letters. Last night he went to the
house In a frenzy and tried to break
down the door. The neighbors were
startled. For an hour he tried to
break Into the house, his wife and
children inside crouching with fear.
Mrs. Keyes believes that had the police
In January her eldest daughter. Miss
Emma Rutherford, was wedded to
Philip Kearney, the affair being one
of the smartest weddings of the year
in Gotham. "While the Astors were not
present, the Goelets. the Vanderbilts
the De Ruyters and many of the first
Knickerbocker families were guests.
And now the second daughter Is to
wed J. Langdon Ervlng of New York.
It was to assist at the marriage of this
daughter that the mother, though mor
tally III* crossed the ocean.
In 1ES3, almost without warning Mr
Rutherford passed away from an affec
tion of the heart. After a year and a
half of mourning the beautiful widow
astonished the Emart set by wedding
George Crocker, the young friend of her
departed spouse. The service was per
formed In St. Thomas Church. New
York, by Dr. John Wesley, In the pres
ence of many friends, it was noted,
however that Mr. and Mrs. Alexander
and Charles Crocker, though in the
East at the time, were not guests at
the wedding. The assumption was that
their absence stood for their disap
proval of the union, but It was after
ward announced that nothing more
than an Inopportune snowstorm pre
vented their attendance. The marriage
proved a success, and in 1836 Crocker
came Into possession of $3,000,000 that
had been bequeathed to him.
During the life of Mr. Rutherford the
family home at 1105 Bush street was
the scene of many brilliant entertain
?^2 tS w. W u re the bea utiÂ£ul chatelaine
held high court among the chosen of
her set, amor.g whom were the Crock
ers.
Mrs. George Crocker was born in Ne
vada City, the eldest child of Mr. and
Mrs. Lewis J. Hanchette. Her child
hood was passed in San Jose, where
her father became a man of affairs.
At sixteen years of age the daughter
was entered in Laurel Hall, near San
Mateo. from v.hlch she was graduated
vith honors, manifesting at that time
the Eplendid mental equipment that
afterward distinguished her in society.
A gTea-t beauty, she soon became the
bel> of the Garden City, where she
tvas wooed and won by A. H. Ruther
ford, a prominent mining man. Of this
union three children were born, all of
whom survive the mother.

PARIS, July 27.â The Yinkow cor
respondent of the Matin says that the
Japanese troops entered Newchwantc
at 5 o'clock this morning and hauled
down the Russian commercial > flae.
which had been substituted for the
military standard on the residence "of
the Governor. The Japanese standard
was hoisted, the Chinese flag flying
from the neighboring buildings and
the custom-houses. The consular au
thorities had taken precautions to in
sure the safety of the European resi
dents. The Russians who 1 refused to
follow the retreat have been cut off.
The Japanese cavalrymen, the cor
respondent says, were supplied with
the most modern accouterments and
each man was furnished with a com
pass and field glass.
Competent authorities supposed that
a Japanese attack was out of the ques
tion on account of the large Russian
reinforcements arriving during the last
two weeks. The dispatch in conclusion
says that Japanese troops are still filing:
into Newchwang.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 26.âAl
though military men do not seem to
be alarmed at the situation In Southern
Manchuria, pointing out that the with
drawal of the Southern army from
Tatchekiao tends to concentrate Kuro
patkin's forces, thus giving him a
smaller front to defend, considerable
nervousness is manifested here by those
not in on the secrets of the Russian
commander in chief, especially as Gen
eral Kuropatkin himself points out the
danger threatening his line of com
munications to the north, owing to the
development of the Japanese advance
from ' Saimatsza toward Mukden. If
this column should be pushed home and
the Japanese cordon should at the same
time be tightened from the south and
east General Kuropatkin'a danger
would be easily conceivable. Conse
quently there is already talk of his
preparing to meet this danger by with
drawing to Mukden and there awaiting
further reinforcements.

letters of regret.
John W. Kern placed Taggart in
nomination, speaking briefly about his
aUIlity and capacity as a Democratic
leader. No one else was named and
Taggart was declared the unanimous
choice of the committee. A delegation
was sent out after Taggart. who was
escorted to the committee-room. He
thanked the committee for the high
honor It had paid him.
Homer S. Cummings of Connecticut
then placed Urey Woodson in nomina
tion for secretary and C. S. Van Duzer
of Nevada named C. A. Walsh of Iowa.
The only rollcall of the session fol
lowed, Woodson receiving thirty-five
votes and Walsh twelve. Those who
voted for Walsh were Clayton. Ala

Montana. Wyoming and Porto Rico;
Van Duzer, Nevada; Tillman, South

and Lamb, proxy for New Mexico.
Van Duzer moved to make Wood
son's election unanimous and De Ford,
who had Walsh's proxy, withdrew his
name and said the selection of Wood
son was satisfactory to the members.
Sheehan suggested that the chair
man of the committee. In his discretion,
be authorized to appoint an executive
committee, to consist of not less than
five nor more than seven members and
a finance committee of not less than
three nor more than five members.
Senator Bailey said that there was a
possibility of carrying Colorado. Idaho,
Montana and Nevada and he believed
the executive committee ought to be
enlarged so as to include representa
tives of those States. Sheehan modified
his proposition so as to allow the chair
man of the national committee and the
executive committee to have the selec
tion of additional members, who would
have charge of the campaign In special
localities or States. The proposition
was adopted by the executive commit
tee.
Senator Bailey moved that the com
mittee proceed to a permanent organi
zation. Just at this time David B. Hill,
William F. Sheehan and August Bel
mont, all with proxies, entered the
committee-room. They had been in con
ference up to the last moment, but they
offered no objection to Bailey's motion.

COVIXA. July 26.â "Walter "Wheeler, a
well-known Covina ranchman, was
killed by lightning yesterday near the
summit of Old Grayback, the highest
mountain in the San Bernardino range.
Wheeler devoted much of his time to
scientific study, and on Friday left here
with his cousin, George Grant, a Pasa
dena botanist, to climb the big moun
tain and there search for rare botanical
Epecimsns. There was an extremely
heavy thunderstorm in the mountains
late yesterday afternoon, the rain fall
ing as far down the valley as Riverside,
an almost unprecedented thing at this
season of the year.
Wheeler's death probably was direct
ly due to his having a large magnifying
glass, which was rimmed with a heavy
band of metaL He and Grant and their
guide, Charles Dodds of Crafton, had
been industriously climbing among the
rocks collecting flowers for botanical
studies when the guide cautioned the
botanists that the dead calm which had
settled upon the mountains and the in
termittent flashes of lightning presaged
a furious storm. As they hastened
down the mountain toward their camp
Wheeler was attracted by an especially
beautiful flower. Plucking it, he paused
for a moment to look at his find
through the magnifying glass, when
there suddenly occurred a blinding
flash and a terrific crash of thunder
shook the mountain. Some time later
a mountaineer named Carlson happened
along, discovering the three men pros
trate and apparently lifeless.
Wheeler's body was shockingly man
gled and partly incinerated. Carlson
soon ascertained that Grant and
Dodds, who were some distance in ad
vance of Wheeler, were still alive and
calling for help. He assisted in resus
citating them, after which he started
for Mentone. Riding hard all night, he
reached San Bernardino this morning
and notified the Coroner of that county,
who was at Redlands. Carlson set back
for the mountains with friends of
Wheeler, but after carrying the body
fcur miles on a horse they were forced
to cover by another fierce electrical
storm, which raged for hours, during
which a heavy cloudburst washed out
the trail, strewing the canyon through
which they had to pass with the body
high with debris. It was found neces
sary to prepare a litter of boughs, upon
which the body Is now being slowly
carried by four men down the moun
tain. They expect to convey it twenty
miles to the stage line, where a vehicle
will be In waiting. This afternoon the
party with the body was still twenty
miles from Redlands.
Special Dispatch to The Ce.ll.
VENTURA, July 25.â Senator Thomas
R. Bard was Indorsed by the Republi
cans of Ventura County at the primary
election held to-day, and at the county
convention on next Saturday D. T. Per
kins, Bard's candidate for the Assem
bly, will receive a. unanimous nomina
tion for the Legislature.
Bard's victory was accomplished only
after a hard fought campaign and a
primary election, that was as intense as
it was interesting. Only three or four
precincts in the county failed to develop
opposition to the Bard ticket, and in all
but these few the election was strenuous
from start to finish.
The result was a surprise to both par
ties. The Bard men were surprised at
the good showing made after the hard
fight put up by the Oxnard workers,
and the Oxnard men were surprised at
the few precincts they carried. Of the
ninety-three delegates which will make
up the convention Perkins will have
sixty-two and Major Driffill will have
thirty-one. The wide difference in the
number of delegates does not Indicate,
however, the closeness of the vote. The
Oxnard forces carried seven precincts
and part of another, and the Bard
forces the balance of the twenty-eight
precincts in the county.
In many of the precincts carried by
Bard the vote was close, the largest
ones giving the Perkins delegates only
bare majorities of from 4 to 16. The
smaller precincts, however, gave Per
kins a v vote i of three to one. The pre
cincts in the town of Oxnard gave
Driffill 11 votes without opposition. In
the other precincts carried by the Ox
nard men the vote was very close.
Both Bard and Oxnard voted in their
home precinct â Hueneme No. 1âOx
nard casting his first vote in the coun
ty. That precinct, which had been con
ceded to the Oxnard forces, gave the
Bard candidate the delegation by a
small majority.
Senator Bard Is pleased and gratified
over his splendid indorsement by his
home county and feels that the people
have approved the stand he took re
garding his candidacy.

to-day's date, that the Japanese unex

those of the Japanese.
The Russians made a fierce bayonet
attack and retained their position at
nightfall, but were unexpectedly or

the morning of July 25 they evacuated
the railrcrad station at Tatchekiao, car

as a serious blow to Russia, which
thereby is prevented closely watching

Chinese soldiers by promises of good
pay and hints of the possibilities of

July 25 announcing that the Japanese
maintained a terrific bombardment of
Tatchekiao throughout the day, but
that toward evening, several of their
batteries having been silenced by the
Russian guns, they retired. No esti
mate of the losses on either side is
given, but Judging from the nature and
extent of the fire the engagement was
a serious one. The dispatch says:
"Throughout the night of July 24 the
Japanese were busily engaged in
placing batteries on the crests and
slopes of the neighboring mountains,
and at 4 o'clock in the morning they
opened a terrific artillery, fire on the
Russian position at Tatchekiao from

of the Japanese at present seems to be
Haicheng.
The evacuation of Tatchekiao was

o'clock at night, when the Japanese
were within sight of the Russian in

in perfect order, favored by the beauti

LONDON". July 26.â The British
Government is taking energetic action
relative to the sinking of the British
steamship Knight Commander by the
Vladivostok squadron. AM informa
tion received by the Government tends
to establish in the official mind the
belief that an outrage has been com
mitted, for /which no excuse exists in
international law*. Those aware of
the feelings of the Ministry said to
night that all the members of the
Cabinet were in accord regarding the
principle of the inviolability of Inno
cent neutral shipping, as well as upon
the principle that a neutral ship can
not be destroyed, even if carrying
coal.
WASHINGTON. July 26.â In the ab
sence of action by the Department of
State in the case of seizures by Rus
sian and Japanese warships it appears
that the last official word on the sub
ject indicating the position of the
Government is that contained in the
proclamation of President Roosevelt
of February 11 last, Just after the out
break of the war. This was a little
different from the ordinary neutrality
proclamation, and, in addition to en-
Joining citizens of the United States to
refrain from organizing military expe
ditions in aid of the belligerents, con
tained this clear statement for the
benefit of many inquiring shipowners
and exporting mercantile houses:
"And that while all persons may law
fully and without restriction, by rea
son of the aforesaid state of war, man
ufacture and sell within the United
States arms and ammunition and other
articles ordinarily known as 'contra
band of war,' yet they cannot carry
such articles upon the high seas for
the use or service of either belligerent,
nor can they transport soldiers and
officers of either, or attempt to break
any blockade which may lawfully be
established and maintained during the
war, without incurring the risk of hos
tile capture and the penalties provided
by the law of nations in that behalf.
And I do hereby give notice that all
citizens of the United States and othera
who may claim the protection of this
Government who may misconduct
themselves in the premises will do so at
their peril, and that they can In nowise
obtain any protection from the Govern
ment of the United States against the
consequences of their misconduct."
This makes clear to mercantile and j
shipping interests the President's view
that it is not in violation of United
States law to ship contraband, but Jhat
it must be shipped at the owner's risk
and is subject to seizure.

Republican League, has issued a, call
to all Republican State. and Territorial
leagues, delegates and alternates and
members of Republican clubs through
out the United States to assemble. in
regular biennial convention at Indian
apolis, Ind., on October 5 and 6, 1904.
CLUBS TO ASSEMBLE.
The Democratic ratification of the
nomination of Parker and Davis will
take place as announced at the Alham
bra Theater to-morrow evening. Timo
thy Spellacy, chairman of the State
committee of .the party, will direct the
affair. The speakers listed are Supe
rior Judge M. T. Doollng, San Benito
County; James G. Maguire, E. J. Llv
ernash, W. J. Wynn, Thomas M.
O'Connor, and Charles Swigert. The
honor of presiding will be accorded to
Joseph Sadoc Tobln.
, There are indications that Contra
Costa Courwy intends to break away
from the old compact which gave the
Republican nomination for State Sen
ator alternately to Marin and Contra
Costa. The assertion Is made that
Marin County annulled the agreement
by knifing the Contra Costa candidate
In 1900. returns of the election
that year show that the head of the
Republican ticket (Samuel M. Short
ridge, Presidential elector) received
a majority . "of 777. over his
Democratic opponent, and that James
H. Wilkins, the . Marin County
Democratic nominee for State Senator,
received in Marin a- majority of 162
over Charles M. Belshaw, the - Contra
Costa Republican nominee. The Re
publicans of Marin have indorsed E. B.
Martinelli for State Senator. The
Stockton Mail's San Francisco corre
spondent writes: "Belshaw, if elected,
will be for Bard. George Hatton is
pretty confident that Martinelli will be
for Oxnard."
Thomas Flint will accept the Repub
lican nomination for State Senator In
the Thirty-first District. The counties
of Monterey, San Luis Obispo and San
Benito comprise the district. The
county of San Luis Obispo was added
under the new apportionment. The old
Thirty-third Senatorial District, which
Senator Flint represented In every ses
sion of the Legislature since 1886, was
composed of the counties of Monterey
and San Benito. The old district was
Democratic, but Flint's personal popu
larity and superior ability overcame
the odds. The addition of San Luis
Obispo County increases the Demo
cratic strength, hence Flint may need
all his popularity and energy to win
out. .
The fourth Republican aspirant for
the honor of representing the Fifth
District in the State Senate is Frank
Roney of Vallejo. The other candi
dates for the favor of the Republican
convention are Robert- Corlett of Napa
and Ben P. Rush and ex-District At
torney Devlin of Solano. The counties
of Napa and Solano comprise the dis
trict. The latter Is entitled to twelve
and the former to ten delegates In the
nominating convention, hence it is ob
vious that the power to win resides in
Solano. Senator Corlett entertains the
hope that the fight will become so in
tense in Solano that the delegates will
not be able to unite in support of any
aspirant residing in that county. When
Napa and Lake were In the same Sen

that Solano will perform the same act.

A gentleman called upon me a few
riays ago to ask me about my cure of
rh*Â»umati*m. My cure has attracted con-
siderable attention, simply because my
case was probably about the worst case
that ever puzzled the doctors of San
Francisco and Oakland. I am an old
repldeot of California â have lived in
sight of San Francisco for forty-nine
years. I k^pt a grocery store at the cor-
ner of Fourth and Webster streets In
Oakland for twenty years. I am pretty
well known. Many know that I was
compelled to give up my grocery busi-
ness simply because rheumatism crip-
pled me up so I could not walk, could
not dress rr.yself. hardly feed myself; so
to all Intent and purpose, rheumatism
paralyzed nre. ;.,.-.
Wasn't I a feast for the doctors, and
didn't I make an apothecary shop of my
stomach, all to no avail? Doctors and
medicines never did me any good. I am
a well man now and a happy man. No
more pains, no more swollen Joints, no
more stiff and aching limbs. I can walk
twenty miles If I want to. It seems like
it ls too good to be true, yet I was cured
In a few weeks, and at a trifling ex-
pense, at the Electro-Chemic Institute,

were Imported from Chicago. Grand
I President McNeil of the International

LOS ANGELES, July 26.â James Kel

the request of the Washington authori
ties as a fugitive from justice. He was
found living In a comfortable home
near here, which he had recently pur
chased, and to which he had brought
his wife and four children., According
to the telegraphic information the po
lice have received from Ellensburg,
Kellogg is wanted there on a felony
charge, consisting of having accepted
deposits in his bank when he knew the
institution to be insolvent. The State
of Washington has a statute for gov
erning county banks similar to the
Federal penal statutes for the regula
tion of national banks, and Kellogg's
alleged offense is the violation of this
special ttatute.
Kellogg: declares that the effort to
have him taken back to Washington a
prisoner is only for the purpose of com
pelling him to pay claims for which he
is not responsible. He openly declares
that the criminal courts there are being
used as a collection agency, and there
fore he will resist extradition.

matter.
Indian delegations from the entire
Sioux nation have been arriving in
great numbers to engage in a council
relating to the Black Hills treaty of
1877. .Many old men who were pres
ent at the councils when the Black
Hills treaty was affirmed maintain
that the commission appointed by the
Government to conclude the treaty
with them promised that the United
States wanted the Black Hills country
only until the gold, silver and other
precious metals could all be taken out.
Of course, In the light of subsequent
developments in the hills, this in itself
would be an indefinite lease, but the
old generation of Indians believes dif
ferently.
The council to be held at Cherry
Creek during the next, week will be in
teresting in many ways. It is cur
rently rumored that the aggressive ele
ment is working to get the majority
of delegates present to adopt a reso
lution of a radical nature. Just what
this final conclusion desired by this
element is cannot be definitely learned,
but sufficient is known to warrant the
statement that if all other means fail
them in securing the restitution of
the Black Hills, they would resort to
armed force.

MARTINEZ, July 26.â A sensational
suit which has occasioned much sur

E. Mulliken of Lafayette is the plaintiff
and Martha M. Taylor, sometimes
known as Martha M. Crawford, Mrs.
M. M. Crawford and Marthat Crabtree,
is the defendant.
According to the complaint John Tay
lor, deceased, fell under the Influence of
Mrs.Crabtree and v> as by her induced to
seek and obtain a divorce from his wife
and marry the defendant, he having
full belief that the defendant was an
unmarried woman. Taylor deeded two
tracts of land, comprising about 550
acres and situated near Lafayette, to
the defendant, whom he supposed was
his lawful wife, cutting off his daugh
ter, the plaintiff in the suit, with but
a slight bequest.
The daughter alleges in her complaint
that she did not know the defendant
was married before until some time
after her father died, when E. B. Crab
tree of Alamtda County commenced
suit against Martha Taylor, alias
Crabtree, for a divorce. The prayer of
the plaintiff is that the deeds in ques
tion be declared fraudulent, that a re
ceiver for the property be appointed
and that the estate revert to the true
and lawful heirs of John Taylor.
The property in question Is considered
to be worth about $15,000.

CHICAGO. July 26. â The sympa
thetic strike at the stockyards will be
completed to-morrow morning. The
belated sanction to the teamsters Join
ing their brother workmen in the gen
eral strike was given to-night by the
officers of the International Teamsters'
Union, and the drivers employed in
the packing industry in Chicago will
Quit work to-morrow. Nearly 100 of
these men struck to-day of their own
volition, refusing to wait for an offi
cial order notifying them that the sym
pathetic strike was indorsed.
While an attack was being made on
colored strike breakers as they were
leaving the stockyards to-night. John
Stokes, one of the strikers, was shot
and mortally wounded by one of the
negroes. Stokes, together with fully
100 companions, it is said, rushed upon
the negroes and one of the latter drew
a revolver and fired into the crowd,
hitting Stokea. The police were close
at hand and succeeded in scattering
the rioters after much difficulty.
During another riot within a hundred
feet of the same place and less than an
hour after the one in which Stokes was
shot, a negro strike breaker was shot
and killed. The rioter escaped before
the police arrived on the Bcene and it
Is not known who is responsible for the
shooting.
Little if any advantage was gained
by either side in the strike to-day and
there was no hope to-night of any im
mediate settlement. Realizing that
they have one of the hardest proposi
tions to contend with in the history of
the packing Industry, the packers are
leaving nothing undone to gain the up
per hand. All day long workmen from
outside points were rushed to Chicago
and taken to the stockyards to fill the
places of the strikers. To-night it was
announced by the packers that 7000
new men were now installed in the dif
ferent plants at the stockyards. With
these new men and with the arrivals
that are expected each day the packers
expect to get their affairs into such
shape that the strikers will be com
pelled to seek a truce.
Although the receipts of livestock to
day were small compared with receipts
en corresponding days under normal
conditions, still many cattle, hogs and
Fheep were left ia the pens to-night
unsold.
DENVER, July 26.â Governor Pea
body to-day issued a proclamation
calling off military rule in Teller Coun

trict in charge of the civil authorities.
This action was taken by the Gov
ernor In face of opposition from many
influential citizens of Cripple Creek,
who desire to prevent deported union
miners from returning to the district.
Before Issuing his order withdrawing
the trooos, however, the Governor re
ceived assurances from Sheriff Edward
Bell that his forces were able to con
trol the situation.
Military rule was proclaimed in Teller
County on June S in consequence of
disorderly acts following the explosion
at Independence on June 6, by which
many non-union miners were killed and
Injured. Previous to that there had
been a large force of soldiers on duty
for many months in the Cripple Creek
district, but before the explosion oc
curred these had all been withdrawn.
No troops are now under arms any
where in Colorado and good order pre
vails in all the mining camps.
The military expenses of the State
during the past eighteen months, due
to strikes, are said to aggregate about
$1,000,000.
VICTOR. Colo., July 26.â The recall

The three daughters of Colonel P. A.
FInigan have bested the attorneys of
their father in a suit for a piece of
Berkeley property. In a decision to-day
by Judge F. B. Ogden, Attorneys
George N. Williams and James P.
Sweeney are required to give back to
them a block of realty worth $4000 in
consideration of the payment of a $500
fee.
The land was deeded to the attor
neys as security for their fee for de
fending FInigan in a divorce action
brought against him. When Finigan
was, ready to settle with his attorneys
he tendered them the $500, but they
claimed that the land had been given
to them outright and refused to give
it back. The land was the property of
Lillian, Maude and Mary Finigan, the
daughters, who deeded the land to the
attorneys to help their father. In the
decision handed down to-day Judge
Ogden holds that the deed was a trust
deed and that upon the payment of the
$500 the land must be reconveyed to the
young women.

Not long ago Mr. Chase learned that
Mrs. Lincoln was in San Francisco. A
visit followed, with then a mutual ex
change of confidences, and finally it
ended, as all Romances do, in marriage.
Last night sa : the culmination of it
all, when they were married by the
Rev. B. F. Sargent at "his parsonage.
After the ceremony Mr. and Mrs. Chase
took the train for the East. Mr. Chase
is fifty-one years old and his bride fifty.
He is from Vermont and is investing
in Berkeley property. The couple's per
manent residence will be in the col
lege town.
Twenty years ago Frank D. Chase
and Mrs. Atlanta J. Lincoln lost sight
of each other in the whirl of the world.
In the Eastern city where they were
born they had been raised together and
they went to the same school, manu
factured the same mud pies and danced
In the same company when they grew
up.
But matrimony finally parted the
childhood friends. He married and she
married and they drifted asunder, so
that they knew nothing of each other
for a long time. In time he amassed
a fortune by hard work and a year
ago came to California to live, his wife
having died In the meantime. The hus
band of his childhood's friend had
passed away, too, though neither knew
that the other was widowed.

The claim of Nelda King, whose
mother, Mrs. Grace' English, was left
an annuity, was not considered In the
recent compromise. Mrs. English died
and the daughter claims that the an
nuity should descend to her and wants
$60,000 held in reserve to satisfy her
claim.
When the decision was given by
Judge Seawell it was In accordance
with a general compromise arrived at
by fourteen heirs of the estate, which,
it was thought, had the consent of one
or two heirs not Included In the com
promise. This, it now transpires, was
a conclusion drawn without warrant
and the dissatisfied ones, through the
California Title and Trust Company, the
present trustee of the estate, are to
appeal to the higher court.
The litigation has continued for four
teen years, and the compromise ar
rived at last* May was in accordance
with terms offered the various con
testants seven years ago. The estate
was originally appraised at about $.500,
000 and went to eighteen different heirs.
The whole estate, however, has been
held together by the trustees in the
face of the opposition of fourteen of
the heirs, who wished to have the es
tate distributed so that they might be
given their shares. The pretext for
holding the estate together was found
in the fact that annuities were to be
paid to Emily A. V. Brownell of $.75
a month, Frances Raleigh of $100 a
month and Harriet A. Loomis of $75 a
month. The claim of the heirs was
that only a sufficient sum to enable
payment of these annuities should be
held together, instead of the entire es
tate, and according to the recent com
promise but $25,000 Is necessary for this
purpose, and the balance was to be
distributed to the heirs.
The litigation over the estate of the
late Thomas Varney of Livermore has
broken out afresh. Notice of an ap
peal from the decision handed down
by Judge Seawell of San Francisco last
May was filed with the County Clerk
this afternoon. The entire matter of
the trust, which is holding together
an estate of $325,000, will be threshed
out before the highest tribunal in the
State.

Trouble In getting the body of Mlch
ae-L Ahcarn, which was found in the
Truckee River a few days ago, has
caused an appeal to be made to the
District Attorney's office here by the
relatives of the dead man. They want
the actions of Coroner Updyke of
Washoe County, Nevada, investigated.
They intimate that the body was held
for money, and when coin was not sent
the body was buried.
Mrs. John Martin, a daughter of
Ahearn, told Deputy District Attorney
W. II. L. Hynes to-day that in answer
to a query as to how much it would
cost to have the remains sent to this
city she had received a reply thAyit
would cost $85. To this she agreed.
Later it developed that more than $100
was found on Ahearn's person. A mes
sage was sent to Mrs. Martin that it
would be all right and that the body
would leave Reno Saturday last. A
local undertaker met the train at the
Sixteenth-street depot on Sunday
morning, but the body did not arrive.
Another telegram was sent and . a
replv was received Informing the rela
tives that Jf they wanted the body they
must send $100. Irvvlew of the former
messages the whole affair had a pe
culiar look to the family. They re
fused to send any money, and in the
meantime the remains have been buried
at Reno. The District Attorney of
Washoe County, Nevada, has been
communicated with and he has prom
ised that an investigation will be made.

Allen lived In San Francisco many
yearsâ until his wife died. Then he
went to L<js Angeles. He became en
gaged in the purchase and sale of real
estate in the southern city. One morn
ing about eleven years he made a
strange acquaintance in the office of
another dealer. He had just entered
for the purpose of transacting some
business, when the announcement of
his name caused a stranger who was
in the place to step up to him and
question him regarding his blood rela
tions.
When he had answered everything
the stranger Informed him that he and
his brother were heirs to an immense
fortune in England. The stranger said
he was the JCew York agent of some
English solicitors and that for nearly
two years he had been making an ef
fort to find the two brothers. Their
uncle Edmond had made a will leaving
all his money to his maiden sister, who
went to keep house for him. The will
also orovided that when the woman
died the property should be given to
his tw6 nephews. The maiden sister
followed her brother to the grave very
shortly. An effort was made to locate
the two brothers, from whom the uncle
had not heard since he abandoned the
sea and went to England to live. The
English solicitors applied to New York
and their agent came West. After look-
Ing over San Francisco he went to Los
Angeles and called on the real estate
man, who was a boyhood friend of his,
when the chance meeting with the ob
ject of his search took place.
Allen heard little more from the es
tate until two years ago. when the New
York agent Informed him that a woman
had proved the right to the title of the
uncle's wife and had been allowed a
third interest In the estate. About one
month ago Allen received a communi
cation from this woman asking him to
come to Manchester and marry her
and that the estate would all be settled
within sixty days. She said she would
forward a draft to pay the painter's
expenses, and this he is expecting
every day. Ht haa not given any deci
sion on the proposition of marriage,
but says he will certainly go to Eng
land and make his showing for the es
tate. He exDects to be enriched by
about $100,000. ?
FORTUNE FOUND ALLEN.
The boys were reared In Vermont,
and when the uncle's ship touched an
American port he came to see them,
and always reminded them of a
promise he had once made that
some time they should share what pos
sessions, he might acquire. The older
Allen bwame one of the part owners
In the line for which he had been em
ployed and acquired a fortune. This
he invested in Manchester property.
When he tired of the sea he settled in
the English city and prepared to en-
Joy the remainder of his days. He had
always been a woman hater and never
married. When he desired to establish
a home he came to Vermont, where a
maiden sister resided. He made ar
rangements for her to return to Eng
land and keep house for him.
All this happened many years ago.
â¢"Both Fred Allen and his brother went
to the civil war soon afterward, and
while Fred languished in Llbby Prison
William was killed on the battlefield.
Before the war had ended Fred re
ceived the news of his mother's death,
and after he got his discharge he did
not return to his Vermont home, but
came West and married.
Allen had one brother, William F.
Allen, and the two were favorites with
their uncle, Edmond Allen, the captain
of a British ship plying between Eng
land and New York.
Then Allen began to tell his story-
He continually called the captain of a
phantom ehip to wait for him as he
had a. stateroom reserved and wanted
to sail at once for England. In expla
nation he told the captain of the for
tune that awaited him and that he
was going to claim it.
As soon as the operation had been
completed and consciousness was re
stored one of the physicians In a jok
tng way told Allen what he had said,
remarking that a man's brain evolves
peculiar Ideas while the soothing drug
1* acting on it. Allen then said that
what he had spoken was the truth,
that an immense fortune awaits him
in England and that he expects to start
shortly to claim it and to consider a.
proposal of marriage from a woman
who is to be a joint heir, but of whom
he never heard until one year ago.
UNCLE LOVED BOYS.
While under the Influence of anes
thetics at the Ileceiving Hospital this
afternoon, Frederick Waldo Allen of
472 Eighth Btreet, a well-known con
tracting painter, told the etory of a
$100,000 fortune that awaited him In
England. The tale seemed so romantic
hlB listeners smiled and accredited his
words to the peculiar power of the
drug. Later, when Allen was aroused
and informed of the utterances he veri
fied !t all with correspondence and doc
uments, and what he had revealed un
der the drug proved to be true.
Allen visited Berkeley this afternoon
for the purpose of securing a contract
for painting a building now in process
of construction. He stepped out on a
piece of scaffolding when one of the
â¢supports snapped and he was thrown
to the ground, twenty-five feet below.
His right shoulder was dislocated and
he was sent to the Receiving Hospital.
The 'physicians put the patient under
the influence of chloroform.

LED BY. A BOY'S LETTER,
POLICE FIXD A MYSTERY
The Board of Police Commissioners
experienced a change of heart last
night and before the adjournment of
Its meeting six lack drivers' licenses
were issued to 31-union handlers of
the ribbons. , 1 \ recipients of this
favor are Willian. 1 D. Hughes, H- A.
Martin. Thomas Smith, C. G. Brad
ford, H. H. Smith and Thomas F.
Glynn. The petition of P. J. Curtln
for a license was the only one denied.
Representatives of the Citizens' Al
liance were present to lend moral
support to the non-union applicants
lor licenses. They were pleased wltj*
the outcome. To round out the night's
work Bush Finnell, counsel for the
Citizens' Alliance, demanded that the
board revoke the hackdrivers' licenses
now held by Joseph, better known as
* Kid." Egan, Matthew J. Gallagher
and John Walsh.
Though Finnell offered to produce
Police Court records showing that
Epan was not a fit person to hold a
driver's license and prove that the
other two named were also unworthy
of such favor at the hands of the com
mission, the board refused to hsar the
charges and continued the cases until
next Tuesday evening. The police
have been directed to locate Egun and
*erve him and the others with cita
tions to be at the meeting.
The hack drivers disposed of. the
commission * took up the charge
against Patrolman George O. Brown.
Brown is accused of having been ab
sent from his beat for one hour and
five minutes, or at least failing to re
port at the station for that length of
tim*Â». After these facts were testified
to the case was continued to the next
meeting to enabie Brown to summon
witnesses to endeavor to prove that
he has been falsely accused.
The board then began a slaughter
of saloon licenses and before the meet
ing adjourned a goodly number were
revoked and several institutions wiped
from the city's business directory.
The licenp? of Georg.- D. Somerset,
Mho conducted a den at the northeast
corner of Pine and Dupont streets, was
iirst revoked. John Pero, a sculptor,
set forth that Grace, wife of the pro
prietor, had relieved him of about 5100.
Somerset pleaded absence at the time
of the commission of the offense, but
the testimony of Grace was more dam
aging to her than was that of the
prosecution. Grace was led away in
tears when the judgment "license re

of the commission muttering that he

A trombone, blared to the accompa

Charges preferred against Marc Au

IÂ»iM*>Ter Body of Infant Burled
in a Ix>t â Arresta
Follow.
Patrolman* Edward Stanton of the
Seventeenth-Etreet station, who resides
ax Â£2 Whftney street, received a note
yesterday afternoon from a boy who
eigned himself Norman McGlinn. say
ing that if the policeman would search
in a yard at Z0 Whitney street he would
come across something criminal. Stan
ton took the note to the station and
Lieutenant' Price dnd Patrolman Fo
garty accompanied him to the place des
ignated, which is In a lonely neighbor
hood n*ar Sanchez street. The house
is divided into two flats. The lower
flat was occupied by the McGlinns and
the upper by a Mrs. McKenzie. Both
these tenants have moved to 366 Lex
ington avenue. After digging in several
places in the yard the police officers
<^une across the body of a female child
prematurely born and in a bad state
of decomposition. From a hasty exam
ination it is believed that the body has
been in the ground a week. Detectives
Fitzgerald, Ryan and Taylor have been
detailed on the case.
Detective Fitzgerald late last even-
in?: arrested I. H. Burbank and his
v. ifp Bertha, who also were known as
McGUnn, at their home on Lexington
revenue. They are the parents of the
boy whose letter led to the investiga
tion.
August Geber, who shot and killed
the Hartman brothers, George and
Charles, at their home on Third
etreet on the morning of Sunday,
July 10. manifested keen interest in
the preliminary hearing of the mur
der charge agulnst him, which was
begun before Police Judge Conlan.
He sat beside his attorney, ex-Judge
Low, and his piercing dark eyes
were steadily directed at the face of
each witness on the stand. Occasion
ally he plucked his counsel's sleeve
as If to call his attention to some
exaggeration or omission in the tes
timonj', all of which was for the
prosecution, and once he sharply
commanded Policeman Tyrell to re
peat fully some language which trys
witness credited him with having ut
tered immediately after his arrest.
Early in the proceeding the de
fendant impudently answered the
Judge's query as to his name, but
afterward apologized through his at
torney. In reply to the question,
he said that Geber was his name at
the time he -was arrested.
"But what is your name now â
your true name?" the Judge asked.
"Never you mind what my true
name is," wa< the response, and its
tone was reflective of irritability.
Ex-Judge Low then apoligized on
behalf of his client, who. he said, did
not want to bring disgrace upon his
relatives by disclosing his identity.
The story of the shooting of George
Hartman as told at the Coroner's in
quiry was repeated. Policeman Tyrell
testified that when he arrested Geber
the latter said he shot in self de
fense, as the Hartman boys had called
him an opprobious name.
"Well, why don't you speak it out â
tell what I said!" exclaimed the de
fendant.
The officer repeated the unprintable
epithet, and Geber nodded approv
inglj'. Testimony for the defense will
be heard to-day.
When the little boy's parents quar
reled and agreed to dwell apart It
was arranged that he should re
main In his mother's care and that
his father should visit him once a
week. But the child was not inform
ed of that arrangement, and when
several evenings passed without
bringing home the big man who had
always been so kind to him he asked
mamma for enlightenment, but she
did not give It. Then he made up his
mind to investigate for himself, and
with that end in view he started out
last Monday afternoon and walked
to the workshop where daddy had
once proudly introduced him to ever
so many other big men. There he
found daddy and chided him for
neglecting mamma, who did not
seem to be happy when he failed to
appear for supper. Daddy patted the
tousled head, and by promising to
go home that night induced the child
to permit himself to be escorted back
to mamma by Arthur Hughes, a fel
low workman. That's how Arthur
Hughes came to be arrested and
charged with abduction.
When the mother missed the little
boy she jumped at the conclusion that
he had been kidnaped by his father,
and at once unfolded her belief and
gave a description of the child to the
first policeman she met. The vigi
lant officer kept his eyes open, and
son they were rewarded by seeing
Arthur Hughes leading by the hand
the very little boy that had been
minutely described to him. So he
arrested the man and restored the
child to its mother.
When the case was called before
Judge Conlan yesterday there was
no appearance for the prosecution,
the mother having discovered her er
ror and the policeman being sorry he
had not deferred the arrest until a
formal complaint was filed. The de
fendant's anger was difficult to mol
lify, because he had spent the night
in prison, until the Judge said that
the Incident which had brought such
inconvenience to him was probably a
means of reuniting the parents. Mr.
Hughes then looked pleased, and be
fore leaving the courtroom he was
overheard to say that he would
willingly serve a week in Jail to
bring back to the little boy's father
the good nature that was routed by
his deprivation of the little boy's so
ciety.

If the offense charged against Albert
Jacobsen, middle-aged and decently at
tired, had been punishable by death he
could not have presented a more for
lorn front to judge Conlan, before
whom he stood accused of breaking
one pane of glass In the residence of
Mrs. Twombly, 112 Eddy street. He
blubbered and sighed and sobbed as
he sat in the prisoners' cage side by
side with a man who had the killing
of two human beings to answer for and
who regarded him with mingled con
tempt and wonder.
. "Oh, Judge, be merciful," he pleaded,
his hands clasped imploringly and
tears dripping from his aquiline nose
and heavy mustache.
"What Is this manâ an emotional ac
tor?', his Honor asked the bailiff, but
that functionary uttered no reply.
"Let me off with a fine, oh, please.
Judge, do," wailed the defendant. "I
was drunk when I did it." .
"Did what?"
"I don't remember what It was, but
some of these gentlemen in the cage
have told me that "

Edward C.-^iblln, a striking stable
man, who emptied his revolver at Polk
and Post streets on July 2, was found
guilty of discharging firearms within
the city limits and Judge Fritz will
sentence him next Saturday. GIblin
was drunk when he indulged in the
reckless pistol practice, his immediate
provocation being the refusal of an
Italian peddler to leave the street
when commanded by him to do so
He it was who swore to the complaint
that charged James H. Smith, negro
with the murder of A. O. .Gallagher
a striker. *
-That's what I'll be compelled to
do if you do not come down here when
I ask you to do so," said the patrol
man.
"Well, I guess you'd better com
mence climbing," Mr. Michelsen said.
The policeman's response was an
agile bound up the stairway and a
collaring of the two men. The trio
descended in a bunch and when they
struck the hallway flopr Nelson was
atop, with his grasp unrelaxed. With
a prisoner in each hand he emerged
triumphantly from the lodging-house.
In the court of Judge Conlan neither
Henley nor Michelsen had anything to
say for himself that was of general
interest and both were pronounced
guilty and ordered to appear for sen
tence to-day.

Under military escort Prank O'Con
nor, a private of the Thirteenth United
btates Infantry, was marched into
Judge Conlan's court for preliminary
examination on the charge of murder-
Ing Arthur Oliver, an ex-soldier. The
prisoner was handcuffed to one of the
guardsmen, while three others, armed
with revolvers, surrounded him, the
detachment being in command of
Lieutenant Halsted. Ere entering the
tribunal, however, the officer showed
knowledge of and respect for civic
usage by ordering his men to disarm
themselves and by seeing that the
order was obeyed. O'Connor was at
tired in the latest prison fashion ap
proved by Uncle Sam's military au
thorities, a large "P" being marked on
the back of his coat and each lee of
his trousers.
All the testimony was for the de
tense and it was taken contrary to the
customary mode of procedure to al
low the military witnesses to depart
for the summer' camp at San Lufa
Obispo Several soldiers gave the late
Mr. Oliver a very bad character and
that while serving in the
.Philippines he was convicted and sen
tenced for attempting to slay a com
rade with a knife. None of the wit
nesses saw the killing of Oliver, but
one of them testified that on that night
he heard Oliver announce intention to
get some d d soldier" and that he
was seen to strike O'Connor on the
face.
The prosecution will have an innim?
next Friday.
Miss Nellie Bennett, with one eye of
blue and one of brown, told ! Judge
Fritz that two trunks, containing all
her worldly goods, with the exception
of those she wore, were illegally held
by Miss Rose Decker, and she hoped
the court would lend to her the aid of
its mighty machinery to recover them.
Miss Decker said she held the trunks
because Miss Bennett was indebted to
her in the sum of $110, about half of
which was money loaned and the re
mainder for board and lodging at the
rate of $26 a week. She then produced
a contract, by which Miss Bennett had
agreed to pay that amount weekly in
return for the privilege of living In
the boarding-house conducted by Miss
Decker on Mason street. . â¢
The Judge declared the law did not
allow him to look upon such a con
tract as binding, and then Miss Ben
nett, encouraged by the setback thus
administered to the opposition, went
on volubly to explain that the con
duct of Miss Decker towar-d her had
always been tyrannical as well as ex
tortionate. She did not value the cloth
ing in the detained trunksâ though,
gracious knows, it had cost her enough
âas highly as some photographs which
they also contained. They were treas
ured by her as the aborigine of ro
mance prized the scalps that dangled
from his lodge poleâ as the soldier

The State's active commission has been extremely-suc
cessful in attracting the fair's visitors to the wonderful
displays in the Palace of Agriculture and in the Califor
nia building, and to-day there are thousands of good
Americans who know more about the splendid golden
citrus fruits, the fine olives, the famous prunes, the great
grain crops and the luscious yield of the vineyards of
California than they did before the gates of the exposi
tion opened last April. The visitors have delightedly
dallied with the luscious prunes and they have smacked
their lips after sampling our sparkling wines. The Cal
ifornians have given their guests something choice to
eat and to drink, and like Oliver Twist, those that have
partaken of their hospitality have come back for more.
The latest and most novel attraction of the California
commission was a watermelon feast. This took place a
few nights ago on the lawn in the rear of the California
building, and the refreshing melons â a half carload of
.themâ were served, flavored with several kinds of Cali
fornia wines. The feast, naturally, in sweltering St.
Louis, struck a popular chord and another has been
planned for an early date. With the thermometer sprint
ing in the direction of the 100 mark and thousands con
stantly in quest of cooling refreshment, it is safe to pre
dict that the next melon spread will be an overwhelming
success. When this' interesting functioa holds the
boards the balance of the exposition will perforce find
it advisable to shut up shop, as everybody will hurry to
the alluring feast in the fervent hope of getting a whack
at the luscious fruit flavored with the juice of the grape
of the Golden State.
The resourceful commissioners deserve warm commen
dation for this innovation that has won new friends for
the greatest State in the West. They have opened the
eyes of the other commissioners, who will ;have to hustle
if they do not want California to carry off "all the honors
for unique surprises. Now, if the managers of "the' fair,
are really eager to improve the situation they should
lose no time in giving out some information to the gen
. eral public about California's watermelon-wine feasts,
THE National World's Fair Commission deplores
the fact that the big exposition is not attracting the
crowds merited by the magnificent exhibits, and
gently prodding the managers urges them to stand up
â¢and do a little more shouting about the "greatest show
on earth." Now, if the worthy gentlemen who are di
recting things at St. Louis will only scatter broadcast
news of what California is doing at the fair there will
certainly be an increase in the attendance, and the Gov
ernment's representatives will be rapturously extending
the, joyous hand instead of giving vent to disappointment
over "small houses."
CALIFORNIA AGAIN TO THE FORE.
The Vladivostok squadron of the Russian fleet has
made traveling on the high seas somewhat too uncertain
and unsafe to be included in the category of summer
recreation. In the general uproar of protest and trepida
tion, however, it is easy to discern the voices of our
British cousins rather than our own. If we calculate on
a basis of relative tonnage, we have just about one
chance in ten of being injured that the British have. Let
us not be too hasty to espouse the cause of our friends.
These institutions, big and little,
number about a hundred, and every
week sees a fresh one in the field beg
iringr for charity. So keen has become
the competition between them that
these appeals are wearying the public
and breeding contempt and Indiffer
ence. One of the most eloquent signs
of this has been the failure of the
â¢â¢charity concert." This season has
provided an unprecedented number of
them, and In many cases the results
have been worse than disappointing.
At one concert where royalty was pres
ent and famous artists appeared the
net profits were less than $45. Several
others did not realize sufficient to pay
expenses. The charity concert as a
"inoney raiser" for hospitals Is prac
tical ly dead, and there are not enough
rich Americans, South African mag
nates and others ambitious for social
distinction and willing to pay well for
it to fill the empty hospital exchequers.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
I HENRIETTA STREET. COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. July 13.âAl
though the following statements reach
me from a source usually to be relied
Â«n. they are given with all reserve. I
am told that the present scheme to en
dow the hospitals of England from the
j>ublic funds. Instead of allowing them
to depend for support on public sub
rcriptlons, as heretofore. Is to be fought
tooth and nail by several influential
American women cf title over here, who
will have the support of many folk
prominent in London society circles, as
well as that of others who would like
to be. This on the ground that the
rcherne would put an end to a means
of ostentatious giving, which at pres
Â«nt is regarded as one of the surest
passports to royal favor. It is common
knowledge, of course, that Sir Thomas
Lipton gained his present title In this
way. and the same is true of the King's
friend. Sir Ernest Cassel, and others
too numerous to mention. Upon her ar
iival in this country the Duchess of
Marlborough was astonished to find
that the hospitals of England practical
ly depended for their existence upon
the generosity of the rich, but since
then her contributions to these institu
tions have been surpassed by no one,
t.nd I understand that she is one of the
most vigorous workers against state aid
for them. She is said to have the, ac
tive support of the 'Countess of Craven
and Mrs. Arthur Paget, both of whom
also have given largely to the hospitals.
On the other hand, among the women
v.-ho are advocating the scheme of state
'iid are the Countess of Warwick, Lady
4enry Somerset, Lady Winborne and
he Marchioness of Ormonde. The "op
position"' party, however, includes it is
said tjie Rothschilds, the Cassels and
the â¢ Neumanns, all of whom fre
quently have the Prince of Wales as
their guest, and his Royal Highness' re
cent pronouncement condemning the
idea of state-aided â¢ hospitals is sup
posed to have been dictated by a desire
to please the company In which he so
frequently finds himself.
Despite the generous contributions
made to the London hospitals by those
who find it affords the easiest method
cf gaining admission to court circles,
the sums realized are totally inadequate
to meet the growing requirements of
these institutions, which, like Oliver
Twist, are continually clamoring for
more. The present outlook for their
maintenance by means of the volun
tary system on a scale commensurate
with the increasing demands made
upon them is a black one. Between
them they are at present asking the
public for something like 513,750,000 in
addition to the annual $750,000 which Is
needed merely to keep their wards
open. By far the greater proportion of
this vast sum is wanted for building
purposes.
Special CorrerpondeDC*.
Oslcntaiicnis CItarity.
THE^people of Northern California have been un
pleasantly affected during the last week by learning
that the location of the great Federal seed and plant
experiment station at Chico is endangered by the failure
of the people of that city and Butte County to respond
with the $9000 required to purchase the land that is
needed. We are persuaded that' they are not fully aware
of the importance of the prize that is within their grasp.
Some one among them has raised the cry that if the
United States wants such a station it should buy the land
and not throw the burden upon the local people. It is
astounding that such an argument should be made in
such a matter. If the Government were locating a fort
or an arsenal for its use in operating one of its defensive
functions, it would be proper to say that it should buy
the ground. But this is an entirely different matter.
This station is not required by the Government, which
can get on without it and never miss it. It is primarily
and mostly a direct benefit to the people who are nearest
to it. It will be the greatest of its kind in the world.
The world first heard of the capital of Santa Clara Val
ley through the San Jose scale. But this is forgotten
since the world has seen San Jose through the Lick tele
scope on Mount Hamilton. The world will in the fu
ture see Chico, Butte County and the Sacramento Valley
through this new garden, which will be the Eden of
Northern California. It will tell more of soil and cli
mate, of capacity and products, than can be told by bil
lions of pages of advertising.
Already the seeds and stocks to plant it are coming
from every grand division of the globe, and from every^
zone where nature produces plants useful to man, neces
sary to his existence, and profitable to his purse. In a
brief time, in the stimulating climate of the Sacramento
Valley, there will rise there a garden that grows a
greater variety of plants than can be grown elsewhere on
the earth. Their growth is not necessary to the Govern
ment of the United States. It has existed more than* a
century without them, and will continue to exist far into
the future, even if the people refuse its offer to gather
useful and novel, plants from all over the world and
plant and tend them there, provided the petty sum of
$9000 is furnished by Chico to buy the land. The Gov
ernment'will finally spend ten times ten that sum on ths
planting and maintenance of the station and in aiding
planters to utilize the plants it will grow there.
We are told that in a meeting of the Sacramento
Chamber of Commerce some glee was expressed over
the prospect that Chico would lose the station by failing
to raise the money, as then Sacramento would make a
bid for it and get it located near that city. This was
not merely the exhibition of a mean spirit. It was fool
ish. The Government experts made a survey of the
whole State and found two locations that filled the con
ditions, one at Chico and one in Southern California.
If Chico fail, that ends all prospect of any station in
Northern California. The commercial drainage of the
Sacramento Valley is to Sacramento. That city, instead
of exulting over the failure of Chico, should rally liber
ally to help her neighbor out.
It is no time for petty jealousy or selfishness. All of
the Sacramento Valley may well make common cause
with Chico. Such an opportunity to make a final dem
onstration of such economic factors as soil and climate
does not come twice to a region. It knocks once and
passes on, never to return. Let the door be opened by
the opening of many purses and the returns will be
many times the investment.
His neighbor, the King of Portugal,
either from choice or necessity, also
patronizes the hire system. To cele
brate the visit of King Edward to
Portugal, King: Carlos presented his
consort Queen Amelia with a mag
nificent rope of pearls, each of which
was separated by a diamond. A j
Dutch firm got the order, and accepted ,
payment on the hire-purchase system. [
It Is satisfactory to know that the in
stallments are being paid regularly.
The King of Sweden is an ardent de
votee of the hire system. Very big
reunions and elaborate functions are
Tare in the Swedish court, so that
when anything out of the way does
happen, hiring has to be largely re
sorted to. A few years ago there was
a great partv, including Queen Alex
andra (then Princess of Wales), the
King and Queen of Denmark, those of
Norway, the Czar and Czarina of Rus
sia, the King and Prince George of
Greece, and German grand dukes and
princes without number. The reunion
was held at Fredensborg Castle, and
it was difficult to know what belonged
to the place and what did not. Fur
niture was hiredâ some all the way
from England â beds were hired, plate,
linen even, and silver all canfe from
outside sources, and entertainers were
fetched all the way from London to
Sweden to amuse the guests. His
Majesty of Sweden hit upon a happy
Idea to avoid horse-hire for his enor
mous number of guests and their re
tainers. As head of the army, he
commandeered some of the cavalry
horses for the purpose.
There is no evidence to show that
the German Emperor himself ever in
dulged In the luxury of the hire sys
tem; but the innumerable little heads
of the kingdoms and the duchies which
make up his empire do. It is a well
known fact that at the coronation of
the Czar of Russia the display of
jewels was the greatest ever seen at
one single ceremony in the world, and
the bulk of these was worn by Ger
man duchesses and princesses, who
were present in huge numbers, Ger
man and Russian relations being vei>
cordial at the time.
Here were ladies wearing jewels to
the amount of fifty times their hus
band's yearly income! Where did
they get them? The answer came
from the Continental jewelers and
diamond merchants, whose stocks, for
the time being, were sadly ravaged
and diminished. The jewels were all
hired. Not one stone in five hundred
that glittered and flashed in the palace
on the Neva belonged to the woman
who wore it, and many a beauty's
crowned head was aching with the
thought . of how her temporary mag
nificence was to be paid for.
The King of Italy is not a keen
hirer. He certainly ordered a mag
nificent steam yachtâ the "Pla" â from
a British firm on the hire system; but
after using It for a short season, and
paying two Installments he returned it,
and rumor says it was then sold to
Mr. Rockefeller. Its exact where
abouts is a mystery, but it has disap
peared from European waters.
For his forthcoming European tour,
carriages, horses, uniformsâpractical
ly everythingâ has to be hired; and the
reason that he is not including Eng
land in his travels is- on the ground
of expense. His new castle which is
being built at Guadalajara, in the,
province of that name, near Madrid,
is being paid for on the rent purchase,
or "every-man-his-own-landlord" prin
ciple.
talned large numbers of people at
once, such as deputations and dele
gates, who needed refreshing and
feeding, the china and glass were in
variably hired, If indeed, as was often
the case, the whole thing was not put
in the hands of caterers.
King Peter of Servia is having an
unpleasant experience of the "hire
purchase" system at the present time,
as his crown is being paid for by in
stallments. This is not the bronze
crown which Is being made from a
cannon kept as a relic of his grand
father, but is the jeweled structure
necessary for state occasions. It is to
cost Â£12,500, but money is scarce in
Servia, so the Paris firm which is mak
ing It agreed to accept payment by in
stallments. Two installments of Â£1250
each had been paid before the King
discovered that the officials entrusted
with the payments were endeavoring
to "square" the manufacturers to put
in bogus jewels and divide the illicit
profits between them. The payment
of future installments on the royal
crown Is to be made by King Peter
himself. 0
. The King of Spain is an example of
a poor wealthy monarch who Is obliged
to resort to the hire Â« system. Gold
plate, jewels, trophies, and all sorts of
costly ornaments he has In plenty, but
they are the property of the crown,
and useless except to look at. He has
a decent income â on paper â but it is
rarely paid, and consequently he has
I to hire right and left when he wants
to "make anything of a 'splash," as
the Americans would say.

THE Salt Lake Tribune asserts that at the twenty
ninth annual picnic of the Old Folks of Utah there
were assembled at Spanish Fork more than two
thousand persons in one grove at one time, all of whom
were aged at least 70 years. This took place last week.
On one special train from Salt Lake City there were
845 persons wearing red badges, indicating the age of
70 years, in persons whose eighty years entitled them
to wear blue badges and four with white badges, over
whose heads the winters and summers of ninety years
have rolled. All the Utah counties sent in their old peo
ple and so swelled the number of congregated septua
genarians to two thousand.
Nathanial Hawthorne, in his search for the unusual,
never imagined an assemblage so striking. The Tribune
says that the frosty polled party had "a frolic" and a
"merry time," with "youngsters" 50 years or so old to
wait upon them. They indulged in reminiscences; they
feasted at long tables in the shade of a grove; young
people sang, played- and performed in an amusing way
for them. Conspicuous among the decorations that were
provided for the occasion was a banner on which was the
motto, "All honor to the aged."
Men and women of all climes, looking forward from
middle age to the period when the tduch of age shall be
upon them, entertain the wish that their hearts and
minds may retain their jfrcshness so that they may en
joy with the keenness of unimpaired senses their closing
days. This large collection of Utah septuagenarians
would seem to have left within them still the sources of
enjoyment. The first gathering of this sort, which Utah
says can be found in no part of the world outside of
that State, took place at old Peter Clinton's place near
Lake Point in 1875. One of the originatqrs of the idea
is still living and was at Spanish Fork with his hoary
headed, colleagues the other day.
There were present old people of nearly every color
and nationality known to mankindâ a chieftain from the
South Pacific, Samoans, Hawaiians, colored people,
English, Welsh, Irish, Germans, Scotch, Americans,
Scandinavians â a cosmopolitan gathering of a very un
usual character. They were all alive when Queen Vic
toria was crowned. They were able to discuss from
memory events in the war with Mexico and the old days
on the Missouri and Mississippi prior to 1846. Even
one of the original party of Mormons that entered Salt
Lake City in July, 1847, was at the picnic. That one is
Thomas P. Cloward, who was born in 1823 and is still
hale and hearty. Among the gay picnickers of advanced
years were Mary Hart, aged 91; Mary Carter, aged 90;
Benjamin M. Beer, aged 92, and Miriam Chase, aged 91
âall residents of Salt Lake City.
After a day of pleasure the veterans proceeded to their
several homes, and it is agreeable to learn that no one
met with an accident or was harmed by a day of pleas
uring, extraordinary.

"Where the city of St. Pierre once
flourished," he says, "there is a thick
bed of land, which is already assum
ing the appearance of a vast gray
granite rock. About nine years ago
I passed close by St. Pierre in the
evening and saw its white roofs, its
towers and cupolas gleaming between
the fronded crests and lithe gray
trunks of the royal palms and heard
the crash of bands in its squares and
the tinkling of mandolins upon the
French ships lying In the roadstead.
But now the scarred mass of lava cov
ers completely the gay Paris of the

There are no ruins â nothing at all to
indicate that a city of 25,000 people
had once nourished there.
"Before you rises the gaunt and co

blown out crest and sides. The im
pression which the sight of Mont Pe

to define. . You are awed, but hardly
horrified. In the presence of such evi

think of the blotting out of such an

I have been a wheat farmer for more
than thirty years in California. Though
not at the present time actively en
gaged in farming I still own a wheat
farm. In my opinion the real trouble
lies in our mode of harvesting. There
was no complaint from the millers un
til some ten or twelve years ago, after
we had come to using the combined
harvester. Previous to that we used
the header and cut and stacked our
wheat, the wheat standing in the stack
from three to six weeks, during which
time it went through the sweat and,
being protected from the hot sun, dW
not lose its gluten and turn to starch.
But the combined harvester superseded
the header. The grain Is not now
stacked; it stands in the field until it
Is ripe and as dry and hard as It can
get. Then it is cut and threshed and
a great deal of It is in the warehouse
the same day, or I should say the
greater part of It by the close of the
second dayâ at least I think that Is the
result in the San Joaquln and Sacra
mento valleys, the great wheat belt of
California.
I would also add that a great deal of
wheat stands In the field until Septem
ber and October.
Most sincerely yours,

QUITE as important as the engineering problems
and admitting of no solution by trite mathemati
cal formula is the question that must soon con
front the Panama Canal Commission â whence a contin
uous supply of labor? If ten years is the limit set, in the
popular mind at least, for the completion, of the great
ditch, 20,000 laborers will have to be in constant employ
according to estimates of the experts. Where is this
army to be marshaled, and how is its number to be^
steadily recruited?
Dr. C. A. Stephens, long familiar with the climatic con
ditions of Panama, and formerly a close student of the
medical problems presented to ( the French canal com
pany, declares in a recent pamphlet that "no sensible
person can spend a day, even an hour, in the heat of the
Culebra cut without coming to th"e conclusion that this
is not a white man's job. No white laborer from the
United States can or would endure it." , Dr. Stephens
goes on to cite the experiences of the French excavators.
According to the estimates the French Io9t about 50,000
laborers during their period of construction. Not only
did the common diggers succumb, but the sudden deaths
of men in higher places Â»\vere continually causing en
forced delays on the part of gangs of diggers.
Many are the expedients that have been advanced to
relieve the difficulties of the labor problem in Panama.
Some have advocated the wholesale importation into the
canal zone of negroes from the Southern States, others
have declared that upon the working classes of Jamaica
and other Carib islands, negroes and half breeds all of
them, rest the only hopes of the commission. But to the
first of these propositions it has been strongly objected
by the South that taking away a great army of negroes
for work on the canal would so alter the field of labor
in the cotton belt that the cotton industry would suffer
seriously. Against the Jamaica suggestion it is main
tained that there are not enough reliable laborers in any
of the adjacent islands to fill the steady demand.
There remain, then, the Japanese or the coolies. On
the Hawaiian sugar plantations, where climatic conditions
very nearly approximate those of Panama, the bulk of
the heavy labor is done by Japanese. Hardy, inured to
excessive heat in conjunction with constant humidity,
over-willing to work according to the word of the over
seers, these little brown fellows would seem especially
fitted to endure the grilling tasks in the great ditch.
The close of the war will see thousands of them free to
take employment. As to the coolie, well, he is at least
a last resource. Prejudice may have to be put aside if it
be that we can find no one else to wield the shovel in
Panama.
LABOR FOR PANAMA.
French capitalists have undertaken the construction of
a railroad 500 miles long in Bolivia to tap some of the
highly productive districts of the South American re
public. We should accept this enterprise as a hint of
our own delay and procrastination and a warning that
something more commercially tangible than the Monroe
doctrine is necessary to conserve and promote our in
terests in Latin America.
Jin Turn Ling considers himself a
white man and keeps a white man's
restaurant up on Washington street.
Frequently in the past he has lost
meals and money to the improvident
and faithless "Mellcanmen" who have
volunteered to patronize him, conse
quently the "I'll-see-you-to-morrows"
are now below par with Jin Turn Ling.
He meets the moneyless visitor with
his usual urbanity, but with no meals.
Last Monday a man who had de
ceived Ling before came in. The
Chinese recognized him. but bowed
politely and directed the fellow to a
table.
'/Good morning. You want dlnna?
jft-Iite. Plenty dlnna. You hungly?"
"Yes, Ling. Heap hungry. I am
broke to-day, but to-morrow me have
plenty money. Then me come see you."
"Al-lite. You Demclat? You vote
for Hlurs? I think Russha-man lick

"Oh, never mind the Japs, Ling; yon
give me dinner. Too much hungry."
"Al-lite, al-lite. Plenty time. What
chu like?"
"Anything, anything."
"AI-Hte. Like flish? Sea-bah, hal
but, sam'n, tlout?"
"Yes, yesâ troutâ just the thing."
"Al-lite, you come Fliday."
"You Come Fliday."
making them the headliner . of the list of attractions.
Such an announcement will bring crowds as readily as
molasses draws flies. The attendance will be all that
could be desired, the gate receipts^ will grow surprisingly,
everybody will be happy, and California will have saved
the day.

A man giving the name of J. S.
Mellon and saying he was a member
cf the choir of Christ Church at Los
Angeles presented himself at the
Emergency Hospital yesterday for
treatment for several contusions of the
head. From his appearance it was
evident that he required the assistance
sought. But for his broad English
accent he might have passed for a
native of Africa, so discolored were
his features. In explanation of the in
juries he declared he had met a
"friend" and after "tipping glasses at
a tavern" in the neighborhood of Clay
and Kearny streets the "friend" had
escorted him to Portsmouth Square,
where he assaulted Mellon and re
lieved him of his last remittance from
Canada. This amounted to $15. His
"friend" had then deserted him. Mel
lon could not give the â¢ name of his
"friend."
Mellon Says He Was Robbed.

ST. LOUIS,' July 26. â Footsore,
travel-stained and weary, Renaldo
Walco, a British subject from San
Jose, Costa Rica, has reached the
World's Fair after a walk of 6000
miles only to find that he had been de
luded by a mythical prize of $15,000,
which he had heard had been offered
by the exposition company to the per
son who walked the longest distance
to attend the World's Fair.
WALKS SIX THOUSAND
MILES TO ATTEND FAIR
British Subject Competes for a Prize
of $15,000 and Finds He lias
Been Deluded.
"There Is no truth in this rumor.
We have spent $1,500,000 in filling In
the basin and it is now sound and will
meet our purpose admirably. If we
had any Intention of abandoning it
we certainly would* not petition the
Harbor Board for permission to re
move our freight slip from another
location to the northeast corner of the
basin."
This controversy disposed of, the ques
tion of the petition of the Santa Fe
was taken up. Captain A. H. Payson,
vice president of the railroad company,
said that up to date the corporation
had expended $111,303 33 in its efforts
to construct a firm slip at the foot of
Fourth gtreet, but without success. He
asked permission to construct a slip
at the northeast corner of China Basin
and the right to use the material again
in the Fourth-street slip. His request
was granted and bids for the recon
struction of the slip at the new loca
tion will be advertised for without de
lay. '. -,',Â«â¢*..'Â¦
Regarding the story that has been
circulated that the Santa Fe might
abandon the entire China Basin dis
trict. Captain Payson, after the ad
journment of the meeting of the board,
said:
FETITION IS GRANTED.
He asked that the board at least
agree to a test case; that it revoke the
permit of one of the dealers, and that
while the legality of such action was
being tested the other members of the
combine be permitted to continue busi
ness under the old sale unit. Attorney
Wise protested against such action, but
his protest was unnecessary.
Chairman Kirkpatrick of the board
said it was not within the province of
the board to consider matters of confu
sion or the lack of understanding of
English on the part of the mem'. ~rs of
the compact. All the board knew was
that the law was being violated and
it would proceed accordingly. The
board then directed that those j mem
bers of the combine who refused to
resign therefrom and accept the sale
unit fixed by the board be served with
written charges and directed to appear
before the board next Wednesday at
2 o'clock and show cause why their
permits should not be revoked. If they
do not resign from the combine imme
diately their right to sell produce on
the wharves will terminate at the time
set.
WANTS TO MAKE TEST.
On investigation the board found the
complaint well founded, and notified all
the parties to the agreement that un
less they forthwith filed with the board
their resignations from the combine
their permits to sell produce on the
wharves would be revoked. The board
also fixed the unit of sale at ten sacks
of potatoes and five sacks of onions.
This action resulted in immediate ac
tivity in the combine. Anxious to save
their permits, D. E. Allison & Co., the
American Produce Company, A. Friant
& Co.: Lercari, Pera & Co.; Macpher
son & Cochrane, Minaker & Wellbanks,
the Sacramento River Co-operators, L.
Scatena & Co., Wetmore Brothers,
Wood, Curtis & Co. and Wolf & Sons
immediately resigned from the com
bine.
But others were more anxious that
the combine should remain in power.
Among these were H. Bloom, the Eng
lish-Wallace Company, Glovannetti &
Son; Hunt, Hatch & Co.; Jonas, . Er
langer, Davis Co.; Marshall, Teggart
& Co.; G. B. Olcese & Co.; Schultze.
Hanse & Co.; Slmonl & Garbini, and
Webster & Dunbar. They employed
Attorney Reinstein and yesterday he
requested that the combine be allowed
to pursue its course, saying that a
change in the sale unit of potatoes and
onions would result in great confusion,
as many of the members of the com
bine were Italians who talked little
English and would be overwhelmed in
an effort to grasp the new situation.
NOTIFIED TO RESIGN.
Two important matters were consid
ered by the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners yesterday. One was the peti
tion of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe Railway Company for permission to
move its ferry slip from the foot of
Fourth street to the northeast corner
of China basin; the other was the ef
fort of small dealers in produce to
put an end to the operations on the
city wharves of what is known as the
"potato combine." In the first instance
the railroad company won its point; in
the second victory was with the small
dealers.
J. B. Reinstein, attorney for the
wholesale dealers in produce compos
ing the "potato combine," whose ill
ness had resulted in long delay of the
hearing of the petition of the small
dealers, was present at yesterday's
meeting:, and therefore the matter was
taken up for final settlement. Briefly
stated, the grievance of the small deal
ers is this: The members of the "po
tato combine" agreed to refuse to sell
potatoes or onions to retailers in small
er lots than fifty sacks of the former
and twenty-five sacks of the latter.
The funds of many of the small dealers
were so limited that this agreement
vorked a great hardship upon them.
Through Attorney Otto H. Wise they
protested to the Harbor Board that the
Woodward law was being violated.
The remarkably cool weather that
has prevailed during the past week has
done much to dispel the popular belief
that St. Louis constantly sizzles
throughout the summer, and from all
parts of the country visitors are pour
ing in to enjoy the exposition during
the period of lowered temperature.
The installation of the Russian ex
hibits in the Varied Industry and Lib
eral Arts and Art palaces will begin to,
morrow. A telegram has been received
by Loupre Chex, in charge of the Rus
sian exhibits, to the effect that Benko
wltz Gedberg and his assistants, who
have arrived in America, will reach the
exposition to-morrow and begin the
work of installation.
ST. LOUIS, July 26. â Colonel Clarence
R. Edwards of the Insular Department,
who has arrived from Washington, an
nounces that President Roosevelt prob
ably will visit the World's Fair in Octo
ber. Colonel Edwards says that the
President is anxious to see the exposi
tion, and the details of the trip will
soon be completed.
Following the annual convention at
Cincinnati, Elks from all parts of the
country are visiting the World's Fair,
and to-day was designated as Elks*
day. President Francis of the exposi
tion, Exalted Grand Ruler W. J. O'Brien
of the Elks and other exposition offi
cials and prominent Elks occupied seats
in a wagon drawn by a twenty-mule
team which headed the grand proces
sion of Elks through the grounds to the
Temple of Fraternity, where the exer
cises of the day were held. Addresses
were delivered by President Francis
and Grand Exalted Ruler O'Brien.
Pope was married and had been em
ployed in the Crocker building for
several months. He was a steady man
and a member of the Engineers'
Union No. 64. Before coming to the
scene of his death he had been em
ployed as engineer at the Lurline
Baths on Bush street. The body was
sent to the morgue.
Through apparent forgetfulness of
threatening danger, Frank Pope of 806
Polk street, a night engineer in the
Crocker building, was crushed by a
descending counterweight in the cen
ter elevator shaft, at 7:45 last night.
Pope died before his body could be
liberated from beneath the weight.
Just prior to the accident Pope was
cleaning and oiling the center shaft.
He stood on the Iron crossbeam be
tween the second and third doors. He
had finished the part of the shaft
within his reach and signalled to J. J.
Dwyer, the operator of the middle
elevator, to take him a little higher.
As Pope was about to step to
the top of the car, a bell from the
eighth floor rang and Dwyer told Pope
to wait. Pope stepped back upon the
crossbeam and Dwyer asked him If he
was "all right" and Pope answered
"all clear." After the operater re
ceived this answer the car shot up
ward and the counterweight started to
descend. !*:).â¢;â¢Â¦
As the elevator neared the eighth
floor, Dwyer felt a sudden jar, the
car bounded slightyl and stopped. He
opened the elevator door on the eighth
floor and crawled out. Hastily run
ning down the stairs to the second
floor he saw Pope's body beneath the
counterweight of the elevator. In re
sponse to Dwyer's cries the night
watchman, Walter W. Meade, respond,
ed, and with the assistance of Special
Policeman Kelly, after some difficulty
they succeeded in extricating the body
of the unfortunate man. An ambu
lance from the Central Emergency,
Hospital answered to their call, but the
man was long past the help of a sur
geon. A hasty examination showed
that the weight had struck Pope
across the back of the neck and the
base of the skull, while he was In a
stooping position on the crossbeam,
and apparently oblivious of the swift
rushing weight above him. Before
the man could utter the faintest cry
the heavy weiprht had crushed him
down on the beam, fracturing his
skull and breaking his neck
Judge Kerrigan also granted a di
vorce to Erminia Daneri from Andrew
Daneri on the ground of neglect.
Judge Kerrigan granted a divorce to
Jessie Ponton do Arce from Stanley
da Arce, a salesman employed by Suss
man, Wormser & Co., on the ground of
cruelty, the cruelty consisting in his
improper correspondence with other
women and his possession of
photographs of the objectionable fe
males. Some of photos were ex
hibited in court, and one of them was
a likeness of a woman who posed be
fore the camera in a costume little
short of "the altogether." According
to a stipulation filed the court awarded
the wife $90 a month alimony
and $150 for attorney's fees, together
with the custody of the two minor chil
dren.
Other suits for divorce were filed yes
terday by Clementina Kranz against
John Kranz on the ground of deser
tion and neglect; Elizabeth John
against Wiiliam John, desertion and
neglect; Frederick Ingle against Emily
Ingle, desertion; Edmund P. Morris
sey against Edward J. Morrissey, neg
lect and desertion.
Dr. R. A. Buchanan, connected with
the medical staff of the St. Helena
Sanitarium and assistant at the San
Francisco branch of the California
â¢Medical Missionary and Benevolent So
ciety, has decided that his wife's fre
quent charges of infidelity are suffi
ciently cruel to warrant him in apply
ing for a legal separation. In only one
case, according to the complaint, filed
yesterday, did she specify the person
with whom he was supposed to have
been guilty of improper conduct â Flor
ence Morrison â but she not only as
serted that women had been so asso
ciated with him, but declared that he
had made a house of ill repute out of
the institution employing him and had
violated his marriage vows with sev
eral of the nurses there engaged.
On one occasion, says tne doctor, his
wife came into a room full of persons
and declared that she had taken pois
on and was about to die. The state
ment was false. They were married
at Battle Creek, Mich., March 5, 1889,
and her jealousy first manifested itself
in July of last year, in this city." Three
children are the issue of their union
and the husband asks for their cus
tody. ;*,;, ;

"White Hat" Dan McCarty has re
pudiated a bet made with F. H. Jer
myn of Scran ton, Pa,,and" is suing
John C. Kirkpatrick' for the recovery of
$1000 placed with him as a. forfeit on
April 26 last, when the wager was
made. According to the copy of the
agreement attached to McCarty's com
plaint filed yesterday in the Superior
Court, Jermyn agreed to- wager $2500
that McCarty's sorrel mare, Lillian
Palmer, would not make a record of
2:10 in a race on -a public track dur
ing the year 1904.
Both parties ,to the wager ,were to
put up $1000 forfeit" with' Kirkpatrick
and the remaining $1500 was to be put
up before the; first, of July. McCarty
alleges that on June 30 he repudiated
the bet and demanded a return of his
forfeit from Kirkpatrick, who declined
to surrender the money. It is -not re
lated in the complaint that "White
Hat" lost faith in the mare's ' speed ,or
that she met with any setback which
would make it impossible for her to
get the fast mark he had set for her
early in- the springtime. His attorney
is James H. Creely/ -

"WHITE HAT" DAN McCARTY
WANTS HIS FORFEIT BACK
' .: It is stated that the charges are
similar to those returned some months
ago and thrown out of court on a de
murrer. It was then held by the
court that Ryan, the only defendant
who was j tried, was acting as trustee
for the depositors and not subject to
indictment for embezzlement.- When
this ruling was made the cases against
Gill and Arnold were discontinued.
Since then Mr. Folk and his assist
ants have been conducting a systemat
ic and thorough search of the statutes
for a means by /which an indictment
could be drawn that would withstand
the technical objections of the defense
and they believe that they have found
the way. - . ' " r
ST. LOUIS. July 2G. â New indict
ments have been found against John
J. Ryan, operator of an alleged "get
rlch-quick" race concern, and L. A.
Gill, manager of the Arnold Company,
by the Grand Jury, which has recently
heard considerable evidence against
the men in question. Ryan has been
arrested. â¢
There are seven of the new indict
ments. Four are against Ryan, three
charging grand larceny and one
charging embezzlement, and three
against Gill, two charging grand lar
ceny and one charging embezzlement.

%Â¦& AGAIN IN THE TOILS
This was fully discussed, but no con
clusion was reached. The committee
will .shortly send . a circular to all the
parlors to interest them in the matter.
; It is said that the Fraternal Order
of. Eagles .will' undoubtedly go to St.
Louis in time to ' be at the fair on
Admission day, and it is thought that
if the three orders can secure a good
representation of each arrangements
can.be made for several special trains
to convey the excursionists.
"The 'representatives of the several
railroads were present and they were
consulted : as to rates, with the idea
of securing a lower one than $67 for
going and returning. That rate is now
charged for excursionists to the
World's Fair. :
The Grand Parlor committee of. the
Native Sons of the Golden West that
has In hand the matter of arranging
for an excurslpn of Native Sons of the
Golden West to go to St. Louis to take
part in 'the celebration of California's
Admission day held a protracted meet-
Ing in the grand secretary's office yes
terday and had present by special in
vitation . Past Grand Presidents Con
rad and Tillmann and Grand Secretary
Frakes of the Native Daughters and
Ed Head of the Fraternal Order of
Eagles. *':
Charles H. McLaughlin, grand pres
ident, occupied the chair and Judge
R. H. McNoble, past grand : president,
was the secretary. .
The representatives of the Native
Daughters were informed that it was
desired to have a - representation of
members tÂ»f that order at the St. Louis
celebration and it .was suggested that
action be taken . along the line of
carrying out the plan.

Hermann Suderman's drama, "Fritz
chen," was translated by William J.
Stack, who played the lead. He ac
quitted himself acceptably. The ver
satile work of, Nat Phillips deserves
especial mention, his portrayal of the
father showing talent. Miss Ruby
Ramdohr aa the mother was accept
able in a hard part and Miss Aimee
Buckley was charming. The Incidental
characters were rendered by Ernest
Llewellyn and W. H. Richardson.
The students of a local School of Act
ing presented three clever one-act
sketches at the Alcazar Theater yester
day afternoon. There was an audience
of admiring friends and many critical
professionals. The students acquitted
themselves well.
The first sketch was by Martin V.
Merle, entitled "The Prairie Judg
ment," staged in a setting similar to
the last act of "Soldiers of Fortune."
It was given by Nat Phillips, Lester
Alden, Claude Nelson and Lawrence
McKenna. This was by far the best
and most uniformly acted play of the
afternoon.
"Mars Van," a Virginia romance by
Emma Sheridan Fry and Mrs. E. G.
Southerland, gave opportunity for
clever work by Miss Margaret lies aa
the pickaninny and Miss Marjorie
Rambeau as Barbara. Gillmore
Walker's rendering of Lieutenant Car
ter was marred by nervousness. Miss
Iola Hawley and J. Ross Birchett com
pleted the cast.

CHICAGO, July 26.â The Grand Jury,
after Indicting twenty-four bookmakers
this afternoon, ordered Sherln* Bar
rett to begin a campaign for the sup
pression of race track gambling in
Cook County. Just how soon the Sher
iff's deputies are to swoop down upon
the bookmakers and their patrons he
did not intimate, but as ; he left 'the
Grand Jury room after an uncomforta
ble interview with the inquistors he
remarked: "I will do as they have re
quested."
Their "request" was presented to the
Sheriff in the form of a resolution that
had been deferred until to-day for ac
tion, when all interests represented in
the effort to check gambling at tracks
near this city were on hand prepared
to "show down."
Indicted bookmakers include all those
now operating at Hawthorne.

Bell Plays Clever Tennis,
BOSTON, July 26.â In the. Long
wood Cricket Club's tennis tourna
ment the star match to-day was be
tween Malcolm Ward ot Orange, N.
J., and A. E. Bell of California, and
although the Eastern man won, hi3
opponent gave him a stiff four-set bat
tie. Ward found it harder to meet his
own kind of play (the net style) than
the long back court game of his most
familiar Eastern opponents. During
the first set he could not get into his
swing and was unsteady, with thÂ« re
sult that Bell won, 9 to 7. Ward thea
braced and won the next three sets
and the match, although Bell pressed
him hard repeatedly. Score, 7-9 6-4
-2, 6-4.

Stanford Parlor No. 76, Native Sons
of the Golden West, tendered a supper
last night in a Pine-street restaurant
to the officers who on the previous
Tuesday were installed for the cur
rent term and to those who retired
after having served for six months.
There were in the dining-hall about
one hundred and fifty members of the
parlor and several invited guests. Carl
Granz, the toastmaster, was flanked
on each side at the head of the table
by the new officers. Departing from
the custom of waiting until the last
course had been served before intro
ducing those who had been selected to
respond to toasts and entertain with
songs, the toastmaster called upon the
selected ones betwen courses. Henry
Lleb sang the "Stein Song," the mem
bers joining in the chorus. Dick Lee
sang the "Heidelberg Song," after
which J. J. Lerman responded to
"Stanford Parlor," and while lament
ing the fact that Stanford did not gain
grand parlor honors in Vallejo, it had
the proved satisfaction of knowing
that many of the Slate and city of
ficials are members of the parlor.
Messrs. Dunn, Eckenroth and Hunt,
members of the organization, favored
with several trios. R. B. McMillan,
a new member, responded in eloquent
language to "Our Order." Dr. W. H.
Sieberst entertained with German spe
cialties and then told in dialect song of
the several officers who are to rule
Stanford during the next six months.
Charles A. Sweigert responded to "Cal
ifornia." Peter Weineger. "the lost
brother," who recently returned from
a visit East, told of his wanderings and
declared that there are "only two cities
in the United States. New York and
California." District Deputy G. W. Ger
hard told of "old times in Toulumne,"
and the party broke up after singing
"In the Good 'Old Summer Time," due
next October. Vv:

Eddie's exercising yesterday was
"light and was taken more to avert
monotony than with any purpose of
bettering his condition, as Trainer Mc-
Donald does not believe his ward could
be put in finer fettle. In the morning
Hanlon went out for a six-mile Jog
with Toby Irwin. In the afternoon he
batted out fly balls and went through
light gymnasium work. This consisted
of bag punching, shadow sparring and
rope jumping.
Visitors who Journeyed to Larkspur
yesterday with the expectation of see
ing Battling Nelson were sadly disap
pointed as Trainer Murphy has in
structed Baling to take things easy
until the night of the battle. A brisk
walk in the morning and a iialf hour's
light work in the gymnasium consti
tuted hia day.'s work.
In the afternoon Battling and his
training mates took a dip at Escalle
baths. On their return to camp, Nel
son'was weighed in his street attire
and tipped the beam at 134 pounds.
He looks big and strong and feels con
fident that he will be declared winner
on Friday night.
The betting on tha Hanlon-Nelson
battle dropped a point last night. Early
in the evening the knowing ones were
willing to lay 10 to 8 that the pride of
the city would get the man from Chi
cago. The Hanlon money began to
come rather strongly, so the price was
gradually forced down to 10 to "..These
odds looked good to the Nelson men
and many bets were made, but those
who wanted to plunge on the native
son held out for a better price.
Down to weight and full of confi
dence Hanlon awaits the clang of tha
gong that will announce the onset of
the flght between himself and Battling
Nelson on Friday night. When he
puts up his gloved hands In front of
the rugged Scandinavian he will have
behind him as advisers the veteran
Billy Delaney, Frank McDonaM, his
trainer, Fred ..Landers and probably a
fourth assistant yet to be selected.
Hanlon and his staff will leave Ala
meda on Friday afternoon between 2
and 4 o'clock and will come to this
side of the bay. After weighing in at
Morris Levy's place, Eddie will go to
his home for a few auiet hours and
from there to the ringside.

CHICAGO, July 26.â Tokalon,. winner
of the Chicago stakes at Harlem and
of the Premier . stakes at. Hawthorne,
picked up 117 pounds in the second race
at Hawthorne to-day and, as in former
races, won pulled up from high class
sprinters. She defeated the five-time
winner, Clifton Forge, by three lengths
in the fast time of 1:13 3-6 for six fur
longrs. Knapp was easing the filly up
all through the last sixteenth. Had it
not been for this she would have run
the three-quarters in 1:13 flat. That she
is by far the best fllly in the West
horsemen say there is no dispute. Some
go so far as to say she is the^superior
of any thoroughbred in training in the
West, not excepting McGee nor Eng
lish Lad, which she has defeated every
time she met them. Tokalon was at the
prohibitive odds of 7 to 20. She was
well backed by the big bettors even at
this price.

The most surprising development in
the Seashore handicap was the great
speed of both Lord of the Vale and of
Hurst Park. The first mile was run
in 1:41 1-2 and this on a heavy track.
Before the mile was covered Hurst
Park was inclined to -go wide and did
so, coming up the center of the track
apparently a sure winner, as Lord of
the Vale vras then half a length be
hind him. Suddenl Kelly began to
use his whip freely on Lord of the
Vale and under its influence he began
to close fast on Hurst Park. The two
horses finished with half the width
of the track dividing them, making it
a difficult task to place the winner;
but the judges promptly hung out Lord
of the Vale's number. Pentaur was
third and Major Daingerfleld last,
where he had been from the start. The
time, 2:07 4-5, for so heavy a track was
considered good. Summary:

BRIGHTON BEACH. July 26.â The
Seashore handicap had four starters
to-day, including Lord of the Vale,
Hurst Park, Major 'Daingerfleld and
Pentaur. A few days ago Lord of the
Vale worked a mile and a Quarter in
2:08 1-2 and this was generally known.
The great question was as to whether
he could run well over a heavy track.
This is the reason Major Daingerfleld
was made favorite. Yet he ran last.

Postofflce Appointments.
Professor Hilgard has promised to at
tend the meeting next Wednesday if
Professor Shaw is unable to be pres
ent. Possibly other members of the
agricultural faculty from Berkeley will
supply Immediate information. The
stake that all concerned have in a suc
cessful determination of the best
course to pursue in this State Is the
home market for milling wheat as
against the product of South Dakota
and Kansas. These States have been
breaking largely Into the California
field end selling their products in great
quantities to the makers of flour, espe
cially for the Oriental and bakers'
trade.
One week from to-day there will as
semble in the rooms of the California
State Board of Trade flour millers, pro
fessors connected with the agricultural
department of the University of Cali
fornia, the president and manager of
the Board of, Trade and Secretary
Friedlander of the Merchants' Ex
change. They purpose beginning a sys
tematic investigation of great import
ance to the grain growers of Califor
nia and to owners of land upon which
grain is produced. The meeting is
called at the instance of the committee
recently appointed by General Chip
man of the California State Board of
Trade to ascertain what must be done
to produce wheat in California pos
sessing a sufficient percentage of
gluten to make it acceptable to Califor
nia flour makers without importing
wheat or flour from any other State or
country to mix with it.
The call for the meeting was sent out
yesterday. The committee Is anxious
to begin at once to gather all v the in
formation that is available upon a very
important matter, and would have come
together on Monday last but for the
fact that some of the members were
unable to attend.
One of the questions for considera
tion is whether loss would be entailed
temporarily by the use of new seed
wheat that may take time to become
acclimated. There have been instances
where the first sowing of a new seed
or of old seed planted in a new local
ity did not bring satisfactory results
the first season, but yielded plentifully
the second. Expert testimony on this
point is expected from the professors
in the agricultural department of the
University of California.
Horace Davis or James Hogg of the
Sperry Flour Company will give all the
information that can be supplied from
the millers' point of view. Expert
knowledge is desired.
Secretary Arthur R. Briggs has sent
out a circular to wheat farmers In all
sections of the State asking them to
communicate as early as convenient
with the State Board of Trade. Much
Information concerning conditions and
the needs of the farmers may be de
rived from this source. .

The crew of the American bark Foohng
Suey, which arrived Monday at Delaware
Breakwater from Kahulul, Is suffering from
beri beri. One man is reported dead and two
others are not expected to recover. The Foohng
Suey arrived at Delaware Breakwater In com
pany with the clipper ships Kenilworth and
W. P. Frye. They were all from Hawaiian
ports. The Foohng Suey left Kahului 140
days ago. The Kenilworth sailed from Hilo
ninety-nine days ago and the Frye left Hono
lulu 13.'{ days ago. There was seven days
difference between the trips of the Foohng
Suey and the Frye and more than a month
between the smart run of the Kenilworth and
the time made by the others. The vessels
did not Eight each other at any stage of the
lens voyage, but all dropped anchor at Dela
ware Breakwater on Monday within a few
hours of each other. The folio wins clipper
ships are now en the ocean carrying sugar

NOTE â In the above exposition of the tides
the early moniins tides are given In the left
hand column and the successive tides of the
day In the order of occurrence as to time: the
fourth time column elves the last tide of the
day. except when t!>ere are but three tid;s, as
sometimes occur. The heights given are In
addition to the soundings of the United States
Ccast Survey Charts, except when a minus ( )
slsn precedes the height, and then the number
given is substracted from the depth given by
the charts. The plane of reference is the mean
of the lower low waters.
The loading of the stock was accom
r lished yesterday morning. Army mule
skinners make short work of persuading
four-footed passengers to climb the
steepest of gangways, and when^the
work began yesterday there was an un
broken procession of horses, mules,
cows and bulls from the wharf to the
deck of the transport. All the stock
was aboard and each animal snugly
quartered in a comfortable stall when
the 12 o'clock whistle blew. Before thÂ«
noonday signal had ceased to sound
thÂ« Dix was moving away from the
wharf.
The transport also carried 230 horses
, and mules and three score cows and
bulls. These are the first cows the Gov-
I ernment has shipped to the Phllip
j pines, and the experiment will be
i watched with great interest. The cows
| are all highly-bred Jerseys and the bulls
â¢ are of the Holstein family. About a
I score of the cows are now giving milk,
! and the officers of the Dix are looking
I forward to having the kind of coffee
I mother made all tthe way across the
Pacific.
The army transport Dix, Captain
George Ankers, sailed at noon yester
day for Manila with a large cargo of
feed and livestock. Stowed away in her
holds the army freighter has 7000 tons
of hay and 2500 tons of oats. The hay
and grain are of the best quality ob
tainable, and Uncle Sam's stock In the
Philippines will live high after the ar
rival of the Dix.
Of course It is impossible for me to say
at thiÂ« time whether we shall pay the came
amount in dividends thjÂ« year as we did in
JK3. That depends en the conditions of trade,
but I see no reason why we should not. Our
operating exjjenses have decreased and we
anticipate as good a return from the season
fcÂ» the tiSft one.
Tbxse conditions are- the general ones of the
Falir,. n season. Up to date reports received
indicate that cur pack will be equal to that
cf Ian year and If there it any falling off
it avtU be but a slight one. The general fall
tag off. however, of the entire coast will be
Â¦boot 750,008 rasos. Our pack last year was
valued at Stf.000,000 and ocr profits were more
than Sl.OOO.ftfiO. Regarding our indebtedness
ef nearly $4,000,000 to the local banks, that
matter is w-ell known in commercial circles.
AX AVERAGE PACIv.
North Britten Columbia has a fair run of
fcalmon, but the ;-:.ck is F^iall. due to strikes
emor.jt the fishermen. In Southeastern Alaska
the run iÂ» Rood, but the pack in small because
ten laire canneries have been closed. Xone of
the canneries . of cur association are closed,
however. The Central AlaFka pack is up to
the average to date, while on Bristol Kay vee
ecla have been delayed by ice and the pack
will probably be somewhat short, but we have
received no late newe. >
The rer.tral condition* en the Pacific Coast
do not apply to our association. Our salmon
packing: i* mainly dene :n Alaska and a *mall
portion cf It en Puget bound. Flnce 1&01 th*
total salmon catch of the coast has decreased.
wh;iÂ« our* has increased. Tne cycle In which
th* Fockf-ye Â»almcn run *vcry four year* in
emell number! obtalrs this year, but It doe*
not apply to our fishing jrrounds. It applies ta
the Fraser River and Puset Sound and In the
latter flaw we are not operating on account
of tbe small run of salmon. In the Sacramento
River the run is the smallest on record. On
the Columbia. River, the pack to date is less
than V> per crnt of what it we* on thÂ« Mine
date last year and this mcrr.ing no fish are
reported from that locality. In Pujjet Sjund
the run cf salmon to date Is the emall'-at
known. The same conditions exist en the
J"ra4erftivcr.
President Fortmann was asked as to
the reports that the salmon pack this
season would be below the average,
and replied:
phi:sidi:xt explains.
There were many rumors on the
street as to the cause of the decline.
The generally accepted theory was
that a few holders had become timid at
the report that the salmon catch of
:hÂ«Â» present season would fall below
tbe average and that the packing: as-
Bocfmtton would not pay the handsome
dividends expected as a result of the
profits of the corporation during the
last three years.
Henry F. Fortmann. president of
the association, was not at all con
cerned when asked yesterday as to the
cause in the decline of the value of
the stock of his corporation.
"As a matter of fact." he said, "we
take no notice of the dealings on the
Stock and Bond Exchange in our
shares. Our corporation has 48.000
shares of stock, mainly held in large
blocks. Some of the stock has natur
ally found its way on the market, but
the dealings are very small, ten to
twenty shares having been offered for
pale &t a time."
A flutter of excitement was causod
yesterday among brokers and stock
dealers by the fall in value of shares of
the Alaska Packers' Association. Thess
ti!t edged securities, which reached
Â«s high a point as $13S 50 early in
the present month, have since de
clined steadily and on Monday they
closed at $121 10. Yesterday morn
ing: the stock opened at $ 121 50 and
then declined to JUS, but at the. close
of the day the rhare3 had risen to
5125, much to the satisfaction of hold
ers.

It is frequently the case that a party wishes
to soil his holdings for the purpose of reinvest-
ing the proceeds in o different kind of property.
Our . long experience in this business enables
us to often accomplish this double purpose by
only one transaction. The only condition we
make is that your property, if you wish us to
dispose of It fcr you. MUST BE GOOD OF ITS
KIND AND IN A GOOD LOCATION. Don't
take tip either our time or your own with
worthless offerings, or property so heavily
mortgaged aa to leave no actual equity.
If It has merit, whethar you own real estate
or a mercantile or manufacturing- business,
bring a description of same to our office, atat-
Ing what klcd of property you prefer la ex-
chanztr. and you will be surprised how quickly
we can effect the result.
THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE UNDER-
STAND THE EXCHANGE BUSINESS and are
the enly company in San Francisco making a
specialty of same. '.We make no eharge for ad-
vertising or any other purpoie unless we pro-
cure an exchange satisfactory to you to ac-
cept. â¢ '

; Aside from the rumored reduction In the rail
rate on Flour from Southwestern points to
California, mentioned yesterday, and which Is
annoying the local millers considerably, there
1% nothing new to rspcrt in these markets,
which are quiet. There Is naturally a great
deal of interest taken in the probability of
shipments of Flour from this port to the Orient
being seize.! by the Eastern belligerents, as the
export business, would ct course be affected
thereby, so the situation in Flour Is uncertain
all around.

Nezv York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. July 2ft. â Speculative confi
dence was sensibly shaken by the action of
today's Stock market, which gave the first in
dications of urgent liquidation since the recent
rife was inaugurated. Up to tsis tin* the ac
tion ct the market has all been to chow a firm
undertone, even after the evident culmination
of the rise and the adoption of a waiting at
titude by the professional operators who had
tcllowed the advance. To-day, on the con
trary, the undertone was weak. Thus the
greater activity throughout the day was dur
ing the period of declines. On the occasional
rallies there was a quick lapee isto dullness.
Timt i* to say. buyers were steadfast in re
fraining from accepting criers except with ma
terial concessions, asd sellers -seemed disposed
to make ihc- coscessiens in order to realize on
their hcldlrgs. This served to upset the exist
ing faith of those determined to held stocks.
Itie iigateniss of loads to-day had the effect
of arcuslng a suspicion that the accumulators
were finding difficulty In distributing their
holdings to advantage. There was disappoint
ment also at the Email demand for stocks met
at the declines. Ff*cu!atlve opinion has been
very confident- that a large demand awaited a
â¢light reaction from the market. A retrospect
of tie common lsferenees to be drawn from
yesterday's violent rise is sterling exchange*
the jump in Londcn discount rates and the
stre^ijth of the wheat market took on a for
midable aspect to the minds of oreraters In
stocks, although the sterling market was
quieter to-day. Nevertheless. gTave fears were
felt that the Anglo-Rystlan friction might is
sue in scrie overt act of hostility that would
start an international ! conflagration in Eu
rope. A wideir-read influence was exerted
both In the wheat and etork markets by an
allertd estimate by J. J. Hill of only $560,-
OOO.oOO bushels fCr tne tctal wheat crop. A
â¢udder, break tn Northern Securities on the
curb proluccd the weakest period of the Stock
Exchange. Notwlthstandisg the contin
ued great ease cf mosey, an effect was
produced by the rugpested contingency of out-
KO of gold, withdrawal of Government depos
its from bar.ks and an early development of
the Interior demand for currency to move
crops. Bear raiding was as clement that
hÂ»lped the break and was successful In nncov
ertsir etcp-lcsn crBers, while covering by shorts
made the final rally.

Butier, Cheese and Eggs.
The flocd of Butter continues, the arrivals
still averagisg over 1000 cases per day. Most
dealers ars making concessloss to move the
goods and others are scoring whenever they
find themselves overstocked, and the market
is soft all arousd. The great bulk cf the fine
creameries Is selling 1 from first hands at 20c,
but there Is Just about enough bringing 21c to
keep the msrket from an actual decllse.
An easier feeling is reported in Young Ameri

advance In them U drawing In larger supplies
from the factcries. Flata are in ample supply,
quiet and unchanged.
Eggs are lower again. Receipts, while not
excessive, are too large for the market to ab
sorb, and as they are now being generally re
tailed at 30c the wholesale market has given
way under the pressure. The public, who eat
the Eggs, and who really fix prices when It
ccmes right down to the point, refused to stand
the recent advance, which compelled them to
pay 35c. asd curtailed their consumption,
which Is the cause of the present decllse.

Chicago was higher on the day. The wires
of Mitchell. Mulcahy Sc Co. from there said:
'â¢Liverpool was easier asd there were no rains
of izneorumee West or Southwest. Receipts
at primary markets were very tarsÂ»>. After an
easier opening, however, the market turned
strong, asd ruled so ustit the close. Cash
Wheat in this and the Southwest markets was
al.-o higher under a good demand. The action
of the market is. on the whole, surprising, and
considering the influences of the day it shows
a great deal of strength. We think It must be
censidered. however, that while consols are
only a sliade lower, the newspapers are filled
with war talk, and this not only frightens the
short interest, but encourages speculative buy
ing. The weekly Government report confirms
Ute complaints of rust in Iowa and in South
Dakota, but on the whole it is a favorable re
port. J. J. Hill's estimate of the Wfieat crop
at being 100,C40,COO bushels less than last year
was probably also an influence Is the day's
market. The outlook seems to us a little un
certain, but the action of the rnarkn is
strung. It Is rather difficult to determine hew
much the war news has to do with It."
In this market the cash Wheat was firm at
a slight advance. In the ring there was a
large business in futures at an advance cf 2c

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables, j
Fresh arrivals of Potatoes were lighter than
usual, but there was plenty of carried-over
stock on sale and the market generally had a
weak tone. The low prices seemed to stimu
late tha demand, however, and the wharves
were pretty well cleaned up at the close. Tel
low Onions were In increased supply and ruled
weak at a lower range of prices. Red were
in limited supply asd dull at the nominal rate
of SI 50 per sack.
The market for miscellaneous vegetables eÂ«rn
tinued weak, with supplies of nearly all de
scriptions still far In excess of the demand.
Tomatoes had a further decline asd small
boxes were practically unsalable, owing to the
abundance and cheapness cf large boxes frcin
the river district*. String and Wax Beans
were very weak, with the casners purchasing
freely of the former at the minimum quotation.
As previously mentioned, there la na market

At this point Judge Kerrigan inter
rupted the attorney's examination with
the remark to Mulick that the parents
of the child were entitled to his cus
tody and notwithstanding the affec
tion that might have grown up in elev
en years the law could not be evaded
by such actions. The Judge expressed
his belief that Mulick knew where the
boy was to be found and told him
that h.e must produce the child in court
this morning or, failing to do so. he
and .his wife would be punished if the
court could punish them.
JUDGE WILL PUNISH.
Attorney Davis then asked Judge
Kerrigan to order Mrs. Mulick into cus
tody for perjury, but the Judge de
clined to do so and the woman prom
ised to have her husband on hand to
testify at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
When Mulick took the stand he de
nied knowledge of the boy's where
abouts, but admitted having taken him
from the home of S. S. Storey at 117
Oak street on Sunday evening after
the boy's first disappearance. He said
that he had taken the lad to the side
walk and that here he was taken away
by a strange man whom the witness
did not know.
firmed Mrs. -Weiss' evidence.
Mrs. Elizabeth Weiss, pleading inno
cence of any Intent to Vkldnap" the
boy, testified that she had given Mrs.
Mulick the name of a man who would
take care of the lad for a few days,
and she had ' heard that the boy was
either at the end of North Beach or in
the Sacramento Valley. Mrs. E. A. Me-
Court, who lives with Mrs. Weiss, con-
In the examination yesterday Mrs.
Mulick was first called to the stand.
Replying to Attorney Davis' questions,
she declared she did not know where
the boy was and had nothing to do
with his disappearance. She even said
the lad had cun away because he did
not want to go to his parents, but
that, notwithstanding her affection for
him, she did not deem it her duty "to
run around looking for him"â that was
for his parents to do. She admitted
that she had represented herself to be
the mother of Mrs. Lewis.
Comely and -clever, the child at an
early age was placed upon the stage
and all her earnings went to Mrs. Mu
lick until the girl married George W.
Lewis, an instructor in dancing in
company with Â¦ which, she was playing.
Two children were born,- Raymond and
another boy, now 8 years old. Ray
mond was placed in Mrs. Mulick's care,
because in traveling about the country
it was impossible for the parents to
look after his welfare. They sent re
mittances, which are vouched for by
proper receipts. The younger boy, who
for a time was a cripple, spent part of
the time with his alleged grandmother
and part with his parents. .
Mrs. Lewis, who has been playing
an engagement at Santa Rosa, recent
ly came to Alameda. Her husband
was with her and it was decided to
take Raymond across the bay for a
time. The father Intended to teach him
to swim. Mrs. Lewis came to the housa
of the woman who had posed as her
mother for so many Â»y ears . to get the
boy. She sent him down stairs to black
his shoes and has not seen him since.
That was two weeks ago yesterday.
MRS. MULICK DENIES. .
The evidence submitted by Attorney
Davis shows that Mrs. Lewis was born
in New York. There is no record of her
parents' names, but on April 12, 1876, at
the age of 5 .years, she. was placed in
the San Francisco Protestant Orphan
Asylum, with her 9-year-old sister,
Louisa Barnes. Shortly afterward Mrs.
Lizzie Mulick took the younger girl
from the institution and reared her in
the belief that she was her own daugh
ter.
George W. Lewis and Josephine Lew
is are the parents of Raymond Henry
Lewis, a 12-year-old lad, who since his
birth has lived with the Mulicks, who
were supposed to be his grandparents.
Two weeks ago, at a moment when the
child's mother desired to take him to
Alameda for an outing, it was found
that the boy had disappeared. Accord
ing to the testimony he has not since
been "seen. The parents, who are in the
theatrical profession, engaged Henry
H. Davis to begin habeas corpus pro
ceedings -against the Mulicks to regain
the boy. . Judge Kerrigan heard the
witnesses yesterday, examined the doc
umentary evidence and concluded that
the Mulicks were able to produce the
youngster. If they do not do so at the
stated hour this morning the court will
"punish them as far as is in his pow
er." This means that Raymond Lewis
will be* restored to his father and moth
er, or the persons who have posed as
his grandparents will go to jail for
contempt of court.
LEFT IN ORPHAN ASYLUM.
Incidental to a hearing in Judge Ker
rigan's court yesterday on habeas cor
pus proceedings to recover a missing
boy. the fact transpired that the boy's
mother did not know until a week ago
that William and Lizzie Mulick of 2519
Sutter street were not her parents and
that she had an older sister living. The
case is full of human interest and ro
mance, and the end is not yet, because
unless the missing boy is produced in
court this morning at 11:30 o'clock mer
ited punishment will be meted out to
those who have spirited him away.

The building formerly known as the
Stanford Primary School on Eighth
street near Harrison was designated as
the San Francisco Parental School with
the rank and salary of a grammar
school. Superintendent Langdon read
a statement explaining his reasons for
favoring a parental school and his
resolutions on the subject were adopted
by the board. They are as follows:
XEW PARENTAL SCHOOL.
Mark's appointment was due to the
establishing of a new school to be
known as the San Francisco Parental
School upon the recommendation of
Superintendent of Schools Langdon. R.
D. Faulkner, principal of the Frank
lin Grammar School, was transferred
to the principalship of the Parental
School. Mrs. N. A. Wood, principal of
the Hearst Grammar School, was
transferred to the principalship -of the
Franklin jj School; W. A. Edwards,
principal of the Crocker Grammar
School, was made principal of the
Hearst Grammar School and Mark
took Edwards' place at the Crocker.
School Director Cecil W. Mark was
yesterday appointed principal of the
Crocker Grammar School by the Board
of Education and immediately after
ward he filed his resignation as a
member of the board. As President
Roncovieri is away Mark was elected
by the votes of his colleagues, Direc
tors Walsh and Boyle, and his own.
Mark's term would have expired on
January 8. He was recently an un
successful applicant for the vacant
principalship of the Girls' High School.
Mark will assume his r new duties to
day. His salary will be $180 per
month.
The Mayor did not name a new
School Director, but will probably do
so to-day. The man who Is most likely
to secure the place is Albert M. Arm
strong, head of classics in the Mis
sion High School, who was a* strong
candidate for one of the vacancies on
the â¢ board last January. Other aspi
rants for the place are D. J. Oliver Jr.,
and Thomas E. Atkinson.
The deceased attorney â¢ tras at one
time a prosperous citizen of Grass Val
lpy and jvas deemed an authority on
mining law. He married twice and
leaves several children by the first
wife, from whom he was divorced. , The
second wife died a year after his mar
riapre and Burrows left for San Fran
cisco with his housekeeper. It was re
ported that he was infatuated with the
woman. She deserted him soon after
the pair reached this city. Letters to
friends in Grass Valley .indicate that
Burrows intended to go to Tonopah to
practice law.
An attache of the hotel detected the
odor of gas in the hallway about 9
o'clock and Burrows was found dead.
The Morgue wagon arrived simultane
ously with the money.
Burrows was about 46 years old. He
leaves a niece in Oklahoma. He came
to the hotel at 416 Turk street about
three weeks afro and a^ked for credit,
which was readily granted as he had
been a guest before. The body was
sent to the Morgue.
As Burrows was writing the jingle
and meditating bitterly or*r the brutal
Jest of the situation {i client whose ac
count was overdue was depositing? $200
with Wells-Fargo at Grass Valley.
Burrows, of course, was entirely ig
norant of this. He imagined himself
completely down and out of the battle
of life, then determined to take the de
feat with a jest on his lips.
He entered an adjoining bathroom
and plugged all the crevices in the door
and windc-w. Wrenching out the burn
er he turned on the gas jet. Then he
spread a quilt upon the floor and lay
waiting the end.
As he lay there dying, satisfied that
he was no longer al>le to cope with
circumstances, the money that would
have given him new life was speeding
to San Francisco Â«â¢ fast as an express
train could carry it. As the rescue
drew nearer the shadows of death crept
close to the unfortunate attorney. Had
the lov? of life that is strong in every
man asserted itself, had Burrows post
poned the deed but tn hour he would
have been alive.
The express train whirled into the
Oakland mole probably just as the sui
cide unconsciously gasped vainly -for a
few breaths of pure air. Tiie gold came
too late.
Back te old earth I journey My the;
TO her embrace whate'er betide
Â¦We all return, howe'er allied;
And thus to go I'm Battened.
Or a splash In the water with a s^irtrle for
breath,
Or sas turned on to produce certain death.
Or a swallow of poison, not carbolic acid.
But. some of the kind that's bitter but placid;
Like morphlum â queen of the night and ol
Â¦leeiHâ
That Induces repose and a coma so deep.
That Its patron glides over the valley of death
As a child In Its Joy sometlmie runs out of
breath.
The moment that A. Burrows, an at
torney, flung aside his last cent piece
and decided to end what seemed a
hopeless existence Monday evening
enough money to give- him a fresh
start in life was shipped to him from
Grass Valley. The Wells-Fargo mes-
Eenger with money for Burrows ar
rived at 416 Turk street, the scene of
the suicide, yesterday morning just as
the Morgue wagon drew up before the
hotel. Burrows had committed sui
cide by inhaling gas.
Burrows had been in financial straits
for some time. On Monday night he
found himself reduced to the last cent.
He thought of former property and the
friends of better days who had grown
cold to him. and his one remaining
copper coin seemed to mock him. The
ghastly humor of the situation struck
him forcibly. He tossed aside the
cent piece and sitting at a table
scrawled the following doggerel:
Coroner: To you I Â¦will confide.
Tbls Is a. case of suicide.
The causes â they are multiplied.
To mention torn* would hurt my pride.
X*t them remain in-.myEtified.
All my old frieadsâ "the true and trlc4."

JUose am I â the suicide!
â¢ Alexander is said to be Civil Service
Commissioner Rogers' lieutenant in the
Thirty-sixth Assembly District, and as
such is supposed to be worthy of higher
regard than less fortunate political
brothers.
It is not told how Alexander man
ages to fulfill the duties of two posi
tions, although the hours of each are
such that- it is possible for him to do
justice to both. As deputy registrar
performing clerical work in the main
office he is supposed to work from 8:30
a; m. to 5 p. m. A janitor can do his
work before the opening and after the
closing of schools, or he may employ
some one else to do it at a smaller
salary than he is himself receiving. No
one knows how Alexander manages, but
he is down on the Auditor's books for
two salaries monthly, and the Auditor
is of the opinion that he is only entitled
to one and will withhold payment on
the other for the month of July.
Alexander is one of the non-civil ser
vice deputy registrars whose appoint
ment to the exclusion of three civil ser
vice ellgibles has been disapproved by
the Civil Service Commission, but he
continues to hold his job. Alexander's
appointment to a second position is de
fended owing to an opinion of the City
Attorney that a night school teacher
may hold another salaried position un
der the city government, but the opin
ion goes further and says:
"It does not follow, however, that a
teacher or that any employe may oc
cupy two positions which conflict with
one another, either as to duties or as to
hours of employment."
The discovery was made yesterday in
the Auditor's office that H. J. Alexan
der is holding two positions in the city
government, notwithstanding the char
ter provision that no employe of the
city can hold two salaried offices at
one and the same time.
| Alexander is a janitor of the Horace
Mann School by virtue of his appoint
ment thereto by the Board of Educa
tion, and is also fortunate in holding
a temporary clerkship in the office of
the Registrar of Voters. As janitor
Alexander is paid $108 per month, and
the other position pays him $100 per
month. Though Alexander's appoint
ment is supposed to be a temporary
one, it possesses all the earmarks of a
permanent tenure.
