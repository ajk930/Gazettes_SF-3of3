LONDON, July 29.â A dispatch to the

that the Russian police say they have
discovered a widespread conspiracy,

the alleged object of which was to take
the life of the Minister of the Interior.

MANY PLOTTERS ARRESTED.
LONDON, July 29.â The failure of
the reactionary system in Russia,
of â¢ -which . the ! murdered Minister
of the Interior was a typical rep
resentative, is the leading theme
taken up by the editorials in this
morning's newspapers, which comment
with horror on this latest political
crime as a stain on the pages of Rus
sian history. Little surprise is felt at
the removal of a man who. although
honest and able and well meaning, was
regarded as the evil genius of his
country. The editorials generally ex
tend the utmost sympathy to the. Czar,
who is surrounded with such difficul
ties both at home and abroad.
The Daily Telegraph says there is
no mistaking tho moaning of the blow.
The red specter has reappeared. at an
unhappy stage of Russian history, and
the system of Czardom is again threat
ened at its heart by. an enemy destined
sooner or later to be more fatal than'
the enemy on the frontier. The wonder
is that Von Plehwe has so long es
caped his doom.
Extended accounts of Von Plehwe's
career accompany the descriptions of
his assassination. It is alleged that he
epent as much as $500,000 yearly !h po
lice measures for his personal protec
tion. This is probably exaggerated,
but it is known the expense of the se
cret service has been greatly augment
ed under his regime.

Trains in Spain are certainly slow.
A rate of ten or twelve miles an hour
is considered a jrood average of speed
for everyday travelers. When the
Spanish officials wish to show visiting
foreigners what they really can ac
complish in the way of rapidity, they
offer express trains which dash madly
across the landscape at an average rate
of fifteen or eighteen miles an hour. In
one way this proves an advantage, for
the traveler tees a great deal more
scenery for his money than If he were
rushed past it swiftly.â Tid-Blts.

to mean "The Voice of the Montene

The fact that Von Plehwe, who was

As to the Knight Commander case,
the Government had earnestly and per

that vessel was contrary tx> the ac

Balfour assumed a serious tone as he
referred to the Knight Commander.
"There are, I am sorry to say," said
the Premier, "other questions not con
nected with these incidents at all which
must cause some discussion between
the two governments, and, like all dis
cussions between ..governments, there
may be legitimate cause for anxiety.
We hold that it is not proper that on
the authority of the captain of a cruiser
goods alleged to be contraband of war
should be taken from a merchant ship
without trial." Â¦â¢', Â¦â¢'.: -, . ..
This statement^by/ the . Premier was
greeted with an .outburst of- cheers. '
... While Russia is willing, to make full
reparation If any wrong has been done
in the case of the Knight Commander,
Count Benckendorff, in ' conversation
with Lord Lansdowne, made no admis
sion that the commander of the Vlad
ivostok squadron had violated interna
tional law In sinking the vessel. Ac
cording, to the Russian view, it was the
duty of the commander to destroy any
supplies believed' to be on the way to
Japanese ports, and -it is added that
the papers he took from the Knight
Commander before she sank will estab
lish whether her cargo contained con
traband. As stated here, the whole
Russian case will rest on this point.
In the House of Commons this after
noon Premier Balfour said the acute
stage of the Red Sea incidents had
passed. He laid down the British view
that no belligerent warship could issue
from the Black Sea and that the volun
teer fleet vessels, in issuing therefrom,
if they took belligerent action, either
,had no ri^ht to issue or to take such
action. The strongest' possible excep
tion had been taken to the seizure of
the on the foregoing ground,
the Premier added. The Russian Gov
ernment had met the British contention
in regard to this particular Incident. -
LONDON, July 28.â The tension in
the Russo-British relations has been
relaxed and no rupture Is now proba
ble. Count Benckendorff, the Russian
Embassador to Great Britain, informed
Lord Lansdowne this -morning that If
Russia had committed a wrong she
was ready and willing to make full
reparation, but before any action
could be taken in the" Knight Com
mander case the Russian Government
must have the opportunity of receiving
the report of the commander of the
Vladivostok squadron.
Lord Lansdowne was not disposed to
unduly press the subject and promised
to wait a reasonable time;
Â«It developed to-day that the United
States Is depending on Great Britain
to obtain compensation for the loss of
the Knight Commander's cargo. It is
the cus.tom for ship owners to be re
sponsible for cargoes, and, therefore,

the status of Russian converted eru!s
ers in the passage of the Dardanelles,
J. W. Burgess, professor of political

Right of search by the said regularly com

of merchantmen under the tl&g of neutral pow

continental Kuropean nations have sought to
modify this practice by placing: merchantmen

EX ROUTE TO RED SEA.
Russian Second Class Cruisers to Re
place Volunteer Ships.
ST. PETERSBURG', July 28. â The
Russ to-day prints an editorial on the
case of the Knight Commander, which
is believed to reflect the attitude of
the Foreign Office. It quotes exten
sively, from the ."Perilous. Working, of
International Law," a German stand
ard on maritime law, to fihpw there is
justification: for sinking a prize in case
the vessel .*s -too old and slow, when
there Is dif&eu'lty in getting her to the
nearest home port and where there is
danger of recapture.
It is understood that the Don and
the Ural, commissioned yesterday by
Russia as second-class cruisers, are al
ready on their way to the Red Sea
to take the place of the St. Petersburg
and Smolensk of the volunteer fleet.
LIAOYANG, Wednesday, July 27.â
The Russian retirement from Tat
chekiao was terribly galling to the
rank and file, who,, after two days'
hard fighting, held their positions and
believed themselves on the eve of a
great victory..
Colonel Paschenko, whose battery
distingulshed itself, had a marvelous
escape. He was thrown bodily into the
air* by the explosion of a melinite
shell, but was unharmed and continued
to Â¦ fight. Later he was wounded in
the hand while waving a signal to the
gunners.
At 3 o'clock the extreme left of the
Russians was ordered to attack. The
movement was anticipated by the Jap
anese, however, who hurled themselves
on the Russian . position. The Bar
naoulsk regiment bore the brunt of the
shock and after a hard fight drove off
the Japanese in disorder at the point of
the bayonet.
Marquis Oyama, commander in chief
of the Japanese field forces, is reported
to have been personally in command.
The Japanese loss at Tatchekiao is
estimated at from 4000 to 5000, resulting
chiefly from their attempt to take en
trenched positions in the face of a
heavy artillery fire.
LONDON, July 29.â The Daily Mail's
Newchwang correspondent, in a long
description of the battle of Tatchekiao,
which mainly repeats the details al
ready known, says it was not until the
Japanese attacked all along their front
that the Russians retreated. The Jap
anese artillery was immeasurably su
perior and their shrapnel frightfully
destructive. Russian gunners ; went
down by hundreds, but their guns were
served with magnificent bravery.
The Russian officers, the correspond
ent adds, speak in the highest terms
of the bravery of their men. They say
Russia already has lost one campaign,
owing to the recklessness of the Czar's
advisers, but that she must have Man
churia and that she is now preparing
for another campaign.

Steamship Aragonla Sails From Port-
land With Contraband Cargo.
PORTLAND. Or.. July 28. â The
Portland and Asiatic Company's
steamship Aragonla sailed this after
noon for the Orient, carrying a general
cargo. -
The most important consignment on
the Aragonia is a shipment of 50,800
barrels of flour, valued at 5203,200.
The bulk of the flour goes to Hong
kong, but there are 6500 barrels for
Yokohama, 4250 barrels for Kobe,
4000 barrels for Moji, 1875 barrels ror
Shanghai and 500 barrels for Naga
saki. The vessel also carries a quan
tity of structural iron for Kobe and
thirty-seven car bodies for Yokohama.
Three per cent being asked by the
insurance companies to cover war
risks, no insurance was taken out on
the Aragonia's cargo, shippers pre
ferring to wait for a decline in the
rate. The fact that the steamship
Arabia, also of the Portland and
Asiatic line, was captured by tne
Vladivostok squadron last- week has
not deterred the company and the Ara
gonia was dispatched with orders to
follow her usual route.
Russian Vessels Said to Have Sailed
From Port Arthur.
THREE WAKSHIPS MISSIXG.
CHEFU, July 28. â Chinese refugees
who left Port Arthur thirty-six hours
ago say that three large Russian war
ships have left that port. The Chi-
On June 13 of this year it was an
nounced from St. Petersburg that the
Council of the Empire had approved
Von Plehwe's decree for the repeal of
the law under which Jews were forbid
den to reside within thirty-two miles
of the frontier. This measure has been
approved by the Emperor.
It should be added that the allega
tions made against Von PlÂ°hwe have
never been proved to be founded on
fact, and In view of the Emperor's in
quiry into the matter and the fact that
Von Plehwe retained the Emperor's
confidence, it is only just .to assume
that the charges were unfounded. v -
The last great public work of Von
Plehwe, so far as known, was the
drafting of the Peasant Code, early
this year. This is a scheme for peasant
reform, ordered by the Emperor in his
recent manifesto.
In May, 1903, Von Plehwe was ap
pointed president of the Imperial Com
mission, appointed to carry out the
Emperor's reform decree. ,_ j|
Wh"at parti if any, : Von Plehwe act
ually played in the Kishenev mas
sacres probably will never be known,
but his enemies have claimed that he
had full knowledge of the. events lead
ing there o, 'trough his political friend
and agent, Kishouhevan, known as the
most extreme anti-Semite in Russia
and proprietor of the Bessarabetz, a
newspaper of Kishenev.
: Plehwe was not a scholar,- but from
his youth he bad been brought into
contact with official circles, and he
slowly but surely pushed *himself
ahead. Before the Emperor called Von
Plehwe to take the portfolio of Minis
ter of the Interior he had already spent
about forty years in official work and
at the time of his death he was about
6b years of age. The educated j'ouths
of Russia are said to have been bitterly
opposed to Von Plehwe, owing, it has
been claimed, to his turning on. his own
people and to the drastic changes
which he instituted or advocated. He
is said to have regarded the common
people as either dangerous criminals to
be repressed, or as innocents, to be ig
nored.
Von Plehwe was largely of Polish
blood. He was regarded as in many
ways being the power behind the
throne, and was dreaded on account of
his control of the third (secret) section
of police and also owing to the fact
that he controlled the press of Russia
through the censors, who, it has been
understood, did Von Plehwe's bidding
without question.
The deceased Minister was laborious
in the- extreme, but had no trace of
brilliancy and was an- indifferent con
versationalist. He was, however, fond
of music, and was accustomed to read
many French novels during his leisure
hours.
Von Plehwe was app.inted Minister
of the Interior on April 18. 1902, suc
ceeding Siplagulne. who was assassin
ated on April 16, 1902, by a student
named Baimashon\ He had formerly
been director of the Department of Po
lice, which position he practically as
sumed of his own accord when In
charge pf the Department of Political
Prosecutions, owing to the incompe
tence of the official in charge of the po
lice when Emperor Alexander II was
killed,, on March 13, 1831. Von Plehwe
conducted the prosecution of the regi
cides and afterward reorganized the
police. From that time on the power
of Von Plehwe increased until it bo
came second only to that of the Em
peror. Several plots to assassinate the
Minister were discovered during the
last two years, which period has beeji
marked by strong political rivalry be
tween the Interior Minister and the
former Minister of Finance, Wltte,
now .president of the Committee of
Ministers.

ST. PETERSBURG, July 28.â The
United States Is preparing to take a
strong position for the protection of
neutral ships carrying American car
gQesu This Is indicated by the fact that
the United States made an official in
quiry, of Russia regarding the British
steamship Ardova, seized by the vol
untÂ«er fleet vessel Smolensk in the Red
Sea, which had American Government
stores on board. The Ardova had al
ready been released when the inquiry
was made. To-day the Foreign Office
received a; communication from the
United States asking whether the Ar
dova, a. British shiD chartered by an
American company, had been released,
and adding .that according to informa
tion in possession of the United States
Government the steamship Arabia's
cargo was bound for Hongkong. While
the communication did not take the
form of a protest. It is believed that un
less the Arabia be released a formal
protest will be lodged. The Government
could only reply that it was completely
without information, the Arabia not
yet having arrived at Vladivostok,
whither it was reported she had been
sent in charge of a prize crew.
WASHINGTON, July 28.â The State
Department hag addressed itself to the
Russian Government, through Spencer
Eddy, American Charge at St. Peters
burg, on the subject of the seizure of
the cargo of the Arabia by the Vladi
vostok squadron.
The Hamburg-American Company,
owner of the ship, undoubtedly will ap
peal to the German Government to se

General Bogdanevitch. an old' friend
and associate, with whom he remained
until a late hour. The Minister ap

the guests asked him if he had received
A no less impressive service was con
ducted at the Minister's stately home
this evening, but only Intimate friends
were invited by Von Plehwe's assistant,
Durnovo. who is temporarily in charge
of the Ministry of the Interior. The
magnificent staircase and the recep
tion-rooms were draped in black. The
body of the Minister was covered with
a white shroud, which concealed the
ghastly mutilations. It reposed in a
black and silver coffin in a corner of the
vast hall, surrounded by luxuriant
palms. Gendarmerie and non-commis
sioned officers stood sentinel at the
head of the coffin, while at its foot were
two high officers of the Ministry.
A special edition of the Official Mes
senger, which was distributed late this
afternoon, contained only a brief an
nouncement of the death of Minister
von Plehwe and the intimation that a
requiem would be conducted.
Czar Nicholas did not leave the pal
ace during the day, although he had
arranged to so to Oranienbaum, nine
teen miles from S%. Petersburg, to at
tend the consecration of the new har-
V'or. The Czarina has not been informed
of the tragedy in view of the hourly
expectation of her accouchement.
BODY REMOVED TO CHAPEL..
When the officers of the law, headed
ny Minister of Justice Muravieff, had
terminated the necessary formalities
by drawing up a written report of the
crime, the mangled body of the Minis
ter of the Interior was .conveyed to a
hunble chapel adjoining the railway
Btation. the windows of. which had es
caped destruction. Priests and people,
with characteristic Russian piety, at
once Joined in a solemn requiem. The
pquare in front of the station was filled
with a reverent crowd of peasants and
laborers, and the busy hum of traffic
was silenced. A priest proclaimed the
memory of the departed Minister, while
all those in the congregation droppe'd
to their knees.
The police, immediately after the ex
plosion, arrested a suspicious individ
ual who took refuge in a hotel near the
*?ene of the tragedy. He carried a
bomb Fitnilar to that thrown by Leglo.
As soon as the police saw the bomb
Xbty ecattered, but an employe of the
hotel rushed up behind the accomplice
end pinned liis arms.
The explosive is believed to have
been composed of "pyroxiin, as it gave
off little smoke. The force of the ex
plosion was so terrific that it not only
broke nearly ever?' window within a
radius of a half mile, but reduced
heavy pavin< stones to powder, heaved
tip the cavement and flung a heavy
piece of ironwork of the carriage
across the canal, severing a thick
barg-c mast which fell, Etunning the
captain of the barge. Everybody in
the street was knocked down and
bruised.
The assassin wore a brown overcoat
find a railroad officer's cap. He stood
on the sidewalk Just as Minister von
Plehwe's carriage was about to cross
the canal bridge near the station. The
Minister was escorted by a number of
detectives on bicycles, and one of them
jostled the assassin, who then rushed
into the road and threw the bomb
after the carriage. The missile struck
Â¦Jhe hind wheel and exploded with fear
ful force, killing or wounding more
than a 6core of persons. Minister von
Plehwe and his coachman were killed
outright and an officer of the guard
\Â»-as fatally injured.
One of the detectives seized the as
sassin, v.ho had attempted to escape,
though wounded by splinters in the
face, arm and abdomen. He made no
attempt at resistance, however, when
peized by the detective and confessed
his crime, but refused to give his

ST. PETERSBURG, July 2S.â As
Minister of Justice - Muravieff was
driving to the Peterhof Palace this aft

BO3IB'S AWFXTi FORCE.
In conclusion, Balfour' said:
"I cannot help feeling that there Is
some misapprehension regarding the
duty incumbent upon neutrals. I have
so far only stated what we believe to
be the duties and obligations of bellig
erents, and these duties, to the best of
our abilities, we mean to see carried
into, effect, but the belligerent of to
day is the neutral of to-morrow. There
are duties Incumbent upon neutrals
which must be. borne in mind by the
ship owners of the country. It is un
doubtedly the duty of a captain of : a
neutral ship to stop when summoned
to stop by a cruiser of a belligerent and
to allow, without difficulty, his papers
to lie examined. That obligation on
neutrals we have systematically, con
sistently and sternly enforced when we
have been belligerents and it would not
become us to minimize that duty."
tice Is that any ship reasonably sus
pected of carrying contraband of war
should be taken by the belligerent to
one of its own ports and its trial should
take place before the prize court by
which the case is to be determined."
The Premier continued: "More seri
ous than the others Is the case of the
Knight Commander. If, as our infor
mation leads us to. fear, she was sunk
by a cruiser of the Vladivostok squad
ron,on the ground that she carried con
traband of war, in our view this was
entirely contrary to the practice of na
tions in war time, and we have earnest
ly pressed our view on the Russian
Government."
any more threatening letters and re
monstrated with", him for going about
unprotected. Curiously, Von Plehwe
replied:
"I am safe enough every day In- the
wqpk except on Thursday. No one
knows of my movements beforehand
except on that day, when everybody
knows I go to present my weekly re
port to the Emperor."
The assassin was dressed in the uni
form of a Warsaw railway guard. He
is a comparatively young man.

On July 2 W. H. Quann, bookmaker
at the Hastings races, three miles out
side of ths city, was stopped by a
masked man and robbed of $6000.
Quann was unable to see the man's
face, but took a good look at his revol
ver hand. He told the police that if he
ever saw the hand again he would b*e
able to recognize it. Sam McDonald,
who formerly lived in San Francisco,
and recently a professional gambler of
this city, was arrested later and
charged with the hold-up.
To-day the police put Quaan's hand
theory to a novel test.
A large curtain was brought into
court and holes for six pairs of hands
were cut. The prisoner and five other
mfn were ranged behind the curtain
and put their hands through the holes.
Quann was brought in and confronted
with the twelve hands in the row, be
ing unable to see their owners. Unhes
itatingly he picked out the hands of
McDonald as those of the man who
held the revolver at his head.

Mr. Upham alluded to the old-time
subsidy that was paid to tho Pacific
Mail Steamship Company by the trans
continental railroads, amounting, to
575.000 a month, for the purpose of
preventing tompetition by sea. While
the railroads shipped no freight in the
Pacific Mall steamships, space was re
served for the roads, making it impos
sible for others to send freights over
the Panama route. Then the Panama
road and the Pacific Mall Steamship
Company had a falling out. The Pan
ama Railway declined to renew its
contract with the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company and entered into an
agreement with. San Francisco busi
ness men that resulted in the forma
tion of the North American Navigation
Company, through the agency of the
Traffic Association. Ships were put on
the Panama route by the "San Fran
cisco merchants. 'This brought down

Once before California has had com

American Navigation Company ran
ships in connection .with a sea line put
on by the Panama Railway Company,
and put the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company out of business for a time be
tween San Francisco and New York
and way points. During the same pe
riod the rail rates were forced to meet
the sea rates. In this an example was
afforded of what can be permanently,
effected in rail rates. â¢ .
The Traffic Association of California
did splendid work at that time for this
State. It was composed of hundreds of
San Francisco business firms, who
stood together for the common good. It
efficiently aided in the construction of
the first railway to bring competition
on overland business into Northern
California by the institution of the San
Joaquin Valley road. An object lesson
was afforded at the same time of the
willingness of the San Francisco busi
ness houses to combine for common
business advantage, which Is still of
value as a leverage, for the large
houses then at the front and most of
the active movers in both the North
American Navigation Company and the
Traffic Association are still actively en
gaged in business.
The transportation men and the rep
resentatives of business houses held
another conference yesterday. All those
in attendance at the conferences have
been pledged to secrecy from the start,

the part of all participants in the meet

such vast importance to the coast, that
have been in progress. Several business

It Is my 'earnest desire to co-operate with
Democrats all over the country to bring alwt't
a change in the administration. We must put
the Democratic party In control to check im
perialism and oligarchy and to bring the de
partments of the Government under the light
of complete investigation. We will deal Justly
with those departments, but there must be no
immunity from prosecution for those who are
guilty of wrong doing. There must not t\p
whitewashing for corruptlonlsts. Â¦
It is necessary to have a change in party
In control of this country. We must put the
Democratic party In control In order to put
an end to the spoils system and end corrup
tion. Â«.
Roosevelt's administration Is not a credit
able one; it Is not like that of McKinley. If
the Republican party took credit for the pros
perity in McKlnley'a time, when it must take
discredit for the bad times under Roosevelt.
No man Is more American than Judge Par
ker, or a more Ideal American, and he was
also selected because he is from New York.
He will carry New York, and that means the
defeat. of Roosevelt.
AX IDEAL AMERICAN.
If Roosevelt carries New York he will be
elected; if Parker carries that State he will
be elected. Judge Parker was nominated on
account of his sterling qualities and his ex
alted position, which he has tilled with dig
nity for seventeen years and with the greatest
satisfaction.

There are two great forces battling for
supremacy in this country, and we must de

our lot. There can be no question tie to which
we will stand with. Men who believe In law
and liberty will stand with the Democrats in
this campaign.
All ' Republicans are not imperialists and
believers in oligarchy, but all Imperialists and
believers in oligarchy are Republicans.
Pj-esident Roos<evelt said to the notification
committee that the Democratic party is di
vided, but he Is not interested in those di
visions, if any exist. Certainly not in the
South thanks to Roosevelt.
i a P le asure to see a reunited and har
inonlous Democracy that Intends to battle for
the < common cause. I see here men who be
neve ..in the party, but who have been sepa
rated on account, of certain issues.
I am delighted to see that the ardor for the
grand principles of Democracy Is not damp

ship of that grand leader Judge Parker, a
great victory will be won "in November. ;
In all civilized countries there are two great

FUN FOR>-AUDIENCE.
The Republican administration under Roose
velt has given us three thingsâ doubt, slump
and a lO-cent dollar. That Roosevelt has
courage no one can deny. So has the man
that smokes In a. powder mill. I have con
cluded that he has too much martial spirit.
The strenuous strenuoslty of strenuouaness is
admirable when confined as It was In his
charge up San Juan Hill, but when it steadily
shows itself in the White House it becomes
a menace and Inquietude must follow.
The nation needs a change and I am not
afraid the Democratic party will make an
over-radical change. If anything I fear it
leans more toward extreme conservatism than
radicalism. I earnestly hope this campaign
we are entering on will continue to be con
ducted with the spirit of good temper. The
union belongf, to us all and is dear to us all.
The great majority of its people are Intensely
patriotic.'.. Let this be a campaign of educa
tion and whether we be Democrats or Repub-r
llcans. Prohibitionists or Socialists, let us all
be Americans, clasping hands under the folds
of Old Glory.
The atmosphere of the nation Is charged
with doubt. Hard times are upon us. You
worklngmen here know this. Go home and
ponder upon It. In the South we find that
discontent exists through that unhappy In
terference in the negro question. In financial
circles there 1Â» uncertainty as to what Roose
velt may do sloshing about midst the nations
of the earth. In the mercantile world wages
are less and production is less. To all of
you I say that the tide of prosperity Is on
the ebb. Two years ago It set in and to
day it la flowing more and more toward
disaster.
In Introducing Congressman E. J.
Livernash, who was the next speaker,
Chairman Tobin paid him a tribute for
his fidelity and energy. In turn Mr.
Livernash paid Mr. Tobin a tribute and
stamped him as "one of God's noble
men." This showering of compliments
was refreshing in view of memories of
recent events in the Democratic ranks.
It seemed unnatural; it breathed too
much c-f peace, but there were none
that hinted that either was not sin
cere. Addressing himself to the pur
pose of the meeting, Mr. Livernash, in
his deliberate, pleasing style, said, in
part:
In choosing a President and a Vice Presi
dent we should counsel with great care. I
know that President Roosevelt ia ' an able,
well-meaning man, and that the Republican
party holds millions of conscientious, honest
men. but one of the deepest convictions of my
life is that the welfare of this nation would
be advanced by placing another party In
power; by placing In the Presidential chair
Alton B. Parker.

decisions are unexceled. Judge Parlter would
be the instrument .to bring this republic back
to that condition on" which Its etabi'.lty de
pends.
The speaker then declared that the
country was tired of President Roose
velt and his claims to be considered a
military hero, and satirized the war
record of, the chief executive, but his
remarks were scantily applauded.'
He accused the President of being
lukewarm In prosecuting the trusts and
declared that the President had treated
Admiral Sampson; and General Miles
In an unfair manner. The reference to
Miles drew hearty applause. He said
President Roosevelt had ignored Jef
ferson In one of his books, and further
asserted that he wishes to run every
department In Washington. â¢
The speaker then dwelt on the affairs
of the country of the past few years
and said:
We want a President who is the antithesis
of Mr. Roosevelt, who will listen to others.
Our nominee is a distinguished jurist and bis
We will make an appeal to the people on
the platform we have made â a platform for
the benefit of the people and not of a favored
few. The people must consider the head
strong peculiarities of our present President.
The speaker then said that the Dem
ocratic party opposed an army or navy
that could be used for bullying weak
nations. He said the republic should
not be warlike and seek dominion.
Continuing, he said:
We have been called the parties of the op
position, but the outlook Is that we wlIl.Tje

the Democratic party (stands. It la earnest In

J. C. Sims, ex-State Senator from
Santa Rosa ana ex-chairman of the
State Central Committee, was the next
speaker. After declaring that Wynn
and Livernash had rendered good ser
vice to the party and should be re
elected, he said in part:
Under the leadership of Parker and Davis
we will be led to victory. We are united, we
have no unnatural alliances to corrupt and

Is Indeed a pleasure for me to stand here to

of Alton J. Parker? Three years ago I worked
and tolled in the machine shops of this city.

me to public life. Since then conditions have
changed and, though three years ago the

the writer regretting that he was un
able to be present at the meeting -and
indorsing the Democratic platform.
Chairman Tobin then announced that
Thomas J. Geary could not be present
on account of illness in his family.
Congressman Wynn was next intro

with affiliations and constituents alien
to the Democratic party. He was wel
comed and he manifested his apprecia
tion. His speech was well prepared,
but his memory as to Parker's initials
was clouded. Alton T., Alton J. and Al
ton G. he called the Democratic stand
ard-bearer, and won the smiles of the
audience. In part Mr. Wynn said:

SAN FRANCISCO. July 27. 1904.
Hon. T. Spellacy. Chairman Democratic
State Central Committeeâ Dear Sir:. . I am
compelled to decline your kind Invitation to
speak at the ratification meeting on Thursday
evening, as I leave. to-day for Oregon, " there
to take part in the mme pleasant task, under
arrangements made Bome time ago. It is al
ways an honor to bÂ« asked to speak In behalf
of the" Democrats of America; and It is doubly
*o when to apeak for them Is also to ratify
such a platform and such a ticket as American
Democracy hae now presented to us. Too much
It teems that many faces of Democrats who
have been absent for some years from our
meetings are here again .and that our party
is united. The man that drlfU with the crowd
may be sleek and prosperous and It is easy
enough to live after the opinion of the world.
ThÂ«? great man In he who retains the sereni
ty of his own principles. We are here to in
dorse such a man. By one simple act he
placed himself In the front rank of men. We
have In him a man more sincere than politic.
He did not Indulge In speeches nor useless
newspaper Interviews before the, convention.
He has stamped himself as a man of honor
and distinction. His simple message to the
convention proclaimed him a man among men.
Democrats realize that they have a great
leader in Alton H. Parker.
When he rose to call the meeting to
order Chairman' Tobin was enthusias
tically greeted. Though the cheers were
manifestly in tribute to the party and
the event at hand, there was also a
tone of admiration for the man that led
the Democrats in a former municipal
campaign. Mr. Tobin bowed In ac
knowledgment and when quiet came
eaid in part:
Notwithstanding this fact I want to say to
you that I need the friendFhip and assisance
of every Democrat In this State. As chairman
nf the Central Committee I want to represent
the entire jiait..-; I want to represent no fac
tion: I want to be the chairman of all. I want

TOBIN TAKES CHAIR.
There was one phase of the meeting
that occasioned comment. In extend
ing invitations to the stalwarts to
serve as vice presidents the State Cen
tral Committee was generous. Had all
that were named as vice presidents at
tended they would have filled the Al
hambra and made the street impassa
ble, but in spite of generous invita
tions even the chairs on the stage were
not all occupied. It was 8:30 o'clock
when Timothy Spellacy of Kern, chair
man of the state Centra! Committee,
called the meeting to order. At his ap
pearance on the stage, accompanied by
Joseph S. Tobln, chairman of the meet
ing, James G. Magulre. Thomas M.
O'Connor. Congressmen Livernash and
Wynn, Frank H. Gould and Charles
Sweigert, the audience, which .had long
been growling at the delay, became at
tentive. Advancing to the front of the
stage without ceremony, Mr. Spellacy
said: 'Â¦Â¦.'.?:'Â¦''-';-
Before I Introduce the chairman of this
meeting. Mr. _Tobln, I want to Bay something:
to you. This is a ratification meeting, but
greater pleasure awaits you. On November
10 we will hold a jollification meeting In a
laiK'T hall than this to celebrate the greatest
victory thlc grand old republic has ever seen.
On June la last. I was elected chairman of
the State Central Committee. Since that time
I have traveled quite extensively and I can
a*?ure you that the conservative Republicans
are frtentened. They are getting into our band
wagon by the thousands and by November 8
next the great legion of voters that means vic
tory will be with us. If the trusts and com
bines and those they control phould ceawe to
'jcist the Kepublican party would not have
votrs enough left to place a ticket In the field.
OCCASION'S COMMENT.
Inspection showed that, the hall was
draped in bunting and a sign in letters
of gold gave the names of the men In
whom the ho:>es of the party are cen
tered. The trained political eye .looked
for evidences of harmony in the party.
From the center of the hall the fea
tures of Charles Wesley Reed beamed
forth. They were In a strange environ
ment. None of the war horses were
near him to swap reminiscences. Way
back, sitting low down in his chair,
was Gavin McNab, director general of
the works, talking to E. Myron Wolf,
Insurance Commissioner. Around on
every hand were strangers on the field
of Democratic battle. Doubtless others
of the stalwarts were there, but they
attracted no attention. This gave a
harmonious complexion, but many won
dered whether it was peace or the lull
between the gone and the gathering
storm.
From 7 to 8 o'clock a brass band
brayed to entice voters within, but met
with discouragement. The opening ad
dress was to a half-empty house. In
the gallery but two rows were occupied.
This lack of interest delayed the ora
torical feast.

nomination of Alton Brooks Parker and
H. G. Davis at the Alhambra Theater
last night. The enthusiasm was not
marked nor were the numbers over
whelming. "

Los Angeles Police Surgeon
Performs Very Delicate
Operation on Colored Man
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 28. â Alfred
Smith, colored, was stabbed in the
heart by two other negroes this even
ing during a fight over some trivial
matter and was taken to the Receiving
Hospital apparently In a dying con
dition. Realizing that here was hard
ly a chance to save the man's life, Po
lice Surgeon A. M. Smith took des
perate chances and performed one of
the most amazing pieces of surgery
ever attempted here.
The operation consisted of cutting
away the ribs over the patient's heart
until that organ was plainly exposed
and then taking two stitches in the
heart itself. Dr. Smith then stitched
Uip the cardiac sack and restoring it to
place closed the incision in the ne
gro's body through which he had oper
ated. ?
"When the negro came from under
the influence of the anesthetic he was
seemingly in better condition tnan
-when he entered the hospital and he
is thought to have more than an even
chance of recovery. Dr. Smith stated
that the knife entered the left ven
tricle, but not deeply enough to let
out much blood or interfere with the
muscular movement of the heart.
That very movement had increased
the length of the wound and the
stitches were taken on the outside. To
reach the heart portions of the ribs
had to be cut away and if Smith lives
these will be replaced later with silver.
The man who stabbed Smith has not
been captured. ' _ _ _ . :

At the conference yesterday after
noon the railway company was repre
sented by General Manager Markham
and Messrs. Small and Heintzmann, su
perintendents of motive power. John
McNeil, grand president of the Broth
erhood of Boiler-makers and Iron Ship
Builders of America, represented the
strikers. After a long: conference, in"
which the ooints at issue were argued
pro and con, a proposition was finally
agreed uoon for submission to the un
ion. It provides that all the men now
out be returned to their old positions,
but gives the company the privilege of
retaining the men who have been tak
ing the strikers' places, provided they
are employed in departments other
than thÂ» boiler shop, such, for instance,
as the scrap pile or the freight yards,
or other departments where skilled
labor is not required. There is some
dispute regarding apprentices, but this
is not considered of sufficient moment
to cause a serious breach.
At an informal gathering: of the mem.
bers of the union in Harmony Hall last
night the action of its chief officer met
with hearty approval. The men seem
anxious to get back to work. The dis
pute was not over wages or hours, but
over the failure of the company to re
employ the union men who were laid
off when work was slack, taking in
their places non-union men.
It Is authoritatively stated that only
a few minor points remain to be set
tled and a new agreement signed. It is
expected that this settlement will be
made this morning, the papers signed
and a strike which threatened to tie up
the whole Pacific system of the South
ern Pacific will be at an end.
A conference was held between rep
resentatives of the striking boiler-mak
ers and the officials of the Southern
Pacific yesterday afternoon, and as a
result it is probable that all the men
now on strike will be back at work by
next Monday.

To-night both sides to the dispute
at the stockyards were claiming a
victory. According to the packers,

thÂ» other hand, the labor leaders de
clare the packing industry in Chi

is almost at a standstill. That the

not altogether true is evidenced by
the fact that the packers are slaugh

Among the witnesses yesterday were
Colonel Sedgwlck Pratt, Inspector Gen
eral Lieutenant H. A. Hanigan, Lieu
tenant E. H. Tarbutton, Sergeant Ma
jor Smith and Sergeant Dullagher. The
scenes of the orgle at the discharge
camp were realistically described by
some of ther witnesses, who took part
in breaking up the festivities of that
occasion.
Report has it that on that momen
tous evening, when Lieutenant Hani
gan sent word to White to put the
"ladies" of the orgy party out of his
quarters. White sent back word that
there were no ladies there. When
Hanigan broke in the door a grand
scampering took place. White pointed
his pistol at Hanigan, and Â¦ Hanigan
grabbed a gun from a sentinel and
threatened to shoot White unless he
behaved himself. In the meantime the
boatman who brought the women over
from the city was on the beach, shout
ing for them to come down and pay
him for his services, Hanigan wound
up the carousal by arresting White and
Smith and sending the "ladles" home.
Among the general testimony that
will be introduced are a large number
of telegrams pent from Angel Island to
this city by the young lieutenants. In
these a party by the name of "Flossie"
appears to play a prominent part.
When the case is resumed this morn
ing more evidence will be introduced
for the prosecution. Smith, it i% re
potred, will call White to the stand to
testify in his behalf. â '

Smith raised objections at every
point. Some of his objections, it is re
ported, were well taken, and at others,
it is- rumored, a suppressed smile suf
fused the faces of the members of the
court. Nevertheless he succeeded f in
keeping the courtroom cleared of wit
nesses at frequent intervals, that the
members of the court might discuss
the different objections he brought up.
The entire day was taken \ip by the
prosecution, the court adjourning at 5
o'clock.
Lieutenant Smith again conducted
his case single-handed. Heopenedup
the session by again challenging Cap
tain Samson L. Falson of the Thir
teenth Infantry, and requesting that
Faison be permitted to retire from the
court. Smith was"sÂ« strenuous in his
demands that finally Faison withdrew
from the board and the trial proceeded
without him.
The military trial of Lieutenant
Charles F. Smith, one of the partici
pants/in the Angel Island orgies, wa3
resumed at the Presidio yesterday
morning at 10 o'clock. The session was
carried on in absolute scerecy behind
barred doors. The reception room ad
joining the court room, to which the
representatives of the press had been
allowed access on the opening day of
the trial, was, by order of General
Morris, closed to every one excepting
those immediately connected with the

Police Judge Conlan Is seeking advice
as to the legal value of a petition that
v.as presented to him yesterday. The
document marks an innovation in the
submittal of "character, testimony."
His Honor doea hot desire to snub peti
tioners, neither does he want to con
flict with the lav.
The situation is a development of the
complaint of Miss EL Jackson of 507
Shotwell street against John C. Tooker,
who lives next door to her. Miss Jack
eon accuses Mr. Tooker of disturbing
her peace on the Fourth of July by
chucking lighted firecrackers ?nto her
dwelling through an open winaow and
by retorting to her mild expostulations
with language vile. It was to offset
Miss Jackson's Insinuation as' to his
general character that Mr. Tooker in
troduced the petition thSt Judge Con
lan now has under consideration. Here
is a verbatim copy of it:
S. J. Keyes. charged by his wife
with having followed her from Phila
delphia with Intent to take her life,
will have a hearing this morning De
fore Judge Conlan. Inability to pro
cure bail in the sum of 54000 makes
him an inmate of the City Prison. He
was a widower and his wife a widow
with two children when they were
married five years ago in Philadelphia
and the woman says that the man's
treatment of her was so brutal that
she was compelled to leave him. Her
19-year-old daughter is an accom
plished pianist and her 17-year-old son
is a ticket taker at the Chutes. They
dwell at 2676 McAllister street.
"Let me down easy, Judge," said
Emma Deutsch, incurable vagrant, to
Judge Fritz, "for I'm not feeling well."
"Nor do you look well," his Honor
responded, "and a long sojourn in the
Dranch County Jail will do you a
world of good."
"Six months, I suppose?" ventured
Emma.
"No, I'll surprise you by making it
five months."
For the second time a jury failed to
agree on a verdict in Â¦ the case of
George Greenwell, accused before
Judge Fritz of practicing medicine
without a license. The defendant, who
is an ex-pastor, was a senior student
at the California Medical College when
he was arrested, on March 18 and
charged with having accepted from
one Charles Carlos the sum of $1 ror
a prescription, the arrest being made
at the instigation of Dr. Dudley Tait,
secretary of the State Board of Medi
cal Examiners. The prosecution in
sisted that the dollar was exacted as
payment by Greenwell, while the <Je
tense maintained that it was forced
upon his acceptance by Carlog. .
Assistant District Attorney Greeley
resented a policeman's insinuation that
the art of "rushing the growler" is
nurtured only in the region south of
Market streat. The case of John B.
Murray, accused of selling liquor with
out a license at the Presidio, was on
hearing. A patrolman swore that It
was sold in cans and carried away
"just as they sell it south of Market
street."
"May It please the court," exclaimed
Mr. Greeley, "the selling of beer in

3Iarriage Licenses.
The trial of the suit of B. M. Eis
ner against Miss Flossie Lewis for the
return of a. diamond ring and other
gifts presented to the plaintiff in hon
or of their marriage engagement was
resumed yesterday before Justice of
the Peace Daniels. Eisner was on the
stand for an hour and was subjected
to a" rigid cross-examination by the
defendant's attorney, who attempted
to draw from Eisner the admission
that the engagement was broken for
cause, owing to Eisner's alleged unbe
coming conduct. Judge Daniels ruled
that such evidence would only be ad
missible in a breach of promise suit.
Miss Lewis, through her attorney,
offered to return three steins, a cot and
other articles and $6 65 in cash, and
Eisner accepted the offer. The an
swer to the complaint in which she
denied ever having received the ring
or that it was in her possession was
read and the attorneys for both sides
submitted their case. One point upon
which Daniels desired to look up the
authorities was the fact that no tes
timony was adduced that the ring was
in Miss Lewis* possession at the time
Eisner demanded its return. It was
expected that Miss Lewis would take
the stand, but neither of the attorneys
called her thereto.

cation from the Milwaukee Knights

possible the cruiser be dipped into her
future element during their visit to this
city on the occasion of the* great con
clave, which begins Monday, September
5, and will last one week.
. It Is not yet known just who will be
present from the State of Wisconsin
or its capital city, but it may be stated
that some of the State officials will
represent Milwaukee at the launching.
It is possible that Governor La Fol
lette will attend the conclave and be
on hand when the cruiser goes down
the ways into the water. Among the
fair women accompanying the Sir
Knights from far Wisconsin will be
found one worthy to spill the wine and
speak the name â "Milwaukee."

Fuey Loy, a native born citizen of
the United States, was before United
States Commissioner Heacock yester
day on a charge of being unlawfully
in this country. He proved his right
to remain and was dismissed.
Incidentally it developed during the
hearing that Fuey Loy had previous
ly appeared before the Chinese bureau
and had then given the name of Wong
Je Yung. He took oath that he was
indebted to a Chinaman named Foon
Dak in- the sum of 51000. This was
done in order that Foon Dak might
obtain a return certificate as a Chi
nese laborer, the requirement being
that in order to return to this country
a laborer must have solvent credits
to the amount of $1000. Foon Dak
is a member of the Salvation Army
and he prevailed upon Fuey Loy to
commit this perjury in order to permit
him to -go. to London as an example
of what Christianity could do with the
"heathen Chinee."

For fourteen years Gilpin was City
Treasurer of Oakland. He was known
as "Honest Old Zach."
Two attachments have been levjed on
the property of former City Treasurer
Z. T. Gilpin. A blanket attachment was
filed this evening by W. E. Dean, an
assignee of Dr. .W. D. Huntington, on
four pieces of property standing in the
name of Mrs. May Gilpin in order to
secure notes aggregating $3600. It is
claimed by Dean that this property is
community property and Is liable for
the debts of the husband, although
standing in the name of the wife. The
only piece of property standing In .Gil
pin's name is one piece mortgaged to
the Central Bank for $4000.
In the meantime there are complaints
from other sources. An attachment has
been Jevied on a piece of property be
longing to Mrs. Gilpin by H. Blais, a
money lender, for $1500. This note is
signed by Gilpin and his wife and by
George W. Johnson and his wife.
Frank H. Brooks of the California
Bank admits that Gilpin owes his con
cern considerable money, and it is
rumored that it Is as much as $10,000,
although this cannot be verified.
Brooks, however, states they- are anx
ious to find Gilpin.
Gilpin, it is supposed, is now in the
hills back of Colfax, where he is in
terested in some mines. Attorney Fred
L. Button, a close intimate friend of
Gilpin, said: "When Gilpin left he was
very much exercised over his financial
affairs. What worried him the most
was a large number of personal notes
he had given to friends and acquaint
ances which were unsecured and which
he was unable to met."

Captain William A. Irvine said that
the engineer, W. D. Sullivan, must
have misunderstood his orders to run
the ship at forty-seven revolutions per
minute and had gone at the rate of
fifty. Owing to this variance between
the order and the performance the
captain was thrown out of his reck
oning. He said that the action of the
engineer caused the loss of the ship.
Another session of the United States
inspectors was held yesterday in the
matter of the investigation Into the
wreck of the steamship Colon on April
11 of this year on Remedios Reef oh
the Guatemalan coast. J. M. Camp
bell, second- assistant engineer, was
the only new witness examined. Ac
cording to his testimony the captain,
the three engineers, the tirst, second
and third officers and the rest having
anything to do with navigating the
ship were cold sober, while all the
whisky and champagne consumed to
celebrate the wedding of First Officer
Wilson was imbibed by H. G. Stevens,
the storekeeper, and a few others who
were hilariously drunk. The inspec
tors promised to render a decision in
the near future.

The litigation over the money closed
in September, 1901, and then, acting
upon Brennan's suggestion, the aged
ecclesiastic gave the doctor a check
for $37,524, with the understanding, It
Is said, that the doctor should deposit
the money in trust for the priest. The
physician put the money in bank, in his
own name and Father Grey rebelled.
Brennan answered the suit with the
declaration that the money had been
duly assigned to him. On DecemDer
24 last Judge Sloss granted a tem
porary injunction against Brennan and
yesterday made the* order hold pend
ing the trial of the suit for ownership
of the money, but the court requires
that the priest shall furnish an ade
quate bond in the sum of $2000.
Superior Judge Sloss yesterday
granted an injunction against Dr.
Thomas F. Brennan, the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank and others to restrain the
withdrawal or disposition of $37,524
pending the litigation of Father P. J.
Grey, who is suing for the recovery of
the sum named.
Father Grey is 86 years old. In 1899
his eyes\7ht was impaired almost to
the point of total blindness, and, be
sides, on account of a;ls great age, n*s
was sick and feeble. He employed Dr.
Brennan to treat him and the treat
ment extended to November 11, 1903.
At that time Father Grey was liti
gating for an interest in certain

A special committee from the Mer
chants* Exchange composed of Wil
bur Walker, J. F. W. Sohst and T. G.
Elben met officials of the Southern Pa
cific Company this afternoon with re
lation to the establishment of an all
night ferry service between Oakland
and San Francisco.
The conference was not productive of
immediate results. After a presenta
tion of the arguments by the commit
tee, the representatives from Oakland
were Informed that their application
would be given consideration. No time
was specified when further action will
be taken.
Concerning the meeting, Commission
er Eiben said:
"We discussed the subject of all night boat*
freely with the railroad officials. As no de
cision was reached we have pledged ourselves
not to talk about the matter for the present.
We are hopeful that something will be done In
the near future.
In railroad circles it is freely assert
ed that very shortly the long rumored
electricizing of the steam line on Sev
enth street will be commenced. It is
said that the railroad company has re
ceived complete estimates of cost of the
projected change and has detailed
plans of construction in hand.
Further, the talk is strong that un
til the company makes thi3 change
there will be no radical departures
from the present service.

VANCOUVER. B. C, July 28. â
News was brought from the north by
the steamer Danube to-day that there
is wreckage of two four-masted
schooners on South Gander Island. It
is thought, judging from the condition
of the wreckage, that the vessels must
have met disaster quite close to the
islands. The South Gander lies about
thirty miles from Day Point, which is
situated on the northwest entrance to
Milbank Sound.

REMAINS l/F MRS. CROCKER
ARC PLACED IN VAULT
Body of San Francisco Woman Depos
ited in Greenwood Pending
Decision of Relatives.
NEW YORK, July 28.â The body
of Mrs. George Crocker of San Fran
cisco, who died In Newport on Mon
day, was placed In the receiving vault
in Greenwood Cemetery, South Brook
lyn, this afternoon to await the da
cision of the family as to final burial.
The decision means a return to the
old fee system. Under it a tramp ar
rested is worth $1 to the Constable
arresting him and mileage\to the jail.
Justices of the Peace collect fees for
criminal cases from the county and fees
for civil cases from the claimants be
fore them.
The decision affects Justices of the
Peace and Constables in twenty-one
counties throughout the State.
There is much perturbation among
the Justices of the Peace and Consta
bles of the county as to the effect of
the decision of the Supreme Court de
claring the law unconstitutional which
fixed their salaries according to the
population "of the township for which
they were elected. County Auditor Ba
con has been appealed to to know what
he will do toward paying off for this
month, and he has referred the matter
to District Attorney Allen, who is now
engaged in looking up the decision and
the scope of Its language.
None of the Justices or Constables
has kept any account of what business
has been transacted during the month
and many state that they will not
have a cent coming to them if the de
cision is held to apply to the present
month. Justice of the Peace Quinn,
whose salary has been $225 a month
under the law just declared void, said
to-day: "If that decision is held to
apply to the present month I won't
have anything coming to me." Jus
tice of the Peace Geary said his sal
ary would not pay house rent this
month. Very few of the Constables
have done sufficient work to entitle
them to any considerable sum.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, July 28.
With a bride of three weeks mourn
ing his departure, Walter S. Snow,
a real estate dealer of Brockton, Mass.,
has quietly folded his tent and slipped
away. Mrs. Snow awaits news of her
spouse at her home In San Leandro.
Before her marriage she was Mrs. Kllen
May Tanson. Recently Snow issued a.
public notice that he would not be re
sponsible for his wife's debts. Indeed,
it is said, the disturbances so soon
after the wedding were caused by
Snow's discovery that his spouse had
contracted a large nunjber of liabilities
that the creditors were trying to un
load upon him.
Snow arrived last February. He met
Mrs. Tanson, then a resident of San
Leandro, and they were soon married.
The Snows found a home at San Lean
dro, but troubles began early. Last
night Snow departed. His announce
ment was that he intended to return to
Massachusetts and he did not care
whether his wife followed him or not.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, July 28.
Pickpockets held revel in the crowds.
J. L. Kennan lost $50. P. Church had
$85 stolen from him. Mrs. Rose Bish
op's purse, containing $37 50, was taken.
J. Smith reported that $19 was filched
from his pockets.
After the speaking the visitors were
entertained at an old-time Spanish
barbecue, which was followed by a
programme of automobile and horse
races and athletic event.->. which were
>pen to all comers. There was also a
baseball game at Recreation Park.
The exercises closed wi.Ii a ball In the
eve.'.ng. The celebration was arranged
by the following committee of citizens:
L. U. Grant, William Richards and
John Murray.
The opening of the new road is an
event of importance, not fÂ»nly to the
citizens of Point Richmond, but to
every resident of Contra Costa County,
for as the lines of the company are
extended means of rapid transporta
tion will be furnished from Martinez,
Point Richmond and intermediate
points to Oakland, Berkeley and Ala
meda.
The other speakers were Senator
Charles M. Belshaw and A. ? Mac
donald of Oakland. It was through the
efforts of Macdonald that the Santa
Fe Company secured its present fran
chise from Stockton to Oakland.
Superior Judge William S. Wells of
Martinez welcomed the new road on
behalf of the citizens of Richmond. He
said that the town of Richmond was to
be congratulated upon being the pos
sessor of the first electric street railway
to be put in operation in Contra Costa
County. He also said that he believed
that the time was not far distant when
the lines of the new company would be
extended to Martinez.
W. S. Rheem. superintendent of the
Standard Oil Works at Richmond, who
is also general manager of the East
Shore and Suburban .Company, re
spunded on behalf of the electric road.
Rheem said that the officials : of the
company had already determined to
extend the road to connect with the
San Pablo-avenue division of the Oak
land Transit Company's system. He
declared that the company did not in
tend to stop at that, but that as soon
as posf^le the lines would be extended
to Martinez.
POINT RICHMOND. July 28.â The
new line of the Bast Shore and Sub
urban Street Car Company, which
forms the connecting link between the
old and the new towns of Richmond,
was opened to-day, and the first car to
make the round trip was welcomed
with a fitting demonstration by the
citizens of the community.
The celebration was held at Recrea
tion Park, and all day the cars over the
new road were packed with people go
ing to and from the park. Nearly 3000
visitors from other localities attended,
many of whom were from Oakland and
San Francisco. Both the Southern Pa
cific sjnd the Santa Fe ran special ex^
cursion trains to accommodate the
visitors.
"With the opening of the new college
year at the .University of California will
come the revival of the Hearst domestic
industries school, from which Mrs-
Phoebe A- Hearst withdrew her sup
port at the close of the last semester.
This arrangement is made possible by
the subscriptions of a few friends of
the institution, and the means are now
provided by which at least a dozen
young women students may support
themselves through college.
Since Mrs. Hearst's announcement
that she would not longer assist the
school Miss Amanda M. Hicks, its man
ager, and its friends have been seeking
to secure the means to continue the
work. Now sufficient support has been
promised to revive the school on a
small scale. Twelve students will be
taken in at first, and the number grad
ually increased as the means at hand
permit. In time it is hoped to admit
as many as fifty students, that being
the number Mrs. Hearst supported.
At the time that the school was dis
continued by Mrs. Hearst it was stated
that she, having spent $10,000 in four
â¢years for its support, did not wish to
continue her gifts because the enter
prise was so expensive and did not jus
tify ths expenditures.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, July 28.
'The City Council did not follow this
procedure, but directed the planting
of American elms without consulting
the voters. The point is whether the
Council had authority to proceed in a
way not specified by the Legislature."
Barnett admitted he cut down the
trees. He called several horticulturists
to testify that the American elm ?vould
i uin sidewalks and sewers. Judge Sam
uels will decide the fate of the tree
planting scheme on August 1.
It was Barr.ett's contention before
Police Judge George Samuels to-day
that he had a right to chop down the
trees because, he asserted, they were a
nuisance. Deputy City Attorney W. H.
O'Brien argued that this had nothing to
do with the case. Judge Samuels, how
ever, referred to a State law on the
subject of tree planting on public thor
oughfares. It provides that in such tree
Ranting the question as to the kind of
trees to be thus used shall be decided
l>y v>t<Â» of the people. Judge Samuels
eaid further:
Barnett was originally charged with
malicious mischief, but this case was
dismissed. He was rearrested on a
complaint alleging that he had removed
the trees in violation of an ordinance
which requires permission to be granted
by the Board of Public Works before
a tree can be removed from a public
Ftreet.
Mayor Warren Olney's plan for beau
tifying the streets of Oakland with or
n-mtntal shade trees has fallen foul of
the statutes of California. The persist
ent objection to the setting out of elm
trtes in front of his property manifest
ed by Edward Barnett, a capitalist, on
Telegrnph avenue is at the bottom of
the trouble.

touched for hits when they were need

was steady when 1 men were on the
bases. This accounts /for the defeat
of the locals in the third same of the
series by the score of 4 to 2. There
were many spectacular plays by the
fielders of both sides. Bernard made
the most astonishing catch of a line
drive ever seen on the grounds. Eagar,
after a long run for a foul, crashed
into the grand stand and was knocked
senseless for several minutes. He held
the ball, however, and when he re
gained consciousness still had it in his
hand. Score: 'Â«. : "

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BRIGHTON BEACH. July 28. â The
officials wisely delayed calling the first
race to-day pending: the cessation ot
one of the hardest rainstorms of the
year, which converted the already
chocolate colored elipse into a pond.
There were four starters in the Iro
qyois stakes, Ort Wells being
scratched. Knight Errant carried top
weight, 126 pounds. He was required
to concede fifteen pounds to St. Valen
tine. Gold Saint made all the run
ning and but for a palpable fumble by
his rider, Hildebrand, at the last fur
loug pole he might have won. This
gave St. Valentine, which had been
under severe punishment for a furlong,
a chance to set up, which he did, win
ning by a head. Two lengths away
was Knight Errant, while Pentaur was
last. Time, 1:66 1-5.
Knight Errant slipped on the turn
after finishing. He threw his Jockey,
J. Martin, and ran toward the Judges'
stand, where he was caught.
During the storm to-day lightning
struck the stable occupied by the
horses of E. L. Graves and Frank
Clarkson at Gravesend, killing two
two-year-olds, Woodtrice and C W R.
Dinah Shad was reported killed, but
she was only stunned. The stable was
almost completely destroyed, tne
lightning tearing a hole through the

TWO STAKES TO BE RUN
AT INGLESIDE PARK
HARBIN SPRINGS, July 23.âVaca
tion days are at an end in the Jeffries
cump and the "limbering up" process
preparatory to three weeks of strenu
ous training commenced to-day. The
big champion returned from a hunting
trip late Tuesday night and looks the
picture of health. All soreness has dis
appeared from the knee that was re
sponsible for the postponement of the
last fight and no further trouble can
be anticipated from that source.
Notwithstanding the State law
which provides for the opening of the
deer season on July 15, the Supervisors
of Lake County passed an ordinance
making it a misdemeanor to kill deer
prior to August' L The possession of
vtnison is also prohibited. More than
twenty arrests have been made in va
rious parts of the county. A reward of
$25 has been offered for the arrest and
conviction of any one violating the
ordinance. A score of game wardens
aje roaming the county on the lookout
for lawbreakers.
In anticipation of the return of Jef
fries with several trophies of the chase,
a close watch was kept for the big fel
low. Genial Bill Spiers, president of
the Lake County stage lines, kept the
wires hot in an endeavor to locate Jef
fries and warn him of the danger of
arrest. Jim was finally located and he
shipped his venison to friends in San
Francisco before returning.
According to Billy Delaney 1 , . Jeff
weighs about 237 pounds at the pres
ent time and will undoubtedly enter the
ring at 220 pounds. "Jeff never was in
better health," says the veteran train
er, "and his knee is absolutely healed.
It caused him no trouble during the
hunting trip and his leg is as good as
ever." â¢.-.â¢--. V
Jen! spent considerable time in the
gym this morning toying with the
weights and rowing machine. No box
ing was indulged in and the work was
designed to limber up his muscles.
Delaney leaves to-morrow morning
to witness the Hanlon-Nelson go and
will second Eddie. Delaney sees in
Nelson a dangerous opponent, but
looks for Hanlon to win. Brother Jack
Jeffries is expected next week and
training will then comment in earnest.
Eddie Hanlcn and Battling Nelson
ci<5 their final turns at their training
vjuaners yesterday ajid now both box
ers art? patiently awaiting for Billy
Jordan to say "Let *er gi/* to-night st
Woodwards Pavilion. The rival box
ers ere both down to weight, but they
must Â£i> through the forajaliiy of
Muishing in at the Baldwin Theater on
Harket street at 6 o'clock this even-
The betting did not change last
ci^ftl, the same odds, 7 to 10, with
Hanlon favorite, prevailing. There was
Â«. lot of Hanlon money in sight, but ihe
Nelson men seemed to be holding out
lor a better price. The knowing ones
>ay 10 to 6 wiil be the price when the
boys face tach other in the ring. Many
bttlors art holding off until they see
bow the boxers look when they weigh
in.
Hanlon's friends are enthusiastic
ever the improvement in his form since
his last appearance here. This, coupled
with the fart that he will have so
competent a second as Billy Delaney
t< direct him in the rirg. has given
them unbounded confidence in his abil
ity to win.
When weighed yesterday afternoon
at his Quarters in Alameda Hanlon
moved the scales at 12'.* pounds. His
heaviest exercising during the day was
B four-mile jaunt in the moruir.g. In
the afternoon Eddie and his trainer.
Prank McDonald, drove in a buggy to
J^an L^andro to pass a few hours in a
vay that was not monotonous. Last
night Hanlon attended Ye Liberty
Thtater in Oakland, witnessing a pro
ductior. of "Mr. Barnes of New York."
Eddie i-etired at midnight and will
sleep until 11 o'clock to-day. He will
then go for a short walk and will dino
on squabs, toast and tea at lunch time.
Â¦ This afternoon Hanlon and McDonald
have planned to enjoy another drive.
They will return to doll's Gardens in
time to leave with the other members
of the training staff for this city at
4:15. Upon reaching this Fide at 3
o'clock the party will proceed to the
appointed place for weighing in.
Battling: Nelson has completed his
training for to-night's battle; After
norkfnz in the gym a few 'minutes
yesterday morning he was . weighed
and tipped the beam at I2?bi pounds.
Nelson said yesterday: "I have -worked
3<>ng and faithfully for this battle and
am in one condition. 1 have had no
trouble making the weijrht and will
probably enter the ring under weight.
J know 1 am up against a hard man,

PLEASANTON, July 28.â After tak
ing two heats with ease in the pacing
race at the second day's meet of the
California circuit, E. A. Servis* Edwia
S broke badly at the half in the third
heat and could not regain his stride.
Cuckoo, which was thought not to have
a sight on the coin, took the last three
heats and the race. Edwin S was
backed at 4 to 5 against the field in the
first heat. When he was distanced Oma
A was offered against the field. In the
last heat the horsemen began to realize
that Cuckoo waa not a plow skate, and
she was chalked ur> -at 2 to 1, but the
offer did not secure any takers. The
finishes were all close and full of thrills.
A mongrel dog came near upsetting
the last one. Just as the pacers whirled
up the stretch the dog started to cross
in front of them, despite the warnings
of the constabulary. The canine took
his time. Cuckoo whizzed by and the
sulky did the Juggernaut act to thn
mongrel's tall.
The trotting race was bran mash for
Durfee's Briney K. Rozell and Verona
followed him In the order named in
every heat. The last was close enough
to stop the multitude's breath and tha
town clock.
Tha buggy race was .?on by Geor&a
Gray's Isabel, which took both heats
without straining.
I The betting was brisker to-day, but
no heavy wagers were made. Ed Smith

Uncle Henry had a feeling way down
in the depths of his hearf that Frank
Barber could get hla old team mates,
the Siwashes, and uncle was figuring
on handing it out to Parke "Wilson
when the game was over. But It was
not to be. Barber had curves, speed
and control, but no luck. Seattle
glaumed four runs, and they were all
easy. The best uncle could do was one,
and that was a gift.
The fans were glad to see Barber on
the knoll, and signalized their pleasure
by some good, hearty cheering. When
he mystified the Siwashes In the first
round they cheered again. But Barber
could hold them runless for only one
inning. Their tally came In the second
and It came on errors.
Mr. Frisky Frisk fanned, but Leahy
dropped the ball and then tossed wide
to first. Williams bunted, and this time
Townsend threw the ball away. Smith
sacrificed them both along. Hall scored
Frisk with a long fly to center. The
sixth was good for another. This time
Frisk was clouted in the ribs, and again
Williams sacrificed. When Hall banged
it out to right field Frisk imprinted his
foot on the pan.
San Francisco broke In with one In
the seventh. Hildebrand hit out to
center, but the next two were easily
stowed away. Cy Townsend drove the
leather out to right for two, and Miller
banged to Delehanty. The latter fum
bled the ball a second, but recovered
quickly and put It on Townsend tearing
into third. "Safe," quoth the umpire,
and so the run was scored.
Seattle drew away again in the
eighth. This time Mr. Frisk walked
and came in with the assistance .of
Smith's two-baser to left. Hall had an
other one in his bat and it scored
Smith with the last run of the day.
Hall had twelve chances at short â
hard, medium and easy. He gobbled
'em all and pulled off some pretty
plays. Shields twirled ball that goes in
any man's league. Barring the errors,
the game contained everything that
makes the fans howl. The scqre:

Opponents of the Government ownership of railroads
have received from a most unexpected but convincing
Source another powerful argument to support their cause.
William Jennings Bryan has . unloosed his energies in
the Presidential campaign , and announces that whether
we will or no the Government must own the railroads.
What more need be said? We couldn't take the wrong
road now if we tried."
The Circuit Court of New York has announced its
judgment with due solemnity that in the formation of"
the steel trust men conspicuous neither for industry nor
ability made vast fortunes, a proceeding, the court de
cides, inimical to sound public policy. The public, how
ever, has yet to learn that the enforced attendance at
any of our penitentiaries has thereby been increased.
American investigators have the disagreeable faculty of
making' discoveries too late.
THE WOODEN HORSEâ Reader.
Santa Cruz, Cal. It was the siege cr
Troy. 1194-1184 before Christ, that was
raised by means of a wooden horse.
The story goes that the city was taken
by means of a device of the "crafty
Ulysses." Upon the plains in sight of
the city the Greeks built the statue
of a wooden horse, within whose hol
low body they concealed a number of
their warriors. Then* the whole Gre
cian army retired to their ships, aa
though giving up . their siege in de
spair. The Trojann came out on the
plain and gazed, in wonder at the
wooden image. They believed it had
been made by the Greeks as a pro
pitiatory offering to the gods, there
fore they bore It within the walls of
Troy. At night tho concealed Greek3
issued from the horse, opened the gates
of the city to the waiting army with
out and Troy was sacked and burned
to the ground. *.

Her lolterings and her soft vicissitudes;
For you the Pleiades are seven, and one

For you the snake is burnished in the

The flower has plots touching its mar

The queen-bee from her wassailed lords

And high and high Into the nuptial bine,
Till only one heroic lover now
Flies with her, and her royal wish Is

To the elected one. whose dizzy heart
Presaseth him of ecstasy and death.
For you the sea has rivers in the midst.
And fathomless abysses where it breeds
Fantastic life; and each* its tiniest drop
Flung from the fisher's oar-blade in the

Has rivers, abysses and fantastic life.
For your sakes it was spoken of the soul
That It shall be a sea whereon the moon
Has might, and the four winds shall
walk upon it â
Also it has great rivers in the midst.
Uncharted islands that no sailor sees.
And fathomless abysses where it breeds
Mysterious life; yea, each its tiniest <Jrop

A Heroic Governor.
Sir William McGregor, who has just
been appointed Governor of New
foundland, is one of the most remark
able men of the British colonial ser
vice, both physically and intellectually,
and. Indeed, his herculean strength
has contributed in no small degree to
impress the savages, over whom he
has been called to rule in the past,

I On his mother's side he was descend

majestic Oriental figure." Zangwill de
scribes him, "with eyes that brood and
glowâ you would say one of the Assy
rian Kings, whose sculptured heads
adorn our museums, the very profile of
Tiglath-Pileser." Can one wonder at
the mistake of the wild Arabs in the
villages ' of the Holy Land, who ; ran
after him shouting, "There . goes the

The death of Dr. Theodor Herzl. the
great leader of the Zionist movement,
has. naturally called forth many stories
concerning him. It is related that as a
boy of 10 years he attended the Real
schule In Budapest, where on one oc
casion one of the teachers explained the
meaning of the word "heathen" to the
class by saying, "To that class belong
the idolators, Mohammedans and
Jews." The boy Herzl was a rich
man's son and was never troubled per
sonally, but he had a vague idea that
he was a Jew, and this glib definition
seems to have been too bitter a pill for
the future Zionist leader to swallow. He
left the Realschule for the Gymnasium.

Some comment of an adverse disposition has been
made at the discovery that one man in the service of
the municipality is holding two positions of responsibil
ity and is drawing as a reward two very excellent sal
aries. No reason has been advanced, however, to show
that the fortunate possessor of official favor is neglect
ing the duties of either of his positions. An ordinary
observer in the City Hall may judge without difficulty
that under our system of political patronage one man
may fill half a dozen jobs and do justice to them all.

ON August 4 or 5 there will convene in our city
for the purpose of concluding its investigations
the Merchant Marine Commission appointed at
the iast Congressional session for the purpose of mak
ing a rigid investigation into the present status and
pressing needs of the American merchant marine. Upon
the report submitted by this commission depends in
great measure the future policy of Congress in reference
to the upbuilding of this sadly deficient factor of our
national commercial life. Upon the report of the com
mission hang also vital interests of San Francisco.
Ours is the last shipping, center of the United States
to come under the investigations of the Congressional
commission. Having, determined upon the conditions
of the merchant marine along the Atlantic seaboard and
in the gulf ports, the specially empowered delegation of
Congressmen is coming to study the great field of Pacific
commerce and the part American ships- play therein.
Possibilities as well as actualities will be the .subject of
their investigation. In no other port than that of San Fran
cisco could the commission come to a better realization
of how tremendous are the opportunities for a strong
merchant marine and how inadequate is the present one
for grasping the prize offered.
The Far East looms largest as the corning center of
commercial . activity, of trade rivalry. With the end
of the present war, whichever contestant is victorious,
there will be opened to the marts of the world new
fields of activity in Manchuria and Korea. China itself
must feel a sympathetic thrill of energy from the "tre
mendous struggle now being enacted on its own soil,
and the opening of a greater scope of trade there is in
evitable. Along with England, : Germany, France â the
great carrying nations of the world â America will com
pete for this rich trade plnm â compete with vessels sail
ing from, the port of San Francisco. If. these carriers
fly the flag of England, Germany or France, and if from
each increment ofsgain there be paid heavy toll to for
eign ship owners, how far can American trade interests
run in the race for new markets? .

Several of the counties of California have decided to

rent and Sir Charles Eliot has sought
to develop it by attracting individual
tettlers. But the Foreign Office, while
making virtually free gifts of "land to
Â¦wealthy syndicates, imposed, it is said,
*uch onerous terms on those who
fought the country to, till and plant,
establish farms and raise cattle that
ate, accompanied by a bold challenge
to the Prime Minister to institute a
public inquiry into the circumstances
"vhich caused him to take rhis step,
Sir Charles Eliot has justified the judg
ment long ago pronounced by his
friends that he Is no ordinary man.
With what promised to be an excep
tionally brilliant career before him he
has sacrificed it. eo far as this Govern
ment is concerned, that he might make
a fight for a principle which vltally
â¢conceros the future prosperity of a sec
'ticn of the British empire embracing
three-quarters of a million square
miles. By throwing up his position he
ihas slipped off the muzzle v?b!ch bound
â¢him to silence and submission. In no
'other way. according to British usages
land traditions, could he obtain a hear
ting before the court of public opinion.
"Lord Lansdowne," he says in his
meFsage, "ordered me to refuse grants
rof land to certain private persons
â¢while giving a monopoly, on unduly
.edvanta^eous terms, to the Cast Afri
can Syndicate. I have refused to ex
ecute these instructions which I con
â¢tlder unjust and Impolitic."
The Foreign Secretary is thus direct
ly accused of using his high office to
further a big land grabbing job. Thus
( far he has made no response to the
charge, taking refuge in that dignified
Â¦eilence which in English Government
â¢circles is supposed to indicate conscious
rectitude and Integrity. But when Sir
Charles Eliot arrives home with his
muzzle off he will put the Government
on the defensive and force an expla-,
ration of some sort. The East African
Syndicate Is a speculative an* mining
company merely with no Interests in
the protectorate apart from that of
capitalists bent on obtaining the big
pest possible dividends. For a merely
nominal rental it has been granted a
ninety-nine years' lease of 320 square
miles of the choicest land, and, accord
ins to Cathcart Wason, a member of
Parliament, who recently Investigated
the conditions on the spot, within this
aroa it has received such unlimited

suggestive as to the nature of the in

â¢â¢ISN'T THAT ONE OF THE
FINEST SCENES FOR A 'BLACK ,
AND WHITE?' "
According to the Census Bureau re
ports the. average age of the popula
tion of the United States is 26 years,
with a life expectancy of 10 years more.
The great majority of people who
are born In this country do not pass
many years beyond the age of discre
tion before death overtakes them,
while only a few, comparatively, reach
the middle' stage of life. There is an
excess of 1,815,097 females among the
Inhabitants now living. So we see that
the chief elements in! our population
are youth and femininity.
These facts are worthy of note as a
probable cause of some of the country's
social phenomena, which so frequently
excite amusement, irritation or criti
ciem. Women and the young of both
sexes are looked upon as more emo
tional than men. This country during
recent years has lost much of the
calm, deliberate character which it
possessed at an earlier period of our
national existence. We are now quite
prone to fanaticism and much given
to pressing the trigger on the slightest
provocation. As a nation we take to
tads and novelties of all kinds with
feminine and almost childish impul
siveness. We go into spasms over
trivialities which would not elicit even
a grunt from an Indian nor awaken the
slightest interest in a Dutchman. Our
passions and affections are easily
aroused and equally as easily allayed.
We change from love to hatred, from
admiration to scorn, and back again,
as facilely as a piston rod goes in and
out of a cylinder. We are never con
tented or at equipoise, but are continu
ally on the go, fHpflopping wherever
fancy leads. \
These peculiarities are not more no
ticeable anywhere than in the arts
which politicians and business men fre
quently employ to attract our support
and trade. Whether they resort to
these devices on their own motion or
are led thereto by the demands of their
customers is simply the question over
again as to which existed first, the
egg or the hen. But however it be,
they make use of arts and tricks which
we cannot imagine ever to have been
put into practice to catch the votes or
trade of such men, for instance, as
George Washington, Benjamin Frank

fathers of this glorious country- It Is

American Flight in ess.
NO act of President Roosevelt has caused more 'at
tempts to prejudice labor against him than his ac
tion in the Miller case. Miller was a foreman
bookbinder in the Government' Printing Office and was
in the civil service. Finding that in bookbinding the
Government was paying 40 cents for what cost 8 cents
in private shops, the work in each case being done by
union bookbinders, he insisted that the Government
should have as good service as a private employer from
craftsmen of the same union. For this he was expelled
from the union, which thereupon ordered Mr. Palmer,
Superintendent of the Public Printing Office, to dis
charge him, and that was done. Miller took his case
to the Civil Service Commission, which reported it to
the President, who, in plain obedience-to the law, ordered
Miller reinstated, and that was done.
The merest tyro in the law knew that the President
had simply done his duty. In the public service the Gov
ernment alone is the employer and the Government
alone can discharge from its employment. If that power
were delegated to a private organization that is not even
incorporated, it amounts to the acknowledgment by the
Government of a sovereignty superior to itself. Yet
this action of the President, who would have violated
his oath had he done otherwise, was seized upon by the
Democracy as an opportunity to attack and abuse him
and make capital against him. No" sensible labor union
man ever believed that the President had done oVhcr
than right in the premises. But the element that was
backing the fantastic candidacy of Mr. Hearst was urged
by him to push the Miller case for all the votes that
were in it. Now all of these Democratic chickens arc
coming home to roost, and the roost is getting crowded.
City employes in Chicago belonging to a union de
manded discrimination in their favor for that reason.
Carter Harrison, Mayor of Chicago, is of such impor
tance in the party that he was urged as the Democratic
candidate for the Presidency. He is the foremost offi
cial and most powerful Democratic factor in the Middle
West. He is a far better known man in the party than
its nominee, Judge Parker. He has represented its aspi
rations and by authority declared its position and pur
poses on many public occasions, and it has elected him
three times Mayor of Chicago. When he is dealing with
a public issue arising in the municipal government of
which he is the head, it is the act of his party, at least, in
that jurisdiction, as much as what President Roosevelt
does is the act of his party in the Union, of which he is
the head.
When the union employes of Chicago demanded sub
stantially what the Bookbinders' Union demanded of
President Roosevelt, Mayor Harrison, mindful also of
his oath to execute the Jaw, refused the demand, and in
his decision said: "Where a man belongs to a depart
ment, such as firemen and policemen, he has no right to
have a divided allegiance. 'He must owe allegiance to
only one master, the city of Chicago."
The Democratic enemies of President Roosevelt may
now turn their clubs on Mayor Harrison, and union
laborers â¢ sensitive to the requirements of good citizen
ship may see how sincere and how right the President
was when he told them: "All men must obey the law.
No man is above the law and no man is below it." That
is a simple guide to public and private conduct. â¢, It does
not juggle with words, but expresses in its most compact
form the duty alike of the citizen and of the officer cho
sen and sworn to enforce the law.
We make a point of this because it is a notable and
impressive instance in which a leading Democrat has
confessed for the party that the President was right in
a matter that has been foremost among the personal
issues raised against him. The other issues of that
kind will share the same fate before the campaign is
over.

only way by which the vessel, which

JUDGE PRITCHARD of North Carolina has just
decided, and properly, that a judge on the bench,
like any other public officer, ifl properly subject to
criticism by the press, and that such criticism is not to
be construed into contempt of court.
Contempt of court, as soundly construed, consists in
acts of disorder in the presence of the court, or in the
violation of the court's order or decree. The attempt to
go farther and construe criticism of a judge by a newspa
per into contempt of his court has made no headway in
this country, and will not. Judicial officers must de
pend for the preservation of their reputations upon the
same public opinion that dominates the good name of all
men and all public officers. There are reckless and licen
tious newspapers which use the power of publicity vi
ciously and corruptly. No matter how bad their character
nor how low their motives, some will believe their slan
ders and translate their libels into a public service. But
euch believers are not themselves qualified to make pub4
lie opinion and are not its leaders. So, after all, the
licentious" press, like all things licentious, disarms itself
by being outlawed from the sympathies of the only part
of the community that has character, and therefore in
fluence.
Closely allied to this matter of the relations of the
bench and the press, however, is a form of discussion
that was carried into politics in 1896, and is kept theje
by the Democratic platform of this year. It is a propo
sition to disarm American courts by taking away from
them the power to protect property by injunction. Of
course all thinking men see that this policy falls upon
the owners of property and not upon the courts. Yet
the public has been partially wrought op to tolerate the
proposition by the newspaper discussion of the courts
for exercising one of their plainest judicial powers.
If all men could think back and recreate the conditions
which existed before courts had been given the power,
and great judges had devised the form of writ to protect
the rights of person and property, the influence of much
of the newspaper discussion of the subject would be
limited. So sacred were the rights of property finally
considered, as the common law developed, that we owe
to the esteem in which they were held the beginning of
that system of equity which now protects property
rights even in the face of legal conclusions. Since the
long contest between law and equity in England, led on
one side by Coke and on the other by Ellesmere, from
which Coke retired defeated, the courts have used the
injunction to give relief to property rights in cases where
no legal remedy existed oAwhere it is inadequate.
Though the writ is junior to that of habeas corpus, it
has equal dignity. The habeas corpus is the efficient
and sole defense of personal rights in their need and ex
tremity, and the injunction performs the same office for
property rights. But when an injunction issues the
court enforces it through its power to punish for con
tempt. It has no other instrumentality, no other wea
pon. The Federal court, by permanent injunction, pro
tected the property rights of people on the Feather,
Yuba andÂ»Sacramento rivers against injurious hydraulic
mining. If the court cannot punish violators for con
tempt of court, that permanent injunction is a vain thing
and the valley ranchers have no protection at all. â¢ If a
man guilty of contempt of court for violating.an injunc
tion issued to protect property is to be taken out of the
hands of the court and tried for contempt by a jury, it
is the end of our system of equity jurisprudence. It will
mean that when the law furnishes no adequate remedy,
no adequate protection, there is no protection at all, for
the courts are disarmed and equity is destroyed. I
This is a subject that the press can afford to discuss
without heat or prejudice. That the proposition is tol
erated at all is evidence of the spread of the Socialistic
idea that property is robbery, and therefore is not enti
tled to protection. It is the beginning of the battle be
tween Socialism and the law. In the result is involved
the fate of all property rights, and therefore of property
itself. It is disquieting that one of the leading political
parties should go deliberately on record in what it calls
its conservative, its sane and safe form, in favor of such
a monstrous proposition. It is the most radical and the
most dangerous attack on property, because its object
is veiled by making it an attack on the courts.
many of them returned home rather
than submit to them.
"The objection held In the protector
ate to syndicates as private individuals
is," says Major Powell-Cotton, the
East African traveler, "that while the
former hold huge areas. with no.imme
diate Intention of stocking or cultivat
ing the land, the same area, if divided
among Individual settlers, could at a
much earlier period be developed. Con
sidering the enormous sums which the
British taxpayer has provided for the
Uganda Railway, it is not surprising
that Sir Charles Eliot and his officials
advocated a policy which would place
the country on a paying basis at a very
much earlier period'than would be pos
sible if great areas of the pick of the
country are to be tied up for indefinite
periods."
To an outsider it looks as if -Sir
Charles Eliot were going to disclose a
political scandal that will cause some
upheavals in Downing street. He is a
man of rare force of character and the
last person in the world to submit to
being browbeaten. Despite the fact
that he Is barely 40, he has a fine rec
ord of diplomatic service to his credit.
Scholar of Baliol and Fellow of Trin
ity, his university career was as bril
liant as his promotion in the Foreign
Office was rapid. Academically he cap
tured no less than five scholarships;
diplomatically he wtnt to St. Peters
burg as third secretary, and then to
Constantinople, became Charge d'Af
faires in Morocco, Bulgaria and Ser
via, went to "Washington as first sec
retary and was subsequently HJgh
Commissioner at Samoa. Then as' K.
C. M. G. he was made four years ago
British agent at Zanzibar and Com
missioner and Consul General in Brit
ish Africa, as well as Consul General
for Germany's ' dominions there. In
January, 1902, he was made East Afri
can Commander in Chief and, having
resigned that post, is now on his way
home to fight it out with Lord Lans
downe. Whatever steps the Govern
ment may take, a man of his type can
not be put down and kept down. He is
bound to be heard of again doing good
work for the empire.
DISARMING THE COURTS.
the commission what stakes are offered a strong mer
chant marine in other oceans. The west coast of South
America is ours exclusively until the Panama canal
brings other contestants from the Atlantic coast. Yet
of the total value of imports into South American coun
tries for the last year, amounting to $300,000,000, \ the
share of the United States' Atlantic and Pacific trade
combined was but $30,000,000. Little better is the show
ing made by the record of' trade with the islands of the
sea and the antipodean countries; yet all of these op
portunities are in the rightful province of American
commerce.
When the erchant Marine Commission comes to San
Francisco, then, let it ,be the duty of our business men,
our commercial boards and shipping associations to lay
before the eyes of the Congressmen a truthful scheme
of the possibilities that arc open to American commerce
through the avenue of this port. Then let them take the
commission out on the bay and show them the foreign
flags that fjy from the halyards of nearly every mer
chantman in its tide.- The lesson will be convincing.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL'. FRIDAY, JULY 29, 1004.
...In connection with the litigation
against the Pacific States Mercantile
Company, an alleged get-rich-quick
scheme, several moyes were made yes
terday in the Superior Court. The com
pany appealed from the order appoint
ing Thomas Quinn as receiver and
qualified on a $5000 bond to carry the
matter to the Supreme Court. Receiver
Quinn made good on a $3000 bond and
the plaintiff, H. F. Hobson, qualified
for a $1000 bond on the appeal.
Hobson, who represents Chinese
holding 374 contracts, filed an amended
complaint in his suit against the com
pany, in which he is more srecific in
his charges of fraud, and he names the
persons connected with the concern as
follows: Sam Epstein, Carl May, Os
car Lipman Henry A. Callender and
Arthur W. Copps. '
The amount Hobson seeks to recover
on contracts bought by Chinamen is
$4514. He alleges that two concerns
have been incorporated to take over
the assets of the Pacific States Mercan
tile Company, the Republic Savings
and Investment Company and the Re
public Securities Company.
Plaintiff Hobson in Amend
ed Complaint Specifies Men
That He Accuses of Fraud

It is frequently the case that a party wishes
to sell his holdings for the purpose of reinvest-
ing the proceeds in a different kind of property.
Our long experience in this business enables
us to often accomplish this double . purpose or
only one transaction. ' The only condition we
make is that your property, if you wish us to
dispose of it for you. MUST BE GOOD OF ITS
KIND AND IN A GOOD LOCATION. Don't
take up either our time or your own with
worthless offerings, or property so heavily
mortgaged as to leave no actual equity.
If It has merit, whether you own real estate
or a mercantile or manufacturing business,
bring a description of tame to our office, stat-
ing what kind of property you prefer in ex-
change, and you will be surprised how quickly
we can effect the result.
THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE UNDER-
STAND THE EXCHANGE BUSINESS and ara
the only company In San Francisco making a
specialty of same. We make no charge for ad-
vertising or any other purpose unless we pro-
cure an exchange satisfactory to you to ac-

CHICAGO. July 2S.â At the outset the mar
ket exi>erienced a setback because of lower
cables, liberal receipts and continued bad
weather reports from the Northwest Sep
tember opened 4S%c lower at %Â«Â§-S9iie: a
lot of long wheat came out during the first
few minutes of trade and prices declined still
further. September selling off to SSifc'gSSSfce
On the break there was good liquidation by
commission houses, resulting In an advance of
about 4c. The demand was Influenced to some
extent by the bullish foreign opening and by
many complaints of rust from the American
spring wheat country. Another reaction oc
curred on heax-y sellingof July, resulting from
the announcement of estimated liberal receipts
for to-morrow. Speculative trading also j was
affected by the weakness In the cash' market
here, all grades of cash wheat except contract
rraln. which can be delivered in July being
down 3@4c. Later In the day the market
for distant deliveries became firmer on a re
port of the condition of German crops showing
considerable deterioration as a result of severe
drought. Much of the earlier loss was re
gained. September closing at 89 4c.
Favorable crop reports and weakness of
wheat were the main influences affecting the
corn market, September closing unchanged
at 49%c.
Fine weather reoorta and good crop pros
pects and weakness of wheat caused con
siderable liquidation in oats. September opened
at 3.{4Â«?33Uc and closed at 333334c
Covering by shorts imparted a firm tone to
the provision market, but trading was light
at the close. Pork was up 74<S10c. LÂ«rd
showed a gain of 7 4c and ribs were up 5c.

Chicago was bearish on lower cables and
higher consols. ' The private wires of Mitchell,
Mulcahy & Co. from there said: "Higher
consols, lower Li%-erpool cables and larger pri
mary receipts were the causes of the decline.
Market opened sharply down, but after that
showed a good deal of *tea<ilness for the de
ferred futures. July Wheat, however, con
tinued to decline under scattered liquidation.
Cash markets all around were generally easier.
With the exception of scattered complaints
of rust In South Dakota, spring Wheat re
ports are generally satisfactory. The situa
tion is *!ill nervous and unsettled. So much
of the re'eent buying has been due to the po
litical situation and eo much of the recent
demand for cash Wheat has been to fill July
shorts, that both the speculative conditions
Hirf the cash situation are uncertain and some
what obscured While we are doubtful of cash
Wheat reaching thV September price very soon
after the July option Is out of the way. yet
we are inclined to think cash prices may at
that time take a slump. An export demand
is out of the question, but millers' bins are
probably empty and at least a fair milling de
mand Is likely. For the moment, however,
without the advent of further polttlcal Influ
ences, we rather think prices are hjgh enough
and that some Â¦ further reaction may .take
place The best local sellers of yesterday were
evidently replacing Wheat at to-day's decline."
In this market cash grain was firm but
futures were lower In sympathy with Chicago.
Kansas City reported that the California mill.
er8 were buying in Kansas.
CASH WHEAT.
WHEATâ Both Paris and Liverpool futures
were lower. The German crop was officially
stated at' 60 per cent, against 76 per cent. at
this time last year. The shortage In the Euro
pean crop this year Is variously estimated at
from 125.000.000 to 150.00O.CO0 bushels, and the
import requirement of Europe are expected
to be larger than JHst year. Argentine. Rus
sian and Danublan shipments are expected to
decrease from now on and the demand will
naturally fall upon this country, where prices
will be made.

.In spite of the continued heavy receipts of
Butter the market holds steady and dealers
succeed in taking care of the large daily ar

cargoes now afloat which should arrive here
prior to September 1. There are thirty- five
vessels in' all. afloat and to load at New

carrying capacity of about 92.000 tons; a num
ber of these vessels will not deliver their car
goes here for several months yet. '" Freight
rates from the colonies are quoted firm at full
figures, hence no low-priced Australian Coal
can be looked for this yr^r. This port will
not be a very seductive Ugh for Coal carriers
to seek In view of the dismal outlook for grain
carriers outward, as we have a surplus of for
eign vessels now here, and we will have a very
meager quantity of grain for export. The
major portion of the engaged tonnage has
already passed out of first hands and- Is now
for sale by our local wholesale dealers. Busi
ness in the fuel line is very quiet, as fuel oil
controls fully 75 per cent of thÂ» steam demand
and sales for domestic uses at this season of
the year C?e never brisk; there is no change
of quotations, the prices remain steady. A
coalition has been formed this month between
the Western Fuel Company and R. Dunsmulr's
Sons Company which gives absolute control

NEW TORK. July 23.â To-day's stock mar
ket turned to a large extent on the Anglo-
Russian relations, and was a striking demon
stration of how large an influence the same
condition had en yesterday's market. - Not
only s:curiiiea. but all ether speculative mar
kets were Influenced. Grain markets were re
laxed, in Â«cue of some rumors of unfavorable
developments in the spring wheat region. Ster
ling exchange reacted decisively from the gold
export point. Stocks in New York regained
rather more than those lost yesterday. London
bought back from here fully as much as was
sold yesterday, and buying was the main
factor in holding the early advance, on which
there was free realizing and a consequent halt
in the UDward tendency. But buying of all
the prominent stocks was aggrtsslvely renewed
as the day advanced, and the bears were
routed and driven to cover. United 8tates
Steel preftrred was not among the strongest
stocks to-day, although it was one of the
acutest offered. It was strong, however, and
wasi helped by reports of an improving demand
for pig Iron. The completion of a stock market
settlement in London was a helpful .factor to
the market. In addition to the reactfd tension
in International return*, as an easier money
market is now looked for. The Bank of Eng- |
land loan* expansion of almost $20,000,000 for |
the week I* an ind-:x of the pressure upon the i
money raarkei there. That Institution is also
training sold rapidly now. and In fact re
frained from advancing the rates to-day, which
I is acceded as an assurance of better condi
tions!. The announcement that a $1,000,000 pay
ment would be made hext week on the Cuban
loan, with a probable demand for at least half
the amount In cold remittance . to Havana,
seemed to be accepted with equanimity, which
was furthered by the assurances from the
bankers concerned that care would be taken
not to disturb the momy market In arranging
f^r the further remittance. The assassination
of the Russian Minister of the Interior was
not a r*ree:nihle factor in the market. The
upward lmiiu!** for the market was renewed
in the late trading In the expectation . that |
the London market to-morrow would take
stock at higher level. The trading became
dull at the last. t>ut the closing was fitva and
only slightly below the bÂ»st. Consols were firm.
Bonds were firm. Total sales, par values,
$2,145,000.
L'pited States ly-nds were unchanged on call.

Condition of the Treasury.
Tfce weather during tfce week has been un
ttsual'.y warm . ac4 dry, which was favorable
Jor barren work, but It caused the grain to
t. '.".Â£_-.* ripen a little too fast. Fail wheat
Teet of the Cascades has mostly beea cut and
Â«rhocked r.r.l east of the Cascade Its harvest
Is progrpÂ«Â«lrx rapidly. But little threshing
*~jlh vet beea done In the WlUanieite Valley.
In thÂ« Columbia River Valley and in Southern
Oregroa the yields are generally reported to be
tetter than expected. Early sown spring
vheat and oets were greatly Improved by the
ii.. r.- cf latt week end they promise frora fair
to rood returns. Late iwn spring wheat and
oats are thin, beading short and generally so
j<oor that they are beir.g cut for bay.
Feed ca the ranges continues better than
usual, but In the Willamette Valley pasturage
5 s gettlcg chart and stock la beginning to lose
flesh. Where properly cultivated, hops, gar
dens, corn, potatoes and field onions are doing
Â¦m-sll. but' thty all. as well as p&fturage.
m-ould be greatly benefited by more rmtn. Seme
â¢praying ha* been done In the hop yards, but
the net weather killed moet of the lice, and.
as a rule, the yards are remarkably free from

an alarming extent, and an average or better
than an average crcp of apples is expected.

Salted Hides are %c higher, chiefly owing to
the Western packing-house strike, which, by
keeping back shipments of Cattle. Is causing
a corresponding decrease In the supply of
Hides. This Is not yet marked, but Is In
creasing and the trade look for a pronounced
falling off In the Hide supply before long. If
their expectations prove correct prices will go

There was nothing new In the local market,
which continued dull. Brokers' reports from
Chicago said: "There was a little increase in
activity. There Is no changÂ« on the part of
strikers, but the packers are Increasing their
force and the receipts of Hogs are a little
more liberal. The feeling seems to be that the
strike will not succeed and that the packers
will be able to gradually restore things to
their normal condition. This is increasing tho
trading interest at the moment"

we will be delayed. This work is too import
ant to be cast aside. Work among baths,
bakerien and laundries has been suspended
by reason cf the lack of funds.
Dairy inspection has also been impaired by
the lack of the necessary appropriation. This
work, however, will not be allowed to suffer,

ance circles as a man of wonderful en-,
ergy that was materially responsible
for his business success. It is said that
his destination was Minneapolis. ]
The missing man is an Englishman,
xvho came to this country from Aus
tralia, and was widely known in insur-
Monday, however, it was discovered
that Sennion had departed for the
East and then Morris made a thorough
investigation of the accounts, which
revealed the fact that Bennion.
through the manipulation of notes, had
defrauded the company out of various
fums of money. It was also learned
about that time that he had disposed }
of the furniture in the flat occupied by
himself and beautiful young wife on
Lapruna street and the supposition is
that Mrs. Bennion has since followed
her husband tÂ»> the East.
His shortage exceeds $1000, but
against this amount there stands on
the company's books in favor of the
missing manager a bonus credit that
nearly covers the loss of the agency. . j
Bennion had been employed by the
insurance company for about a year,
having secured his position through j
the recommendation of the head of a. j
rival company, v-ith which he had been j
previously engaged. ]n addition to a
salary of $275, Bennion enjoyed a
monthly Income of about $400 from
commissions from insurance worked up
by himself. Â£ .
He was a man of extravagant habits,
gambled at poker and horse racing and
it was not long before he was Impor
tuning the clerks of the Insurance
company's office for loans, which he
was, extremely Blow In paying. It soon
became apparent that Bennion was
Â¦worried over financial matters and his
associates in the of!:ce were beginning
to comment on his seeming distress,
when he unexpectedly advised Man
ager Tupper of the company that he
had been offered a more lucrative posi
tion with an Eastern concern and had
accepted it.
Last week, following the practice of
the company. Inspector Morris pro
ceeded to look over the accounts of the
Geary-street office and discovered sev
eral discrepancies, which he called to
the attention of Bennion. The latter
replied that they could be explained
and adjusted easily, and promised to
meet Morris on Monday and go over
the bcoks.
Frederick Bennion, until recently
manager of the Geary-street branch of
the Conservative Life Insurance Com
pany, and recognized as one of the
cleverest "hustlers" in that particular
line of business on this coast, is now a
fugitive from Justice. Yesterday a
warrant for arrest, charging him with
the embezzlement of the funds of the
company, was issued at the instigation
of F. B. Morris, inspector of accounts
of the Conservative Life Insurance
Company but it is not expected that
Bennion will be apprehended, for he is
supposed to be far bey~nd .he limits of
the State.
Mrs. Davies alleged that two children
were the issue of the union, and that
since their marriage Davies had accum
ulated $400,000 worth of property and
had an income of $50,000 a year. She
made no specific demands for a share,
but asked the court for a proper award.
Davies made no reply, except to contest
the jurisdiction of the local court on
the ground that he was a citizen of
New South Wales. 0
Judge Floss yesterday granted a di
vorce to Alexander J. MacDonald from
Josephine MacDonald on the ground of
cruelty. The case has been pending
'or some time and is out of the ordinary
in the matter of allegations. The court
tried the cape and took it under sub
mission on briefs on May 12 last.
Suits for divorce were filed by Ed
na W. Plowden against William D.
Plo-svder., habitual intempernr.ee; Maud
Keating against Alfred E. Keating,
cruelty; Kate S. Fox against Henry D.
Fox, desertion, and Lucy Fischer
against John Fischer Jr., cruelty.
Divorces were granted by Judge Ker
rigan to Orlando Macy from Sarah A.
Macy, Existence of former marriage;
to Minerva C. Karry from William C.
Karry, neglect; by Judge Hunt to
Josephine Schneider from Emile
Schneider, crur'ty.
Judge Kerrigan yesterday annulled
the marriage of Hattie Voeller and
William F. Hummeltenberg. It was
shown that the man with the unpro
nounceable name wedded in Honolulu
in October, 1901. Then the bride found
out that her husband had another wife
in New York, having married Grace
Cummings in 1891. Mary Elizabeth
Cummings, mother of the first wife,
corroborated the testimony. The Judge
asked the woman why she had not
prosecuted Hummeltenberg for bigamy.
She said she did not want him sent to
jail.
Judge Kerrigan thought that the case
was one for the criminal court. He
sent a letter to the Grand Jury regard
ing the case. Hummeltenberg's prose
cution for bigamy .will probably follow.
He is said to be in the city.
A dismissal was filed in the Superior
Court yesterday of the suit commenced
on. June 24, 1903, by Elizabeth Montague
Davies against Lewis James Davies, a
wealthy resident of Sydney, New South
Wales. The indication is that the
breach in the domestic relations has
been healed. When Mrs. Davies com
menced her suit she alleged that she
married Davies at Santa Clara on Jan
uary 15, 1895. Some time after that he
was said to have begun scolding,
threatening and abusing. For a portion
of four years they lived in Sydney, and
a friend, one Euphemla Stewart, was
their guest. Euphemia is said to have
become very familiar with Davies. Mrs.
Davies reproached her husband, where
upon he became angry. On November
17. 1902, she left him.

We tound that we could manufacture, at as low a cost as other makers; JSS^^^^Mf^
and when we offered the clothes in our retail store we could sell them at the 'ffmSSS^^Sm
same price that dealers must pay to manufacturers. We knew it would only I^^^^^^M
be a question of time when the pubiic would find out these facts. lifM . ' $$&
