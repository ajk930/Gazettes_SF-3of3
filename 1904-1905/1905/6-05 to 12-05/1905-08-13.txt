your presence, Bunny) docs not bore
the whole world with them without, ul

arc this chap's motives? Does he want
to- advertise himself? No.he's" some
body already. But is he rich? 011 the
coutrary. he's as poor as a rat for his
position and apparently without the
least ambition to be anything else.
Certainly he won't enrich himself by

camp-bCdstead that would not have un
settled an anchorite; there was, no place

nodding and shrugging toward a pair
of very large Indian clubs that stood In
the fender, oh cither side of the chimney
un which I .,. had nreÂ«.umcd to glance.
Ih> an- Jn3tant ; Raffles, had seizÂ«d the
clubi and was, whirling them about his
erav head in a. mixture of .childish pique
and pVrile bravado which I should have
thought "him altogether above. And sud
denly a* I watched him his face changed,
softened, lit up, and he pwung the clubs
gently down upon the bed.'
"They're not .heavy enough for their
size." -said he rapidly: "and .'l'll take my
oath they're not the same weight!"
He shook one club' after the other, with
both- hands, close to his ears; then he ex
amined* their' butt-ends under the electric
light.*-;"! saw [what, he susptcted now. and
caught' the contafifton of his suppressed
excitement. of us spoke; But
Raffles had taken : out> the portable tool
box -that he 'called a knife, and always
carried, and 'as he opened the ptmlet he
handed me the club he held.. Instinctively
I tiipked the snriill ctyJ under my arm and"
presented tho other to Raffles. - : Â£.
"Hold on tiÃht." he wh!apÂ«red. smillnsr.

We were discussing the robberies for

Impediment, the risk of recognition was
another. But there were exceptions,
wlnn the doctor was away or the pa

we frequented a certain unpretentious
restaurant in the Fulham quarter, where
the cooking was plain but excellent and
the cellar a surprise. Our bottle of 'Â£3
champagne was empty to the label when
the subject arose, to be touched by
Raffles in the reminiscent manner in
dicated above. I can see his clear eye
upon me now, reading me, weighing me.
Hut I was not so sensitive to his scrutiny
at the time. His. tone was deliberate, cal

then, though a head full of wine, but as
it floats back to me across the gulf be

pitch of excitement than ever. Yet I had
no more 'conception of the game that

and I eduld swear he touched me; then
his- boots creaked, there was a raftlÂ« In

light. - ' :.
Lord Ernest Belville crouched in Its

end, like a footman with a stolen bottle.

"Lord Ernest Belville," said Raffles,
"It's no use. This is a loaded revolver.

Lord Ernest lifted the club an inch

after it his stalwart frame as the club
crashed back into the fender. And ;he
stood at his full height, a courteous

mustache; he looked what he was.

1 DON'T blame you much, Dorothy, for
your great dislike of mathematics. .
I have never particularly enjoyed
studying them for my own part, and
I have always looked with respectful
wonder and almost awe on other people
who have professed to -find them de
lightful.
Yet. my dear, the girl next you in the
class may approach this subject In- a-,
quite different mood from yours. She
may fully enjoy the abstract and con
crete principles of the science of num
bers: may fairly revel In difficult- propo
sitions, and may regard the hour for al
gebra, trigonometry or whatever else it
may be as the most exhilarating hour of
the day. Not infrequently two sisters
may he entirely in contrast when the
question concerns this abstruse and, on
the whole, formidable study; one may
love it as much as the other loathes It.
You need not expect to receive much
help from the people at home when you
are puzzling over diagrams, examples
ami problems in mathematics. Most of
us, after our school days, remember
enough of -what we learned there to en
able us to foot up household accounts,
and to ste that we do not overrun our
weekly or monthly Income. But we do
not retain much more.
If we arc thoughtless persons, we are
apt to regret that we were compelled to
spend a lot of tlJaeover thiugs we did
not like when there were so many other
things that would .have given us a great
deal of i) leas u re.
But. Dorothy, step a moment before
you condemn your teachers for insisting
on making mathematics the test of your
scholarship. In tho first place, it is good
for most of us to do what we don't very
much want to do. We are better for be
ing compelled to exercise some self-de
nial. You and I arc bound to meet ob
stacles of one son. or another all along
the road of life. If we are cowards, we
shall shiver and shake and turn away
pnd look for some little bypath by which
we may avoid the issue. If, on the con
trary, we are brave, we shall go "boldly
up to the thing in our path, and se^
whether it cannot be i>ut aside. In order
to get along credltab/y in this world
every one of us must have a good supply
of moral courage and real force of char
acter. These tasks of the schoolroom
are chiefly valuable because in them there
is hidden the element which turns the
raw recruit into a soldier, the element
called drill. You get an enormous
amount of drill for your mind when you
study mathematics. You may not find
jt agreeable, but that does not matter.
The fruit will be reaped later on.
You need not laugh at me. Dorothy,
when I tell you that a girl who- has been
thoroughly trained and disciplined by
struggles with mathematics, that for her
mean conquest, will "bear herself much
more finely than one who has spent her
time dawdling over lessons that never
taxed her powers. For instance, it is a
shame for a woman to scream when she
seeb.a poor little mouse scuttling as fasf
as it can out. of the closet, or to. go into
fits when a bat or a' spider or some-other,
uncanny creature crossts her field of
vision. â¢ Women who do this are women
who have never had any practical drill
in self-control.
I once met a lady approaching mfadle
ago, who boasted that she had never re
strained an emotion in her life. "If any
thing goes wrong I Just go to pieces,"
she said, "and everybody has to fly
around and wait on me." She. seemed to
think this a meritorious thing. In reality
it was disgraceful: The one duty be
yond all others for you and me, Dorothy,
is to be equal to the occasion whenever
it comes, and. to rule- our own spirit. How
are we ever going . to. rule anybody else
if we do not rule ourselves? \u25a0$
- Having said this, let me add .that I
look upon mathematics very much < as
the builder looks on the foundation of
the house. If you are planning to build
a beautiful, mansion, with- many rooms
and corridors, with a tower, on the top
and* windows. open wide to the sunshine,
you must first, of all dig deeply Into the
earth and see that ' your underpinning
will be safe and your foundation stable.
The whole- of education is built on the
alphabet, the multiplication table. arid the
ten commandments. On these you may
rear whatever beautiful editke you please.
It would btv a. very one-sided develop
ment that a girl would haVe^who knew
nothing except mathematics. Once in
awhile this has been shown in s the case
of some nVT-thtmatlcal prodigy who has
performed astonishing feats with figures
and, has done nothing else. At one end
of the scale place mathematics for bal
last: at the other give play to imagina
tion and "then you will have a perfectly
balanced character. Do not make the
mistake of thinking that there is no vir
tue outside the ledger. Every child who
solves. a difficult problem should be told
a fairy story Immediately afterward as a
reward. Whatever else you omit, be ssu e
you cultivate your mind in the region of
poetry and fancy.
A traveler was wending his way over
the mountains of Kentucky, when he
came at nightfall to a cabin in a lonely
p.iss. He asked if he might find shelter
for the night, and the hospitality of the
mountains was at once extended to him.
Fodd and a bed and asylum for man
and b<nst are always freely given by th e
dwellers In those hillside homes. Lying
at full length on the cabin floor and
ciphering by the light of blazing pine
knots was a boy who seemed absorbed in
his occupation. On inquiry it transpired
that this lad of 14. who had had very
little schooling, was working his own
way through algebra, patiently tackling
every difficulty as he met It. and -thus
far he had had almost no help. The
traveler discovered that boy had a gen
uine love for learning: Â«the sort of love
that pushes a student on whether he ha?
teachers or not." He was. able to glvÂ«
him some suggestions.- and "after awhile
to put him in the way , of going to college.
That mountain boy became a distinguish
ed professor in a prreal university, prov
ing himself not only s,kil}fur in mathe
matics, but able to master other studies
in many fields. L ;
Dorothy, the real value cf mathematics
for you will be to convince you that
\u25a0whatever other girls have done, a girl
like you may do. Also, it may help you
to adopt the motto of the wisest of men
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, dc
it with thy might." / .
(Copyright. 1005, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
IN a family^of eleven children, sons
- and daughters unusually- gifttd.
charming and successful, there was
one who,* in ' early manhood, went
astray. He"* was. spoken of. by. tlio .
neighbors as "the one black sheep in a
very , white flock." From time to time
his' youthful tscapades got him into trou
ble, and after awhile his Recklessness
brought disgrace upon the family name.
He left home, and for years was not
herird of by the outside world, though
occasionally a letter or a message came
to the mother., whose love for him never
wavered, arid whose faith in him was un
clouded, notwithstanding the great
strain that- had been put upon it. She
sometimes said to the few with whom
she conversed on the subject of her ab
sent boy: "It is too much to expect in
so largo a family as mine that all s^all
be equally well conducted. I know that
Felix will come out right In the end, for
of all my children he has the most lov
ing heart."
; The father said little, but he. too.
yearned for the return of the prodigal.
Meanwhile, in a distant land, the black
sheep came to himself, was rehabilitated
in 1 his own esteem, honeÃtly : earned
money enough, to pay his debts and at
last returned tojbrlng sunshine to the
hearth that his folly had darkened. He
was no longer the black sheep.
Two or three things may be noted
when we mention one who belongs* to the
list of the black sheep. The first is that
outsiders arc much more strenuous anil
severe in their condemnation of him than
are his own family. The neighbors have
long memories for the mistakes and sins
of youth. They are apt to lay up against
a boy the fact that as a youngster he
was wild and thoughtless, and any doubt
ful deed he may have committed is not
cusily forgotten by them.
God help and pity the boy who goes
-vvronp, if he has nobody of his kith and
kin to care for and love him and condone
his offenses. Blood is thicker, than water.
Parents, brothers and sisters are very
thankful at the first evidence of genuine
repentance on the part of an ill-doer for
whom they care; they are very ready to
find some palliation for weakness, and
they will make no e"d ; of sacrifices; for
the child who gives- most/ 1 trouble -in "the
home. It would almost \u25a0 seem- as -if 'here
were a certain unfairness /.toward "the
steady-going chap who does VjhXs... plain
duty day after day. and' year after^year,
receives little pralse..>andrhas\hls?air
tues completely taken for .g ranted; vwhile
the other Is caressed and â¢'cdddled; arid
praised at the slightest evidence that he
is turning over a iuw leaf.
Human nature will have to be more
nearly perfect than it is before this state
of things can be accepted without a sin
gle murmur. Yet when all is said, the
Droner attitude for a family to take is
that of endless patience with the one
who is not strong enough to stand alone.
We have this' endless patience with -the
sick, for those 1 who ; are laid aside by
bodily distase make large demands on
the well," and" every, one recognizes that
strength must .pay a 1a 1 debt. "to "weakness.
In a very true sense sinfulness of every
kind is spiritual disease,' and it can be
cured -in its own realm only .'by Just
such means as are freely'used to cure
physical maladies. .
Whatever people may think or say, in
the privacy, of their homes and; behind
closed doors, the family . should /present
an unbroken front to the . world, r and
should by every means -in Us' power
shield the erring child 'from public criti
cism, from the consequences of his , acts,
if possible, and should bend; all its ener
gies toward his .reformation.' \u25a0
\u25a0â¢\u25a0.;* -\u25a0â¢; * , > '\u25a0;..â.:-â¢-
Another consideration' is" pertinent. : Is
It -right-thaTr'an entire family, brothers
and sisters, children not yet grown and>
children \yet unborn, shall suffer'' because
of the family .effort to defend the one
child who has botn false to' the -family
ideal? This is. not an Isolated, instance.
The hand, of the black" sheep sometimes
casts an indelible stain and shadow on
the rest of the household. Sacrifices are
made for him which are'rhariifestly" un
just, ami rather than face' a passing re
proach a whole family may be impover
ished in a futile endeavor to protect his
name and make restitution for. his dis
honesty. ' ... \/ '.; ;â¢ ; ,
In . common with many other human
problems this one bristUs' with difficul
ty. Where is the solution? There can
be none that will adequately fit every
different phuse of trouble;'.- there can be
none .that will satisfy, all minds. In the
end most of us have to-meeflivlng trou
ble with euch courage' and resignation as
we can, setting our teeth and "facing- the
worst, yet forever hoping for the best.
Our, greatest \u25a0 danger is that we , may
drift into pessimism. No 'human soul is
wholly reprobate. No one ever drifts
too far away for .love to bring him back.
The ease is more distressing when, the
black sheep is a woman than when it is
a mnn\vho has, gone astray. Society anil
the home demand of woman an unques
tioned purity. ;a; stainless 'honor and-an
impeccable virtue. <It V "is rfght that" this
demand should be made; of woman, 'for
on her rests the fabric: of civilisation as
It can never rest on man. The integrity
of the family is in woman's hands. t If a
girl wander from the right path, , it' is
harder â¢ to reclaim . her, 'and ,the conse
quences are more terribly; 'far-reaching
than in the case of her brother." 1 . Yet even
for her there should be pardon and the
blotting out of .the past. ... .
In one of lan . Macllaren's exquisite
Scottish tales there is the .story of a
daughter who had been driven from her
Tiome by the harshness and lack of sym
pathy, of a" stern father: -The day /comers
â¢when, broken in health, with the utmost
..timidity, the homesick child creeps back

O.NCE in; a- while we" fail, do we
' not," girls? There Is something
:.on which " - we' Â« have act our
;/ hearts, some "perfectly right and
.desirable, thing, but we cannot
get it. .We have tried faithfully t^o the
best of our, ability. But we are dis
appointed. We feel very much as we
would if we saw somebody^else climb
ing... without the least, trouble, to the
top of a mountain, while we kept- sliding
back to the bottom.
J Everybody cannot be equally success
ful,:and a friend or a classmate often
seems to gain without - much " effort
whatever she wants, while we. lose. It
is so in many departments of life out
side of ; the schoolroom. It is not only
that another girl wins the gold medal
for proficiency, while we have not even
a, mention on the honor list; that an
other always has reports enriched with
a double A, while we have only a B or
C.ibut there are other failures that try
our hearts quite as much.
Another girl makes a friendship
where we have only a slight ncquaint
ance, or goes off on a splendid trip to
Europe; 'while we stay at home with
out change of scene* The fact is. if we
choose to disturb ourselves about them,
the small disappointments of life are
endless. The great ones, too, occur now
and then. It is a test of character to
meet, discouragements bravely, and to
refuse, to be downcast and blue, when
\u25a0we 'fail in an attempt through no fault
of .'our- own. . \u25a0 . - â¢\u25a0 â¢
As I Vwrite I "am thinking of a girl
friend who h,as had an experience which
.will show her mettle and disclose in its
; later -^effect the â¢ sort "of girl' she is.
Elizabeth is a quick .and clever girl,
who learns without taking.much trou
ble,', and; who has a reputation in her
family circle for extraordinary genius.
She. has always been* expected to carry
orf all the prizes in sight. Her father
amuses his .friends. by the unconscious
vanity which prompts him to boast of
Elizabeth's sprightliness, and he is'con
tinually repeating her .witty speeches
and telling any listener- whom Â«he can
buttonhole v the storyyof her latest tri
umphs. Htr ; mother has less to say, and
-Is /more tactful, but- in her quiet, unob
trusive fashion she -is just as proud of
â¢her daughter andl just as. convinced of
her superior talents as her. .good..hus
band is. i Both these people, without
meaningr.it, have puffed . up, Elisabeth
from her cradle, \u25bawith the result that
she has come,, to depend entirely ;too
much on her quickness and has omitted
...ie hard study 'which at certain points
is! indispensable. - You niay imagine the
family. consternation and, chagrin when
Ellzabem failed to pass , her. senior ex
aminations and was told that she would
have to take her last year over if she
is finally to be graduated.
A year does not look very lons to
your father and mother, because- as
people grow older the. years seem fair
ly to rush along like waves in "a'mill
race, but It seems a tremendous thing
to a girl of 17. It loo&s to her like a
long level stretch of. eternity. If wa
fair in anything w_en we are young
we are tempted to fancy that we never
can make up our loss. That Is one
reason why young- people are blue
when they ought to see everything In
rose-color. Once we allow ourselves to
be discouraged we are handicapped.
We are very apt in such moods to dis
courage others. If a girl in Elizabeth's
position , happens to ,be preparing to
teach, or has In mind a determination
to be an artist, or a journalist, she says
to herself. "I may as well give it up.
There is no use in keeping* on. I shall
never attain what I wish."
V Never", is -a word one hears on the
lips of schoolgirls much oftener than
one ought.- : â¢-
Looking over a closet one day in
which a middle-aged woman had
packed away -many treasures of her
girlhood. I came upon a lot of old
school books. In one of them I found
written 'in very black letters, under
scored, too, on the margin ' of several
pages the word "Despair."" "Have you
any. idea." I said to the/owner of the
books, "why or wh,en you wrote this
word on these page??" ..
"Oh," she said, with a laugh, "When
I" was 14 I had moods. I often used to
think that I had almost reached the
jumping-ofr place of>the world, and if
1 failed in a lesson I; felt as if the dis
grace were inscribed.- upon me in letters
so. large that everybody could sec them.
I suppose I scribbled that one day when
I was blue." Â». â¢ '
Occasionally It becomes necessary
wholly to change the plans for one's
life. " A girl may be compelled by loss
of health or financial trouble In the
family to do something quite different
from that which she had * anticipated.
This is such a bright, and cheery
world in which we live, and there are
so many reasons for being: happy, that
it is a positive sin- for anybody ever to
be blue. When a girl lets herself drift
into a habit of self-pity she becomes
morbid and miserable, makes herself
wretched and perhaps loses the power
of controlling her nerves. "She wants
to scream. 1 wish you and I could un
derstand as we ought that, however we
may feel inside, we* never have a right
to show our friends anything except
brightness and sympathy.
To let ourselves huddle up in tearful
heaps, to be damp., moist and unpleas
ant, and have hysterics over anything 1
whatever, is absurd and shameful. The
worst failure any one can have is a
failure to rule one's own spirit and be
havior.
In the "Life of Burne- Jones." a book
that is full of glorious courage, there
are continual proof 3 of -the great art
ist's heroism. When you see his lovely
pictures I want you to remember that
the loveliest, thing about him was his
refusal ever to be discouraged. He
made his friends stronger by his habit
of, constant cheerfulness.' We ought to
- make stepping stones of our failures.
If we happen not to succeed to-day, let
us' start right over and. succeed to-mor
row. One learns more by failing than
by gaining easy honors in tha early
struggles of this strenuous time. The
one who fails and tries again will win
at last.

case upon it and tossed things into it
with a dejected air; suddenly, as he was
fitting them in, -without raising his head
(which I was watching), his right hand
closed over the barrel with which I cov
ered him.
"You'd better not shoot." he said, a
knee upon his side of the bed; "If you
do it may be as bad for you as it will be
for me!"
I tried to wrest the revolver from him.
"I will Jf you force me!" I hissed.
"You'd better not," he repeated, smil
ing; and now I saw that if I did I should
only shoot into the bed or my own legs.
His hand was on the top of mine, bending
it down, and the revolver with it. The
strength of it was as the strength of
ten of mine; and now both his knees were
on the bed: and suddenly I saw his other
hand, double into a fist, coming up slowly
over the suit case.
"Help!" 1 called feebly.
"Help, forsooth! I begin to believe you
are from the Yard." he saidâ and his
uppercut came with the "yard." It
caught me under the chin and lifted me
off my legs. I have a dim recollection of
the crash that I macle In falling.
in. s
Raffles w.is standing over me when I
recovered consciousness. I lay stretched
upon the bed across 'which that black
guard Belville had struck his knavish
blow. The suit case was on the floor,
but its dastardly owner had disappeared.
"Is he gone?" was my first faint ques
tion.
"Thank God you're not, anyway!" re
plied Raffles, with what struck me then
as mere flippancy. I managed to raise
myself upon one elbow.
"I meant Lord Ernest Belville." said 1
with dignity. "Are you quite sure that
he's cleared out?"
Raffles waved a hand toward the win
dow, which stood wide open to the sum
mer stars.
â¢â¢Of course," said he, "and by the route
I intended him to take; he's gone by the
iron ladder, as 1 hoped he wouk*. What
o'i earth should we have done with him.?
My poor, dear Bunny, I thought you'd
take a bribe! But it's really more con
vincing as it is, and Just as well for Lord
Krnest to be convinced for the time
"\re you sure he is?" 1 questioned, as
1 found a rather shaky pair of legs.
"Of course." crlod Raffles again in the
tone to make me blush for the least mis
giving on the point. "Not that it matters
one bit." he added, airily, "for we have
him either way; and when he does tum
ble to it, as lie may any minute, he won't
dare to open his mouth." \
"Then the sooner we clear out the bet
ter." said I, but I looked askance at the
open window, for my head was spinning
still. \u25a0
"When you feel up to it." /ctÂ«"ieÂ«l
Rames, "we shall stroll out. and I. shall
do myself the honor of ringing for the
lift. The force of habit is 100 strong in
you. Bunny. I shall shut the window
and leave everything exactly.as we found
It. Lord Ernest will probably tumble be
fore he is badly missed; but then he may v
come back to put salt on us: but I should
like to know what he can do even If he
succeeds! Come, Bunny, pull yourself to
gether, and you'll be a different man
when you're in the open air."
And for a while I felt one. such was
my belief at getting out of those infernal
mansions with unfettered wrists: this we
managed easily enough, but once more
Raffles' performance of a small part was
no less perfect than his more ambitious
work upstairs, and something of the suc
cessful artist's elation possessed him as
we walked arm in arm across St. .lames'
Park. It was long since I had known
him so pleased with himself, and only too
long since he had had such reason.
"I don't think I ever had > brighter
idea in my life." he said; "never thought
of it till v he was in the next room; never,
dreamt of it coming off so ideally even
then, and didn't much care, because we
had him all ways up. I'm only sorry you
let him" knock you cut. I was waiting
outside the door all the time, anil it
made me sick to hear It. Hut I once, broke
my own head. Bunny. If you remember,
and not in half such an excellent cause!"
Raffles touched all his pockets in his
turn, the pockets that contained a small
fortune apiece, and he smiled in my face
as we crossed the lighted avenues of the
Mall. Next moment he was hailing n
hansomâ for I suppose I was still . very
paleâ and not a. word would he let me
speak until we had alighted as near as
was I'mdent to tl'.e flat. ..
"What a brute I've been, Bunny!" he
whispered then: "but you take h;ilf the
swag, old boy. and right well you've
earned it. No. we'll ko in by the wrong
door and over the roof: It's too late, for
old Theobold to be still at the play and
too early for him to be safely in his
cups." ,
So- we climbed the many stairs with
catlike stealth and like cats crept out
upon the primy leads. But to-nis?ht they
were no ! blacker than their jj canopy of
sky: not a chimney-stack stood out.
against the starless night: one had , ; to
feol his way In order, to av<>ld trippins:
over the low â¢ parapets \of the L-sh.-ipcd
wells that ran from roof to basement- to
light the inner rooms. One of these trells
was Pnnnned by a .flimsy- bridge -with
iron handrails . that felt warm ;lo;(liÂ«
touch as Raffles led the wiy across; a
hotter and a closer night I have never
known. . â¢ â¢ 1 ; \u25a0â¢ â¢ '
"The flat will be like an oven.'.' I grum
bled, at the head of 'our own staircase.
"Then we won't go down," .said Raffles,
promptly: "we'll slack it up here. for a
bit instead. No. Bunny, you' stny .where
you are! I'll fetch you a drink and a
deck chair., and you shan-t come- down
till you feel more fit.". , â¢ .
And I let him have his way. I. will not
say as usual, for I had even less than
my normal power of resistance that
night. That villainous unpercut! My
head still sang and throbbed, as I seated
myself on .one of the aforesaid parapets
and buried it in my hot hands.. Nor was
the night one to dispel a headache: there
was distinct thunder in the air. Thus I
sat in a heap and brooded over my mis
adventure, a pretty figure- of a subordi
nate villain, unjll the step came for which
1 waited: and it never struck me that it
came from the wrong direction.
"You have been quick," said I. simply, j
"Yes," hissed a voice I recognized;
"and you've got to be quicker still! Here,
out with your wrists: no, one at a time;
and if you utter a syllable you're a dead
man."
It was Lord Ernest Belville: his close
cropped. Iron-gray mustache gleamed
through the darkness, drawn up. over his
set teeth. In his hand g::Uered a pair
of handcuffs, and before I knew it one
had snapped its jaws about my right
wrist. â¢ .
"Now- come this way," said : Lord. Er
nest, showing me a revolver also, "and
wait ' for your friend. . And, recollect, a
single syllable of warning will be your
death!" Â»
With that the -ruffian led me to the
very bridge. I had. just crossed at Raf
fles' heels and handcuffed me to the iron
rail midway across, the \u25a0 chasm. It no
longer felt warm âto; my touch, but icy
aSj.the blood in all my veins.
So this high-born hypocme had beaten
us at our game and ...s, and Raffles had
met his match at last! That was the most
intolerable thought that Raffles, -should
be downin the fiat on my account, and
that I could not warn him of his impend
ig fate; for how was" it possible without
ma'klng such an outcry as should bring
the mansions about our ears? And there
I shivered "on that ; "wretched \u25a0- plank,
chained like Andromeda to the rock, with
n . black infinity above a nC below; and
before my eyes, now grown familiar with
the peculiar darkness, stood -Lord Ernest
Uelville. .waiting for 'Raffle i -to emerge
with full hands j and unsuspecting heart!
Taken so horribly unawares,; even, Raf
fles must fall an easy prey to a desperado

v/hs to happen next. ' . ' ". '-'\u25a0-' â¢
; And wr-at did ' happen was worse than

flickering into the .sort â¢\u25a0 of companion

Hihfnesâ in'.hls .shirt \u25a0 sleeves! \ He was not
only carrying, a .candle to 'put the .finish-
inj;. touch to him as a target: he had dis
pensed with coat and . waistcoat down

unarmed.
..''Wbcro are you, old chap?" -he cried
softly. Jhlmself. blinded, by the "light he
carried; and he advanced a couple of
steps toward Belville. "1 "\u25a0\u25a0; :sn't you,
is it?" i'- S
And Raffles stopped, his candle held on
high, a folding chair under the other arm.
"No, I am not your friend," replied .;
Lord Ernest, easily: "but kindly remain
standing exactly where you are, and
don't lower that candle an inch, unless
â¢ you want your brains blown into the
street." .'\u25a0â¢\u25a0. â¢'\u25a0.-'.
Raffles said never a word, but for a mo
ment did as he was bid: and the vn T
shaken flame of the candle" was testimony
alike to the stillness of .the night and to
' the finest set of nervesdn Europe. "Then,
to my horror, he coolly stooped, placing
candle and chair on the leads; and his
hands in his pockets, as though it were
but a popgun, that covered him. '
" "Why >didn't you! shoot?" he asked in
solently, as he rose. "Frightened ":qf ;the .
noise?. I should be, too; with an old-pat-,
tern machine like that. All, very wellfor
service in the Heldâ but on the housetops
at dead of night!" .. ';' ; >?C .
"I shall shoot, however," replied Lord
Ernest, as 'quietly in his turn, and . with
less insolence, "and chance the noise, un
less you instantly restore my_ property.
I am glad :you don't dispute th'e:,last
word,'- he continued after a slight pause.
"There is no keener honor than ; that
which subsists, or. "ought to subsist,
among '\u25a0 thieves ; and I need '\u25a0 hardly . .say
that I soon spotted you as one of the fra-_

chuckled the wretch, dropping^ for a mo

seemed intended; to enhance our humilia

The : abrupt, question took.' my- breath
away;, but Raffles himself did "not" lose, an,

"intimately," said : he. '.
"That accounts for you, men, . laugnea
"Lord Ernest, "as it does for me, though
I. never had the honor of . the. master's
â¢acquaintance. Nor is it for me to say
which is the worthier disciple. Perhaps,
however, now that your friend is hand
cuffed in: midair and you yourself are at
my mercy you will concede me some little "
temporary advantage?"
And his face split, in another grin from
the "cropped mustache' downward, and I
saw no longer by candle light, but by a
flash of lightning, which tore" the sky in
two before Raffles could reply.
"You have the bulge at present," ad
mitted Raffles, "but you have still to lay
your hands upon your. 'or. our. ill-gotten
goods. To shoot me is not necessarily to
â¢do so; to bring either one of us to a vio
lent end is only to court a yet more vio
lent and infinitely more disgraceful one
for yourself. 'Family considerations alone
shpuld rule that risk out of your game.
Now. an hour or two ago. when the exact
opposite â " ' \. ' * ,
The remainder of Raffles' speech was
drowned*, from my ears " by the belated
crash of- thunder which the lightning had
. foretokL. So', loud, . however. , was the
crash when it came that the storm was
evidently approaching us at a hlsh veloc
ity^ yet as the. last echo rumbled away
L heard .Raffles talking as though he had
. never stopped. ; \u25a0 \u25a0â¢'; ...
â¢ ".You offered us a share," he was. say
ing: "unkus you mean to murder us both
in cold blood it will be worth your while
-to repeat 'the offer. We shouiu be dan
gerous enemies; you had far better make
the best of us' as friends."
'"Lead the way down to your flat." said
Lord Ernest, with a nourish "at his serv-.
ice revolver, "and perhaps we may talk
about it. .It is for me to make the terms.
I imagine, and. in the first place lam not
-going to get wet to. the skin up here."
-. The rain was beginning in great drops,
even as he spoke, and by a. second flash
of llglrtnlng 1 saw Raffles pointing to me.
' !'But what about my friend?" said he.
' * And then came the second peal.
-, "Oh; he's all right." the great brute re
r plied; "do him. good. You don't catch me
'letting myself in -for two to one!" . .

joined Raffles, "to induce me to leave my
friend to" the mercy of anight like this.

; such a fool as, to blame you for that, but

â¢ And. just as it ceased. Raffles' voice
seemed ;dlsirictly. nearer to. me; but in the
'darkness and the rain, which was now. as
heavy as.hail. I could see nothing clearly.
The rain; had already extinguished the
i candle'vLhfard.an'oath from Belville,* a
laugh from Raffles; and for a second that
was all.' ; Raffles was .coming to me, and
the" other could not-even see to fire; that
-was "all ; l, knew in the, pitchy interval of
Invisible rain before the : next crash and
And then!
This time they came together, and not
till 'my dying hour shall I forget the sig^t
that the lightning lit and the thunder ap
plauded. Raffles was on one of the
parapets of the gulf that my foot-bnuge
spanned, and in the sudden Illumination
he stepped across it as one might across
a garden path. The -width was scarcely
greater, but the depth! "In the sudden
Hare I saw to the concrete bottom of the
well, and it looked no larger than the hol
low of my hand. Raffles was laughing in
my ear; he had the Iron rajltng fast; it
was between us. but his foothold was as
secure as mine. Lord Ernest Belville, on
the contrary, was a i.dth of a second late
for the light, and half a foot short in his
spring. Something struck our bridge
plank so hard as to set it quivering like
a' harp-string; there was half a gasp and
half a sob in midair beneath our feet; and
then a sound far below that I prefer not
to describe. \u25a0 I am not sure that I could
â¢lit upon" the perfect simile; it is more
than -enough for me that I can hear it
stiil. And. with that sickening sound
came the loudest clap of thunder yet. and
a great white glare that , showed us our
enemy's body far below, with one white
hand spread like a starfish, but the head
of him mercifully twisted underneath.
"It; was bis .own fault, uunny. Poor
devil! May he andall of uÂ» be forgiven:
but pull yourself together for your own
sake. Well, you can't fall; stay where
you are a minute."
I remember/ the uproar of the elements
while" Raffles was gone; no other sound
mingled with it;. not the opening of a sin
gle window, not the uplifting of a single
voice.' Then came Raffles with soap and
water, and the gyve was wheedled from
one wrist;; as -.you. withdraw a ring for
which the finger has grown too large.
Of the rest. I only remember shivering
till morning in a pltch-darx flat, whose
invalid occupier was. for once the nurse,
and I his patient.
.'And -that Is the. true ending of the epi
sode, in which we two set ourselves to
catch one of our own kidney, albeit in
another place "I have shirked the whole
truth. It. is not a grateful task to show
Raffles as completely at fault as he really
was on that occasion: nor do I derive any
subtle satisfaction from recounting my
own two-fold humiliation, or from hav
ing assisted never so indirectly in the
death of a . not uncongenial sinner. The
truth, however. . has. after all. a merit of
its own,, and . the great kinsfolk of. poor
Lord Ernest have but little, to lose by its
dlvulgence., lt. would, seem that they knew
more of the real character of the apostle
of | Rational" Drink than "was known at

hushed upi - as tragedies only are when
they. occur in, such circles. But the rumor
that did get abroad as to the class of en

We dropped into our donghy and
pulled ashore in some uncertainty. . A
few natives came down to the beach, to
see us land, anfl seemed quiet and
friendly. One of them showed us to
the presidente's house. He, told us on
the way that the presidente was In con
versation with the . senors from 'the
other vessel, which had ; just arrived
that morning from Cebu. . . . â¢..
As we drew near we heard the quick
patter of voices raised -in . argument,
and occasionally a "staccato laugh.
Then we were discovered, â¢ for> the
voices ceased, and the presidente him
self came out to greet us. . -' â¢- â¢.. .
I wished him "good-day," and for. a
while we talked in a circle, exchanging
compliments and felicitations. He -.was.
a rather good looking Spanish' Vlsayan
mestizo, and seemed a person of breed
ing and poise. Soon I introduced
Knapp, â¢ whi crumpled his paw, and I
explained that we were Englishmen
and on a little trading cruise, and
hearing $o much of the wealth and, re
source cf his well-known city, as wel
as of the great personal charm of. its :'
presidente, we had put in while pass-
In*-, to give ourselves the pleasure- of â¢
paying our respects and making his ac
quaintance, and casually to see if, per
haps, he might happen to have a few
bags of coffee, a little tobacco,..or possi
bly some hemp, which just now was
ot little value owing to : the cursed
Americanos.
"Ah, amigo, why did not the blessed
Virgin send you an hour earlier?- It
is true that the storehouse- yonder is
full of hemp which I have bee^n. saving
for the rise in price that . I thought
was sure to come as a result of "the
interruption of the industry by these
cursed Americanos: But at last I am
obliged to let it go, for how otherwise
can my son Emilio pursue his studies
in Paris, where he has gone to become
a famous artist?"
"AJas!" said I, "I can indeed fell for
your anxiety as a parent, which does
you infinite credit, also your solicitude
concerning your eon's . career. I also
am an artist in a poor way,"- and I
showed him my half-filled' sketch book.
He turned the leaves in great delight.
"San Die*ro!â but the senor is a great
master. Seldom has it been my for
tune to gaze upon such work."
"It grieves me, senor," said I, "that
Emilio might have to be disappointed
in tht amount of his remittance. Rath
er than. have .that happen would it
not be well, perhaps, to let us have this
hemp at a little higher price?".
-Ah, the English senor is indeed my
friend, but it is impossible. ." These men
are old acquaintances of mme â and
desperate characters. If I were to play
them false, who knows? '.Itjs possible
that they might burn my' village!"
I held a short conference with Knapp,
in which I told him what I had learned.
His mouth puckered, and he drew his
great brows together in thought. Then
his face expressed a sudden inspiration.
"Ask him . when he's got to deliver
the cargo," he said. I did so. . . .
"To-night." replied the Spaniard, ''as
soon as the coolies can bring the ca3
cos down the fiver, which will be
about 10 o'clock." . ,
"Ask him. if he minds, telling "you
how much .he ig -retting -for his darn
hemp," Knapp said; again. .
The senor hesitated a moment, but
thinking no doubt that f it really. made
no difference since - the stuff was as
good as sold, told me. The price was,
indeed. 'ridiculously small. In.confirm
ation, he showed me a. roughly drafted
contract from the owners of the
schooner to pay the money down as
.soon as the hemp should be delivered
'on board. : This I showed to Knapp;
who studied it carefully.
"Now, kid," he said at length ex
citedly, "is the chance far you to get
in your fine work. Tell this old Greaser
that, although disappointed in-getting
our cargo, we bear no ill-will; and in
vite him and these other Greasers out

a bully cook, and the best booze that
money, can buy.. They'll, comeâ or
Greasers are a lot different in. this part
of the world than they are anywhere
else. Then we'll go back aboard -and
talk to Boles. I've got a plan^Ji^f.

laughter came from the house.' "flaid

1 failed utterly to follow his train of
thought, but did as he told me. _ The
presldente was apparently delighted.
"The sc-nor honors me. It would af
ford me the greatest pleasure. And' If
the senors will condescend to'enter'my
poor house we will have- a flask of
Madeira, and you shall meet, these
othersâ the laflrones that Â£ they are.
But you must not be offended if they

When we were walking back to' our

suppressed anger. . " â¢â¢

suddenly upright, s and it did not need
the thump that I gave my head on the
deck -above .to. remind me that I had
one. Knapp was standing beside my
bunlc with: a grin on his face and an
empty bucket in his hand. Behind was
Bales, wearing a -worried look.
"How do you feel?" he asked anx
iously. . . . ' ' ',

C^J "Go with you where?" I
asked in surprise.
"Knapp has anticipated me as
usual." said the doctor. "It's like this.
Mr. Brpwn. We've got a tight little
schooner that we picked up at quite
a bargain, and we've just finished- fit
ting out fo.- a trading cruise around
the Philippine Archipelago.
Knapp ftnoaded. "Yes," he eaid,
"and if :ou want to take a little share
In the venture, just to give you an
interest in the game, why we're per
fectly agreeable â trat do Just as you
please about that."
I looked from one to the other in
much perplexity and doubt
"Gentlemen." said I, "this is a very
Eenerous proposition, but it is so un
expected that I don't Just know how
to regard it "
"Well," drawled Knapp, "let's put It
on a business basis, then you can tell
better how you stand. Boles and I
have got this schooner, and we're go
ing to run over to Manila and get our
trading stuff, and then take a cruise
around the open ports of the southern
islands of the group, on the lookout
for a cargo of hemp, which is 'way up
just now â tobacco, coffee, copra,
curios, pearls, silks, plno or any darn
thing we can lay hands on at a-rea
sonable bargain. Some of the time
we'll both want to go ashore, and as
we don't want to leave the vessel with
only the natives aboard we want an
other white man to take charge when
we're away. Or perhaps we might
want him to attend to something
ashore.
"It sounds very attractive," said L
"Do -you mind if I think It over and
let you know to-morrow?"
"Not a bit: rather you would, in
fact. We expect to clear in three
days."
"Very well," said I; "then I'll leave
you now, and meet you here In the
morning."
"AU rightâ and mind you make your
plans to come." said Knapp. "Good
by!"
The next morning all of my misgiv
ings returned, and a lot of new ones
besides. By the time that I reached
the hotel I had finally made up my
mind to call the thing off. Boles met
me on the veranda.
'â¢Good morning!" he said cheerily.
"Well. I see you have decided to go
with us."
"Ehâ yes." said I; "I've decided to
Ko," and then I felt much better. Af
though I had known these two men
but a day, I instinctively gave them
my confidence. .
Knapp came in shortly, and when he
learned that I had made up my mind
to go, held out his hand, but I had
learned better than to put my own into
that jaw-trap, so we went in and had
a drink instead. Of course I' had no
desire to take any share in the enter
prise, as I have as much money as I
am ever likely to need, but I stocked
our lockers well up with the best bot
tled hardware there was to be had in
Yokohama.
The fourth day out we sighted "some
of the Loo Choo Islar*-. and from that
time on sighted some land almost every
day. Five days later the coast of
Luzon loomed up early in the morning
on our port bow. From there on we
had variable; winds, and not until four
days later d!d we sight Merivalles
Mountain, which lies at the entrance
to Manila Bay, and which, for some
reason or other, Boles cursed heartily.
Knapp and I were glad to,6ee it. We
ran past Corregidor and up' to the city,
dropping our anchor behind the break
water, and Boles immediately went in
with his papers to report to the captain
of the port. He was ashore until
after dark, and when he came off I
6aw that he had heard something of
Interest.
"Come below," he said to Knapp and
me. "I have just got wind of a good
thing."
We went down Into the cabin, and
Boles hauled some charts out of his
locker and spread them on the table.
"I have Jast learned from a friend
of mine ashore, who is in a good posi
tion to know all about these things,
that there is a fine, fat cargo of hemp
\u25a0waiting for the first comer at Mayon
gong, a little place in the couth of
Saraarâ ah. here it is. It seems that
the port has net been opened yet, but
there win be no difficulty in our get
ting ihe stuff If we can only manage
to reach there before a certain little
brigantine that left here yesterday on
the same errand.
"That seems to be our specialty, doc
â to correct these fool regulations. Let's
have a go at it. It'll be easy enough
to pick up a little more somewheres
else and change the figures on the
manifest."
"No." said Boles, "we can't do that
exactly, but I think I know how we
can arrange It all right. Well, on the
Jump, boysâ -we're cleared and can't
afford to waste any time. \u25a0 These little
coasting ctrfflhs are slow as death and
nothing like as sure, but a day's a big
start, and it's only a matter of 500
miles or so. We'll hare our chin when
we get under way."-
It was not until the sixth day after
*c left Manila that we entered San
Pedro Bay and drew near to our des
tination. I was dvwn In the cabin
shaving, because I always like to keen
-well "policed," as Boles calls it. even
at sea., when a bellow of rage from
Knapp brought m e flying up the com
panionway, under the impression that
some calamity had occurred. And ap
parently it had. â¢
TVe were rounding the point, and
there, Just off the village. lay a schoon
er very much like our own!
It was certainly discouraging. To
have worked and worried as we had,
won our race through dangerous and
unknown waters, and then to find an
unlooked-for rival already on the
ground was enough to make- one swear.
Knapp evidently thought so.
We held a little conference, and it
wag decided that Knapp and I should
so ashore and see how the ground' lay,
while Boles remained on the schooner
as a sort of reserve. Here I was able
to be of some service to. my .mates,
as I had spent several years studying
in Europe, and could speak Spanish
like a native. Boles coujd speak good
Spanish, too, but -Knapp. "svb^n speafc-
into a fogbankâ then it cleared a bit
and I saw the two Spaniards dancing
furiously up and down, locked in one
another's' armsâ and "wondered how
they ever managed to do it with the
schooner 'on her beam ends.\ Thereupon
I was lost in admiration for their
cleverness, and wanted to go over and
embrace tlysm. as they j weren't such
bad fellows after all! But when I got
up, a swell - must ; have gotten under
her, for the deck rose with me..
I dimly overhead Boles saying to the
presidente: "And then Emilio might
take- a course at Juliens â -"
When I awoke, It seemed to me that
I had just gone over Niagara' Falls and
"Stop, senorsS" called Boles _again.J|
"I say-we-cannot^recetTe-yottt.rAnbtherit
stroke at your peril!"
The boat still kept on. ..A 1
. "Shoot high, ' boys."V said BSIBM
"about a foot over their heads. Let!
them feel the wind"
.Our., rifles rang out. and the boat]
immediately held water. The gorilla
rose to his feet.
"But why is this, amigo?'.' he called I
reproachfully.' "I do nut understand.^
We have but cc-rae to bid adios to our*
kind hosts.",.
"Then for what purpose are the
weapons which I saw 'hu\ a moment
ago In the stern Â»f the boaÂ£?" Boles re
plied. Â»""J \u25a0 /;
The face of the gorilla underwent a
change.. His brows came down and his
lips curled ur> with an expression of
malignant ferocity. '\u25a0 * &
"Ah â Dios!â pigs of Englishmen? *youÂ£
have'* stolen our cargo. -;nrst having*,
poisoned us with your vile decoction." '
"They're not the only ones,"- 1 said tpi
myself. - - * ; '. . ,
"The . senor -is surely In error,"\ -an
swered Boles politely.; >'lV^rrtfe7 that
we have taken oh a few bales of" very
poor hemp â but for air of it \vÂ« htfve
paid a good price and received a re
ceipt. As we were stowing the last of
it I learned with deep regret that our
schooner had been mistaken for yours,
and it is probable that the mistake ha 3
not yet been discovered. . But what
would you have? ; Business is business,
and a man "must look after his own
Interestsâ ls it ~riot so?"
"Yes t " replied the Spaniard, "and for
that reason '. I will inform the senor
that". unless, he* delivers over, the carg^
to ' us. ; vte ; â¢will come and take It by^
force." He "smiled, and his yellow
teeth ; gleamed through hi 3 bristling
mustache. â¢ \u2666
: "What . does he say?" demanded
.Knapp impatiently. "What's all this
Jawing' about, anyway? Why don't
you' ask 'em what they're going to do
abont It?" â¢
"He's Just told us." said I. "Ha sayÂ»
that we've- got to give up tho hemp."
\u25a0 â¢ Knapp scowled. "How do you say
â¢go to hell! m Spanish?" he asked.
; "Shut up!" I answered; "I want to
hear what Boles says."
"Brown, get our boat over and tow
us out a bit. to clear that schoonerâ
quick! Knapp. you keep those scoun
drels-.covered; and if one of them
reaches for a gun nail him!"
' I jumped to my feet, and running orri
ward, hnstled our Japs to thÂ« boat
falls; which consisted simply of a
couple of light, tackles and a Jig hook,
rigged from both mast head 3. Boles
was haranguing the Spaniards with
honey words, and they seemed a little
undecided as to what course to pursue.
Then suddenly I saw the gorilla snatch
a rifle from the thwart and throw It to
his shoulder.- Two reports came simul
taneously. Boles staggered a littlÂ»
against the wheel, but the Spaniard
fell with -a crash across the gunwale
"of the boat, which promptly capsized,
throwing all hands into the bay.
"Hurry up with that boat," sang out
â¢Boles. I started aft to get my rifle.
when Boles hailed me. -^
;'\u25a0 "Stand by. to cut that bow-line whenj
I give the wordâ then get aft here a3
quick as you can to repel boarders!
Now stand. by to slack your Jib-sheet!
â Leggo your Jib-sheet!" I cast it off
the pin and let it run. The brig was
not a cable's length away and coming:
along with a fresh puff of the breeze in
her topsails. A knot of men were gath->
ered in 'her eyes.
"Cut the bow-line!â hard-a-lee!â
tumble aft here! Don't shootâ knock
'em overboard!*.* \u25a0 . -
The brig was almost on us as we
luffed, and if they had guessed our de
sign they could ha ve. easily jammed
their helm dawn and fouled us, but as
she was still paying off. and being a
clumsy craft, we swung across their
bows before they knew it. They tried
to swing in after uss, but It was too
late. Her "starboard .run struck our
.port quarter, a gianclng^blow. and as
it did so. four of t be^nieii leaped down
on our deck,. The- .first, .a Spaniard,
fired a pistol almost in Boles' facfe Ii?
he jumped; but at the same moment
the bowsprit of the brig fouled â¢ the
main tOpping-llft. though Boles had let
the mainsheet run. The rope snapped,
but the strain suddenly tautened the
mainsheet, which flew up, knocking- our
captain over backward Into the leÂ«
scuppers. The next moment Knapp
had seized the^ man in both of hls.gr eat
hands and hurled him back agaTnst tlie
next, a half-breed, knocking both men
off their feet. I had brought the caps
tan brake aft with me. and slipping
past Knapp, I drove the butt of It Into
the next man's face.
By that time Boles had climbed to
his feet, and Jumping across the deck,
grabbed the wheel and clawed the
spokes toward him as fast as he couM
work his .arms. At the same tiaie
Knapp had gripped the: Filipino i^go
came last by the waist and swung- him
up over his head. The man screamed
like a rabbit, thinking, no doubt, that
he was about to be dashed lifeless on
the deck, but the next moment a
mighty heave sent him flying over the
rail into the bay. . - â¢ â¢<
I was standing over the other thrae.
swearing In Spanish at the top of. my
lungs and brandishing my -capstan
brake. One of them, . lying; almost
under the wheel, started to get- to his
feet, but when he was almost up. Boles
let drive with his fist and stretched
him oat again. \u25a0 'â¢ - \u25a0-..
The brig was astern of â¢ ns. drifting
aimlessly. A boat had put off from;
the schooner and had picked up :tha
capsized party, who. from the'male
dictions that came up to us against tÂ£%
wind, were far from showing tha grati
tude that they should "lava felt." I
could make out the gorilla nursing; one
arm in the stern. Knapp afterward
told me that he had shot him throtigh"
the shoulder. . â¢ . â¢
Knapp looked all. around him. then
threw . back his head and laughed. .
"If that lubber hadn't upset that
outfit we mizht have been in .bad"
shape," said he..
"Yes." I answered, ''we'd not only
have had them to look after, but the
chap that went after them front -the
schooner.. What if " r â¢ v >- â¢
I broke, off, horror-stricken^' and
looked at Boles. He had f alien face
downward across the wheel. On the
deck beneath .him was a great pool" of
blood. Knapp was beaicte him' in one
great stride. '\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 --;;
"Boles!" he gaspedâ "old f eilow ! . . Ob*,
my God!" . . \ . "^L
As if he had been a child he plckVd
him up in his great arms and carried
him below. I put one of tne Japs at
the wheel, motioned to the cook to
watch the' prisoners and followed him.
Boles vcas shot in two places â cue a
glancing ball along the side side of tfcÂ»
h<rad . and me other a bullet cleau
through tb-j lunps. When Knapp real
ized that his own shot had . been too
late to save his friend his grief ant?
self-reproach . were pitiful to see. But
it was all unnecessary, for -the doctor*
made a good recovery from both
wounus..
When we got off the Â«nd of the point,
safe from all pursuit,'- Knapp hove the
schooner up and set the prisoners
ashore, as we had no earthly use for
them. I suppose they made their way
back along the beach. We had. made
Boles as comfortable a3 possible, and
after he came, out of hi 3 faint be
calmly superintended- .our rough at
tempts at a surgical dressing. 'Strange'
to say. .the. hole through. . hl3 chest
healed almost immediately, but he told.
me that this was .very apt to Pc- the
case, in wounds of this description.
Knapp was 'a dqct hand at naviga
tion, .but under Boles' ' direction V"%J
mantged tolflnd Manila again tn abt*:
aTweek. We stopped at one little plate
on the way and got a little more hemp
and sonic tobacco. \u25a0 / - .
-stiff "proposition, but once, up. the cool
~ air. revived me "-\u25a0 ~ . ~ ; ' ~ 7 : :*: r ~ v '\u25a0
The schooner was still at anchor, but
her. main and" fore sails were set, and
the : anchor hove short up. "The decks
\u25a0were>; covered with : Ion?, golden-yellow
hemp \ ! fibers,; seeing "which zay eyes
came open \u25a0wider, still.
"For; the Lord's sake- " I began in
amazement,, but "Boles â¢ tapped me en
the shoulder.
"Oh. never mind .that," he ~ said*.
"Liook over there!"
I looked, and .what I saw sobered me^
up like a cold plunge. Just under our
stern lay the schooner of our rivals,
and astern of her, not a cable's- length
away, there lay a newcomer, a little
brigantine of about" our- own tonnage.
Her boat lay alongside the schooner,
but no one was In sight. I looked aloft,
then on all sides. Not a breath of air

Are you. -both sir and madam, slyly
rtudying the physical culture ads, the
obesity cufes, and the reduction-with
out-fasting methods so cunningly dis
played in the back pages of the maga
zines?
Then-
Here is something that may interest
you.
There is a right way and a wrong way
to reduce.
At least that is what Julian B. Bran
don, professor of physical culture and
director of medical gymnastics, says.
And what is moreâ more Interesting; and
more startlingâ he says that it is the
UÂ£or.g way that is commonly practiced.
Xie says that the wrong way is the way
the athletes go about itâ the football
players, the pugilists, and all our fjmous
Would-Be-Strongs who set the "cxamplÂ«
for the common run of people who do the
days' work and secretly would be beauti
fulâand slender.
He says that when our football heroes
pile on their heavy clothes 'and ; their
theaters and go for a run to take off tl>e
fat and put on the muscle they arc mak
ing a mistake.
That when the pugilist, preparing to
battle for the championship, gets into
his heaviest underwear, and piles sweater
upon sweater, and pulling his cap over
his eyes and his knitted collars up to his
cars, goes for a ten-mile tramp to make
himself strong he is actually- doing the
very opposite; that he is Instead of de
veloping his physical powers to their
highest point, really depleting them; that
be is sapping his vitality and poisoning
himself.
Now,* what do you think cf that?
He says, also, that the manyorthe
voman with too much . avoirdupois,
â¢wip, taking a leaf out of the athlete's
book, sets about training it off by
sweating:, going in for exercise with
layers and layers of clothing on, is not
suit $3 a. disturbance of the functions of
tnc organs. .
"Ail quid: reduction Is followed by
quick" gains. This is not what the or
dinary manor woman wants. If exces
sive tissue is removed suddenly and,
quickly the -moment the person stpps
reducing and resumes customary habits
the tissue comes back, and more. All
reduction nmst be very gradual. *
"In all reduction â except, of course,
for such emergencies as those of jock
eys, who must make weight regardless
of health â one should aim not only at
reduction of weight, but to put himself
into^ perfect physical condition. The
only legitimate and scientific way of re
ducing is the way that will leave' the
person who undergoes a course of train
ing in perfect health at the end of it.
"No one should enter upon a course of
\u25a0 training to reduce without being pre
pared for It. ".
"No one can make an abrupt transition
frpm a sedentary or the 'average inactive
life ".to an active life with ..safety any
more than the man who rides down town
â¢ every --'day can jump in and run a mile
without injuring himself.
"The first thing to do In preparing for
a. course of training is to get the heart
in^ condition. If. you ; ha.ve been living a
. sedentary or inactive" life your .heart
muscle, is weak, as a matter of course;
not,, weakened by dtstase-^-I don't mean
thatâ but your, heart muscle. gets weak
just, as the- biceps-do, by inaction. In or
der to strengthen \u25a0it.you must begin with
gentle exercise- and -carefully; avoid over
dolngi 'The heart- gives its own signals.
Any continued ipalpitation^of the heart
is evidence that ybir are overdoing, arid
exercise must be regulated In : accordance
with your heart; signals., ; < f \u25a0_\u25a0 ."-*.Â«..
"it takes about two weeks to put the
average person 1 Uito' condition to co'm
..menee a course or training for reduction.
"Then follows â¢ the exercise for produc
ing muscle and removing "'.fat.: This ex
ercise, Jin character and duration, must be
adapted Yto the individualâ the- age, the
physical 'condition determined by i the con
dition of the various organs,- the* overde

of reduction that does not depend on ex
ercise.
"It 19 wrong to try to reduce by cutting
out fluids: the system craves moisture,
and the only time it is injurious Is at
meals, where If It is taken one doesn't
masticate and docs wash down mouthful*
of food with mouthfuls of water. This
habit is one of the common causes of,
obesity. Water takes up calcareous mat
ter in the body, and people who Btop
drinking in order to reduce often suffer
rheumatism as the penalty.
"It is wrong to seek reduction by med
icines, and injury to the digestive organs
is the commonest result of this method.
"It is wrong to try to reduce by ab
staining from food, for it results in an
impoverished condition of the blood,
sometimes expressed by an eruption cf
carbuncles, anything but beautifying
and always by an anaemic appearance. â¢
"No advice on reducing can be comr
plete without a reference to bathing. .
"First of all, avoid the cold bath la
every form, shower, .plunge or sponge.
"This is another Iconoclastic attack
on custom, but the cold bath is an In
jury to a strong person, and can do Im
measurable harm to a weak person.
"The shock of the cold bath drives
the blood from the outer extremities to
the organs, so that where a hemor
rhagic tendency exists It Is liable to*
cause hemorrhage, and at best It
causes congestion in some degree. More
cases of heart , trouble, sciatica, kid
ney trouble, nervous indigestion and
rheumatism are traceable to the cold
bath than to any other one cause. Many
cases of paralysis are brought on by
its shock to the nervous system.
"Although the immediate effect of the
cold bath is exhilarating Its tax on tha
vitality Is excessive.
- "The bath that follows exercise in re
ducing, and. Indeed in any sort of train
ing, should be tepid â a tepid shower,
gradually reduced in temperature, but
never until It is . actually cold and
chilling. ; .
â¢ '"While exercising the perspiration
should not be wiped off. Let it flow
freely. It is nature's way of relieving
the feverish condition of the skin and
should not be checked while in action.
"I think it is one of the greatest mis
takes to throw cold water -on fighters
during the progress of a fight. You
check persplraflon and stiffen the mus
cles by cold appliances. If athletes
want that demonstrated let them lump
out of a cold bath and try to do some
quick nimble work. Let them also ob
serve the trainer of race "horses who
warms his horse up -just before a race.
The chilling of a. muscle Is the stiffen
ing of a muscle.
"This practice of athletes groins di
rectly.- under the cold shower from ex
ercise seems the utmost .folly. While
exercising, the-, muscle is in a â¢ semi
lluid sfate, and chilling it is liable to
induce rheumatism. "Nature left to her
self does not make abrupt transitions,
so why should we Inflict them on her?
"After exercising the right thing to
do 'is '.to rub all .perspiration cfC the
b.ody until it is perfectly dry, then take
the tepid shower, gradually cooling it.
This - method . involves no abrupt tran
sitions, and consequently no shocks.

oxidation of blcod, and this can be done
by wearing the lightest clothing possible
when exercising by exercising, if Indoors,
only in a gymnasium that gets plenty of
fitsh air and sunshine and that is not
heated artificially. I
"One hears every now and then of So
and-So building -a great house with a
basement. gymnasium, So-and-So would
be better off without a gymnasium than
v.-ith an underground one. Where one
cannot got' outdoor exercise '\u25a0 the aim
should bo to get as much fresh air and
sunshine into the gymnasium as possible.
"Hard sweating is not necessary to
reduction. . \u25a0 \u25a0/â¢
"The moment muscle appears fat dls-,
appears.
"Fat feeds muscle through the fatty
globules being taken Into the blood, so
that a person who has excessive fat will

thin person. \u25a0 ,
.'â¢ln exercising, the nerve force shoula
not be brought into play, for the use of
a nerve exhausts .while the use of a
muscle benelits and develops it. "
'"I say that more attention should be
paid to measurements than to weight in
reducing, for, of course, one of the aims
of reduction is to attain symmetry. The
disposition of surplus adipose tissue is
not alwaysâ ls, indeed, rarely uniform.
The part of the body that is overdevel
oped is the part to be exercised.
"If It Is the abdomen, why exercise
the, muscles of the abdomen. There ara
two -forms of exercise for reducing that
âthe active, and the resistant. That Is,
in one the person may sit on a stool,
with feet caught in straps fastened to
the floor to maintain the balance, and
by swinging the body as far to the sides
and as far back,"ih a sort â¢ of rotary
movement, bring Into play all the mus
cles of the abdomen and back, and by
developing them burn" out the. adipose
tissue. . ;
"In the other method the person Is
exercised instead of exercising. That is,
an attendant takes hold of the knee ana,
pressing against it with all the force
possible while the person resists with
all his force, swings It around with a.
rotary motion. This Is done from both
knee and ankle, and has the same effect
as the stool' exercise, but, of - course,
with less demand -on the person's
strength.- -'.--'â¢
"Massage Is the mildest v form of exer
cise and is intended for the treatment of
Invalids physically . Incapable of taking
exercise.. It is also extremely useful for
the . removal of adipose tissue' from such
parts of< the. body as; cannot b.e put
through auto-exercises that will remove
the tissue. In attaining ' symmetry it is
especially useful In removing a double
chin; in doing away with .. fat on the
shoulder blades or back, in getting rid of
the roll of fat" that sometimes 'disfigures
' the \u25a0 back !of"! of " the neck, ':â¢ and 'also' in filling

- '- THE SAN FRANCISCO ""SUNDAY-: CAULONCE upon a time there was an
Old Grad who had not sat at the
\u25a0 feet of his alma mater for 10,
these many years, or 1 about- that
long. An old grad, it must' be
understood. Is not generally speakinga
man; he' is an institution designed by
nature and the college faculty for the
express purpose of impressing on the
co-called minds of callow undergrad
uates the fact that the old college is
not what it was in the early *70s. HJs
chief function is to show up about tfto
time that a fresh bunch of enterprisiqg
youngsters is being turned loose on a
helpless world, tfnd tell the particular
bunch that happens to be going over
the bars*Vhat a. green and generally
unfinished lot, of specimens they are.
At ether times' Ije is supposed to drop
in occasionally to sit on the chapel
platform and look wise and weary and
envious of the carefree life of the col
lege youth. On special occasions the
carefree youth is allowed to lap up a
little distilled wisdom as it flow* from
the lips of the old grad. .
Then is when the latter gentleman
grets in his fine work. In Impressive
tones that come straight from* the
northeast corner of his manly chest he
assures the budding intellects that' the
only sure way to.be happy ls.to.be
good; he knows because he has been
told by a map who tried it once, but he
usually neglects to add that they are
not apt to have any fun. It Is one of
Fables ;.f<or;tSne FtooHsK âBy; Nicholas- Hesao '
the most touching sights known to
man to observe one of these- samples
of the genus homo urging his young
friends to cultivate the beautiful habits
of patience, industry and the toilsome
accumulation of great gobs of knowl
edge in order to seize the golden op
portunity by the mane and tail: when
it comes around their side of the corral.
To be sure, it often happens, that thl3
beautiful homily on human happiness
is a trifle marred by the fact that the
man who is reeling it off has come
straight from the witness chair, where
he has been sedulously avoiding tell
ing the facts about the organization of

in' somewhat the same mental condition
as the late renowned Little Peterkln. but
he was quite as sure- as .was that young
gentleman that 'twas a glprious victory.
-At; that st%so of tho game the Old Grad
was informed that the proper way to cele
brate a victory on. the ensanguined grid-
Iron was ?to . pour \u25a0 copious and frequent
libations to the slain and to put out the
lights in all the theaters in town. He
didn't Intend to. participate actively in
all _ the ceremonies of the evening, but
he. was prepared to observe the' pro
ceedings from a carefully selected
vantage point If he could find- one not
already occupied. His start was decorous
and; seemly /as befitted a gentleman of
his years and discfetion,and all went well
until he leaped into tha public eye through
the declaration by, a "young man with a
red and " green necktie that the esteem
ed parent of their colleague was suffering
from si restricted circulation of the flow
ing-;bowl:andthat all sincere friends of
the dear old college would see to it at
once that the sad condition was relieved.
That was all that the Old Grad could
remember, however, when . ho awdke in

next day and made a dash through center

to stay open at the same 'time his son
sauntered in, looking as though he had
just been unpacked from his bandbox.
with a flower in his button hole and a
complexion as rosy as the dawn. The
oil man gasped when he saw the dewy
condition of his offspring, but that was
nothing to what he did~when that young
man cheerfully inquired why he hadn't
been to church.
The Old Grad, af tar mature deliberation,
came to the conclusion that when a man
had reached his .ago and condition of
servitude It was too much of "a strain to
attempt to renew his youth all at once
and the next day saw him once more In
the haunts of the peaceful ticker and on
tho floor of the restful Stock Exchange
His brief but strenuous sojourn in the
cloistered halls of learning had given him
very positive \u25a0 opinions on two subjects:
namely, the cheerful individual who be

Old Grad was convinced that people ,ljfs9
prate of the desirability of inducing :"

youthful variety of heads can stand I

who makes diversion of this dreary
roundâ how about her? Why s>hould she
go slumming?
Nothing could be more dreary and de
pressing and spiritless than these sights
she sees when she makes one of a party
seeking recreation in this strange way
nothing could be more dispiriting except
a great railway station In the small hours
of the night, when the lights blink/and
the trains are few and the waits Ici^j.
It is perfectly trueâ and there's no use
dodging or denying itâ that it is Anon
yma she wants to see, Anonyma in al>
her variety. . . *. \u25a0
Why?
Why should the fortunate woman, tha
respectable woman, the sheltered, pro
tected, cared-for woman, the gentle, mod
est, virtuous womanâ who can afford to
be gentle and modest and virtuousâ wish
to go forth with her mantle of righteous
ness about her to spy upon and make a
holiday of her sister's wretchedness?
She doesn't go in charity, with a help
ing hand outstretched.
The chances are she'd be hooted If she
did.
But she does go with a lorgnette aad'*a
laugh, for the amusement -of the tolas
and to tell clever stories about It altar
ward.' â¢ *;:â¢
To make such painful study of ear
pcor human weaknesses in' the interest
of art, of science and of charity is ad
mittedly legitimate.
But In wanton frivolity and prurient
curiosityâ for a night's recreation and
sensationâ and by women-
Then this fashionable fad for elum
ming seems very like vivisection.
High with expectancy, eager for the
unknown, we start on our tour in our
astral form, if you so prefer It â first
to the music hall whose midnight glit
ter dazzles us on our home-bound car.'
It is brilliant with electric lights and
polished woods and polished mirrors,
hot with tobacco smoke and ' stiflingly
moist with the steamy smell of beer.
There is much music of a sort, music
with a -feverish, would-be .joyousness,
above it the screech of foolish song and
questionable jest from the stage which
is, as it were over the shoulder of the
throng so bent upon its own business.
and again above that the confused
murmur of many voices in jumbled talk
and laughter. Walters glide hither and
thither with their loaded trays at a
distracting angle. Every hand grasps
well begin at the beginning and join it at
â¢Vr.ner, at the jolly little dinner in the
more or kss-yusually moreâ Bohemian
re&frsurant. that is a sort of overture to
the entertainment to follow. - -\ â¢ ,'
There is somehow an. undefined surfep
tiUousntss about the party, 'â¢ something
understood but not quite confessed', for
however much slumming is indulged in
and prattled about it still has the air of.
adventure, the flavor of the forbidden,
and the party; we observe, is made up of
men affecting the ease of sophistication,
and of other men's wives. *
The man who is host does not.' as a
rule, his hospitality- =to his own
wife, and for the woman who slums there
is a want of piquancy in s.umming with
her husband.
So the dinner, to begin with,' has
quite a staccato trayety.
It is a late dinner,- too, and lingered
over, for the slumming ; that begins
early is like the e\;s without salt, flat
in flavor.
*a stein or the slender stem of a glass;
everywhere is heightened color and the
roving eyp. ,
Ancnyma -is here â everywhere âwe
are sure she-, is â in youth and beauty
and insolence and fine raiment, flatter
ed and courted; faded, battered, ugly,
trivv^iry, - impudent, seeking prey and
pelf; and on, the spot we confess to
ourselves that it Is Anonyma we have
come to -see: â that slumming, after all,
through all the letters of its alphabet,
is. spying upon Animyma on her native
heath.
Anonyma pervades; we, feel sure she
is everywhere â over there at- the table
in the corner. In flaunting hat and-gar
ish silks ogling the man at her side;
and another over his shoulder. We
see' it all by the aid' of ' the lorgnette.
Here at the very table beside our own,
where we are holding steins and stems
ourselves â for one of the piquancies of.
slumming is to do in Rome as the Ro- .
mansâ is Anonyma again, in demure
tailor-mades and modish turban,'
"really very presentable," we are de
ciding when, gracious goodness! we\
discover her to be the bride on our'
block, our very neighbor in. our very
exclusive neighborhood.
After that things are confusing. It
is very much like attending a dance, at
an asylumfor the insane where your
partner may- be a lunatic or may believe
you -are one. â¢
. You . study > the scene from stage to
dpor.from wail' to wall, seeking its spirit,
and it seems singularly like the egg with
out solt.! \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0"'. ;
The men, for the most part, look
bored, and over-red when they do not look
over-far in liquor; the tables are sloppy
with little pools or uniformly moist, after
the hasty swipe of the waiter; the at
mosphere grows heavier and heavier;
the talk and laughter have too much noise
f~y LUMMIN'G is a fashionable pas-
O. time.
X) Slumming is a diversion of the
4^ smart folk.
Slumming is a part of the itlner
ery of the silk-lined tourist, just as see
ing the missions and the Seai Rocks Is.
Smart New Yorktrs slum In San Fran
cisco, and equally smart San Franciscans
t!um in New York.
You are invited to a slumming party
at inconsequentiy as you are to a bridge
party, and as confidently- expected to
participate.
Smart young matrons, belles who are
\u25a0world-seasoiVed by a season or two, who
reed no longer play the ingenue, even
precocious debutantes slum now and
then, for the piquancy of itâ as one puts
the shake of paprika on the melon, the
t'sih of tabasco on the oyster, the soup
con of garlic in the salad.
Slumming crops up In polite conversa
tion so casually that it might be the most
innoctnt. the most wholesome, the most
natural, the most harmless diversion In
the world â like golfing, or gathering
daisies on an upland meadow.
Indeed, there are good souls who
think that it is.
Here and there you will find this
delusion is still retained by the old
fashioned few who take < things on
tr^ft. whose worldly wisdom is in a state
cf arrested development, and who still
believe that slumming is, as it once
was, a philanthropic exercise engaged
in by the more venturesome good.
Not infrequently these good but un
enlightened folk arc the papas and
rramas, the papas-in-law and maraas
ir.-law of the progressive young wom
en who slum now as it is slummed, and
tuch expurgated histories as they get
of the slumming expeditions do not. of
course, disturb their happy belief.
The veiled revelations in the Taggart
<livorce trial may do that, however, may
Â«:jcite an uneasy wonder, and may, in
deed, temporarily discourage the fad for
slumming.
"What is it," they will ask themselves,
"that is so very dreadful in Mrs. Tag
eart'e slumming that it has to be told be
hind dosed doors? Of course, it if some
thing MY Gwendolen, MY Murielâ who
have been slumming, tooâ would never
6ee."
Which, no doubt, is true, for there are
degrees of slumming, just as there are de
grees of depravityâ and curiosity.
The fashionable slumming of to-day is
a v*ry different sort of slumming from
that which these good folk knewâ that
Lady Bountiful sort, that left its carriage
on" the highway and went through the by
ways, its backet on its arm and its purse
and heart open, pouring balm ,on the
wounded.
Ccmmon words with new customs take
on new meanings.
Slumming Is now a larKâ a newer, later
social dissipation.
If you are behind the times and wculd
know what it is and Â«.ow it is done, come,

The sophisticated man or the plain
clothes man tells us he Is taking us
"down the line." and his phrase is /un
consciously, unintentionally graphic. .
So he is in Very truth, from- the.
first insidious sparkling sip. of folly
down through all the nlce.^degree3,
graduating so imperceptibly* into the
dark and' bitter waters * of : the last
.vanquishing drink.
; The slumming goes even to the
Cuckoo's Nest, that marks the last de
gree'ln the low degrees 'of the Bar
, bary Coast.
â¢ The plain clothes man himself needs
the help of the "special" to discover in
the murky fag end of this Coast of the
Derelicts the feeble glimmer of the
Cuckoo's' Nest.
If slumming should be done at all it
should surely include the Cuckoo's
Nest, and if every, pair of little high
heeled shces that are tripping heed
lessly into the path that leads to It
wVre guided there first there are few.
I'm sure, that -would travel that swift
descending way.
The swinging doors, greasy to the
touch, that open the way into the
Cuckoo's Nest, show a squalid saloon
interior, an interior in truth of saloon
junk over which smoky oil lamps throw
an orange glow. Â» .
Wilted curtains ,stringily covering a
doorway, also greasy to the touch, give
perpendicular strips of a still more
squalid interior In a sort of panel-pos
ter .effect a few scattered dishes with
unpleasant broken food on a bare table,
two awful ancient harridans picking at it
with their fingers, smiling hideously at us
cut of their drink-bloated, evil old faces
as we part the curtains, another sitting
on a humpy, lumpy greasy sofa putting
the last bandage around an ailing foot,
with her remnant of late supper on a
chair beside her.
They give us, heaven pity them, a
chirpy, cheerful welcome.
"Sure, 'tis not very loively this noight.
an* we're glad enough for company," and
they "set" chairs for us, first dusting
them with a whisk of their limp drag
gled skirts.
They greet the/special" with senile en
dearment as "Jee," and "Joey, dear." and
make a feint to claw him into the playful
embrace of dirty, withered old arms. He
sidesteps brusquely, and yet . not un
kindlyâsomewhere in the bottom of
every even fairly good man's heart there
is> that everttowtng spring of chivalry that
makes him gentle with even the worst of
wcrhen.
They, prattle to us the go6sip of their
fÂ»tld neighborhoodâ how the Spanish
woman on another blockâ "a young .thing,
an' pretty, too, the Lord have mercy on
her, dthrank carr-bollc an' committed
soo'!clde the lasth week," and how "the
youug woman next dhooxâ f'om Portho
rickyâ-took the same," and "what a row"
it made. ,
They cackle In their cracked old voices
over . the events, and one looks on them,
these; evil ojd women, so simple In th<Â»lr
vice, with their matted straggling locks
oveV ihsir faded eyes, the old. old wo
men who make gay with the old, old. bat
tered, tattered wrecks stranded on the
Barbary Coast, and one thinks that per
haps the way of the Spanish woman who
"dthrank carr-bolic" and "the woman
f'om Porthoricky who took .the same"
wusV after all, the better way. ...
There are only two stages beyond the
.Cuckoo's Nest, and we make themâ as
the Barbary Coasters doâ in order.
The first is the City Prison.

"Gran'tlm-eâ haddagran'tlrne." muttered
the tottering derelict a3 he taclia to
a cell ia the wake of the turnkey,
and then â this also beirrg a part of the
merry slumming expedition â we tee
him slowly sink in a dirty heap on the
floor, sighing and muttering.
Girls are brought lr., girls with vacuous,
glazed, set eyes and shrill laughs and
pretty, red lips "dripping ribaldry, and
they leer at the sergeant the while they
answer his questions, and thÂ«i they
are hustled away to the women's quar
ters, where the slumming parties can't
follow them, unless they are specially
privileged slumming parties, for even
the big, husky police, used, and presum
ably hardened to such, sights, hold a
deterring hand between woman's shame
and idle laughing curiosity.

n't a very clear idea as to what hap
pened. All wÂ« do know is that wo se
cured the cole and exclusive hearing
to a bunch of originality that has car
ried us past the proposing point this
j'ear and a half, and we trust will safe
guard us for many years to come.
We remember quite distinctly our
former proposal and proposes also.
(She's since begat double enders. pooc
soul. Lord, what a lucky dog we'
were!) We tried to be original that
time, too, as became a would-be literary
man. WÂ© bought a big. red bandana
handkerchief and practiced before a
mirror getting on that peaky wad of
color, till we rubbed the skin oft our
right knee cap. (It was to be an alle-:
gorfcal proposition of Indians and wig
wams and things, based, we are afraid,
on the popular song philosophy of In
dian wooing.) We essayed to eat but
couldn't, and after a few nerve settlers,
took the outward tracks and made the
parlor with all our impedimenta.
If we had known as much a3 we
know now. Jimmy, we would have
known that our nerve was gone am!
postponed the thing. But along about
twelve out we lugs the big greaser
blanket and carefully .spreads it out
upon the floor. She began to giggle.
Jimmy, we were never in it after that
giggle. That giggle cooked us. A girl
who giggles is hopeless. Pull up your
stakes, and take the back track to the
buckwheat blooms.
The whole tableau miscarried. It
was supposed to be representative of
a buck Indian, a la the pop, songs above
referred to, sitting outside the tepee
of his lady-love waiting for her an
swer. She giggled more and more. The
gobs of sweat beaded our classical
brow and the steam put our glassea
out of commission. She had taken off
her hat and laid It beside her upon the
settee. It dipped to the floor, unbe-,
knowns to me. And. Jimmy, by the
great horn spoon, when we finally got
our stiff knee crooked so we could
kneel down, we had got our directions
mixed, and I'm a living lie If I didn't
land on the pet flounce of that brand
new Easter bonnet.
We -were plugging a prosaic type
writer those days at the phenomenal
wage of fifty per month. We never
saw the girl again, but we did see ii
milliner's bill for twenty-five. There
you have our life history, Jimmy. Take
It for the example it affords you.
BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE, don't try any
original proposals. Take her aside
and say to her:
thousand legged bus. Maybe you know
them, too. ' -Well, this proposal game
is a bug of a thousand legs. Every
man has got to pick out his own leg.
There are seldom two men who pick
out the same one. Speaking about
originality reminds me. We have gone
the route twice â both times quite orig
inally. We think that is whtre wÂ«
made our big misplay. We will hand
you ours, and let you judge for your
self.-
We hand you first our most signally
unsuccessful run. Maybe we made too
much of a joke of it. for yon must
understand. Jimmy, that the girls are
awfully strong on crumpling up in

provocation. We didn't try that graft

think -that's where we made our mis

We gave her this: "For God's sake

Tvhcst only exercise- is that C'f more or

hoiffback. mi!ch can be done in the way
cf mi:scu!ar development by very light
exercir.es. provided they are regular and
rysicir.:Uic ami faithfully followed.
I have rocectiy ui!UcJ with Professor
MlchUnc on this rubjret. Arid be proved
tv my satisfaction how littla exercise it
reciii'.rv'i to make a woman's arm more
muicuiar cr.C at tlie same time more
ena^ely.
Of course th^rt- nrc many women v.-ho
r.cltjicr indulge in nor ezre for athletics
In any way, but still athletic^ outdoor
wom*:i are much more in evidence now
ttein !n former years. And what- is
ch"s*fly notk-cable is that they are "ar
riving" at tlie very lop of many athletic
fcjicrts.
Witness Miss May S-tton. the world's
chimpion *t t^nr.i-;! And witness also
her opponents and rivals, a'l of them
very hard 10 beat at that most strenuous
game:
In tennis, in golf, in ridlns and in all
outdoor ypoi is in which women can join
It is chiefly the arm muscles that are
brought into play, and although it has
been said that women have no biceps
muscle, yet it is certain that in outdoor
tports they bold their own with their
rr.a.!e companions.
Exercise Is a pood thing fcr every one
end should not be Heplected. For gen
eral health, the best exercise in the world
Is what is called "Involuntary exercise,"
ei-.d by that is meant the exercise that is
Incidental to duties or to games, in which
one's interest Is absorbed, undisturbed by
any attention to the m*Tc exercise which
forniK a part of them.
The hunter will walk all day after
gamf, covering perhaps many m:les. but
very likely nothing would have induced
him to tramp a quarter of the same dis
tance as a constitutional exercise.
VÂ£ry few women hunt, but a good many
p!ay tennis, gclf and even hand ball, all
of which games tend to develop the mus
cles cf the arm. Professor Miehling says
that s. woman's arm is much more beau
tifuj fcr being used and developed.
"The best developed arm among Amer
ican* women to-dny," sa'.d Professor
Miehling, "is Mirs May Sutton's."
There are not many men who have the
physical strength and endurance to play
tennis as continuously and as strongly as
the three Sutton sisters have been doing
thie summer. They ail piay v.ith sleeves
rolled back, with entire disregard for the
power <>f the sun and wind, and as a
consequence their arms are tinted a fine
bronze ccior. but the flesh is as firm and
htrd as a rock.
The development of a woman's arm Is,
of course, different from that of the mas
culine arm. There aie no bulging or pro
trudir.g muscles, such as are shown in
pictures cf the arms of prizefighters, but
tHerfc is eimply a firm, rounded arm,
shapely and full, but the firmness and
eclidity or the flesh give it as much power
ts !s to be found In many men's arms
whose ii:uscles are lairly. prominent.
Te-iirtis naturally develops one arm more
thÂ»n the other, as rncst 2l! the play is
nec>sfcarily with the right arm, but that
Is true of almost any outdoor sport, al
though perhaps in a less degree than ten
nlK.* But the general exercise of the
who!e body in tennis develops all the
muscles in their due ;>ioportion.
JiiM> May Sutton, for example, could
rot bÂ« the strong, vigorous tennis player
that the is If one side- were unduly devel
oped and the other .-:: de dwarfed by non
use, j There is ulw.iys a great deal for
the left aim to do in tennis, and it gets
a good share of the exercise of the game.
May Sutton is short, stockily built and
with a generous waist line. She is
6traig:ht and sivÂ«.s you the impression of
can doubt it. and yet the ordinary
Rrnv of the ordinary girl seems as de
void of muscular proportion as a pillow.
The development of muscle must be by
IttCfcCS or exorcise, and systematic, not
tpssomdic and Intermittent exercise. All
athletes understand this and have a reg
ular and insistent training In all their
exercises. Women, however, are rarely
under any necessity for such training;
ex< cpt. cf course, the professional female
acrobat, whose muscles must always be
kept i:i a reliable condition of sirength
end elasticity.
TJfcllS muscles in a woman's arms!
Are they capable of Â«3cve!opment
and tnlarscjnent? Xo one who has

stumbling or slipping for her. Her alert
expression also and her bright eye give
her audience great confidence in "her abil
ity to dart after that flying ball from
one end of the court to the other.. Her
forearm is beautifully- proportioned, and
her hand, though not' large, shows great
strength. â_ "\u25a0< . .
The- game of golf, which is now , so
much in vojjue, develops the whole body,
and only incidentally the arms. The
main arm play comes in the grasp of the
club and the swing of the arms in deliv
ering the stroke. That gives the arms
splendid exercise, of course, but, the body
muscles are also brought into, fine - play.
As an outdoor game It is probably |the
most interesting as well as .the . most
healthful of all "involuntary" exercises.'
A wonderful exercise is swimming.
There is hardly a muscle- in the whole
body that la not brought into play, more
or lesft. In swimmingâ and Â«.ue legs quits
as much as the arms. Unfortunately,
however, swimming is, riot often conve
nient or practicable, and in 'public tanks
it Is frequently not agreeable.
Of course the most desirable of Jill ex
orcise Is to be found in outdoor "games,
like golf and tennis. but sometimes
rc-ithcr is .practicable a:ul we have to
turn to mcc'han'.cal devices like dumb
bells, Indian clubs, home gymnastics or
regular gymnasium work. Professor
Miehling tells me that- women with
scrasvny arms that show no muscle at 'all
will in a very short* time develop-well
rounded, firm and strong arms by taking
a course of exercise on the parallel bars.
"They are always afraid to begin," said
ths professor, '"but they soon learn to do
stunts. . ' \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 ' c
"I go down 10 Burlingame once or twice
a week," he continued, "to give private
lessons there to ladies who want to de
velop fine figures and firm, well-rounded
arms."
I asked him. then, what sort of exer
cises he gave tltem.
"Oh. all kinds of stunts." he answered,
"punching the bag, swinging Indian
clubs, practicing the dumbbells and all
kinds of exercise to build them up, and fill
out their chests and arms."
He told me of one charming woman in
Burlingame with whom he has had great
success. " She had betn an invalid for
some time and had oeen taking the rest
cure.
Mr. Miehling's advice was terse and
decided.
"Drop it all. 1 ' he said, "and exercise."
Following this advice, she has been ex
ercising now for about. three years, and
now she punches the bag vigorously, and
swings Indian clubs beautifully.
An idea is prevalent among ladies t..at
exercise of this kind spoils the shape of
the hands, by enlarging the joints and
the knucklesâ but It is a mistake.

Rowing is an outdoor exercise which is
now believed to be unwise for women to \u0084
â¢ indulge in, . though a. great many, women
practice it In iumrncr, with the Idea of
developing the muscles of the -arms. â¢* But
the cramped position of >the, body'is un-'

'really comes more in the backhand

JOTTINGS OF OLD LIM JUCKLIN
ON
TANNHAUSER
OPIE READ
<^Tf BPRING freshet and the wash
f\ ing. away of a railroad brldg<
J I poured out an opera company
I upon the country town. Soon
X was spread about the news that
the manager was going to give a per
formance of "Tannhauser." There was
great excitement. No town of this size
had ever been so distinguished. Surelj
th^.rain had come as a favor of thÂ«
gods to the village of Purdy. And how
fondJy the community loved music! 1<
c^ould boast of many of the most active
and tireless fiddlers In the State. Its
Blnging societies were numerous, and it
was not unusual to find a lad of lo
that -had mastered the entire system
of "buckwheat" notes. At " church it
was given out that the opera was to'bt
enacted and sung on the following
Tuesday night. Tom Balch, president
of the North Run Harmony Club, rods
about the neighborhood selling tickets
So great was the interest of the house
wife that in several Instances eggs
were, exchanged for pasteboard. Ah, at
last the people were to be enlivened
and elevated by that great harmony so
often spoken of in the newspapers. Old
Brizintine bought a ticket. He swore
that there was not a man in the neigh
borhood that could catch a tune quicker
than he. He never went to a revival
that he didn't come away whistling a
hymn. Once a flatboat concert company
had tied up at a landing on his farm.
He had not charged the company for
the use of his land. He was more than
paid in music One of the company
could sing high or low, just as the
case might be; and his imitation of a
foxhound beat anything ever heard' in
that part of the country. Dan Mahoney
had heard it five miles away, iand old
Steve Hortner, two miles distant, had
run to his door in the hope that "he
mrght see the fox. I reckon this
company's got one to beat him all hol
low," said Brizintine. .; . _
"1 don't know," replied the postmas
ter. "Here comes old LlmueL. Maybe
he can tell us somethin' about it.V
Jucklin came up, took a scat on
the horse-block, democracy's, common
throne, told a boy to look out or he might
hurt himself running along, shoving a
stick in front of him, and then inquired
of Brislntine-tf he were goings to' the
opera.
"Me? Well, I've got my credentials
right here." Briz answered. "Couldn't
keep me away with a ten-foot pole. And
as eocn as I hearn that they were goin'
to give us a chance to taste their fruit,
1 says to my wife, says I, 'Emerllne,
that means me. I haven't paid much
attention to these circuses, and I stayed
home one night and shelled a turn of
corn rather than go to the minstrels,
but when they come with , the, grand
opery, that means me.' That's what I
said to her."
"Is your wife a-goin' with you?" Lim
inquired.
"Well, no; she 'lowed she'd take her
money and buy a new pair of quiltin*
frames. She's a smart woman, Lim. but
she don't care" particular for music. I
used to blow a flute before I a lost so
many of my teeth, and she always -told
me I'd better be a plowin'. It fretted
me at first, but we can't all be artistic
You like music, don't you,' Lim?"
"I lick it up the same as molasses.
Music is the syrup of the mind. It is
energy gone to sleep, a - dreamln*. If
the soul is like a rose, music is the
perfume."
â¢"I'm glad to hear you say that. Lim,"
Briz replied. "Me and you don't always
agree, but when It comes .to the great
principles we stand putty much on the
fame platform. Now some folks ain't
educated up to high music. . But .it
don't make no difference to me how
high they sing. I can st^nd ou tiptoe
and reach the notes. I'll drap by for
you. Lim, and we'll go. together.'
Never in an expectant .neighborhood
did time move slower. But Tuesday
dawned and night finally spread , over
the earth. Old Lim and Briz were In
front of the hall door an hour and a
half before it was opened. Mrs. Juck-
Hn had refused. to come. "I have hearn
about them ballets and that high kick
in';' and. Â«?uch carryin's on don't mix
well with the church," she. had said. "If
Limuel wants .to forget that, life's se
rlous.'let'hlm.. I'll have none 0t.1t."
. When the - door wa? -opened the nar
row , stairway was instantly .jammed.
Every seat. in. the house was taken. , In
the , aisle a. rocking, chair was placed
for. tl)Â§. County Judge. When every one
had " been -seated he,
fountain of- wisdom^ arose rind declared
that he desired to say. something. "We
are assembled for a purpose," raid. he.
This sage reniark evoked not a murmur.
"Wo are .here," said he, "not. to honor,
but to be- honored. The opera we are
\o koo and lira? tp-nighi will. I have no
doubt, ostablish Itself, as a- favor

our : young-ladies will be playing it on
their melbdeons. ' I ' move three; cheers

There was no orchestra. '.Sam. Buck,
fiddler, liad offered his .services, ibut a3

THERE was a flash, so blinding that
Dr. Tom Howard closed hi? eyts.
J and the horse threw up his h*ad
| with a whinny of terror: then a!-
A most Instantly canie a crash as^of
a thousand cannon, which rolled across
the mountains in a reverberation of re
ceding echoes. After that all was as it
had been beforeâ inky black!
- Dr. . Tom bent his face to~" avoid the
elant of rain, at the same time touching
the horse's back encouragingly wittr liis
jiand. But they could fc-o no faster, as
he knew, for the horse was pk-kiijg. 1113
way down Hie mountain side step by
step, with nose forward as though smell
ing the way, and with ears alert for
sounds that might indicate their course.
Ahead were patients who might be
needing him. "to whom his coming might
be the 'difference between life and death.
Henceforth his life must be his wbrjt,
his patients were not to be divided even
with* the girl be had hoped to make his
wife. At first he had thought she would
reconsider, relent; but her sudden de
parture, without note or explanation, liad
meant it was to be the end. He did not
even know .to what part of the world
she had gone. ..,'.,;- V- ;
He had already been away from -home
twenty-four hours, on a journey of forty
miles into the mountains to save a man
who had been accidentally shot; and
now, against the advice of hardy,moun
taineers, was forcing his way back in
the very teeth of one of ths fierce hill
slqrmaJ ' . /
From time to time his hand went back
to pat tlie horses back encouragingly,
and at every contact . of tlie ( hand. the
horse startc-d forward a little more
briskly, in an effort to please him, only
to return almost Instantly, however,, to
the ' slow, cautious gait, as .If realizing
that it whs. absolutely necessary to their
safety. Soon there ' came another blind
ing flash, even as the hand once-more
dropped upon j the . flank, and Dr. Tom's
fucÂ«s â¢ blanched a little, for directly in
front of them >a3 a yawning flssure. \u25a0
Aftertha.f, for. a time, he allowed the
horse to choose the* way, with the reins
hanging loosely across his -neck. The
horse's npse. and ears.and instinct were
safrr thun th'e jnan's impatience. More
than once a lightning's flash revealed a
black'holo "lii* front or to one side,, 'with
jagged, precipitous slopes rising or fall
ing beyond; j but always .-under. â¢ the
horse's careful . feet, was firm \u25a0 footing,
sometimes a narrow shelf scarcely
wider ; than was necessary, for them Jto
p'ais,- Bomctinies a 'declivity,' so steep
that the animal's ' haunches almost
touched. the rock as he picked his way
down/ But the-prbgress was slow, slow
â^criminally slow It skeined to. the im
patient doctor,' who wanted to be' at his
work. ' -.- . , iXf.i'' '":'/'\u25a0 X \u25a0 '"'â¢"\u25a0
\u25a0Presently, from brief glimpses obtain-*
ed in the flashings, he,- realized they
were swerving far/ out of their course,
and \he caught ; up .the reins '.with -a
quick.'determined grasp.
Obediently the .horse^turiied back' to
ward the straight, line; but a few min
utes later,; when another flaohcame, he
was heading* in tne : oldjdlrectlon. Again
he was turned, sharply/ and 'again he
went on In Â»; straight 'course, for ii few
\u0084 steps, only; to swerve once! jrioire toThfs
' chosen way in the inky. blackness which
followed the flashings.
, Again arid: again "did Dr. Toni. swing

. impatience . and \u25a0 harshness, â¢ 'and 'just as
\u25a0; often ' did . the \u25a0 horse, swerve /promptly

Gradually, above the roaring of the
storm, there, had been rising. "another

Tom drew a quick breatii, and .his. hand

- Soups Without Meat
In Koman Catholic France these
form a part of Friday's dinner the
year round, and play a more impor
tant part than fish in lenten bills of
fare. , In America we knov? so little
of them that the general prejudice
against themâ especially among the
laboring classes, to whom practical
acquaintance with them would seem
to be essential â is almost excusa
ble. One Xc*a t Tersey farmer whose
muscles were toughened by salt pork
of his own curing, eaten at least
three hundred days in the year, de
scribed meatless soup as "slops with
no 'taste into them." His opinion
was based upon the products of his
wife's manufacture.
The soup maigre, properly made,
is wholesome, palatable and cooling
to systems already, overcharged with
caloric.

IN WHAT street-singers and
college boys glorify as "The
Good Old Summer Time/ let
tender broils, savory ragouts
and casseroles take the place of
heavy roasts. An eight-pound rib
roast of beef diffuses as much heat
as an oil btove, and gives forth
steam as well as a goodly smell. Yet
cold meats are neither so palatable,
nor to most stomachs so digestible
as warm.
Broiled Chops
Broil on a gridiron over a bright fire.
Put a little salt and pepper upon each
chop, and butter them before they go
to table.
Lay them, overlapping one another.
t around a mound of green peas or mash
ed potatoes.
Broiled Veal Cutlets
Rub the cutlets well with melted but
ter, pepper, and broil on a gridiron like
beefsteak, buttering very well after
dishing. Be sure that they are thor
oughly done.
Baked Broiled Chicken
Really young fowls are necessary for
this dish. Split down the back when
you have cleaned and washed them. Lay
them Hat on the grating of your roaster,
skin side down, and put into a very hot
oven, covered. Have ready half a cup
ful of melted butter, and after live min
utes baste the chickens well with this.
Turn them as soon as the inside has
colored slightly: baste again with but
ter; when nearly done dredge thickly
with flour and wash again with butter.
When they are brown and the flesh is
tender in the joints, they are done. Thir
ty minutes should be sufficient. Baste
frequently, and as soon as they are
browned you may add a little hot wa
ter to the butter.
Take up the chickens and keep them
hot, thicken the gravy with browned
flour, and boil one minute before pouring
into a boat.
Casseroles
Casseroles may be bought now at any
crockery store. They are covered dish
es of are-proof pottery, highly glazed
and more or less ornamental.
Casserole of Lamb's Liver and
Rice
Boil a cupful of rice in a quart of wa
ter until soft. Dip into this rice two
tablcspooufuls of butter and salt and
pepper to taste. Line a well-greased
casserole \yiih the mixture, pressing
firmly against bottom and sides, and
leaving a hollow in the centre. Set in a
cold place until stiff, and firm. Mean
while, boil a pound of lamb's liver, drain
and chop line, lieat in a saucepan two
cupfuls of soup stock, season with a
teasyoopfulof kitchen bouquet, thicken
with browned Hour und stir into this
sauce the minced liver. Fill the hollow
in the centre ot the rice with the liver
mixture, sprinkle with bread crumbs and
Eet in the oven to brown.
Apple Casserole
Select large, smooth, tart apples of
good flavor and of uniform size. Re
move core with corer. Mince . cold
chicken line, season with salt, a dash
of cayenne, pinch of powdered thyme,
one-half cuptul of breadcrumbs, moist
ened with three or four teaspoonfuls
of sweet cream. Fill each apple and
bake in oven.
Chicken En Casserole
Select a plump spring chicken, clean
It and truss it as for roasting. Place
in a casserole two tabiespoouf uls of but
ter, a carrot and an onion (both cut into
slices), two bay leaves and a sprig of
thyme. Set the casserole on the top of
the stove for about -ten minutes, or un
til the vegetables are lightly browned
in the butter. Pour In then a pint of
.well-seasoned consomme, cover the cas
serole closely, put it into the oven, and
braise the chicken for three-quarters of
an hour. If it is not young and tender
it will require longer. Ten minutes be
fore the time is up add two tablespoon
fuls of cherry or madeira, and cover
again. At the end of the three-quarters
of an hour drop into the gravy a dozen
or more email potato balls, which have
been cut from the raw potato with a
Parisian cutter and then browned, , or
raute in butter. At the same time add
an equal number of French champig
nons. Season the gravy with pepper
and salt, and leave the cover off the
casserole, that the chicken may brown.
This should take ten or fifteen minutes.

IN ADVANCE of any cleaning, if pos

.house unless you are quite willing to
pay to have places cleaned several
times over, before you begin to live in

Have Everything Ready When Furniture Arrives
THE NEW HOME AND SUCGES . IDN3 FOR ITS PREPARATION
MISS M. E. CARTER
The closet of each room should be swept
out, and the shelves wiped tirst with
a damp. then, with a dry cloth. ;
The secret of rapid cleaning Is not to
allow dust or trash to. tpread again or
. be scattered while the work proceeds.
In a room of ordinary size the sweep
ings should^ be taken .tip. at least live
times," yiz: at- the four corners and in
the middle of each loom. Any common
box, of light weight, answers this pur
pose. -Each sweeper .sr.ould have one
beside her. â¢ If mo appropriate box can
he had, large newspapers, folded and
pinned to form bags, are useful. They
have one advantage, because, when
iilled. they: can be tied up firmly and
sent directly to the trash-can without
being - emptied. This keeps undesirable
stuff from being, scattered below or out
side-when the garbage coiltcior- takes it
away.v - --'â¢-'
WHITE CLOTHS FOR DUSTIKG
After ths first sweeping is done the
â¢walls, ceilings, door and window tops
should be freed from dust. For wails
and ceilings use-a broom covered with
a very -clean white canton tlannel.bag
or else a piece. of canton .flannel pinned
firmly over it. Always use white clotlu
or bags so that they will show the tirst
soil. Change them frequently, because
using, a.; dusty cloth defeats the objsct
to be attainedâ cleanliness. By. manage
ment' this work may. be Uor.e with' a
moderate supply of broom covers. The
soiled covers can be left to soak in a
tub of boraxed water and occasionally
washed out and hung to dry while the
clean ones are in use. By this method
there will always be clean dry covers
ready to take the places of soiled ones.
The door "and window tops should be
very carefully wiped with a damp cloth
and a dustpan held unuer to catch any
dust that might otherwise escape the
cloth and fall into the room. Window
fnimes should be wiped in the same way
before any glass is" washed. When once
the entire house has been gone over in
this way the formidable dirt will be
outside, and people can then go about
without ruining their clothes. _ Un
methodical, heedless cleaning, so-called,
lias spoiled the clothes and the disposi
tions of a good many people. Before the
shade-hangers arrive all windows should
be washed and polished and. the win
dow sills and ledges sponged with clean
water. . This warning â¢- may seem super
fluous to some of my readers, but I have
seen beautiful sash-curtains of delicate
silk put over windows that had after
ward to be washed. for the tirst time,
in a .new house. This made handling
the curtains and their removal imme
diately necessary before the wirfdow
cleaning. No nice manager would allow
such topsy-turvy doings if given time
to plan the order of the furnishing.
. After the important preliminaries have
been attended to. all regular and lighter
cleaning can be pushed forward, accord
ing to the wishes and the convenience
of the housewife and the .special needs
of the expected family.
CHOOSING a frame that will suit
both the picture and the room It
Is to go in is almost a3 important
a point in house decoration as the
careful choosing of pictures themselves.
Money hasn't anything to do with It.
More houses are made beautiful by
a few v.-ell-chosen. appropriately framed
photographs than la more expensive
ways.
Of course, if you've plenty of money,
and the necessary accompaniment of
artistic taste, you'll indulge in originals,
and in rare old Japanese prints, and en
gravings and etchings that are worth a
small fortune in themselves.
Parlors and drawing rooms require
rather more elaborate â more formal
frames and pictures than any of the
other rooms. .Here, if you've oil paint
ings, they are sure to oe hung, framed
in the deep gold frames that bring out
the quality of oil colors as no other
frames can. Perhaps, if it's a very pre
cious bit. it is set in a sort of casÂ«
frameâ a polished wooden frame, deep
enough to take -in deep gold frame and
all. and hold a glass over it to keep off
dust.
Photographs are so often misframed.
in spite of the rule some one who knew
the art of framing well laid downâ to
ketp to the simplest sort of frames. The
warm brown tones of the carbon prints
are better brought out. In most cases,
by a dull brown frame, and the soft
grays by gray, or black, or perhaps the
merest line of gold.
Scenes nearly always look better
framed with wide frames, or with a le
gitimate equivalentâ a wide mat which
tones In with a narrow frame.
SHADED FRAMES
Photographs of dark, strong picturesâ
Rcmbrandts. for instance â neÂ«d treat
ment that will I lighten them a little.
So sometimes they are mounted on,
Rembrandt matsâ shaded from a light
corner over into a much deeper tone,
or perhaps the frame shades, almost
imperceptibly, yet enough to throw the
picture into strong relief. .
Neapolitan frames have gone outâ
that is. In wood. They're still to bo
found among the better sort of pic
tures; those tiny color bits of classic
subject looking better in the carved,
frames covered with sold leaf than la
anything else. * ;
But the plain woods carved in the
fashion termed Neapolitan were neither
handsome enough for a finer picture
nor simple enough for a photograph.
Flat wide frames â oval or square, som-Â»
of them dull-looking things, almost rus
tic in characterâ prove the very thins
often for a quiet little scene.
For the fancy beads, like the-Greuze
beads and the Countesa Potocka and the
rest of the exquisite beads that every
body knows and loves, frames just a lit
tle bit trimmed are better â some of gold,
with rounded corners and a tiny bead
. ing all around, suiting the styles per
haps best of all.
Miniatures demand the most delicate
sort of treatment, and. from a practi
cal, standpoint, frames absolutely dust
proof. Gold frames, or gold mountings.
at least, are almost demanded by the
ivory most of them are printed on.
Wood frames, in dozens of widths,
come in a hundred tints of brown and.
gray, and even of blackâ the different
high polish and dull polish and no pol
ish at all making still more distinctions
of color. / \u25a0 *- \u25a0â¢''' \u25a0
The darker frames â where both pic
ture and mat are dark as. wellâ should
be used very sparingly about a house,
except for hall or library or dining
room Even in a sitting room, they are
likely to be heavy, whiie for bedrooms
they are inexcusable, and for parlors
not" handsome enough.

ALMOST everywhere you will hear
," people saying farming docs not
Â£Pay, and this in spite of the fact
that*there is a never-ending de
mand for butter, eggs, poultry, vege
tables, etc., all of which must be raised
on a farm.
Anybody can make money on a farm
If the proper training has been "received,"'
of course assuming that the farm is
clear of debt arid no large interest
charges to be met. There are different
branches of farm work. Horticulture
affords endless variety, and the same
maybe said^f kitchen gardening,- which
can be carried on on a ten-acre plot, of
land. ; Some women make money .with
early vegetables; others turn the little
farm into a dairy; some raise poultry
and " eggar, which, combined with other
branches, isj an:' important factor In.
making money from a farm. Bee-keep
ing Is 'also a' satisfactory' source of i'n

Raising products is only part of: the
business of farming. * To find a good
market for them is another thing. This
can only be .learned by experience, as
much, depends upon the" cbnditioria un
der which the grower lives and the fa
cilities for transportation offered. :'. 5
Science in .Farming.
I-.would not advise a novice. to under
take farming; but many "women raised
on farms are.- left to do the best they
can.'with ascertain equipment, and such
should bend their energies to turning" it
into a means of livelihood rather than
to drift into something they know noth
ing about. If it is', pbssjble^ Immense
advantage can be derived from*attend
ing an agricultural cchool arid carrying
the. knowledge obtained" inerejn> to >the
management of the tarm. If this is Im
possible,-the next best thing to do is Ho
secure the books used In these schools.

wrapped in oiled paper and reached the

AX ORDINARILY bright baby
three months old will recognize
his mother, or _.; nurse, and will
'smile and "coo" when she .ap
proaches; he will also hold his head up
quite steadily If his back is supported,
and will often reach out his hand for a
bright object. \u25a0 .
His sense of touch is now quite acute
and he Is often particular about the
temperature of his food, refusing to take
It, if it Is a little too, cold or too hot.
Now," for the first time, the tear glands
become active, and the baby cries with
tears.
If the infant weighed seven and a
half pounds at birth he should now
weigh eleven or twelve pounds; but if he
falls a little below this average weight
there Is no cause for worry, as lons as
his gain is" steady.
At the end of the third, month the flan
nel,band may be discarded and a ribbed
knit one used in its place. One which has
shoulder straps is a* 11. tie! better than
one without, for the band Is not so apt
to slip out of place, and then, In in
tensely hot summer 'weather,' it may at
times serve as a shirt as well as a band.
It Is safer to leave a shirt off on a very
hot day than it is to leave off the band,
which fits more inugly and protects the
abdomen, where lie the delicate organs
of digestion. The band should be of wool
in winter arid silk and wool in summer.
It should be put on over the child's feet,
not" over his head, when he is. dressed
'each morning, and be changed for a
fresh one at night. \u25a0
A perfectly healthy baby born In win
ter: may : ,begin to go out of. dqors'ln
March,' if the days are mild, but. he
should not be 'taken out in a cold,
strong wind. .Begin by letting him stay
out for half ah hour in the warmest part
of the day,;- then an hpur, etc., until he
becomes accustomed to the outdoor air.
Never take a young baby out wh*n
there is much melting snow on the
ground, or when the thermometer is be
low 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Let him take
his airing In the house Instead on such
days.
A comfortable bafcy carriage is better
for the child than to be carried In the
mother's or -nurse's anna, for he can bÂ«
kept warmer. It is really economy to
buy a good-sized, substantial baby car
riage. The English make is best on ac
count of the hood, which protects thÂ«
child from the wind-
While the child i 3 so young he should
He out 3tralght on ' a heavy, folded
blanket, or hair pillow, having a small,
thin pillow under his head; near his feet
should be a hot- water bag; a light wool
en blanket or afghan should be put into
the carriage and the baby placed upon It.
then it should be carefully wrapped
around him, and the outer carriage robe
tucked in. These wraps may be modified
to suit the weather. Babies who lie on
one fur rug and. are covered by another
are apt to be in a dripping perspiration
most of the time/ and hence take cold
very easily. .
If the carriage has a parasol, It should
be lined with green and' adjusted so as
to keep the sun out of the child's face.
"When crossing the street let the carriage
gently down on the back wheels first,
and this win prevent a sudden Jerking
forward of the baby's body. There is no
harm in allowing the baby to sleep out
of doors in cold weather, if he is kept
warm.
In cold weather the baby's cloak
should be lined with flannel or lamb's
wool, and his cap should have a flannel
llnln? also. On his hands he should
wear woolen mittens. A veil is not
necessary, and 13 often very uncomfort
able, as It gets wet by the baby** Uds
or by his sucking it. If be is protected
by the parasol, that Is all that is' neces
sary.
What He Should Eat at Three Months.
His Clothes and Carriage
But the white paper is considered In
the very best taste. The surface may be
either the smooth vellum finish or the
rougher linen, as preferred, but the
quality must be good, not flimsy and
cheap. Letter paper -is so inexpensive
nowadays that even the woman of very
modest means should experience no diffi
culty in getting proper stationery.
Never, under" any circumstances,- use"
ruled paper. Â»This Is intended only for
little children, and should be discarded
Just as soon as one has learned to write
properly. Square envelopes are always
in good taste, and at present .fashion
sanctions the use also of envelopes a
little longer than they are square for
friendly correspondence. - It-used to be
the custom to have ciphers, crests or
monograms emblazoned in gay colors on
the note paper, but at present these are
little used, and it' is considered in better
form to have simply. the address of the
city residence or the name of the coun
try place printed, either in black or col
ors, about three-fourths of an inch from
the top. either In the centre of the sheet
or at the right-hand corner. 'This is a
very sensible and convenient custom, es
pecially for the dwellers In large cities,
where addresses are difficult to .remem
ber. : A glance at the stationery at once
shows the whereabouts of the corre
spondent. â¢ â¢ .'
When addressed paper is not used,,
and its use. although tnbst convenient
and fashionable, is not at all obligatory,
the address of the sender of -the note
or letter'is; generally written' in the up
per right-hand corner of the note' paper,
and the date written from the left-hand
corner of the last sheet at the enO- of
the letter, directly after the signature.
Whether or not letters should be sealed
with scaling wax is simply a matter of .
personal preference. Fashion sanctions
the custom; but it Is no longer consid
ered. nec'rs3ary to" fasten up one's letters
In this way; Somepcople always do, it,
howpver. Impressing a. small monogram
or crest into the hot wax. This is
perfectly correct, if one cares each time
a note is written to take ; the . trouble
it eiitails,- but most of us. consider our
selves too busy to do so. â¢

V "-p^HEy say in painstaking Germany
y 1 that Americans are too busy
* studying all sorts of fads and
"'ologks" to learn how to write
their own language correctly. A gen
tleman in Berlin once gravely informed
me that most of our women did not
even know enough to properly punctu
ate their notes and letters. And in proof
of this sweeping statement he showed
me an epistle from his niece bearing
the postmark of one of our large West
ern cities. "Just look at that!" he said.
There Is not a paragraph or a comma
in the whole four pages, and hardly a
period. What do you learn over there
in place of punctuation?"
I stood up valiantly for my country
women right or wrong, as an Ameri
can abroad feels somehow in honor
bound to do. 1 tried to explain that as
one swallow docs not make a summer,
neither is it quite fair to place the
shortcomings of one young. woman up
on the shoulders of a whole nation.
But, nevertheless, there was some truth
in what bÂ« said, and the episode gave
me food lor thought. I remembered
the absolutely correct, if somewhat stiff
ep.'i stilted, notes of the cultivated G-er
rnuo;. ana 1 bejan to wonder If. after
aJ!. our educators quite realized what
an important part in life letter writing
really plays.

The active executive head of the club
for the past Beven years has been Mrs.
Frank H. Mason, wife of the United
States Consul General, who is first vice
president of the organization. As presid
ing officer, parliamentarian and extem
pore speaker Mrs. Mason is exceedingly
gifted. Her lieutenants In the active
management of the club's varied interests
are Zlrs. Mary Honan, wife of the resi
dent American physician. Dr. John H.
Honan: Miss Mathilde Molt, Mrs. John
Clevc-Symmes. Mrs. George O, Watson
and Mrs. S. H. McFadden. Several of
these women were among the club's
founders, their husbands being long-time
resident American business men in Berlin.
The directress of the club is Miss Ellen A.
Hunt, an American university woman of
rare executive talent. She resides on the
club premises and gives personal atten
tion to the varied details of routine man
agement.
The cardinal purpose of the club is to
be a rallylng-grour.d for American women
resident In Berlin, either as preslders
over homes or as students. The Ameri
can woman student element Is always
large. At the conservatories, art academ
ies and university there are never lees
than several hundred of them. The club
affords them dormitory accommodations
The president of . the ' American
\u25a0Women's Club Is, by unwritten law, al
ways the wife of the United States Em
bassador to the Kaiser's court. At
present the office Is ably filled by Mrs.
Charlemagne Tower, who has through
her cleverness and regal entertaining
&iven American diplomacy in Germany
the most brilliant social representation
it has ever experienced. Not even the
flittering functions of the Russian,
Austrian. British and Italian embassies
excel the banquets, and balls at the
Tower palace In the Koenigs-Platz.

BERLIN, Aug. 12. â In the heart of
the "District of Columbia" â as the
American residential quarter of Berlin
is amusingly known â stands the build-
Ing- In which the American Women's
Club of Berlin Is housed, an Institution
â¢which enjoys the privilege of having
been the first woman's club ever or-
B-anlred In the Kaiser's realm, and is
to-day the most typical, essentially
American woman's organization In Eu
rope.
There are societies of Yankee women
and girls In London and Paris, but they
pursue either social pleasures or special
aims like art and music. The American
Women's Club of Berlin lays claim to
being not only serious in purpose, but
comprehensive In scope, and around 'it
Is rallied all that Is best in the ener
getic, extensive American life of the
German capital. Founded eleven years
aero, primarily as a charity-relief asso
ciation, "with a girl students 1 auxiliary,
the club .several years since outgrew
the humble suite of two or three rooms
which served as a "clubhouse" and now
occupies three full floors In one of the
massive stone-front apartment houses
In the smart Kleist strasse. Within a
radius of half a mile not less than 3000
Americans are encamped, either as per
manent residents of Berlin or as mem
bers of the ever-fluctuating: colony of
students, tourists and other transients,
here for periods varying from weeks to
years. Two blocks away from the club
Is another monument to the vigorous
American element In Berlin â the hand
t.orr.e $100,000 Gothic American church,
built by sons and daughters of Colum
bia who have resided In Berlin off and
on during: the past thirty years.
Two women who . now live In America
were active supporters of the club and
contributed largely to its flourishing pres
ent and promising futureâ Mrs. Andrew
D. White, wife of the former Embassa
dor to Berlin and ex-president of Cor
nell University, and Mrs. Marq Bannister
Willard of Chicago, sister-in-law of
Frances Willard. Mrs. Willard founded
the "Willard School for American Girls,"
which Is still in existence in Berlin and,
under the euidance of Dr. Alice Luce,
gives promise of perpetuating the suc
cessful career enjoyed under its founder.
Money for special purposes is raised by
giving: of bazaars and concerts. From
such sources the hard-working women ot
the club have realized money enough to
purchase and own a magnificent * club
house equipment. Including a couple of
grand pianos, an extensive * reading and
reference library and an attractive col
lection of rugs and bric-a-brac. To step
from the heavily furnished German
"hausfrau's" home Into the premises of
the American Women's Club In Kleist
strasse is to step into a typical Ameri
can house, wafted as If by magic across
the water into the heart of the, Fathe
rland.
The cultivation of the German lan
guage Is one of the club's most ardently
pursued alms. It has a special lecturer
on German literature and art, whose ad
dresses are at the disposal of girl stu
dents without extra charge. The club is
self-supporting. Its income is limited to
the moderate membership fees solicited
from resident women ($2 50 a year) and
from girl students (U 25 a year). For
this trifle, members have access to all
the club's facilities and privileges with
out exception. When the "intellectual
season" at the university and- conserva
tories swells the number of students in
town, the club roll-call often totals six
or seven hundred names.
Every Saturday evening during the win
ter season the club's energetic enter
tainment committee arranges a literary
or musical evening for its members and
guests. Periodically men are admitted at
these "salons," especially when, as fre
quently happens, men are on the even-
Ing's programme as singers, players or
speakers. A number of the noted Ameri
cana who have visited Berlin during the
past few years have addressed the club,
which throws open Its forum to the dis
cussion of the widest possible number of
topicsâ intellectual, philanthropic,' artis
tic, etc.
;.':' SELF SUPPORTING.
to a limited degree, the use of a library
and music-room, a dining-room, assembly
rooms for meetings, etc., while a gym
nasium is among the innovations now in
process of arrangement. An information
bureau, where reliable hints as to board
ing-houses, teachers, shopping facilities,
etc., are to be had, is among the most
valuable features of the clubhouse. Many
ambitious girls come here to study with
out either parents or relatives, and the
club successfully "mothers" many of
these, who would otherwise be strangers
in a strange land, and subject to all the
pitfalls of foreign life.

PARIS, Aug. 12. â For 90 cents Jean
Tabean, a 12-year-old shepherd boy, has
been induced to commit a horrible mur
der In the Jura. The instigator of the
crime, who paid him the money, was
actually the mother of his victim, a
little girl of 5; years: 6 months. The
child's body, completely naked, was
found by a peasant in a pond near his
farm. The shepherd boy employed by
the farmer was questioned and even
tually made a clean breast of the crime.
Jean related quite coolly that the
mother of the dead, child, had "twice
offered him 6 francs if he would drown
her little girl." He had twice refused,
but last Saturday there was a fair in
the village and he "decided to commit
the crime in order to have the money
for amusing himself." While minding
his flock he saw the little girl playing
in a field.' He calledher, and they sat
down together by the edge of the pond.
He then pushed her into the water, but
as it was not deep she waded out. .
He told her that she had better re
move her clothes to let them dry. When
she was undressed he pushed her into
the pond again, and went In after her,
keeping her head under water with his
own hands until she was drowned. He
afterward hid the body in the rushes
and then went ; to claim the 90 cents
from the mother, spending the money
at the fair. The 12-year-old murderer
and the unnatural mother have been
arrested and are in prison at Bourg. .
The woman is a widow, who was de
termined to be rid of her youngest
child, the little girl who. was drowned,
because the latter, was illegitimate.

PARIS. Aug. 12.â Juliette Adam, known
also as Juliette Lamber, the famous au
thor of "Jean e.t Hascal," of which a new
edition has seen the light,-may be con
sidered the sworn enemy of Sergius de
Witte, the Russian peace plenipotentiary.
In a recent interview she did not hesitate
to express herself in the most disparag
ing terms regarding the Russian states
man. She said to a press representative:
De Witte is the Nemesis of Russia. He
will succeed in concluding peace, but
it will be a deplorable peace for his
country. Just now he is playing the part
of the apostle. He talks with great com
placency to the foreign papers and with
tears in his eyes he declares that he will
not conclude a shameful peace for Rus

also the soul am. .the secret head of

for the same cause he has been defending
for a long time, and will not be satisfied
until he has succeeded, in obtaining a
revolution. He has set before himself a
well-defined programme.which has already

He has already ru ned agriculture in .'Rus-'

To go through the rooms is a matter
of time and difficult steering. People
stand up, in the London fashion, a
wedged, soHd mass all over the floor
space, talking, talking, talking. Not
loudly, yet the noise is bewildering.
Dukes, Earls, Government officials, Em
bassadors, all. sorts of great people stand
and talk. The effect they produce, when
generalized. Is one of dowdiness. It â¢ia
not so much the clothes, though some of
last year's frocks suggest a belated . In
dian summer season, some coats . do not
agree with the wearer's shoulders, and
waistcoats creep over -collars, and some
dowagers wear nondescript garments
that disdain any fashion ; that ever, was
with a comfortable very
characteristic of the English, dowager.
But what chiefly producess" this effect of
dowdiness is the faces. Though the
frocks may be June all tne faces .are
late , autumnal; the fabrics are .gay
enough, but the faces are unsuitably
glum and dull: They are non-conductive,
apathetic faces. Whatever emotion stirs
the- spirit behind those faces, It leaves
the mask (if mask it be) of facial dow
diness unrelieved.

years ago, when Mrs. Chamberlain gars
a -big reception at which the present

greatly in vogue is to bring, on an in

nearly every one else brought herself,
her family and all her friends.-. It :
was a never-to-be-forgotten gathering.' '
Many people never succeeded in getting
beyond the hall door. An excellent sup

The singer also went on his usual

Is the other of Mr. O'Sullivan's
hobbies. the two -yearly musical
festivals for the preservation and
encouragement of Irish music,
which he has established and at which
he sings and proselytes yearly. For
the Irish folksong, a rich, beautiful
and most ornate literature, he has the
utmost admiration, and to save it is of
the chief purposes of the aforemention
ed festivals. As he puts It: "Every
year some poor old body dies with a
priceless tune in his old head. I'm hoping
to save some of them through the festi
vals. I tell them to whistle, hum, fiddle
the tunes, anything to save them."
Politics, however, came in for the last
word, iln this way. Skibbereen, during
the recent massacres In Russia, got
wildly excited. The London Times
thundered polite denunciations pf the
Emperor; the New York Sun deplored
his weakness; but it was the Sklbbereen
paper that declared: "Let the Czar take
warning; the Skibbereen Eagle has its
eye upon him."
And they'd had only about half an hour
to their fight. They couldn't see , the
justice of itâ l couldn't mesilf."
Mr. Daly Is not the only perron with a
new Irish play. Denis O'Sullivan brings
one, one without pugnacious hazards
however, one indeed of lively romantic
charm if the London critics are to be
credited. The play is by Patrick Bid well,
and is called "Peggy Machree." That "it
was written by a person who had not
the least knowledge of the O'Sullivan
personality" one of Its earlier and pro
vincial critics declared. Another, with
the charming: independence that charac
terizes the kind, decided that the play
was the work of a playwright who knew
his O'Sulllvan like a brother. They were
both wrong. "Patrick Bidwell" Is the
charming: wife of the actor, who, as his
dramatist, has now done everything but
"act for him" as Mr. O'Sullivan puts it.
Mrs. O'Sullivan is well known here as
\u25a0 Â»a axtlst of distinguished achievement.
6he Is perhaps better known as the ac
complished assistant of her husband,
whose outside duties in connection with
his work have been reduced to the sign
ing of an occasional check.,
Mrs. O'Sullivan came quaintly -to the
play writing. She came to the work,
to begin with, with a distinct contempt
for the artâ considerably augmented by
her success therein! It happened through
the difficulty of obtaining a good Irish
play for the fourth week of Mr. O'Sul
llvaa's last season here. Jestingly the
new dramatist said she thought she
could write a better play than those
from which the actor had to select.
"You!" Mr. O'Sullivan laughed. Like a
wise woman. Mrs. O'Sullivan said noth
ing, but going home on the steamer
"patched up" two acts of an Irish play.
"For fun" she tacked on a third, then
put the thing by and forgot it. It was
hearing some one speak of the dearth of
Irish plays that reminded Mrs. O'Sul
livan of hers. She told her husband
that If he heard of any one needing
an Irish play she had one. "You!"
laughed Mr. O'Sullivan again. But that
very night the actor was asked if he
knew of an Irish play, and by Froh
man's play-taster In London, one Ham
ilton. I
However, Mrs. O'Sulllvan's play was
unsuited to the requirements of Mr. Ham
ilton, who, however, commissioned "Pat
rick Bidwell" to write another. "Peggy
Machree" was the other, and after under
going all sorts of amputations, graftings,
transmogrifications, at the suggestion of
managers, at last appeared triumphantly
In its original shape as designed by the
playwright. "Peggy Machree" has been :
s distinct success on the "other side.", A j
long provincial tour set* lt on its final!
Jess, and It was highly indorsed In the
London reviews. A year's run testifies
gratefully to its drawing powers. The '
play was written originally for a woman
ptar. Miss Marie Dainton. the Peggy
Machree of the London production, found
name and fame therein. The part of
Barry Trevor, however, seems, by the
reviews, to have afforded Mr. O'Sullivan
a happy opportunity, not the least of its
charms being several folksong classics,
in addition to some charming v original
ballads. %-fj TK,
The incidental music accompanying the
play is unusually Important. It was com
posed by Esposito. ue Spanish-Irish gen
tlema^ who composes when he has noth
ing better to do. When he is at work
Es-posito is preaching Ireland for the
Irish, the preservation of the folksong,
up-to-date creameries and all the other
admirable activities of the Gaelic League.
This, by the way, is what Denis
O'Sullivan is doing when he is really
busy. There is a bonny singer in
O'Sullivan, a rare artist; there Is an
eloquent and temperamental actor; but
there is a slashing politician spoiled.
West Cork thinks so. This Is . the
constituency that Invited the actor last
year to represent it In cruel England.
Knowing him. one's only surprise Is
that he did not Immediately accept.
fc.But Mr. O'Sullivan told the West
Corkers that when they would pay
him as good a salary as he got in
comic opera he would undertake the
M. P. ship. "Poor dears," says he, "it
would take all the money they have in
the threasury."
But West Cork's turn will come. I
went to talk art and Californians In
London, and Mr. Denis O'Sullivan's
doings there since be left here two
years ago, the other morning with the
actor. One sentence he gave to his
famous appearance in "The Duchess of
Dantzlc;" he gave a second to his re
citals with Madame Blanche Marchesi;
and another or two to "Peggy
Machree." Then he had a little good
news of Slgmund Beel, who is pros
pering In London: of Putnam Gr Is wold,
who Is singing second basso parts
"splendidly" In the Covent Garden
Grand Opera, and who on the Continent
has been singing Wo tan's and such; of
Willie Tayleur Andrews, the baritone,
who la also singing well; word of a
Callfornlan day at Orrln Peck's, where
foregathered Slgmund Beel, Mrs Phoebe
Hearst. Donald de V. Graham, himself
and Mrs. O'Sullivan among other exiles.
And then came the politics.
Up to this a long rehearsal seemed to
have left its mark upon the actor. His
chat was unentbuslastie-^for himâ and
. desultory. But Mr. O'Sullivan's eye lit to
the politics, and he might have Just
risen from his downy couch. I don't
know that I like many things better
than to hear Mr. O'Sullivan sing Schu
mann; but if there Is a choice I might
choose to hear him on an Irish division
in the "House," or to a tale of Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman mumbling awk
ward thunderbolts over at Premier Bal
r four. who. with his heels above his head,
listens with a sweet smile to Banner- |
man. and then, in English polished as ice i
âand as slipperyâ eels through the sltua- I

demand of the Premier why the colonial I

question. From the "distinguished I

There circulates the information that
many of our young members of society,
accredited with enjoying the pastimes
of summer resorts, are In reality closet
ed with a cook book and delving into
the mysterious construction of the
pantry. How shocking!
Still, this secretive method should be
better than none, for the fact remains
that knowledge of domestic industry is
essential to schemes of matrimony,
therefore, being essential, why the con
tinued instinct to hide the practical ac
quirement?
A covert sneer greets an allusion to i
the maid behind closed doors during
the summer season, and there is diffi
culty in ascertaining 1 whether the sneer
is because of her eschewing the outdoor
pleasure or. because she hides that
which she is doing.
Does society impose so great a disci
pline as to demand an accomplishment
without the outer world's cognizance
of the machinery's motion?
Miss must be a belle at cotil
lon or tea â handsome, graceful, versa
tile; also during fashionable infor
malities of summer she must be seen
at an approved watering place or
mountain* resort in order to hold eligi
bility In the eyes of him seeking a
beautiful wife with all requisites nec
essary to society's upholding. These
include the mechanism of home-mak
ing, of which she must possess the un
derlying knowledge, and her time for
forming: acquaintance with th^se home
ly duties is limited amid the pressure
of hops in winter and automobile tours
in summer.
What then? As le dernier ressort. our
maid of proper aspiration feigns an
outing', emphasizing report by darken
ing the house, and remains at home.
Justifiable means toward a commend
able end? Not at all. The drawn
shades are libelous and unworthy â a
libel on the American girl's indepen
dence end unworthy of her courage,
which should not flinch at conviction.
The national trait marked above all
others'is adaptability. My lady of mil
lions should be able to roll her sleeves
at a moments notice with capability
and self-esteem, for, outwardly, the
grande dame evincing little knowledge
of conditions other than those sustained
in the drawing-room, she is. primarily
the woman who can construct a feast
in addition to absorbing one.
Far from repressing this inherent '
versatility, it should be nurtured and
openly, the well rounded woman taking
active deljglit 5n the exercise of her
feminine r>rovress.
Maids, those of you who are fiancees
or aspirants, raise the shades, draw the
latch and let who may pÂ«ep at your
apprenticeship with the domestic ma
chinery, with good riddance to your
sooffers, for Prince Charming will
linger.

The substitution of rose leaves for
rice was an innovation at a recent
wedding, and the precedent might well be
followed.
The throwing of rice as a time
honored custom deserves the respect
due to old age, and that is about the
hest that may be said for it.
In the natural progression of things
Fptrftnal and mundane the rice-throw
ing habit should receive more honor
through its breach than through ob

HIS LUCID IKTERYAL
ANEW idea is abroad. It has been aimed at both the great
universities. It is that professors in those institutions are to
be employed or retained upon popular petition. These peti
tions come from the vicinity and from far States. Those who sign
them cannot possibly know the situation into which' they intrude.
The authority responsible for the university may make a mistake, but
if so, it is responsible. The petitioners may be mistaken, without
any possible responsibility.
No doubt the promoters of the new idea are very well meaning
people. They/have a feeling of loyalty to nationality or some plan
and policy of education that may be respected if asserted on proper
occasions. But the selection of a university faculty by referendum
of that kind would break the strongest institution in the' country.
If petition can appoint it can also- dismiss a professor; and when
the majority of the petitioners never saw the institution and have
not the slightest special interest in it, one may be able to imagine
the complex, compound, comminuted confusion that would be the
chronic state of a university which once surrendered its control to
such purely external influences.
The final authority in university management may sometimes
make mistakes, for it is human, but the worst it can do in that di
rection is mild compared with tfie havoc that would follow the
adoption of this new idea. So, while sympathizing with the motive
ihat is behind such efforts to supplant or control constituted author
ity, one must send it to the limbo of well meant but injurious inter
ference.

ANGELA MORGAN
ACQU RE THE "NOW" HABIT
rr^HE State Board of Trade received, entertained and acted upon
jl the question of reciprocity. It took the initiative in order to
test the condition of public sentiment on that issue. It refused
to suppress it. but provided free discussion and gave a hearing to all
comers, and concreted the result in a conclusive expression. The
position of the board is of such power and importance in the State
that it could not do less.
The editorial statement of the Chronicle that the directors
passed upon the question and were reversed by the full board is
an error. There was but one position taken, but one expression
made, and that was by the unanimous action of the directors. The
board declared its purpose to stand by the protected interests of
the State, as it has always done.
It is well in discussing a public question of such importance
to be exact. Nothing is gained by suppression or by misrepresenta
tion. There is likely to be more than a sectional division over reci
procity. It will be an industrial division with allied lines of in
dustry ranged against each other. No one can now predict the
result. Congress will find it a complex issue and must balance the
books and set profit and loss accurately against each other before
it can legislate on the subject.
California's interests are distinctly agricultural, and the State
Board of Trade can be trusted to safeguard them efficiently. Other
interests, on the other side, throughout the country are .in the
keeping of organizations that will put their case before the coun
try and defend it stoutly and stubbornly. It is a battle of gigantic
industries, and is the equal of that which now disturbs England in
the contention between protection and free trade, which Mr. Cham
berlain has roused by taking an independent position in politics.
A MISSTATEMENT.
The Santo Domingo matter is just a part of the big whole of
that policy, and the administration's action and opinion about it
can be taken as illustration of the trend of a doctrine great enough
to embrace the Monroe as only, one member in its family. It is the
policy of practically putting ethical considerations and forces ,to
the fore in the determination of national and international affairs
more than has ever been known in history hitherto. -We have al
ways with us the tendency to regard the idea of such a policy as
that to be sentimental only, merely academical, and an impracti
cable dream.
Xo one could accuse the strenuous President of these United
States of such idle sentiment, and now in his Chautauquan speech
he virtually announces this ethical policy. Santo Domingo has ap
pealed to our friendship for help, and we are told, on ethical
grounds, that we should continue that successful help which we
are now replying with, and that we should make that assistance
perfect by such extension of the Monroe doctrine to new needs
as will make that assistance permanent, and 'applicable to a like
aid to all our sister republics on this hemisphere. The President
speaks of the growth of the recognition of the duty of bearing one
another's burdens. in Christian civilization, and expresses the. be 7
lief that the ethical element is entering more into the dealings of
one nation with another.
On the very same day that Roosevelt is talking to us thus at
Chautauqua, Secretary Taft is addressing the Filipinos in the. like
fine ethical strain. He is assuring them that the majority party
of the American people have shaped their policy toward the island
ers with a philanthropic kindness kindred to that of a father, pro
tecting and educating his children until they are wise and strong
enough to govern and shift for themselves. That this great policy
is not idle dream and empty promise is evidenced by what we ac
complished for Cuba. That is proof to ourselves and to the world.
It was an undertaking that a cynic might have called quixotic,
but the majority of the American people reckoned it as sanely chiv
alric. and it is now an accomplished fact and placed upon one of
the brightest pages of our history. On the same line we can boast
ihat the late Secretary Hay made the ethical diplomacy of America
a successful diplomacy. So we can reasonably hope that this great
policy is fairly started on its high career. It has done enough to
prove itself practical, and its promises for the future have to back
them men who have been successful leaders in great national and
international affairs.
FOSSILIZATION of the Monroe doctrine is the wav Presi
dent Roosevelt, in his Chautauquan address, expresses the
method of death by antiquation that will come to the doc
trine unless we maintain it alive and growing by adapting new
constructions of it to the new conditions of our times. Fossilizi
tion, he says, means deaths whether to an individual, a government
or a doctrine. , ; v*.
The doctrine is now in danger of being fossilized, antiquated,
relegated to a place in past history, if it is not so construed as : to
meet the urgent case of Santo Domingo in such adequate way as will
prevent foreign governments from having any show of justification
for defying it. In stating his views to us on this subject the Presi
dent reveals to us a great policy that he has evidently deeply at
heart. \u25a0\u25a0 . \u25a0 /
A GREAT POLICY.
. a NOVEL and successful way of
J\ detecting a thief was recently
witnessed on board a. cargo
steamer on 'her voyage from Liverpool
to Natal. One of the seacunniea (Las
car Quartermasters) reported to the
captain that while he was on duty that
morning some one had .gone to bis berth,
i and stolen three sovereigns, two ru
j pecs, and a' half-penny, which he had
; tied up In a piece of rag and sewn In
side his pillow for safety. As the
money represented over a month's pay
he was in great distress. "When asked
why he carried so much money with
him he said he was taking it home to
show to his little girl, who had never
seen a sovereign, and afterward Intend
ed making them into an ornament for
I her.
There are. so many places on board a
large steamer in which the money could
be temporarily hidden and no means of
identifying' the particular sovereigns^,
that the captain had very little hope of
discovering the thief, but as a matter of
form instituted an inquiry and had a
thorough search made, though without
any result.
' Now nothing upsets a seaman, be he
British or Indian, more than to have
a suspected thief on his ship, especially
a thief who robs his mates. They will
broach cargo for food or drink at times,
or steal the cabin plum-duff, without
a qualm of conscience; but to steal
from a shipmate is a crime they scorn
to commit, and so they would not rest
till the thief was discovered.
. Although the captain had abandoned
the hunt, not so the men themselves,
and at sunset the serang (boatswain)
decided to put the whole of his men
through the "ordeal of eating rice,"
which was as follows:
A dish of plain, uncooked rice was
washed In running water j by the person
who had lost the money, and then placed
en a box in front of one of the crew,
who. officiated as priest. The crew were
all mustered and gathered round; the
priest, in a monotone, read a few verses
from the Koran, and, after blowing three
times upon the rice, prayed that Allah>
might make it instrumental in discover
ing the guilty one; that the throat of the
thief might be made dry as the sands
o' the desert, so that the innocent might
be freed from the suspicion that had
fallen upon them.
Each Lascar was then called In turn,
and. -with one hand on their sacred book,
he. with the other, took a few grains
of the rice and proceeded to eat them,
masticating them till they were thor
oughly moistened, when he either swal
lowed them or spaft them out. Nine pass
ed che test successfully and were de
clared innocent, but the tenth seemed to
have difficulty in doing so; this was at
once noticed by the others, who, closing
round, besran to question him. "What
is the matter? Is your throat too dry?"*
etc. .This made him worse, and, after
Hying to go through the ordeal for a
lew moments longer, he gave in, and,

.There Is a chapter In the tale which
gives in pretty condensed form what is
Herrington's view of the necessary com
promises with ; honor In order-to grasp
business success in these days of graft.
It is entitled "An Honorable Merchant."
Herrington is the junior member of a
meat packing firm. The senior member.
Dround, is a strictly honorable man. but
the younger men In his office have bujlt
up bis business by taking advantage of
the uses of bribery, accepting rebates,
â¢falsifying book' accounts, and all the
usual modern tricks of the trade. Dround
was kept. in ignorance for long. When, he
finds It out he is amazed and very angry.
The, younger members regard these
tricky â¢ methods as simply ; necessities of
the modern struggle for existence. It 13
eat or be eaten. You have to fight your
competitors with the same weapons they
emplpy, or they will destroy you. Dround
says to. Herrington: -"It saddens me to
hear as young, a man as y.ou take that
cynical view. It is a strange time we are
coming to. I pray it may. not be a worse
time for the country." ,1
The American citizen of these memoirs
thus comments on Dround's v ' scruples '
after he. bad told Dround to his - face. ,'
"There are no morals In business that lj
recognize except those that are written !
on .the statute book." He closes the In- f
cldent of~. the firm's quarrel with these.!
words: -"To my mind there was some- I
thing, childish .in the use of the. words
'better' land 'worse. 1 Every agre is at

Robert Herrick's new book. "The Mem
oirs of an American Citizen." is some
thing o"f the same Jcind as the well-known
"Plum Tree." It la the story of a man
working himself up by sheer energy and
unscrupulouspess to" a big success under
present day business and political condi
tions, which; the tendency of* the story is
to show, do not make success possible to
one who spins the web of his honor so
fine that little underhand tricks will tear
it. What he says in the mld3t of the
book is slightly tempered by conscience
In the final chapters, and. as usual, at the
boy's start out In life, he gets some
strict and severe lessons as to the neces
sity of being upright. Herrington, . the
man who . thus writes \u25a0 his memoirs,
achieves great . business and. political
heights, and |at the end of the story a
bunch of; American Beauty roses is laid
on his desk. His success was won, how
ever, at the cost of the forfeiture of the
respect of some of the plain but honest
and kindly people of his native county
who scorned the methods by which he
did what Is s called rising in life. The
sticklers for strict moraltiy can get that
much satisfaction from the book's out
come. -. '

who can either buy the book, or bg
members of a \u25a0 pood library and look
over Its pages. of beauty and learn from
a master mind how to, grow gradually
in Â»the. power to appreciate art. The
subjects treated are: Modern judged
by ancient art, representation and sen
timent; modern judged" by ancient art,
decorative effects; the industrial arts
in which form predominates; the indus
trial arts in which color predominates;
sculpture as used in architecture;
painting as used in architcture. As the
author is such. high authority on archi
tecture the parts of his book relating
to decoration :incorineceion with build
ing will be of particular interest. His
recent work, . "The Appreciation' of
Sculpture," has well- paved the way and
excited high expectations for this. .
In chapter 11, on decorative effects, he
gives ug some explanation of what is
meant by decorative as ] : distinguished
from other art. It |s art which is not
primarily representative of nature or de
scriptive of human sentiment. "If we
try to discover why we love Greek re
lief sculpture so supremely, it is found
that v what we love in it. is the quiet
charm of the j thing." "The question as
to whether jit j represents 'â¢ accurately ! any
thing in nature is "not a' serious "ques
tion. The artist only knows how in
his loftiest flights .of thought l he- has
steadied himself by constant . reference to
nature; that is to say, to the great ex
emplar to which all our Ideas are
referred, as they have been drawn
thence. .It is not for the student to ask
whether there is anything of nature in
the composition or not; .what he finds is
the lovely, the " stately,' the 'simple, '; ; the
touching result." It 'applies alike to the
Venus of : Milo, or to a small and simple
painted vase. . "The only \u25a0 distinction we
ca n I make' is this : That the work of art
which takes the least, from ' nature in a

that the sky was. full of naming meteors,
that golden star dust: rained upon us
from the applauding heaven, that the
earth rocked gently as we trod upon it."
Then he closes that ohapter .with the
gate closing between them and he said
"Good night!" and . she said "Good
night!" And consider thisâ it is a brave
effort to put Into words what is beyond
words, "She . left me staring after her,

within me. to be said to her.",-
Calvin Blake goes away from the little
town and learns to be a lawyer. Later
he goes! to fight In the Civil War. and
while he Is away his sweetheart marries
his friend Solon. She is kind enough to
give Calvin friendship, and she names
her baby j boy after him. Before he re
turns from the war he gets a letter an
noimclng her death. His arm is shot
away, and when lying In a hospital under
the influence of opiates he dreams that
the ; spirit of his lost arm is '; seeking, the
soul of the woman he loved 'in paradise.
After the peace comes Calvin returns to
his native town and then the mature part
of the story begins. Solon steadfastly
remains his friend; and \u25a0 that undesirable
citizen Colonel Potts, whose rescue j from
drowning was spoken of . regretfully, fur
nishes opportunity ;in his - peculiar person
for 'much of * the rich -humor of the vol

The "Boss" is the editor and pro
prietor of a weekly paper in a small
Western town, all of the articles 'of
whose paper were spiced with what
Wilson calls "a readab:% sprlglitliness."
There was a flippant "incivility in some
of his paragraphs, but no bitterness nor
real cynicism was in the composition
of Solon Denny, either as to printed
matter or the personal soul of him.
Even when he recorded the rescue from
drowning of a J very undesirable fel
low citizen and interjected -'the seem
ingly either irrelevant or unkind sen
tence, "It *s feared he will recover," he
was not regarded as either a careless
or a malignant writer. - ....- .-
Solon, however, was not the.hero of the
story. , Tttat htfnor- goes to {Calvin Blake,
who- was a friend : of â¢ Solon. "He" tells
his 'own story from his boyhood days,
and does it so charmingly, modestly, and
in such. humorously self-critical manner
that ho sense of unpleasing egotism mars
TTiis first-person way of telling the tale.
He prepares us to like the man by mak
ing us like the boy in the early pages, of
the narrative. He does that in a chap
ter called "The Perfect Lover." Calvin
is therein introduced to us as a school
boy; and he falls wildly in love with a
school girl upon. (he first. day of her ar
rival and his beholding of her. Some
people \u25a0 may. think that is precociously
early to begin a. love story, but Harry
Leon Wilson announces this opinion, and
perhaps it is the enunciation of a pro
found truth:, '.'Your- boy of fifteen,!
think, is the only perfect loverâ giving,
all,, demanding nothing, save, indeed, the
right to his secret cherishings." So he
has entitled the chapter,about this, love
of a school girl when he was fifteen,
"The Perfect Lover." It may be a
cleverly chosen . caption and a .wise anal
ysis of his life, for it is surely true that
immediately after fifteen the lover ceases
to wish to give all so unselfishly, the ele
ment of bargaining- enters into the ro
mance, albeit a bargaining in. very, beau
tiful and noble goods.

Ing may dimly suggest the book's charm.
One comes early in the development and
fills a richly told chapter called v"My
Lady's Garter."' It is an appetite whet
ter for the love affair's excellent telling,
to enticingly moving climacterlcally to
ward the culminating chapter entitled
"The Poet'e Prize." which . closes the
etory and is the other incident barely to
be outlined here by way or sample,
-On? charm or surprise of the chapter
â¢â¢My Lady's Garter" is that It shows. us
William Shakespeare, the man of the
most all comprehending intellect, yet as
so modest a youth that the romantic inci
dent of the lost garter failed to furnish
Mm convincing evidence thai the woman
he wanted loved him.
This Is how the garter was lost, found,
and its recovery blushf ully dofted aside
by the lady in the case as a consummation
not devoutly to be wished. It's Anne Hath
b way. of course. She was talking to
Phillip, King of Spain, wno was at the
Elizabeth to woo the Queen for
3Knself principally, but, incidentally, he

Prime Minister. De Silva, "a high gran-
After the secret marriage Southampton
had to go away, and he intrusted both
his secret and his bride to the care of
Ehakerpeare and the Earl of Essex. This
confidential relationship of the poet to
the handsome young woman caused such
a pang of jealous suspicion to Anne
Hathawav that it well nigh ruined his
prospects with the fair maid of honor.
6he felt 60 sure that Bhe had discovered
his Infatuation for the half-Italian Juliet
that she refused to speak to him, giving
him the rebuff she thought such a bad
man deserved. "With her own lips" she
told the Queen that William was pot a
man of honor, and that he had "intrigued
much with a certain woman." This was
Just the uyual little, hindrance . to the
course of true love. ' Such byplay of the
green-eyed monster gets us fairly started
into the thick of the love tale. The au
.*hor has got the trick of Be'mi-archaic,
\u25bcjaint expression, that gives etory tell
rng a double zest which comes of the
value of the incident related, being, Â«1t
banced by the richness of the terms of

Elizabeth picturesque with rich inci
dents and strikingly peculiar char

â¢Shakespeare, and "a hitherto unpub
lished chapter in the story' of the im
mortal bard" is. the Eub-tjtie of. a novel
just out from the pen of a San Fran
cisco author, Clyde C Westover of the
United States Naval Office. The *tory is
called "The Romance of .Gentle Will"
and show* a genuine talent for ro

toward that wider success which -its
merit will no doubt win, The nucleus
incidents around which the author has
â¢woven- the rich . descriptions . of the
poet's youthful life and environment
are gathered from the "age-worn and
well-nigh illegible pages" of 'the diary
of Henry Wriothesley, Earl of South
ampton,, who was a chum .of Shake
speare's youth. . -- .â¢- i
If the dates of this narrative tio not
tally with the publicly recorded ones i
of the life of the bard, we. are. warned
to make our Quarrel with the diary,
on whose authority the time of the
events told herÂ« Is based. It is a
pretty story made- up of the progress
and hindrances of the great dramatist's
youthful love for Anne '\u25a0.Hathaway.
Around these' two chief players are
gathered a number of the most fasci
nating of the famous historical char
acters of the time, who play parts that
must teem minor to "us for the nonce
while we interest ourselves chiefly In
the romance of gentle Will.
Anne Hathaway is presented .to us as
the most beautiful and most royally fa
vored of Queen Elizabeth's __ maids of
honor, and it is in her court -and ita pur
lieus that the love making 1 and the mar
riage of the bard takes place. In this
way the love aJTair of the great Virgin
Queen herself is drawn in as an inci
dent and an offsetting to the Immortal
William's enamored enslavement to that
"Anne Hathaway who hath a way that is
co very charming." The romantic wooing
and winning of Juliet Florio by the young
Earl of Southampton, who is portrayed
to us as a most charming youth, makes
iÂ£ pretty accompaniment to the main love

but of great beauty and worth, and the
boy of noble birth insisted on having
her, and accomplished his purpose by a

Shakespeare and Southampton are arm
in arm when they are introduced to Ju

cheeks and lustrous black hair. "She
curtseyed low, and the young Earl stared

â¢"As a rc->u!t Of the increased buying Inter
est. j n California raising* which was <ie
veloptl terly last wrtk, and continued up to
Saturday, a strong upward movement in pricts
OOOUred a:i<S th.; market closed ttrong. with
a buo;.ar.t tone. The demand is based upon
tho txptfXMllon that the market upon new
croi- will 01*11 at relatively high prices, owing
te tSM i-trijn*; contrul that is promised In the
new con-.binatlon of growing and packing in
tKrcÂ«tÂ¥. Tfieiframs from the i-oast en Satur
day reported an advance in the f. o. b. price
of ooÂ«Â«t etock' to OV^c for fancy and s'yjc ior
choice. Holdings in this market are vory small
nnd the market is steadily advancing. 7e-7lic
as 10 holder being quoted at the close of last
KMk on fancy coast seedeJ and C<s^JVic for
tbatct. very little bvinjj pi-ocurable at the ip
ride figuix-K in either case. Currants remained
firm on the M'Oi. but were quiet. The Greek
nia".l:et appeared to be Eomewhat unsettled,
bonie cables re:K>rtlng a stronger and other* a
weaker tendency on Saturday. Tlie tone o'
the prune market was decidedly strung on
Eatuntay and the tendoncy was upwstrd. In
ret;>onsfc to a bid of :ic o&fis wired to t'.ie
coast on a lot wanted for export, the response
from three different sources was a declination
sci-ompanied by a counter . offer to sell on a
**ie t. o. b. basis. From a prominent Santa
CUra rack-r a letter was rwtlved In which
the writer estimated the e::t!re vifcible supply,
â¢nrlujing the carry-over un the coast and in
conMUdnc markets of Â»he United States, at
250f< caiÂ±. against Â«*CO tars a year ago. Basel
on :h!s Fhowing-Â£iid the ract that supplies
of al< dileci fruits are light, while the appTÂ«s
etaÃ in nearly all sections Js phort. some au
thorltice conUdently exj.e-:t an active and

Â«o tat'.s by the middle of Scpter.iber. Apricots
\u25a0na bt:-o!.fi Jind all report* from :he coast in
Â«licÂ«tÂ»Â« ar. upward movement in prices. Sonid
1\ action is locked for, however, as soon as the
choit exiles which were made early in the Fca

Wasthfnjrton Crop Bulletin.
The report of G. N. Salisbury, section direc
tor, L'r.ited States Weather Bureau, for the
Washington Crop Bulletin, week ended August
jl.j 1 . .> si- toUoms:
The put wec-k was without rain, and was of
moderate teni;x:rature during the lore part, but
vÂ«-:> Harm fiuriug the latter part. It was
fevorcbic- for the gTOwth of corn, melons, to
rflatots. squash, and all those vegetables re
qutntis a hot sun for tcelr best uevelopment
it \\=s. unfavorable for pastures and meadows,
Or.v.ng theni up badly, and the late hay crop
\u25a0Â»iil be thort. The heat and dryness have
injured apples and prunes, causing them to
Â«1;.;< eft* badly. Rain is badly needed for pas
tures, late potatoes, late oats and fruit.
Hops are doing well and the outlook is
promising, although aphis are numerous and
there is some appearance of mold. Late po
tatoes show evidence of blight in some lo
calities and there are son-.e reports of blijrht
IB tomatoes. Hoot crops are doing well and
thÂ» fsjjr. is unusually favorable for sweet
corn.
The entire week was ideal for haying and
harvesting. ThÂ« winter whett harvest Is
r.car.y completed and threshing is we'l under
way. Most of the wheat will grade number
one. Spring wheat is ripening rapidly and
oots are ripening a little too rapidly. The
barley harvest is about finished, oat cutting Is
well under way . and the cutting of sprlns
Vbctt has besun. The wheat is now too far
advanced for further injury from hot winds
ar.u a bountiful crop Is assured.

; "Receipts of Hay have been about 5000 tons
during thÂ« past week. - Arrivals have continued
so, large, both by railroad and water, that the
handling has been delayed to a considerable
extent.' The railroad company contlnuis to re
quest more active work in removing the Bay
from the cars. The large receivers are doin^
all that is possible to comply with their re
quests,* but there has been so much that l.as
accumulated here, and there are so many cars
arriving dally, that it has beÂ«n impossible to
catch up.
\u25a0 "Prlcts have not changed to any material
extent, although consignments are more diffi
cult to place, , and in many Instances conces
sions are being made to effect sales. The ma
jority of the Hay that has been arriving by
water, has come from the lowlands and con
sists of. our poorer qualities. This chvs of
Hay has been exceedingly slow of 6ale, even
at the bedrock prices that have . prevailed.
There is a great deal of this style to come
during the next two mon:hs, lor the reason
that btorage facilities art limited.
\u25a0\u25a0Sincily choice Wheat Hay sells at $13 to
$13 50, and In a' lew exceptional rases at even
higher figures, but the large majority of all
the Wh*-at Her arriving only brings from
$S to $10 50 on the track here.
"Moderate arr.yiU of Alf.nt.-i are being told
at unchanged figures.
"New bnaw is arriving freely and sells for
35c to 45c per bale."-

The twenty-seven Russian immigrants
who were ordered deported to Panama
did not leave yesterday. .''on the steamer
San Juan. It is possible they may escape
deportation altogether. Although now
suffering from ailments which act as a
bar to their- landins,-_ in no, case is the
trouble incurable. The twenty-Seven ail
ing Russians have been transferred to
Angel Island, where in cabins located on
the site of the new immigration depot
they will live for the present- The Pa
cific Mail. Company will provide i'or -thejr
comfort,- and under the direction of the
Quarantine surgeons their ills will receive
proper treatment/ It is expected i that
most of them in. a few weeks- will be
able to fulfill the health requirements of
the Government. As fast ag they, are
cured they will be landed and sent to re
join their fellow countrymen at Los An
geles. .';
The San Juan carried her usual cargo
and about a score of passengers. There
will be no Panama boat next Saturday. -

The navy transport Solace, Captain
J. H. Bui!, whose approach was an
nounced on Friday afternoon by wire
less, reached port early yestctday
iy.orr.l:vz f. O :n Manila by way of Yoko
hama, Guam and Honolulu. The Solace
brousfcl S3 prissengers and her usual
stock of grievances. The Solace 5s no
torious hi the navy for the friends she
Â«Jo*!Â» not make for the service..
On the last voyage of the Solace a
vomsn enbin passenger complained of
humiliations put upon hrr by Captain
aÂ»fl his executive orfiocr. l-Icuten
\u25a0f..: Commander Knapp. On this voy
age it is at Bull's head r.iost of the
complaints g. r e aimed, although Pay
master \V. C File comes in for his
share. /
The So!acÂ« brougrh: home a large
number of time expired men. One of
the inducements offered by the Govern
ment to encourage enlistment Is the op
portunity Uncle Sam's sailors hxve of
seeing the -world. Many of li:;se sailor
rasser.gÂ«rs on the Solace have served
three years or more in the Philippines.
When they reached Yokohama they
were anxious to *cc something of Ja
pan, Tvhc-re men of them had never
been nshorc. They were granted lib
erty but with empty pockets, Captain
Bull refuting to let them draw any of
lhÂ»-Jr pay until late at night. In cor.se-
Quence of this some of the men went
ashore again and overstayed th*ir lib
erty one day. When they returned they
wr-re lectured fey Captain Bull, who said
that in addition tÂ» putting them in the
bris. he would do all he couli to pro
cure for them dishonorable discharges.
"Most ofScferp," said one Jaclcey. "try
to encourage time-expired men to re
enlisu Few men who make a trip
bonne en the Solace with Captain Bull
ever re-er.!!st."
< The men complain that their food
was bad Â»nd that Captain Bull did not
inspect the g3lley for more than a
mouth and that the paymaster never
Â»"cat near it.
"Couldn't stand the smell," remarked
(Â£ \u25a0â¢\u25a0 of th<= bluejackets.
-< ;t Honolulu, the men say. Captain
8...1 to allow 300 of them to
a'-^r.d a benefit for the memorial to
the Bennir.gton survivors, on the navy
t- nsport Lawton. Captain Bull said
; '-t*iday that the men werÂ« not very
i. lxious to go.
Captain Bull, it is said, had a mixup
Sit Honolulu with Captain Wilder, com
mandlns the Lawton. Bull saw some
of the L&wton's men ashore in civilian
clotbes. He sent word of what he had
se<n to ti:e Lawton's commander and
rerr.indc-d him that it was contrary to
regulations. The Lawton's command
er, say tJ:e passengers on the Solace, re
rlK-d in person, coming alongside the
Solace and in a loud voice requesting
Captain Bull to mind his own blanked
business.
From Honolulu the SolacÂ« brought a
rifle tosrn from the Hawaiian National
Guard. The riflemen are on their way
to Seagirt.
When the Solace anchored off Fol
som-streft whaif she was surrounded
by gasoiine launcht-s loaded with hotel
runners and expressmen. The officers
of the Solace were annoyed by the noise
a.MO an appeal was sent to Captain
Martin at the Harbor police station. Po
liceman MoGrath was detailed to assist
Captain Bull in preserving order on the
S"!ace and all morning McGrath stood.
In the transport's gangway, repelling

James W. Gillln, retired captain of po
lice, died at the Lane Hospital yesterday
morning after a long and painful" illness.
He was a sufferer for many years from
inflammatory rheumatism, which . com
pelled him to retire from active duty
while yet in his early manhood..
Glllin was a native of New York. He
was born there on May 3, 1552. . He start
ed out in life as a druggist and was in
that business when he joined the police
force on December 17, 1879. He was pro
moted .as sergeant ,on Â» October 1, 18S9.
When the Mission, which had been part
of the Southern district, was made an
Independent district Gillin was promoted
to the position of captain and assigned
to it.
Shortly after his promotion as sergeant
he met with a ssrious; accident while In
charge of the Chinatown squad. He was
a terror to the gamblers and they laid a
trap for him. Broken' boards were placed
across a space of about' ten feet on the
roof between two houses. A gambling
game was started in one of the houses,
and Gillln climbed to the roof to effect
an entrance by that means and surprise
the gamblers. He stepped on the broken
boards and fell to the ground. He was
seriously injured and waa laid up for sev
eral months. He was never the same
man physically afterward. .
About a year prior to his retirement
on a pension, on October 7, 1901, Captain
Gillin was unable to attend to his duties.
He was always hopeful that he would be
fit for duty again, but finally had to re
luctantly admit that his active days were
numbered.
Gillln was an able and conscientious of
ficer and had the full confidence of the
Chief and the Board of Police Commis
sioners. The breath of scandal never at
tached to his name, officially or socially.
He was a strict disciplinarian, but at the
same time just to his men. Above all, he
was a loving and considerate eon, and his
widowed mother, who lives at 315% Stein
er street, was always first in his
thoughts. He remained a bachelor, and
often said he would never think of mar
rying as long aB hisjinother was alive.
Captain Gillin had four brothers con
nected with the force, directly or . Indi
rectly. John, while a special officer in
Chinatown, was shot and killed by a
crazy Chinaman in 1891. â¢ Joseph succeed
ed him, but resigned on December 9,
1902. He in turn was succeeded by Frank,
who resigned on October 11, 1904. Peter
was a regular officer, having been ap
pointed in 1898. While chasing a thief his
revolver dropped from his pocket and the
bullet shattered his ankle. He was re
tired on a pension through disability/on
November 18, 1902.

OYSTER BAT, N. V., Aug. 12.â Some
time during the next week or ten days
President Roosevelt will visit a test of
ithe submarine boat Plunger.' The exhibi
tion will take place in Long Island Sound
a short distance from the entrance â¢to
Oyster Bay. Arrangements for the test
have not yet been completed, but the
Plunger is being put in condition at the
Brooklyn navy yard. Her commander,
Lieutenant Charles Nelson,, is recognized
in the navy as one of the most fearless
and accomplished officers in the service.
His record attracted the President's at
tention, who gave direction thai Lieu
tenant Nelson should come to Oyster Bay
in the Plunger in order that he might
have an opportunity to witness person
ally the practical performances of the
little vessel. -,--â¢,..
Of course, the President has no thought
of being aboard the Plunger during the
tests. He entertains no fear of possible
mishap, but he believes that he could
achieve no good results by being on board
the vessel while the tests are in progress,
and, in fact, that he simply would be. in
the way. He will view the work of the
vessel from the deck of the naval yacht
Sylph-
Before the Plunger is put through her
paces the President probably will make
an examination of the .vessel in order
that he may have a thorough under
standing of the operation of the-boati- â¢
The President is anxious to encourage
officials of the navy to undertake orig
inal and daring work. He believes thor
oughly In individual initiative in officers
and admires those who are willing to as
sume personal risks for the betterment
of the service and for the honor of the
country.
A few days ago the President had Com
mander Sims as a guest at luncheon.
Sims has made a special , study of gun
nery. Many of his suggestions were
adopted. The "â¢! British navy also has
adopted many of the plans . and sugges
tions offered by Commander Sijns.

LONDON*, Aug. 12. â The ruins of what
is believed to have been a Roman city
J have been discovered, â¢by curious
chance, near West Meon, Hampshire.
Some weeks ago a schoolmaster
named T. H. Bodley. discovered a very
old and rare history of Hampshire. The
volume contained reference to a Roman
town which had existed on the spot
now known as Lipplvywood.
Bodley thereupon made a thorough
examination of the ground and came to
the conclusion that- a town must have
stood there. Excavations were begun.
About a foot below the surface of the
ground, near the roots of some large
trees, the searchers unearthed three
handsome tesselated pavements, such
joa were used to pave the atrrum of a
Roman house.
Further digging revealed the founda
tions of a large Roman villa, which,
judging by its size and shape, probably,
belonged to the governor or centurion.
The most interesting discovery '. .at '<
present is what is believed to be a cop- j
per vestal urn In which' fire was kept
burning day and night in honor of the
vestals. \u25a0 \ : :
The searchers, who are confident; of
further' - interesting discoveries, surfj
round their operations with consider
able secrecy. All of the ruins are care
fully covered with tarpaulin sheets and
photographers are not allowed near the
excavations.
CHICAGO. Aug. 12. â "Race suicide
lor the poor, and multiplicity of off
spring for the middle classes" Is the
latest recipe to cure crime by the ex
termination of criminals. /
Dr. C. S. Briggrs of Nashville, Term.,
has come forth in. advocacy of a belief
that the laboring: people luid the poorer
classes bring too many children into
the world and then turn them out Into
the alleys to be steeped in crime and
immorality.
Dr. Briggs traces the origin of the
burglar and the thug to the darkened
and unsanitary streets of tlie poorer
quarters of every city. Homes where
children are abundant and dollars few
turn out the criminal element, he be
lieves â not necessarily because the pa
rents are of perverted minds or hold
distorted ideas of the fitness of things,
but because there comes a day when
the undeveloped child is thrown out to
shift for himself.
The problem of fostering: only ideal i
citizens is, however, unsolved by the
Southern physician; nor Joes he ex
plain how tlie poor are to be left child
less and the middle and wealthy classes
deluged with babies. He makes no sug
gestion by which the poor ca#r*be elim
inated and only the middle class left,
and he gives no answer to the possi
bility that over production of children
by the middle classes might hasten
them downward in poverty.
Dr. Briggs expressed the opinion that,
taking the laboring people end the \
poorer classes as a whole, in Chicago,
It would be better both for the mothers
end the fathers and would save the in
nocent offspring the inevitable hard
ships of poverty if they would plan to
limit the number of births.
Children could not be brought up, as
serted the physician, amid such en
vironments as surrounds the poorer
classes and be expected to develop into
normal human beings, with a proper
view of life and citizenship.
Dr. Briggrs said that it seemed to him,
that the wealthy and middle classes of
Chicago should have larger families.
They had means, said the physician, to
raise large families, to surround them
with wholesome conditions and to keep
them from the vulgar and degrading
influences of the streets.

PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 12.â The battle
ship Kansas, the largest war vessel ever
built in the East, was launched at 12:47
p. m. to-day at the yard of the New York
Shipbuilding Company in Camden; N. J.
The launching was witnessed by Govern
or Hoch of Kansas, whose daughter act
ed as sponsor for. the ship. Along with
the Governor wa3 a christening party of
thirty Kansans. \u25a0
An unusual feature of the launching
was the fact that the vessel was chris
tened with water brought from Kansas
by Governor Hoch, instead of the cus
tomary bottle of champagne. This was
the first time that water instead of wine
has been used in launching a vesselin
this vicinity. . ' /
Governor Hoch of Kansas made the
suggestion and he made the announce
ment after the launching that the chris
tening bottle contained only water.
The Kansas Is a sinter ship of *he Ver
mont, now being built |at the yards of
tho Fore River ' Ship and Engine Building
Company, ' Quincy, Mass. She will have
the ' same armament as the battleship
Minnesota, launched several months ago
at Kownort News. - j
The keel plates of the Kansas were
laid February 10. 1904. She is known as a
450- foot" battleship and her contract calls
for a maintenance of 18-knot- speed for
four consecutive hours. The hull is of
steel throughout and is fitted with bilges
and docking" keels.
However, the Temps adds that the
conditions, taken generally, offer a good
basis for negotiation. The Journal dcs
Debats points out th.it Russia, if desir
ous of preserving Vladivostok, has
every reason to seek peace without de
lay.
The Temps devotes an editorial to an
analysis of the terms, dividing them
into three categories, the first compris
ing the acceptable conditions â the evac
uation of Manchuria, the cession of
Liaotung Peninsula, the handing over
of the Harbin railroad arid the recog
nition of Japan's protectorate over Ko
rea. Then follow the debatable points
â the reimbursement of the expenses of
the war and the cession of Saglialien,
which, it thinks, are both capable of
arrangement; and, finally, the limita
tion of the Russian naval forces in the
Par East and the handing over of the
interned warships, which appear to it
not to be acceptable.
PARIS, Aug. 12. â The French press
unanimously refrained from comment
ing on the Japanese peace terms until
acquainted with the trend of opinion in
Russia. Most of the journals to-day
agree with regard to the severity of the
conditions.

chamber, that Russia v/ould discuss all

Mr. dc IVitte has arranged to attend

This evening he remarked laughingly:

It is believed that the condition dis

question cf the evacuation of Manchu-

leases to Japan.

secrecy which the Japanese insisted
upon imposing upon the proceedings, is
distasteful to him. With much earnest
ness he spoke to-night upon the sub
ject. At the tiirte he was laboring un-
Uer considerable excitement because of
the publislied-^issertion, which had been
called to his attention, that he had
pleaded for an armistice. For the dig
nity of Russia, and the pride of bis
country he asked that an absolute de
nial of the report be made.
Recurring to the question of the se
crecy of the proceedings, he said he did
not understand th* Japanese desire to
conceal what was taking place, nor
could he appreciate the logic of the ar
guments adduced in support of their
position.
"We desire." said he. "that everything
pertaining to the conference should be
\u25a0done In the daylight. Russia is ready
to be judged by the whole world. We
have nothing to conceal and nothing to
fear. Before the conference began all

emanated from the other side. Now

ply of Russia presented this morning,

developments of movements In the boy
cott against American goods and mer
chants and to immediately Teport any
thing which may seme to have a signifi
cance and bearing upon the subject.
There are several causes for this re
newed vigilance. One Is that recent re
ports from the empire have been uni
formly disquieting in epite of the earlier
optimistic comments of Rockhill. The
situation has apparently got beyorfd con
trol of the Chiness officials, wlÂ» were
favorable to the United States from the
start, and also beyond the Chinese guilds
which inaugurated the boycott, but later,
when they found it hurt them in their
individual pocket-books, sought to put an
end to It. finding unfortunately, that they
were then powerless and students were
running the boycott
Another reason Is that many of the
American exporters who do a large busi
ness with China have become alarmed
and are now sending letters of protest
and complaint to the department. Many
of these protestors live on the Pacific
coast.

tacles of sweepings that stand upon the
sidewalks. The lid of the box was about
a foot square, yet Mr. Lane sat and slept
upon it with seeming comfort His hands
clasped his knees and his chin rested
upon them, and so firmly was he planted
that the patrolman experienced some
difficulty in rousing him, and finally was
obliged to pull him to the pavement.
"Yours is the most extraordinary case
I ever heard of," said the Judge to Mr.
Lane, "and if you were not a misdemean
ant deserving of - punishment I would
submit ayou to scientific Investigation. It
Is my opinion that your ability to Blum
ber while you perch is inherent and a
tribute to the logio of the Darwinian the
ory of evolutionâ that at least one simian
trait remains with you. I've a good, mind
to Bend you to Berkeley, where the an
thropologists would undoubtedly find you
an interesting subject."
"For Gawd's sake, don't do dat.
Judge," whimpered Mr. Lane; "I have
heerd about what them anthropâ them
what-da-you-call-'emsâ do wid any pore
mug dey gets der hands on. I hain't
done nothin* ter deserve bein' cut up by
dem guys."
Ignoring the defendant's display of Ig
norance, the Judge sentenced him to
three months' imprisonment in the Coun
ty Jail, where she shall not be permitted
to perch while he sleeps.
NEW YORK,*. Augr. 12. â Threats to
wreck the President's train accounts for
the extraordinary precautions which
were taken while* the chief executive
and his party -were passing: over the Erie
Railroad \ from Chautauqua to- Jersey
City last Friday night. The fact that the
letter telling of such a plan was received
by the police of Paterson, X. J.. filled the
officials of the railroad with alarm, es
pecially as the communication emanated
from a city which has long been notor
ious as the hotbed of anarchy and the
rendezvous of men who predict the death
of rulers. It was stated in the letter
that the scheme was to blow up the Erie
tracks at Ridgewood while the Presi
dent's special was on Its way to. Jersey
City. The police of Paterson Informed
Frederick D. Underwood, president of
the Erie Railroad, of the fact and detec
tives employed by the corporation kept
a sharp lookout in every direction.
"It is not our purpose," the letter ran,
"to kill the President, but somebody on
that train will get hurt."
The, police of several New Jersey towns
along the line co-operated with the Erie
detectives and the force of switchmen,
signalmen and trackwalkers was doubled.
No attempt to use explosives was de
tected, but for all that hundreds of em
ployes of the Erie Railroad had a aleep
less night. Mr. Underwood ordered that
railroad men in pay of the Erie who
could not speak and write English be
temporarily suspended, for j many of the
"reds" in New Jersey who are most aot
ive are foreigners who do not speak Eng
lish.
Mr. Underwood boarded the Presiden
tial train and officially took charge of it.
He directed the operations of all con
cerned In the handling of cars and In
spected every part of the train to make
sure that no one lurked about the place
who might be concerned in a plot against
the chief executive. j

pared by Dr. R. V. Pierce, of Buffalo, N. V.,
whose advice is given free to all who wish to

his wide experience and varied practice.
O. S. Copenhaver, Esq.. of Mount Union,
Huntingdon Co.. Pa. (Box 212). writes: " About
twelve years ago I was suddenly taken with a
pain in the pit of the stomach which was so vio-
lent I could not walk straight. It would grow
more severe until it caused waterbrash and vom-
iting of a slimy yellow water. A physician told
me I had a form of dyspepsia and treated me for
about six months with but little benefit. An-
other physician told me my liver was out of or-
der and that I bad indigestion. Be gave me a
treatment and I grot some better but only for a
short time. I then tried another one, who said I
had chronic indigestion, uiccration of the lining
of the stqmach, torpid liver and kidney affection.
He treated me for more than a year and I felt
much bttter. but it did not last. I then took to
usinj several widely advertised patent medi-
cines, but; received no more than temporary re-
lief. I then tried Dr. Pierces medicines, using
his ' Golden Medical Discovery,* and the ' Pleas-
ant Pellets.' and in two months' time I was feel-
In j: better than I had for years before."
Don't be wheedled by a pcnny-gTabbfng

Dr. Pierces medicines, recommended to

$32,000 for extras In the construction at
the \u25a0 California State building. ThlÂ« bUi
is made up of comparatively small siuua
for additional work on various parts at
the building. '
I The chief of its reasons for dlsallowtay^
the bill as given by the Commission is
that the effect of the old Spanish Mis
sions has not been carried out according
to the plans prepared by the architects.
For instance the specifications called for
scarred plaster for the Interior. Tha
plastering used Is not that required. It
is Â» alleged that Inferior material was
used on the building. Including oexneat.
which has no more consistency than dried
clay.
Cn'anges aro also said to have bÂ«ea
made in the roof construction of oca of
the wings, giving an entirely different ef
fect from tnat desired, and spoiling tha
resemblance to the original Mission. Dur
ing the week experts on buiiaing. plumb-
Ing and electrical work havo gon* over

OAKLAND, Aug. 12â After telling her
mother that she intended to return to
her former place of employment in San
Francisco, sixteen-year-old Elvira
Perez, the daughter of Mrs. R. A. Ash
ton of 709 Fifth street, left the latter'a
home last Thursday evening, and sine*
that time her mother has found no
trace of her, either in this city or In
San Francisco.
v The girl had been employed at the
home of Dr. Lee In San Francisco, but
she did not go there after leaving her
mother's home, nor have any of her
friends on this side of the bay seen her..
The mother of the missing girl is satis-"
fled that ahe has eloped with Westley
Bates, a former sweetheart of her
daughter, but nevertheless she has
sought the aid of the police to locate
the girl and bring her home. Mrs. Ash
ton said to-day that about three
months ago, after some trifling dis-.
agreement at home, -the girl, disap
peared, and after a search of several
days was found at the Bates home, near
Third and Linden streets. The moth
er's theory of an elopement is borne out
by the fact that young Bates left home
about the same time that the girl dis
appeared and has not been seen in this
city since. Word has been sent to the
authorities of the neighboring cities to
keep a watch for the runaway pair.

'\u25a0\u25a0 OAKLANP, Aug. 12.â When Joseph
Goldetein was killed in the famous duel
between David - Kiniry and Policeman
Smith, a search was made of the room that"
was occupied by the two young burglars
and several bits of Jewelry found, includ
ing a diamond ring and a diamond stick
pin. These "Jewels were taken possession
of by Chief of Police Hodgkins, who kept
them until long after the trial of Klnlry,
which took place over. a year after the
killing of Goldstein . and Policeman
Smith. Hodgkins refused to give up the
Jewelry until Mrs. Kate Greiner, the
mother of Goldstein, secured an order
from District Attorney J. J. Allen com
pelling him to surrender them.
MrÂ». Greiner made Beveral demands
upon Hodgkhuj for the stones, but the
Chief always took the ground that they
were probably etolen articles and might
be identified. Mrs, Greiner finally secured
them upon District Attorney. Allen's or
der. \u25a0
Chief Hodgkins says he was sure the
Jewelry was stolen and that he held it
for possible identification, and he wished
to protect himself and so demanded an
order from some one in authority.

NEW YORK, Aug. 12.â The disposition
to sell and take profits which was mani
fest' in the 1 late'- trading of yesterday on
the Stock Exchange continued to-day and
an Irregular market resulted. The hesi
tation of London contributed to this re
sult. ' The movement encountered * good
resistance at the decline and was followed
by a slight recovery, but realizing made
the close irregular. Some of the high
priced railroad stocks which had success
fully weathered the market movements
during the week fared rather badly dur
ing the realizing process, though their
wide declines were not great compared
with the preceding upshoots. The selling
seemed to be prompted by some uneasi
ness over the complexion of the bank
statement, Judging by the repurchases
which set in after the appearance of that
document. ,It showed all of the expected
decrease In cash reserves, but the con
siderable contraction in the loan item was
a total surprise, In view of the revival
of the demand for money in speculation
during the week. The demand for loans
has been sufficient, in fact, to result in
hardening the tone for money to carry
over the end of the year. It is thought
probable that the trust companies may
have begun taking over loans from the
banks, thus accounting for the reduction
in., that item by the banks. The reports
from the peace conferences were also
watched closely, and the fact that the
counter proposition of the Russians was
taken under consideration by the Jap
anese envoys, which seemed to point to
day to further negotiations, helped in the
late recovery. The very large buying of
Reading and Ontario and' Western kept
up the tone of the market, but this was
offset at the last by the marked pressure
upon St. Paul and Amalgamated Copper.
Total sales of bonds, par value, J855.000.
Confidence in the outcome of the grain
harvest has been gaining strength for
some time past. But the Importance of
the Government report of crop conditions
on August 1 is accepted as being the ear
liest authoritative statement which can
be safely accepted as the final making of
the grain crops. The showing published
at noon on Thursday is accepted as mo
mentous. The winter- wheat crop Is now
beyond danger, and with the spring
wheat crop, which remains exposed to
only a modicum of danger,, promises a
combined yield only second to that of the
bumper year 1901.

Predominate in the Many Special Offerings for Tb-Morrow
Largest assortment we have ever shown and greatest values we have ever offered in Table Linens, Blankets, Comforters, Bed- ._
spreads, Sheets, Pillow Cases, Towels, Lace Bed Sets, Curtains, Couch Covers, Door Panels and Drapery Materials.
One year ago we held a closing-out sale of rugs that was by far the greatest event of like character ever held in San Francisco. Per-
haps you remember it. Possibly you shared in the advantages of it. If you did, so much the better for the force of the story.
It is for the purpose of surpassing the sales record of that busy day that we have fixed special prices on house furnishings for
to-morrow. For every one person that was interested in rugs, probably fifty will be interested in at least one of the items
involved in this sale.
If you have any house furnishing goods want, come here early >to-morrow. You will be well repaid.

PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 12.â Despite
the sentiment against President Cor
nelius P. Shea, which has been plainly
manifested at various times. during: the
convention of, the International Broth
erhood of Teamsters, there were enough
delegates favorable to his administra
tion to secure his re-election. Contrary
to expectations, Edwin Gould, who had
been Shea's chief opponent, did not
seek the nomination. President Shea's
only opponent was Daniel Furman of
Chicago, president of the Truck Drivers"
Union. President Shea defeated him by
the close vote of 129't0 121.

they came pretty fast and that he liked
them. He did not become drunk in
New York and drank temperately there,
as Jnvariably afterward. In reply to a
question as to how much he drank at
Fort Douglas, Taggart replied:
"I dare say about the same as you
would have drunk."
The courtroom burst into a roar of
laughter at this.
Tag-gart kept whisky and beer for
the entertainment of guests and usually
drank with them, but never alone. He
would offer guests drinks six times a
day if they would drink them that
often, but himself would observe his
habit of sobriety by reducing the size
of his drinks.
At Camp Hlghwobd (now Fort Sheri
dan, near Chicago) , Taggart had met
and married "this little woman," as
Smyzer invariably calls Mrs. Taggart.
He said that she had been reared to
abstain from liauors.
During the courtship, he thought
"this little woman" had been infatuated
wich him. He denied that he "induced"
her to drink beer when she first Joined
him at Plattsburg barracks, but said
he raised no objection when the trained
nurse who accompanied her from Chi
cago suggested it. She drank it, she
said, for medicinal purposes and he ac
cepted her reason as true.
There Is talk in Wooster of a possible
reconciliation of the estranged husband
and wife as a result of some of the
developments of the trial, and It Is
pointed out that the captain in his tes
timony has been as considerate of Mrs.
Taggart's feelings as he possibly could
be under the circumstances. V

TTOOSTER. Ohio, Aug. 12.â The cli
max of the Tagrgart divorce case came
to-day when Captain Taggart declared
en his direct examination that he had
always been a faithful husband. This
was near the close of his testimony and
was in answer to a question by his
ettorney.
While on the stand the captain con
tinued his story of the events leading
up to the separation of himself and his
wife. He told of the farewell with his

VISIT OUR QREAt^ PLAN T^r SEE -i THE FINEST PAINT SHOP IN THE WORLD.CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Aug. 12.â That all rail
road companies are not flint-hearted
is evidenced by an incident that hap
pened only a short time ago and in
which the Southern Railroad, which has
its offices in Washington, figured. A
little mountain girl, living on the line
between Spartansburg, S. C, and Ashe
ville, N. C., discovered a serious wash
out on the railroad track near her
home. A heavy rain had so washed
away the roadbed that the track could
not possibly have helfi up a train of
cars.
This little girl without hesitation ran
to the track and listened. She knew
that a train was due from one direction
in a short time, but she feared that
there might be one coming from- an
other direction. She soon caught the
sound of an approaching train and ran
as fast as her little feet could carry
her in the direction. She succeeded in
flagging the train â a passenger train â
as it neared the washout.
The train crew and passengers of
fered her anything and everything. Al
though poor, she declined their gifts.
The railroad officials were informed of
the incident by one of the passengers.
A letter was written to her and in it
was a check from the company. It
was not a measly check, either, but one
of such amount as to make the heart
of almost any one glad.
The check was declined and returned
to the company. President Spencer
then wrote her again, asking what she
would permit the company to do for
her. She wrote back that she greatly
desired an education, but that her
parents were too poor to do any more
for her than send her to the country
school.
President Spencer Immediately ar
ranged to have her placed in a high
class female college in Ashevllle, with
a guarantee that every expense would
be met during tlje period of her educa
tion. The letter of thanks that came
from the little girl is filed away as one
of the precious archives of the South
ern Railroad.
The comparatively new State, War
and Navy departments building Is al
ready showing signs of wear. By this
is not meant that there is need of
painting and decorationg and that sort
of thing, but actually wearing out In
spots.
Almost every one who goes upstairs
instinctively uses the rail side of the
stairs. When they get to the top they
also swing around close to the end of
the railing before starting off down the
corridor. There is a decided cup
shaped depression worn at the .head of
each of the several flights of stairs Just
where the wear of thousands of feet
have converged " on . the one spot. In
the course of time It will be necessary
to take up the tile that receives this"
extra friction and replace It, though
the rest of the floor remains perfectly
good.
The United States will within a few
years be producing Camembert, Rocque
fort, Erie and Limburger cheese In great
quantities. The Department of Agricul
ture is about to let down the bars so that
milk-giving sheep and goats needed In
the production of cheese of those, kinds
may be imported. Heretofore Swiss goats
âIn fact, goats from all parts of the
world â hax*e been rigidly excluded on ac
count of foot and mouth disease.
The Harlem goat will be eclipsed as
soon as the Swiss goat arrives. His
glory will depart as soon as those Inter
ested in goats discover that the depart
ment has located an island between Sta
ten Island and the Jersey coast that can
be used as a quarantine station for in
coming goats. It Is believed they will be
imported by thousands.
Ground on the island has been leased
and in a very short time regulations will
be promulgated that the Importation can
be commenced.
The Department of Agriculture is also
experimenting with germs to ripen cheese
of the pungent order. It has been dis
covered that a certain microbe ripens Ca
membert better than the European germ.
The American Insect is -fastidious, too.
It does not associate with the putrefac
tive germs, which spoil the cheese and
make it so much more disagreeable to
the smell than it ought to be.
But probably as soon as the Americans
begin making these highly flavored
cheeses Dr. Wiley, the chief of the bu
reau of chemistry, will get after the
makers for trying to sell their product as
Imported stuff. One maker in New York
State is In trouble because he Is trying
to do that He Is following directions
from the. Bureau of Animal Industry,
only to get into difficulty with Dr.
Wiley's bureau.

BERLIN, Aug. . 12. â Aa engineer from
Cologne has just discovered a new sys
tem for petrifying the bodies of the dead.
Immediately after death takes place the
body is placed in a coffin and through a
hole In the lid a liquid solution of plas
ter of paris is poured on the body so as
to fill the coffin. It is said that as Boon
as decomposition begins the body ab
sorbs all the salicylic add and the chalk
from the cement and in course of time
it becomes petrified. The Inventor claims
that a body so preserved could take the

HONOLULU, Aug. 12.â Several young
women of Honolulu are walking around
a large part of the Island of Hawaii, and
although they have been out over a
month they were, according to last re
ports, enthusiastic over their trip and
expected to continue their pedestrian ex
peditions for come time. In the party are
Mrs. Ashley, Mrs. Livingston, Miss
Wlnne, Miss Huntlngton and Miss Hart.
The majority of those in the party, are
members of the Punahou College faculty.
The party walked over the Puna district
last month, covering about 800 miles.
They went to the Volcano House and
walked from that place down to Wal
ohinu, a distance of fifty miles in two
stages. They left the Volcano House
one day at 7 a. m. and reached Pahala
at 9 p. m. of the same day, covering
thirty miles of the worst possible kind of
walking.
The crowd had planned to walk from
Walohlnu to Kona across the lava beds,
but they were dissuaded from making
such a trip, as tKo wild dogs are reported
to be very ferocious in the desolate places
over the lava flow, and it was thought
that the women would expose themselves
unnecessarily to danger If they ventured
upon that expedition. The ladies are all
dressed alike. They wear short army
cloth Ekirts, shirts and army felt hats.
They carry their blankets across their
shoulders and also carry canteens. As a
rule they have been able to arrange
their trips so as to have no difflculty in
securing accommodations over night and
to get dinner or breakfast.

HONOLULU WOMEN ABE
GREAT PEDESTRIANS
LONDON, Aug;. 12.â Every now and
thÂ«n 'the grayoty of the metropolis Is
augmented by apposite suggestions or
queries by Mrs. John Lane. A really
pretty wit Is possessed by this Ameri
can wife of an English publisher and
her dissertations on domestic and other
problems In the pages of the "Fort
nightly" and kindred reviews are In
variably stimulating. Mrs. Lane, who
is a Boston woman, has now called at
tention to the significant fact that even
the greatest realists have not ventured
to bestow eye-glasses on their heroines,
and asks why, In literature, glasses are
incompatible wlth v romance with a
woman while they never damage a
man? "The hero's eye-glasses may
grow dim with emotion," observes Mrs.
Lane, "but if the heroine weeps behind
her glasses, she 1b lost." The fair writ
er does not attempt to explain the mys
tery, but winds up by declaring that
the place of female spectacles in ro
mance Is that of the famous blue ones
in "East Lynne" â to disguise the hero
ine.
Some little regret has been expressed
over the decision of the London author
ities to make way with the ancient obe
lisk at the end of Blackfrlars Road.
It Is to be replaced by a big clock. The
obelisk may be described as a literary
relic, fqr it was erected to commemor
ate Croeby'a battla with > Parliament
which ended with permission being giv
en to the press to publish the debates.
Dr. Johnson often drove past the
obelisk on his way down to Streatham.
and in 1775 Mrs. Thrale wrote to him
"We have had a . great thunderstorm.
It has even split the obelisk in the
Blackfrlars Road; no exaggeration In
this; you may see the crack when you
come home."
All lovers of Goethe will be Inter
ested in a. volume of conversations be
tween the poet and the French savant,
Frederick Soret, which is about to be
translated into English. The conver
sations, which have never before been
made public, have been collected by Dr.
Hugo, the director of the "Weimar State
Archives, and have Just appeared in
print in the fatherland. The volume
will consist of some hundred and sixty
eight special talks between these two
remarkable personalities.
Apropos of the admitted need for a
genuine sympathetic life of George Bor
row, a new story of the author of "La
vengro" has just found its way into
print. When he set out for Russia Bor
rows sole funds consisted of a five-,
pound note, change-for .which. lnto goltl
his mother procured for him at his re
quest. Writing to her from St. Peters
burg, Borrow urged her to be more
careful in the future as one of the five
sovereigns which she had given, him
proved to be bad. "However," : added
this strangest of missionaries, "thank
the Lord,- I succeeded in passing it in
London."
The famous "Greek towns that claimed
Homer dead" were only slightly more
numerous than the houses in Paris that
claim Hugo during some portion of his
career. The author of "Les MJserables"
began hia married life In a winding- little
slum dwelling. Later he lived In the
Place dcs Vosges. And this week upon
the festival of St. Victor, Hugo's name
day, aulte a number of youthful enthu
siasts went in procession to a house in
the Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne, where
he lived at the^moment of his banish
ment of the Becond republic. In apart
ments on the first floor overlooking a
courtyard Hugo had his residence for a
year. The concierge who served the
great novelist is still at his post, hale
and hearty and full of reminiscences,
while the house contains a lodger who
HveH there In Hugo's day. The author's
youthful admirers placed. a small bust of
him In the courtyard.
Tho last home of Victor Hugo in Paris
will be commemorated by .means of a
memorial tablet, which will be affixed to
the mammoth apartment building soon to
be erected on its site. This small, two
storied house Is now being demolished,
and in another fortnight or so will have
disappeared altogether. Standing in what
was formerly the "Avenue d'Eylau and is
n6w the Avenue Victor Hugo, the little
tree-bowered house has many associa
tions with the great novelist's declining
years. Here It was that In January, 1882,
all Paris gathered to honor â¢* tho poet's
eightieth birthday. On the same day: all
the children of the Paris schools marched
past Hugo's window singing his songs
and throwing wreaths of flowers as they
passed on -to a pile, which before all \u25a0 the
children had gone by reached to the win
dow Bill, above which the writer's white
bearded face smiled down his thanks.
He le^t the house for the last time In
his cofim. All who bore names In France's
literature, arts, sciences and music fol
lowed s the casket, ten or more wagon
loads of flowers followed,, and hand-in
hand behind ,the flower laden wagons
walked Jeanne and | Georges Hugo, tho
descendants \u25a0 t or , whom Victor wrote his
famous book on the "Art of Being Grand
father." The furniture .which hla house
contained has been placed In the Hugo
Museum In the Place dcs Vosges.
. It Is when Irishmen are enraged that
they are most prolific of bulls. The out
burst of wrath occasioned by the pro
posed redistribution bill, which would
considerably . reduce . the number, of rep-;
resentatlves of the Emerald Isle at West
minster, has produced some ; gems. ; TbÂ©
following extract from , a leading . article
In ths Galway '.. Western News ; contains
more of them than I can . remember ever
having seen before packed In ' such: small
space: "Being the weaker, 7 England haa
planted her heel on the 'â¢ throat of Ireland
for. a century and robbed us without pity
or remorse. To ', rob "; a man ' of his purse
and then maltreat ; him for not ; having ; It
would pass muster among pitiless brutal
crlmeÃ, but to kill and slay, a man to;the
point of death' and then murder.: him ' for
not dying quick enough" Is one point bet
ter In v the catalogue of . human. infamy.
It Is enough to make Irishmen set ' their
teeth and talk silently In groups."; Ho
wever, (the redistribution bill stands small
chance : of . being passed,' and humor" will
be a sufferer, thereby. _ / V

Mrs. Katie Trambosh, who conducts. the
rooming-house," said the woman would
not eat food for a week preceding Au

Abuse, cruelty and Intemperance are
the causes alleged by Henrietta Salomon I
in her suit for divorce from L L. Salo- j
mon of 122 Twenty-ninth street. The wife
alleges that the cruelty was not
confined to herself, but was practiced
upon two minor children of the husband.
At times, so the complaint says, the wife
and children were compelled to leave
home to avoid assault and in fear for
their lives. Salomon was yesterday
brought before Police Judge Fritz on a
charge of disturbing the peace.
The separate charges cover several
I typewritten pages that recite the extreme
of physical suffering and mental anguish.
On one occasion the husband beat and
choked his wife and struck his little
daughter Hattie with a piece of crockery,
badly cutting her head. Another time, it i
is alleged, he unmercifully beat his j
youngest daughter. Flora, smashed and
broke furniture and drove them from
homo all night. ~ \u0084 \u25a0
In addition to furniture smashing and
plate throwing, the complaint alleges that
one night he entered the room where his
wife and his daughter Hattie were sleep-
Ing and thrust al ighted newspaper In the
bed.
The couple have been married several
years and Salomon owns considerable
property and has money in savings
banks. His wife asks for the custody of
the children and alimony.
Yesterday the 16-year-old daughter,
Florence, alleged that her father abused
and ill-treated her and threatened to kill
her if she did. not stop all prosecution in
his case. In default of $2000 bail Salomon
Is in the City Prison awaiting trial.
Manle A. Grace has filed a petition for
divorce from Terrel B. Grace, alleging
desertion and non-support. \u25a0 - f
Algeltinger holds that the curbs were
part of the property conveyed to the city
and should have been left undisturbed.
He said that he had notified Chairman
Brandensteln of the Finance Committee
Algeltinger had ascertained that the
euros had previously been placed in posi
tion by the company, which had Intended
to parcel the lot to be sold In small sub
divisions for residence purposes. After
the lot had been conveyed to the city the
curbs were taken up, to be utilized by
the company for other property which It
has on the market for sale, or so runs
the charge.
Commissioner Aigeltlnger of the Board
of Public Works yesterday made an in
vestigation of the report that the San
Francisco Realty Company had removed
the curbstones surrounding the lot on
Frederick street, between Stanyan street
and First avenue, after the corporation

ments for the celebration of Admission
cay at Sacramento. Twenty-seven par
lors were represented.
The first f pecial will leave on the Bth of
September at 7 o'clock in the evening.
F. H. Conn, secretary of the Sacra
mento committee, stated that the commit
tee felt that the fight in San Mateo slated
f^r Admission day would interfere with
the celebration. A committee of three
was appointed to wait on the manager of
the fight to have the date changed.
Secretary Conn presented the following
programme of events for celebration
*eek:
Two years ago, 68,000 votes were cast,
of which Schmitz in round numbers re
ceived 26,000. It is figured that 75,000
votes will be cast at the coming elec
tion, and it would not surprise the poli
ticians if Echmitz should receive 30,000
and the candidate of the Republican
party 40.000.
The Union Labor party managers an
nounce that their nominating conven
tion will assemble at Lyric Hall the
evening of August 30. It is presumed
that Ruef favors an early convention in
order to appropriate the Labor Day pa
rade of September 4 to the rest of his
stock in local politics.
The organization committee of the
San Francisco Republican League met
last night at Headquarters. 636 Market
street, and adopted a resolution thank
ing: newspapers of the city for active
support in the canipaign preceding the
recent primary election.
The committee also received reports
from League delegations of the Thirty
fourth, Thirty-fifth, J Thirty-sixth? Thir
ty-seventh, Forty-flrst, Forty-second,
and Forty-third Assembly districts, sup
plementing reports received from the
Twenty-eighth, Thirty-eighth and For
tieth last Thursday night. Assurance
ie positively given that all the League
delegations are solid in their opposition
to Ruef and that there is not the slight
est sign or suspicion of wavering Jn
any quarter. The organization com
mittee is In possession of facts which
justify the public announcement that
the League's majority of delegates is
fully 100. The Ruef minority is in pro
cess of disintegration. Citizens who
were placed on this ticket without their
knowledge or consent and who were
elected to represent their respective dis
tricts have frankly declared their in
tention to Bupport the cause of good
government under the auspices of the
Republican party.
The League intends to at once de
vote its energies to the work of regis
tering the unregistered citizens of San
Francisco. It is estimated that the num
ber of men entitled to vote, but still
unregistered, approximates 15,000. It is
obvious that 40,000 registered voters did
not participate in the primary election
of August 8. Calculations are made
that 75 per cent of this reserve vote is
in sympathy with the principles of the
San Francisco Republican League.
Registration for the municipal elec
tion will close on September 27. To
morrow, under the auspices of the
League, a precinct house to house can
vass will begin for the purpose of as
certaining the name of every unregis
tered voter.

went to their room. The body wa3
found lying face upward on the kitchen
table, with the head resting on the gas

the suicide was discovered, the Coroner
was notified, and the body was removed
to the Morgue, where an inquest will be
held.

end the life which had become a burden
of continued illness. William H. Mc-
Crimmon, formerly a member of the
Oakland Police Department, threw a
blanket ov^r a eras stove in the kitchen
of his apartments at tho Avenue House,
at 129 San Pablo avenue, early this
morning, and covering his head with
cloth, turned on the gas and inhaled
the poisonous fumes until death came.
So quietly did McCrimmon make prepa
rations to end his life, that his wife and
daughter, who were asleep in the room
next to the kitchen, were not awak
ened, and knew nothing of the tragedy
until this morning.
For the last two years \u25a0 McCrimmon
had been suffering from cancer in. the

ing him informed him that an operation
was necessary to save his life. Ever
since he learned that his condition was
so serious, the deceased had been very
despondent.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
OAKLAND. Aug. 12. â Mrs. Agnes
Dlcksou. residing at 1466 Curtis street,
had a narrow escape from death this
morning in the fire which destroyed her
home and damaged two other dwellings.
The nre was caused by the explosion of
a lamp in the kitchen, and so rapid was
the headway made by the flames that
Mrs. Dickson had barely time to escape
from the house before. the entire struc
ture was wrapped in fire. When the
lump exploded the blazing oil was
thrown In every direction, and only the
fact that Mrs. Ditkson was at the othei
side of the room saved her from being
covered with the llaming fluid.
The house, was almost completely de
stroyed, and its contents were a total
loss. The building and furniture were
insured for $1650. The home of S. P.
Bruce, adjoining that of Mrs. Dickson,
was damaged to the extent of $200, and
that of B. M. Reidsmay. at 817 Twenti
eth street, was set on fire by sparks, the
damage being about $50. A vacant
house on the corner of Twentieth and
Curtis streets was also slightly dam
aged.

The remains were taken in charge by
Acting Deputy Coroner Kent of Center
vine, and an .inquest will be held to dis
cover if possible the cause of the suicide.
For come time it had been remarked by
friends of Miss Lewis that she seemed to
be greatly discouraged over some un
known trouble, a^id from being smiling
and happy she became at times moody
and seemed to be brooding over some
secret trouble almost too great to bear.
She was considered one of tho prettiest
girls in t!ie vitinity of Irvington and had
a large circle of friends. Her reputation
throughout the neighborhood in which
she lived was of the best, and her death
comes as a great shock to the residents
of Irvington and the neighboring district.
Her father and mother are prostrated
over the terrible death of their daughter
and are unable to discuss the case or to
remember if she had ever said anything
that would lead to the belief that she
â¢was unhappy.
GIRL SEEMED DISCOURAGED.
"Miss Lewis and Tells were together at
the Fourth of July celebration held at
Irvington and he afterward took dinner
at her home. At that time, however, the
girl's parents had no inkling of any at
tachment between the young people.
Both parents of the girl denied positive
ly that they had any idea of the cause
of their daughter's suicide. They refused
â¢to acknowledge that any love affair was
at the bottcin of the tragedy, but from a
chum of the girl it was learned that for
some time she had lived in fear of being
forced to marry a man whom she did not
love, but whom her father had chosen
for her husband. It has also been learned
that Miss Lewis had for several months
been keeping company with a young
rancher named Joseph Tells, who lives
near Livermore, and it was whispered
among her friends that she had secretly
become engaged to him.
When the girl told her parents what
she had done her father rushed to the
barn and there found the vial which had
contained the poison. The size of the
bottle indicates that Miss Lewis took
about thirty grains of strychnine. As
toon as he realized that his daughter had
to!d the truth when she said that she
had taken the poison Lewis hurried to
Bummon medical assistance, but hardly
five minutes after the srirl had told her
parents what she had done she breathed
her laFt. and by the time the physician
\u25a0 who had b.-en sent for reached the ranch
the victim of her own rash act had been
dead for Bcme time.
Only a few moments after leaving the
table the girl reappeared at the door of
the room in which the members of the
family TrerÂ«? assembled, and telling them
what she had done fcade her father and
mother good-bjr. ThenN almost uncon
scious, she staggered through the house
to the front door and fell on the front
porch, writhing in agony.

OAKLAND, Aug. 12.â Rendered desper
ate, it Is alleged, by the declaration of
her father that ehe must marry the man
he had chosen for her, whether she loved
him or not. Res:Â» Lewis, the 17-year-old
daughter of Antone I. Lewis, a prominent
fruit grower residing on a large ranch
near Irvington, committed suicide thiÃ
morning by taking a dose of strychnine.
She had Joined the other members of the
family at breakfast, but before the meal
was finished ehe left the table, and with
out giving a hint by word or look of her
terrible purpose she went out of the
house to the barn in the rear, where she
swallowed the poiscn, which she had
kept concealed in the barn.

BAN QUENTIN, Aug. 12.â The Board
1 of Prison Directors met here this morn
ing and transacted considerable routine
business. Owing to the 'rapid increase of
applications of convicts for dental work
to be paid by the prison, the . board au
thorized the Warden to communicate j
with the Eastern institutions and ascer- j
tain what -allowance. If any, is made for
dentistry on inmates.
Joseph James, a San Francisco lamp
lighter, who was serving a twelve-year
sentence for assault, was paroled. The
applications of Quan Sick and Wong
I Jaung, alias Irish, who were sentenced
in 1888 to life imprisonment for a murder
committed in San Francisco, were acted
upon- favorably and the board recom
mended them to the Governor for parole.
The escape of Charles John Thomas, a
paroled prisoner, was reported, and the
board offered a reward of $50 for his ar
rest. Thomas was sentenced from San
Francisco in 1894 to serve a twenty-year
sentence, and was released on parole on
January 14. 1905. He worked for Betfey
Bros, in San Rafael up to five weeks ago,
when he disappeared. His failure to re
port monthly, as prescribed by the parole
law, caused the directors to offer the re
ward, and they will make an example of
him when he is caught.
; The directors approved and adopted
the finger print system of identification,
and directed the wardens of both prisons
to take the finger print of all prisoners
and send them to the State Bureau of
Criminal Identification. The Bertlllon
and the De Pue systems of identification
have been adopted and have been used
by the California State prisons for, sev
eral years, and, with the finger print sys
tem, the identification of criminals will
be perfect. Director F. H. de Pue of the
State Bureau of Criminal Identification
will have charge of the finger print work.
The same system of finger printing is in
use in the United States military prison
at Fort Leavenworth. Kansas.
A San Francisco druggist named Dun
lap was appointed druggist at the prison
by Warden lompkins to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Druggist James
Anderson a few days ago.

The' publication Is Intended to show
the estimate placed upon the railroad 3
for business purposes and It purports to
give their market value rather than the
tax valuations. In a note It Is explained
that "the value submitted was deter
mined not with a view to discovering
a proper purchase price for the .rail
ways of the United States nor as a ba
sis for taxing these railway properties,
but aa one step in ascertaining for the
Census Bureau the total wealth of the
United States.
"Whether or not." the note continues,
"the value submitted represents the
value upon which the railways of the
United States might properly be taxed,
depends upon whether the State under
takes to tax the roads at their full
commercial value. Including the values
of both tangible and Intangible prop
erty, or whether it seeks to confine its
taxation to the value of the tangible
property alone. In the former case the
value submitted is believed to be sub
stantially correct, so far as it ooncerns
the operating properties of the rail
ways; in the latter case it is too high."
The percentage of tax valuations com
pared with the commercial value Is glvea
for the various States aa follows:
Alabama, 35.9; Alaska, â ; Arizona. '9.7;
Arkansas, 27.8; California. 213; Colorado.

TAX VALUATION.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 12.-Accordin S . to
a bulletin of the Census Bureau tho com
mercial value of the railroad property in
the United States Is 5H,2Â«.5C2.0e0. dis
tributed among the various States aa fol
lows: '
l^ater he consulted with Prentiss
Gray, his [.business manager, and the
two decided that it must be a hoax.
Later,, when Gruy received a letter from
Miss Boye's attorney advising him to
settle the young woman's claim at once,
the matter assumed a more serious as
pect.
Neither Gray nor Gregory has en
gaged counsel, but neither will admit
the intention to either pay the claim or
compromise It in any way.
Miss Boye's drawing, for which she
wants money, is of a young woman
standing in pensive mood and non
chalant attitude at an entrance to the
Greek Theater. Miss Boye believes it
is air worth at least $25. Its real worth
may not be determined until art experts
appear on the stand in her suit for tho
$25 and givo testimony regarding the
merits of the drawing. . r's' '
"Well, you know, of course, I will
expect to be .paid for it." said Miss
Boye.
"Wha-a-t?" yelled Gregory. â¢ .*\\i%
"Yes; about $25 will do." said Mlsa
Boye.
Gregory collapsed.'
"It is." answered Gregory.
He was called v. â¢> by telephone a day
or two beforethe .iiue and -Gold ap
peared for sale while' it ,was still Yon
the prt-ss, an J. abke'd? by Miss 'Boye if
her drawing was being used. 8 g
The irony of the circumstance is re
vealed when it is known. that Jackson
Gregory, editor-in-chicf l of, the Blue and
Gold, hesitated long before using Miss
Boye's contribution, not regarding it
with favor as a work of art.. He finally
decided to print the drawing rather than
hurt Miss Boye's feelings by rejecting
the contribution. . , ,
BERKELEY, Aug. J2. â An extraor
dinary demand for money,,made by MiÂ»i
Bertha Boye, a university â¢"co-ed," upon
Jackson [Oregrory and Prentiss Gray,
editor and business manager of the last
Blue and Gold issued at the university,
has been followed by a threat of ar
rest and ..litigation* unless the money
desired is paid at once. Bertha Boye is
a student at the Hopkins Art Institute
in San Francisco. She was on the art
statf of the lOOti Blue and Gold, with a
number of other art students from the
institute, tvhl'jh is an institution af
filiated with the University of Califor
nia. It was part of her duty, according:
to the editors, to submit Drawings for
use In the Blue and Gold, which is al
ways profusely illustrated, student tal
ent being responsible for the work.
Miss Boye demands money for her
share of this work, and the astounded
Ulue and Gold men who have received
her demand are now awaiting legal
summons which will call them into
court, where the young woman appar
ently proposes to test her claim. She
believes her work for the Blue and Gold
was worth at k-ast $25, and has asked
Gregory and Gray, editor and manager
of the volume in which her drawing
appeared, to pay . her that sum. Miss
Boye hns retained a lawyer in -San
Francisco to represent her. and the at
torney has informed Prentiss Gray
that he can save trouble and expense
by settling the claim out of court.
Miss Boy<:'s action is regarded as
unique. Never in the history of the
university has an artist or writer for
the Blue and Gold been paid money for
his or her work, nor have any ever ex
pressed a desire to be paid. "College
spirit" is supposed to prompt the work
ers, and love of alma mater presumably
Inspires all to do their best, according
.to the collete men who are most fa
miliar witli campus traditions. To all
of these, who sympathize with the
luckless editor and manager of the '06
Blue and Gold, Miss Boye's demand for
money lias come 'as a distinct shock.

.> "Now,' that my^great suffering- is over. It Is
hard for me .to think what I endured for" so
long a time. Every month I was so sick that
I could hardly. stand my suffering.. The awful
.back- pains, 'the -pain In both sides' of my ah-
domen. the dizzy sick headaches, my disgust
for food and loss of appetite â well, words fall
me when I try to tell how sick I was. 'I bad
two . good doctors. They tried ; hard to help
me.' buf.it was" of. no' use; they could not.
Finally,- when- \u25a0'all hope- from medical treat-
ment was atv an. end. I , was lo be turned over
to the surgeon for an operation. - In my weak-
ened ' condition, I am sure that 'l could never
have lived through > an operation. It was 'a
fortunate day when 1> learned of the Electro-
Chemic. treatment for. bad. cases like mine. . My
"husband^ took me at once and placed me under
the Electro-Chemic course, and from the first
treatment I began to improve. Right from
the start the awfulpaln&j. began, to leave, and
now,' ln 'two months' time, at a small expense.
I feel so well that; I feel it my duty to tell
other -suffering women ' about thla wonderful
new Electro-Chemic treatment. (Signed.)' .

He rented the room last Wednesday
from Eugene Bennett, the landlord,
saying that he had just come out of a
hospital, that he had no money-and that
.on the next day, he would get some. On
Thursday he gave the landlord"7s cents
and an old watch as security for. the
rent. At that time he gave his name
as Gustmann. On his person were found
a card of the Winchester House and a
note in pencil reading as follows:
"The bellboy who brought. my, break
fast Sunday morning and stayed in my
room stole from me about $10 and $5 In
gold and silver coin .which I-had in a
small bag. FRANK FULLER."
DaleDewey, a clerk at the Winches
ter Hotel, called at tho Morgue later in
the day and made a statement with
reference to the note. ' . He said that
three * weeks ago he brought Fuller's
breakfast to his room and changed a
$20 coin, giving , Fuller Jl9 20. Fuller
left the next day and went' to Oakland,
where he remained. a week. On his re
turn hÂ« complained forthe first time
that he had lost hls'money.
The body was emaciated,, and the
autopsy showed that the deceased had
suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs
and cancer. Detective Coleman was de
tailed to investigate the ca.se. - : ; ,

years old, supposed to be that of Frank
Fuller, was found, yesterday, morning,

Yesterday a letter was received from
P. 11. Messinger, who' Jives at 15 Weaver
avenue, Bloomfleld, N. J.)' inclosing ' a
money order for $80, ! with a request to
send him deeds for.- eighty acres of the
oil land the company advertises in the
New York press. M. Austin '.was very
much elated on opening this demand. W.
A. Beck of Evergreen Park, Cook Coun
ty, Illinois, also sent" a 'hurried demand
for certified deeds to- JlO worth of this
great-offer. With.thelr letters they asked
for' a description of the : remarkable pros
pect so they, can invest further before tha
In speaking of the number, of letters
asking about the land. 'the secretary
said she. did not see why ; King
refused to furnish descriptive literature
of the land, because "naturally, the In
vestor wants â¢to know .'.what 'he is buy-
Ing." It is promised that, this lack of lit
erature will be supplied on King's return
from Seattle, if the pubHc doesn't invest
too freely before then./
No means of learning when the whole
of the alleged 4SOO acres have been sold
were in .the office, but the public is : as
sured that surveys of the location have
been made and charts drawn. King, ad
vises' each investor to purchase -eighty
acres or more to facilitate the working of
the claims.; .' . -\u25a0 . V '.- -r ~ "

She could give no reason for the adver
tising in the Eastern press and not In the
papers of the "coast, but said her husband
thought a better field was offered there.
King told her, she said, that Californians
would not understand the chae'p price the
land was being sold foi\and might think
the offer was not exactly legitimate/ His
reasons for not developing it, . she said,
were because of the many other like, pro
jects he was incumbered .with and; It
took too. much of his time to operate
them all. . . .
"Mr. King |j lived in Alaska for- over
twenty years and knows the value of the
mineral deposits in this Kayak region;"
said the secretary. "He is now In Seattle
arranging, some; of the business : of trie
company, '' for it is not incorporated; as
he and I^are Uhe only owners of the
stock. We just started in business ihere
three weeks ago, yet are having great'

No reason for the ridiculously low
figure at" which the land is* quoted was
oifered by King's secretary yesterday.
No explanation was tendered as, to how
King got possession of a 4800-acre
tract enabling him to profit at selling it
for less than the Government offers the
unsettled wilds of the West. .:â¢ " \ .
â¢It is said there are several oil seep
ages on the tract. The company, prom
ises that it will be only a short while
until the land will be of inestimable
value and advises each holder to refrain
from disposing of his share at any
price. No samples of the oil seem, to be
extant, yet the public is assured it is of
the: highest quality. . .: \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 â¢ - â
A bunch of letters containing' money
from purchasers was lying on the desk,
showing the confidence Easterners" have
in, the offer.: All .the description .they
have, of the alleged oil land is taken
from a meager three-line advertisement
inserted; in , the papers of the Atlantic
coast and Middle West.
M. Austin, as she calls herself when
she Is not Mrs! F. H. King, says she is
the secretary of this concern and said
yesterday that F. H. King, -who -com
prises the Oil Springs Land Company,
had a large income from mineral hold
ings and was merely disposing -of a
tract of 4800' acres of oil'land in Kayak,
between Yakutat and Valdez, Alaska, -to
let the Eastern people in "on some
"charity." - S .
Contrary to the usual custom, the
office of the alleged company is not
furnished in regal style, for it is the
plan of the promoters to do an exclus-,
ive mail order business. Through the
medium of the Eastern press the prom
ised \u25a0 get-rlch-quick proposition ;'..-. Is
placed before the public. King - : has
given Instructions to the woman in the
office to ignore all letters of inquiry as
to the location of this land and requests
for/ descriptive literature '_ about ..the
prospects for developing It."
' "We are being put to such an expense
by offering this land at' these low
rates," said the alleged M. Austin* yes
terday, "that we only consider mall
with money inclosed for a deed."--

Oil Springs Land Company Is getting

as advertised, sends each of the Invest
ors a "ecrtlfied deed" to ; a parcel of

Bohemian Club Brings Jti i Midsummer High Jinks

Many prominent San Franciscans, as
well aa nearly, all of the representative
people of Marin County, were present
at the ceremonies. The building is
nearly ready for occupancy and | the
pupils will be in their new home
within a few days. pi 1
The <new .building was constructed
with part of the sum of $30,000 raised
by bonding the town of Sausalito. The
money so raised has been- used entirely
for bettering the public school system
of "the .town. The schoolhouse dedi
cated to-day is one of the finest in the
county.
The new building is a fine two-story
structure, erecfed on the slope of one"
of the prettiest canyons near the town.
It is an ideal situation from sanitary
and artistic standpoints. .. - , \u25a0 â¢
grounds In front of the building to
watch the flag-raising. At a signal
from Professor Davidson the two sail
ors raised the Stars and Stripes to the
top , of the staff, while "The Star-
Spangled Banner" re-eoched -through
the canyon. The. 300 school children
saluted the colors. The . singing of
"America" by the gathering concluded
the exercises.

Special Dispatch to Tha Call
-TUCSON. Ariz., Aug. 12.â Although
peace negotiations are said fÂ»
bo pending between the mili
tary authorities In Sonora and
the Yaqui rebels,- the Indians have tak
en to the warpath in at least two sec
tions and an uprising is reported in a
third district, although the reports of
the latter encounter have not been con
firmed.
General Pienada and a force of three
hundred men returned to-day to Her
mosjllo* to. organize after a ten days'
campaign against the Indians. The
savages had seized two ranches and
were in possession of a large amount
of arms, ammunition and supplies when
General Pienada was sent out from
Hermoslllo. The Indians were" fore
warned when he took the field with a
force which outnumbered them two to
one and at his approach they fled to
ward the mountains, but were overtak
en* at La Bronzuda, where they made a
desperate stand. After, a fight which
lasted for several hours the redskins
fled leaving ten dead on the fie!d and
a large number of wounded, who were
taken prisoners. Many others were
captured in the pursuit which
followed. The Indians ca3t away their
arms and packs during the flight and
practically all of their munitions of war
were" taken by the Mexican soldiers, so
that no further trouble is expected from
them. â¢ \u25a0 Â«
A few days ago a band of Taqui raid
ers came down out of the Santa ' Ur
sula mountains near San Jose de Guay
mas, but were driven back by Captain
Jose Gallndo and a detachment *of
troops stationed at that point. Six of
the raiders were captured and shot.
â¢ Another detachment of troops has
Just been sent to Rayn, where it is re
ported that the Indians ; have taken to
the warpath.

warship, Manila," -which -was captured by
Deweyr at Manila and which has. been
converted Into- a prison V ship "'- at'the
Mare" Island -navy yard, 'will -soon 'be
ready to receive' naval prisoners. ' .- :
Father . Valentlnl began his. "re
marks" in a lighter vein. He main
tains! that the young mind could be
better developed in a schooihouse such
as Sausalito now owns than in a
chanty. In closing he spoke of the liar-:
mony that existed between the repre
sentatives of the different religious
sects In Sausalito. "We all stand. on
the same platform." _he said. "We all
serve the same master."
The Rev. Dr. Maxwell of Sausalito
closed the exercises with a-brief prayer.
The audience' adjourned to the
rniKST t.u,ks or hahmow.
Then Town Trustee W. J. Martin was
introduced. In a well-rounded and im
pressive address he told what the public
schools of America stood for. "The public
school," declared Mr. .Martin, "comes as
near being an exemplar of the ideal in
stitution as anything can be." Mr. Mar
tin closed his speech with a well-chosen
Quotation from Justice Story, which he
delivered in the manner of a true orator.
Thomas J. Boyd, District Attorney of
Marin County, opened â¢ with a pretty
tribute to Â£3tfr. Martin's eloquence.
"After what your eloquent Trustee, the
representative of the, great San Fran
cisco press, has said, I can add but lit
tle." said District Attorney Boyd. "I
congratulate you, people of Sausalito,
on what you and your Trustees have ac
complished." .
Captain Cantwell humorously re
marked that what he had intended to
say had already been used by those
who preceded him, but managed to keep
his audience Interested aJI the time he
was on the floor.'
Judge T. J. Lennon said in part:
"This scene reminds me of a time in
my life long gone by when 7. saw the
same smell scats, the teachers and the
same sort of gathering that is here to
day â and as usual I am at the foot of
the clars. I have been spelled down.
"This building is a proud tribute,, to
your Trustees and k proud tribute, to
you. It has no equal in Marin County."
The Judge then spoke in favor of. a
movement to build a joint high school
for Mill Valley and Sausalito "and
dwelt upon the possibilities of a greater
Sausalito.
SAUSALITO, Aug. 12.â The entire town
turned out to-day to \u25a0witness the dedica
tion of the' fine new schoolhouse wfiich
lias just been completed.' Business was
suspended entirely during the afternoon
and crowds packed the new building to
be present at the impressive dedication
ceremonies. The best known orators of
Marin County made addresses. . Among
those who spoke were Judge T. J. \Len
non. Town Trnstee W. J. Martin, Pro
fessor C. O. Sharpe. Captain J. C. Cant
well, commander of the U. S. S. McCul
loch; Thomas P. Boyd. District Attorney
of Marin County; Professor Davidson
and Father Valentinl.
With the raising the Star sand Stripes
over the new schoolhouse the ceremonies
closed. As the flag was raised to the top
of the etaff by tvyo Jackies from the Mc-
Culloch the school children of Sausalito
raised their hands in salute and a brass
band played "The Star-Spangled Ban
ner."
Shortly after 1 o'clock the pupils of the
Sausalito schools were assembled near
the depot. Headed by a brass band they
marched up to the new building. Over
2jQ girls and boys were in the procession.
It was intended to hold the exercises
in the open air before the schoolhouse,
but the weather would not permit Those
in charge decided that the ceremonies
should be heJd inside. Commodious as
the new building Is, it could hardly hold
the crowd that poured into it.
As many as could crowded into one of
the rooms; the remainder thronged the
halls and stairways. Mayor J. Thomas
introduced Professor C. O. Sharpe, Su
perintendent of Schools, who acted as
chairman. Professor Sharpe made some
well-chosen remarks and introduced Pro
fessor Davidson, the popular Marin Coun
ty educator.i Â»

AN EXPLANATION.
I am an attorney more than 70 years old
and retired with no office and living alone
in a den. I resided for nearly twenty years
in Santa Rosa, in Sonoma County, Cal., and
know the State like a book. When I came
to Oakland I sold a few pieces of country
property for my friends and the result is
I have a list of more than . 200 ranches, large
and email, on my books for sale. In nearly
every county In the State. If you want a
home in California, where winter never
chills, leaves never fade and roses always
bloom, I have got it for you. I take none
but good places with good Improvements,
such as I would want were I buying a home.
They are all near good markets,, schools and
churches. I owned a farm near Utlca, New
York, for twenty-five years and grew email
fruits and other crops and made a success
of it. I can advise othera better for the
experience I have had. I am fretting new
places on my list and If you do - not . find
what you want on this list, : write me for
others and I will suit you. Tell me where'
you want to locate, what you want to do â
whether raise stock, keep a dairy or raise
grain, vineyard, fruit, chickens â¢ or pigeons â
and I can send you direct to the place you
want. IRA C. JENKS, 1209 Broadway, Oak-

SUMMARY.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 12.â Earl KiSr.
er of Dayton, who first acquired national
fame as a bicycle racer and recently" aa '
an automobile racer,- met \u25a0 with .an. ac
cident to-Say at the opening of the Clever
land Automobile Club's summer meet that
may prove fatal. In warming up prior,
to the opening of the races, when no- one
was anywhere near him on; the< track, Ills'
machine was suddenlyV'noticed to turn in'
toward the fence and crash through.
Another racer Just 1 behind hurried .to
the grandstand and secured physicians,
who found that Riser's -left leg 1 -was re-
duced to pulp while. "his . right shoulder
was dislocated and he was -otherwise, cut.
and bruised. :â¢ . ;â¢*;..* " ' \u25a0 " - â¢'* "" " " '" â¢"

proved too much for San. Francisco to
day, and tho visitors were shut out: to
the tune ofK'to'o~ The \u25a0 Seattle' pitcher
allowed .four hits .'in the 'first "three
Innings. After that the visitors were
helpless, eleven of them fanning. Seat
tle scored twice In the fourth', on.', a
pass to Hart, a hit by Frick,- two-steals
and a timely swat by .Frary. A hlt^by
Kane, coupled with a number of passes
and a hit batsnian by Hitt resulted In
three more in the sixth. Hitt was not
found often." but his wildness was cost
ly. Houtz, who performed the- fielding
feature of the day, by, nailing a hard
fly. from Wheeler's bat In the first
Inning and catching Waldron at the
plate by a pretty throw, was forced to
retire from the game as a result of ber

CHICAGO. Aug. 12.â H. Chandler.
Egan successfully defended his "title of
national golf champion. in the. eleventh
annual tourney at the Chicago Golf
Club's links to-day at Wheaton, de
feating D. E. Sawyer of Wheaton, 6 up.
5 to play in the finals. TheExrnobr
player, who has thrice -in four years
taken the measure ' of all. western as
pirants for the Western Golf . Associa
tion title, added his second victory in
the United States G. A. Havemeyer Cup
to his great performances, j Sawyer was.
often brilliant, in his play in the hea>t
breaklng; struggle with- the .champion,
but he \\'as weak at vital times on the
putting green. Champion Egan was
steady at all times with his 'iron cliib,
although often getting discouraging
lies by his terrific tee shots "in " the
morning round. In the afternoon he
avoided some of this .trouble by. using a
cleek at the narrow places, in the
course. As in the^history of golf from
the beginning of the- game,, the" cham
pionship was won and lost on the put
ting green. Egan invariably. s was.do.wn
in the regulation two puts when he gtot
to the green. Sawyer missed ; several
opportunities to get holes simply by
falling down on points. Morning round:

The largest gallery that ever turned out
in the West to view a golf match fol
lowed the players In the afternoon.
Weather conditions early in, the day when
the finalists appeared for the struggle
were threatening, but as soon as Sawyer
with the honors sent away, a long drive
the sun burst out and provided a sultry
day for play. \u25a0 â¢ -\u25a0, .. â¢ ;
Sawyer Is a finished golfer, but he lacks
two great requisites that â¢ bring cham
pionships when pitted" against Chandler
Eganâ force, for work out of bad lies, and
deadly accuracy In not exceeding the
bogey rule of two puts to. a green: '. ' %
Although neither contestant played what
might be. termed championship golf in the
morning, Sawyer was never; up on the
title holder, except at. the second â¢hole. 1 [
Egan gets his second U. S. G. A. mas
sive gold medal, and the Havemeyer
trophy remains with Exmoor for a year.
Egan -Kill attain his,, majority August
21. Sawyer is only 23 years old. "AIL I
can say," said Champion Bgan, after Ws
victory, "Is that I'm glad for Chicago
and for Exmoor that the trophy remains
in the West." '\u25a0â¢';. â¢. . '- â¢

OAKLAND.
TACOMA
The champs made desperate efforts to
overtake the leaders in the Bixth and
eighth innings. In the former round they
succeeded In setting one tatty on two hits
and in the eighth they led off with two
singles. The Oakland twirler again showed
in brilliant form by not allowing them to
score. Casey, the first man up in the
last frame, was given a tralk. but he
could not get farther than second, as his
team mates were not there with a bingle.
The score:
Sheehan had an off day &t third. He
allowed Schmidt, the flrisx man up for
Oakland in xhe fifth, to go to second on
a single by making a wild throw to Nor
clyke. Van Haltren sacrificed and Schmidt
registered Oakland's last tally on
Francks* Jnflell out. -. .â .-.-
In the fourth Van's men did thÂ« pret
tiest piece of batting: worfc Â«rÂ£ the present
teries. Dunleavy sent a clean single tb
center and then Tacoma's lnfleld played
in for a bunt. Kruger fooled them- by
pending a hot single alone the third base
line. McLaughlin tried to throw Dun
leavy out at . third. . Kruger . took . ad
vantage of the throw ana with clever
base running went to second. Kelly made
the third successive hit and brought Dun
borne. Kruger scored on a throw to sec
end to catch Kelly. The next two men
wer.t out at first. .
Oakland finally tooic a brace at Recrea
tion Park yesterday and to the delight of
the faithful who have been patiently
waiting for the unexpected to happen put
an end to Tacoma's row of victories."
Ihe Commuters were otrtfcarted nearly
fw-o to one. yet they nosed out the
champs by a run. Pretzel Schmiddy was
on the mound, and though batted quite
freely at times he pulled himself out of
some tight places, when a hit would have
been disastrous. Busher Brown allowed
crJy fire hits, but three of these came in
a row In the fourth. The score: Oakland
3, Tacoma 2.
It looked bad for the tallenders In the
third, but this was where the German
i-svirler showed a flash of his real form
and let the Northerners down with, a
Blogie tally. With the bases full and no
outs Nordyke sent a hign one to Van
Haltren in center. Brown, who was on
third, scampered home. Doyle tried to
neat the throw in, but was nailed at
ihird. The next man died on an infield
hit.

IIKSI. LTS OF GAMES.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. 12.â
Treasurer R. W., Barrett of the Associated!
"Students has " completed the football ,
schedule of 1905. . Seven varsity games
have been slated and one will mean a|
trip for the squad to Ix>s Angeles. . -
! Practice will probably begin the first
j Monday after the opening of the college
I and on September 23 the varsity will meet
I the eleven of St. Vincent's College of Los
j Angeles upon the Stanford campus. The
{ game will be played upon the old field, as
I will all of the practice games, and possi
bly the Intercollegiate freshmen contest.
September j3O Willamette University of
Salem, Or., will "visit the Cardinal and
will try conclusions with the team.
The next date upon which a game will
probably be played is October 7. An at
tempt to arrange a game with the Uni
versity of -Oregon has been made, but
as the date was not entirely satisfactory ,
to the northerners it is likely this '/will
remain an open opportunity for the re
playing of -some, previous, contest, or for
the obtaining a new match.
The contest next in importance to the big
intercollegiate struggle between the Blue
and Gold and the Cardinal- will be the
clash of the freshmen teams- of the rival
universities. This game will be held Oc
tober 14. The struggle of the youngsters,
which formerly did not attract much-In
terest outside of the classes \u25a0 involved,
has gradually increased to a point where
all students of both universities are vit
ally concerned. Last year the 6truggie
was extremely close, the final result de
pending upon a decision of the national
football committee. This has led to an
especial feeling -of rivalry to the coming
contest of the classes of 1909. Owing to
the intercollegiate agreement between the
universities, the freshman game will be
held at Stanford, regardless of the con
dition of the new football field.
The University of Nevada eleven will
meet the Cardinal October 21. This an
nual contest has always been a close
and interesting match. The results of
the- contests between Nevada and Cali
fornia and 'Stanford have always been
used as the best. .method of obtaining. a
line on the merits of the two rivals.
The only game. which the Cardinal will
play on any gridiron other than their
own will be a struggle with the Sherman
Indians at Los Angeles. The southern
trio will be an excellent thing for the
team, coming as it does irpon the twenty
eighth of October. -This is so far ad
vanced in the . season that should the
-squad show any signs of staleness the
change would probably act Â»s - a tonic
November 4 the eleven of Pomona College
will appear upon the Stanford campus.
November 11 will be the climax of the
season. This is the date set for the
California-Stanford game. The contest
will take place upon the Stanford campua
for the first time in the history of the
universities*.. \u0084-,...... \u0084- â¢:. .. ,

OLD PEOPLE
AND THEIR TROUBLES
Old People have more of the pains,
aches and discomforts of life than do the
young. This is perfectly natural, be-
cause their blood is not so vigorous, nor
their powers of resistance so great, and
troubles that a younger, healthy constitu-
tion could resist often afflict them.
Durinff the civil war I contracted Ca-
tarrh and suffered with its effects for
many years. I tried various remedies
and doctors, but with no good result.
OnÂ© da 7 I found ono of your pamphlets
and read it carefully. I decided S. S. S.
was the medicine I was in need of and I
beg-an its use at once.' My health was
dreadful, and as I was petting; alone: in
years, I had most of the pains and ail-
ments incident to that time of life; but
. after taking- this great remedy for awhile
r I betran to improve and soon found my.
self a strong, well man. lam now more
than 75 years of age, but my health is
rood, because I take an occasional bottle
of s. S. S. Nothing equals it as a tonic
and blood purifier, and I recommend it
to those needixvir such a medicine;
Fordyce, ArkT I*. S. LOCKBIDOB. i
Rheumatic pains, sleepless nights,
fickle appetites, etc., are not imaginary ;
with old people, as is sometimes thought. ,
They need a medicine that will supply
their blood with its lost vigor and build
up and strengthen their constitutions.
& S. S. is the ideal remedy for Old Peo-
ple. It is made entirely from roots,
herbs and barics, and does not injure the
system in the least as do those medicines
containing mineral ingredients. S. S. S.
is gentle in its action, purifying the^lobd
\u0084 of all poisons
**aÂ£sr |,UB'Â£^, U8 'Â£^ j ie^Jtj,y
PURELY VEGETABLE, constitution. It
is the greatest
cf all tonics for increasing the appetite,
toning up the stomach, promoting the di-
' gestion and building up the entire system.
