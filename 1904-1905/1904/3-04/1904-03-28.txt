VOLUME XCVâ NO. 119.
CHEFTJ, March 27.â The Japanese have made another disastrous attempt to block the entrance to Port Arthur harbor. At 2 o'clock this morning four merchant vessels, escorted by torpedo
boats, approached the harbor. They were discovered by the Russian vessels on scouting duty, and as they drew near the Russian forts opened fire upon them, while a single Russian torpedo-boat dashed out
to attack. This torpedo-boat sank one of the merchantmen, and the remaining three were run aground. ]S T one succeeded in reaching the harbor entrance. The Japanese fleet, consisting of sixteen war
ships, remained off Port Arthur until daylight. Atdawn Admiral MarakofFs fleet went out .to. engage "Admiral Togo v but tlie latter withdrew, his fleet disappearing to the southward. It is said the crew of
one of the merchantmen was captured. The Russians lost seven men killed and thirteen wounded aboard the attacking torpedo-boat.

The Japanese cruisers which supported the attack exchanged
shots with the batteries and then drew off, after which Vice Ad
miral Makaroff took a steam launch and examined the fireships.
V,v /An hour later the Japanese torpedo flotilla, followed by Vice
Admiral Togo's fleet, came up from a southerly direction. Just at
daybreak Vice Admiral Makaroff with his fleet sailed out to en
gage the enemy, but after the ships and batteries had fired a few
long-distance shots, Vice Admiral Togo decided to decline the
issue and disappeared to the southward.
The news of the repulse of Vice Admiral Togo's second at
tempt to block Port Arthur created much rejoicing in the Russian
capital, and among all classes the gallantry of the Silni and her
commander is the subject of high praise; but above all the moral
effect of Vice Admiral Makaroff's willingness to engage the
enemy," showing that he considered himself strong enough to fight,
produced a splendid impression.
. In high official circles this new effort to "bottle up" the Rus

the Japanese, as stated by the press on March 24, are now prepar-
ST. PETERSBURG, March 27.â Under cover of darkness
this morning Vice Admiral Togo made another desperate at
tempt to bottle up the Russian fleet in Port Arthur, but he failed
again, and when, after daylight, Vice Admiral Makaroff steamed
out to give battle, the Japanese commander refused the challenge
and sailed away.
The Japanese practically repeated the tactics of February 24
by sending four ships, preceded by a torpedo-boat flotilla, with
the exception that the merchant ships this time were armed with
Hotchkiss guns for the purpose of keeping off the Russian tor-
The enemy's attempt was discovered by means of the shore
searchlights and a heavy fire was opened from the batteries and
from two gunboats which were guarding the entrance to the har
bor. The Russian torpedo-boat destroyer Silni was outside on
scouting duty and to the dash and nerve of her commander, Lieu
tenant Krinizki. is chiefly due the complete defeat of the plans of
the Japanese. He at once made straight for the oncoming ships,
under a hail of fire from the. Hotchkiss guns, and torpedoed the
leading ship, which sheered off, followed by the others, three of
them being piled up on the shore under Golden Hill and one un
der the lighthouse. The Silni then engaged the entire six tor
pedo-boats of the enemy, coming out from a terrific fight with six
killed and her commander and twelve of her complement wound
ed^ but on the Japanese side only one boat's crew was saved. In
addition, according to unofficial reports, it is believed the Japanese
lost two torpedo-boats.
MUCH REJOICING IN THE RUSSIAN CAPITAL.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 27.â An official dispatch from
Port Arthur to the Emperor says that at 1 o'clock this morning
the Russian searchlights disclosed four big merchant steamships
making for the entrance of the harbor, supported by six tor
pedo-boats. A heavy fire was opened on them by the batteries and
some warships.
The torpedo-boat Silni, commanded by Lieutenant Krinizki,
turned the merchant vessels from their course by blowing up the
prow of the first and then boldly attacking the enemy's torpedo
boats. In the fierce fight which followed Chief â¢ Engineer
Swyereff of the Silni and six marines were killed and the com
'mander and twelve men were wounded.
The Japanese plan to block up the entrance to Port Arthur
was frustrated, however, and the channel is still clear.
MAKABOFF'S REPORT OF THE ENGAGEMENT.
Vice Admiral Makaroff, commanding the Russian naval
forces at Port Arthur, has sent the following telegram to the Em
"I beg most humbly to report that at 2 o'clock this morning
the enemy made a second attempt to block up the entrance to the
inner roadstead. For this purpose they dispatched four large
merchant steamers convoyed by six torpedo-boats, to the entrance.
"The enemy's ships were promptly discovered by the search
lights and were bombarded by the batteries and by the guardships
Bohr and Otvajny.
"Fearing the enemy's ships might break through Lieutenant
Krinizki, commanding the guard torpedo-boat Silni, attacked the
enemy and destroyed the bow of the foremost Japanese, steamer
with a torpedo. This steamer turned to the right and was fol
lowed by two others, with the result that the three were stranded
to the right of the entrance. A fourth steamer went to the right
of the enemy's ships and likewise sank to the side of the fairway.
The Silni then battled with the enemy's six torpedo-boatsl En
gineer Artificer Swyereff and six seamen were killed and the
commander and twelve seamen were wounded.

"At daybreak the enemy's battleship and cruiser squadrons
appeared and I proceeded with the fleet under my charge to meet

"The second attempt to block the entrance to Port Arthur has

who" acted as they did during the first attempt.
"The harbor remains perfectly clear."

Another view of the Japanese admiral's purpose, which is less
entertained, is that he believes that bombardments from Pigeon
Bay would be disastrous to the Russian fleet if it were compelled
to remain in the harbor, he having ascertained from observation
that the Russian ships always pass out during the high angle bom
bardments and that a big shell dropped on a battleship could easily
pierce the deck, and, exploding, might completely destroy it.
ing for a heavy landing of troops in the Gulf of Liaotung, either
at Newchwang or on the west coast of the Manchurian neutral
zone, to effect which in safety the immobilition of Vice. Admiral
Makaroff's fleet is absolutely essential while the transports are be
ing convoyed around the southern end of the peninsula. If the
attempt had succeeded it would have required several days at least
to blow up the steamships and clear away the wreckage, during
which time the Japanese would be assured of non-interference in
the carrying out of their purpose. The failure of the Japanese
this morning may seriously hamper their plans, as the ice in the
Liao River is going out, and when the river is fre^ from ice its
mouth can easily be mined.
The conviction continues to grow here that the Japanese
have concluded that it would be inadvisable to make a direct
frontal attack ion Manchuria from Korea against the whole Rus
sian, army and that it would be necessary to land a flanking
column in the Gulfof Liaotung to divide the attention of the Rus
sians, and, if possible,- to seize the railroad and cut off Port Ar
thur. The ground above Newchwang is perfectly familiar to the
Japanese, having used it for a year during the Chino-Japanesc
War. ';
Some experts even go so far as to express the belief that Vice
Admiral Togo was covering the movement of troops in the Gulf
of Liaotung this morning and that, therefore, he was compelled to
exercise great caution and to decline the Russian offer for an en
gagement.

PpÂ«:al Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, March 28.â The Matin's Har
bin correspondent says a rumor is v be
ing circulated there to the effect that
the war will last twenty years and
that it will not really begin before
September, the rains making July and
August unfavorable for military oper
ations.
"Despite China's protestations of
neutrality," the correspondent con
tinues, "General Ma persists in ad
vancing into Manchuria. If this move
ment is combine'd with the Japanese
operations the Russians will be obliged
to act against General Ma, who con
tinues to move northward, although
the Peking Government, it 1b under
stood, has ordered him to retire."
The St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Echo de Paris cables as follows:
"An officer of the naval general staff
informs me that the -\ four steamers
which the Japanese endeavored to sink
in the channel at Port Arthur on Sun
day morning were in excellent condi
tion and worth about $1,000,000. All the
Hotchkiss quick-firing guns aboard
them have been recovered. When the
steamers stranded Russian officers
promptly leaped aboard and cut the
electric wires which were intended to
fire the explosives."
The newspaoers poke fun at the
Japanese and say their admirals go on
bombarding Port Arthur just as a man
goes daily to his office to work.
Gli Bias quotes a. clairvoyant who
foretold the operation for appendicitis
upon King Edward and the postpone
ment of his coronation. She foresees
now that on March 29 the Japanese
will capture Eort 'Arthur; in April the
Japanese will win a great land battle,
in which both sides will lose heavily;
In May an international conflagration
threatens, and France, j England and

movement' will force Russia to seek
peace and a treaty between Russia and
Japan will be signed next Autumn.

ST. PETERSBURG, March 27. â It
is stated that General Kuropatkin
will remain at Mukden. The active
leader, so to speak â the SkobelefC of
the war â will be General Daniloff.
I am assured that the official of the
commissary department, who sold im
portant documents to the Japanese,
was hanged on Tuesday last in the
Schluesselberg prison as a traitor to
his country. His name was Irkoff.
The discovery of his treachery was
made in the following manner: Irkoff
had absented himself from his office,
the chief of which, on arriving there,
asked for a certain document. This
happened to be in the possession of
Irkoff. When told that the latter
was away the chief insisted, saying
the paper was important and Irkoff
must be found. Upon this a fellow
worker and friend of Irkoff was dis
covered, who said that one day when
Irkoff had left the key of his desk
at home he had loaned him his, at
Irkoff's request.

SHANGHAI, March 27. â Trade re
turns of the Imperial Maritime Cus
toms for 1303 were published yester
day. Mr. * Morse, the statistical secre
tary, draws attention to the develop
ment of imports of cotton fabrics from
Japan, while British and American fig
ures show a serious falling off,
amounting under various headings to
between 11 and 40 per cent.
Imports of yarn show a decline of 50
per cent in English spinnings, while
Japanese Bpinnings show an Increase
of 60 per cent.
This result is principally due to the
direct trade between Japan and North
China. It is noteworthy that impom
of yarn, which in 13S2 represented not
more than 20 per cent of total cotton
Imports, are now 52 per cent.
BERLIN, March 26. â The most
elaborate and complete plans are now
In operation to. keep Emperor William
accurately informed of the war's pro
gress during his absence on his cruise
and his stay in Sicily. The* Emperor
took with him several huge maps of
the countries -and coasts involved in
the struggle and a boxful of little
paper fiags, with which to mark on the
maps the disposition of the Russian
and Japanese land forces and the lo
cation of their warships. In his suite
are two military officers, intimately
acquainted with the Russian fortifica
tions in the Far East and with the
structure and carrying capacity of the
Siberian Railway.
The Emperor's sympathies are alto
gether with the Russians and the re
verses they have met have made these
sympathies stronger, if possible. He
has an adamantine belief in the im
minence of the "yellow peril." He
says often:
"Europe will be confronted with
this peril if the nations of Europe do
not unite against it."
Intimate and frequent communica
tions are passing between the Em
peror and the Czar and the Russian
general staff has got valuable advice
from Berlin more than once. It is
hinted even that General Kuropatkin's
appointment as commander in chief
was at the Emperor's suggestion.

CZARINWS DEMOCRACY.
,-- There is much discussion in diplo
matic and official circles over the inti
mation that Great Britain, through the
n^w French entente, is seeking to ad
just hff- differences with Russia. The
Novosti. which has long been the lead
ing exponent of this idea, to-day edl
' torlally contends that there is no real
conflict of interests, and that nothing
ftut an ingrained mutual distrust keeps
the two nations apart. The Novosti
â¢goes further in jroposing a European
coalition under the auspices of Russia,
France and Great Britain to combat
the "yellow peril," and says:
"We have always maintained that a
# rrw tr!rle alliance would assure the
Â» balance of power, not only in Europe,
but throughout the world."

of their having any hard usage.

Modern Merchant Craft Used in
Futile Attempt to Block
the Harbor.
Admiral Togo has made another unsuccessful attempt to "bottle up" the Russian fleet at Port
Arthur. Four merchant steamships, convoyed by torpedo-boats, were sunk or driven ashore by the Rus
sians before reaching the entrance of the harbor. A Russian torpedo-boat, after sinking one merchant
man and turnlne the others from their course, gallantly engaged the Japanese flotilla. Seven of her marines
were killed and her commander and twelve men wounded. This torpedo-boat was so badly damaged that
6he erounded, but was afterward floated. On the merchantmen the Japanese had rapid-lire Hotchkiss
guns, with which they raked^the decks of the attacking Russian boat.
Following the failure *bl this attempt to block the harbor, which was made several hours after mid
night, Admiral Togo's fleet appeared at dawn on the horizon off Port Arthur. Admiral Makaroft* sailed out
with the Russian fleet to engage it, but the Japanese commander withdrew without accepting the chal
lenge. ,
Army men in Washington b elieve that with Commander in Chief Kuropatkin's arrival in Manchuria
Russia will assume the aggressive immediately. The firmness with which Admiral Makaroff Is handling
the naval situation at Port Arthur has greatly added to Russian prestige. Russia is closely watching the
Chinese military operations and believes that Yuan Shi Kai, the Chinese commander, 'will take a hand in
the war at the first fayorable opportunity. ;
The Call's St. Petersburg correspondent says that General Kuropatkin will remain at Mukden to di
rect the. Russian land operations, while General Dnniloff will assume active command In the field.
Martial law has been proclaimed at Xcwchwang. The mouth of the Liao River has been mined
and the Russians are hurrying other preparations to resist the Japanese attack, which is likely to be de
livered without much delay. - .

The New York Times makes some
caustic remarks about Alfred Austin,
the British Poet Laureate, in noticing
his recent lecture on "The growing
distaste on the part of the many for
the higher kinds of poetry." On this
score it avers that Mr. Austin has no
cause of complaint, since the growing
distaste for his effusions Is not be
cause they belong tq.4he higher kinds
of poetry, but quite the contrary.
They might do, it thinks, for the An
nual Floral Offering % or The Young
Lady's Companion, and some of them
on topics of international Interest
would grace the columns of Punch,
but in the way of epics they "fit the
occasion much as, a round peg. fits a
square hole." This is severe, but will
find an indorsement by the great body
of readers. The Poet Laureate has
been a pensioned attache of the royal
household of Enggland from a remote
period of history. The office of court
Jester, also aji appanage of the house

Representatives of the American
Baptist, the Southern Presbyterian and
the Disciples of Christ African Mis
sions called upon President Roosevelt
and Secretary Hay last Friday and de
scribed the affairs in the Congo coun
try as viewed from the missionary
standpoint. The principal Â¦ feature of
the conferences between the President
and Secretary Hay and the missionar
ies consisted of stories by the latter of
atrocities practiced on the natives by
their Belgian rulers. The missionaries
said that their work waa rendered
nearly valueless by the attitude of the
Belgian officials who monopolized all
the food supplies, making It difficult
for the missions to procure vegetables
or fowls or anything to eat from the
natives, who were obliged to turn their
produce into the hands of the officers.
Then by the cruelties practiced upon
the natives the latter were driven away
from the missions and the s.chools were
emptied. In addition It was -pointed
out that no respect was shown for the
property rights of the missionaries, and
it was on this last ground thafthe del
egation thought the United States Gov
ernment might interfere. "
Secretary Hay asked the missionaries
to reduce their views to a written
memorandum, which he said he would
consider, though he could not hold our
any definite promise, of relieving the
situation so far as the natives wera
concerned, because the United States
was not one of the signatories to the
treaty under which the Congo Free
State came into existence. A state
ment of the events leading up to the
present condition of affairs was subse
quently prepared by the delegation for
transmission to the State Department,
in which It was declared that as a re
sult of the absolute power of the King
of the Belgians the freedom of trade
guaranteed by the conference of Ber
lin was now a thing of the past. The
President promised to give the sub.
ject laid before him by the mission
aries careful consideration and re
quested that he be supplied with an
accurate and detailed statement of it.

system are without power because of
the flooding of the power house," near
White River. Communication with the
north and w^st of Indianapolis is cut
off by the flood, which has swept away
bridges. The city is still without wa
ter owing to the flooding of the. water
works pumping* station. Manythouses
have been carried down White River
and shattered against the stone
bridges which connect the city proper
with the "suburbs. Several plants are
closed down, the water . flooding the
cellars.
To-night a break was found. In the
levee at River avenue and the Mayor
ordered sacks of sand and bales of hay
transported to the scene .with wfiichVo

Run Over by a Cab.
The members of the committee are
contemplating: a visit to the Isle . of
Pines to/ look over the field and see
if it would be worth anything to the
United States and if this Government
would be justified in assuming sover
eignty of. the island, in view of the fact
that a large number of American citi
zens have settled there and. invested
money in lands and farming indus
tries. '
When the treaty of Paris was nego
tiated it provided that ownership of
the. Isle of Pines should be determined
at some, future time. It was well .un
derstood that a sovereignty over this
Isle of Pines was left unsettled for the
purpose of giving the United States
something which it could exchange
with Cuba, for coaling stations. There
never was any intention Â¦ on the part
of President; McKinley to retain con
trol over the Isle of Pines.
Until recently there has been com
paratively little opposition to a .rati
fication of the treaty, but Senator'Pen
rose of Pennsylvania has undertaken
to defeat It because a large number of
Americans from Illinois, Indiana and
Pennsylvania have acquired land on
the Island "and propose to engage in
business there.
â¢WASHINGTON. March 27.â Owing
to strong opposition in the foreign re
lations committee to the Cuban treaty,
which provides for the turning over of
.the Isle of Pines to the Government of
Cuba, It has been decided by the com
"mittee to postpone action of the con
vention until the next session of Con
gress. ; '",
The case of Judge Charles S. Wayne
is now properly before the House and
is a matter of the highest privilege.
Palmer, In charge of this case, says
that he will not press it during the con
sideration of the sundry civil bill, but
he will call up the case at the conclu
sion of that measure. Whatever the
minority views, to be filed In this case
by Representative Gillette of Califor
nia, are, It is predicted that the decision
of the House can be reached without
prolonged discussion. : i* "
WASHINGTON, March 27.â Senator
Heyburn has given notice that to-mor
row he will move to take up the pure
food bill, but the enemies of that meas
ure will seek to prevent consideration
of it by constantly keeping: appropria
tion bills. before the Senate. This pol
icy was made plain by the early ad
journment of the Senate on Saturday
which was taken to prevent the com
pletion of the District of Columbia ap
propriation bill on that day, thus forc
ing it over and affording material in
the way of appropriation legislation for
discussion on Monday. The opponents
of the pure food bill count on continu
ing the discussion of the' District bill
until the Postofflce appropriation bill
can be reported on. If the District bill
is passed before the postofflce bill is
ready for consideration the conference
report on the army appropriation bill
or the bill authorizing a new depart
ment building in Washington may be
made to serve the purpose of holding
off the pure food bill.
The sundry civil bill has the right of
way in the House to-morrow, and
Chairman Hemenway believes that it
will require the whole week to dispose
of the measure. Should this not be the
case two special orders have been set to
follow itâ pension bills and the omnibus
bill.
LONDON, March 27.â The follow
ing telegrams have been, exchanged
between the Associated - Press and
King Leopold of Belgium:
"To His Majesty Leopold II, King
of the Belgians, Brussels: The Asso
ciated Press, representing the news
paper press of the United States.
would be happy to cable to the United
States any statement your Majesty
might see fit to make in relation to
the charges against the Government
of the Congo Free State regarding
atrocities committed upon' the na
tives, made to President Roosevelt
and Secretary of State. Hay by a del
egation from the missionary congress.
"The American press Is anxious to
hear both sides of the case and would
welcome any reply from your Majesty
to the allegations of the missionaries
that their rights are not respected
and that the natives are now in a
worse condition than under the Arab
slave regime.
"MANGR. ASSOCIATED PRESS."
King Leopold replied through his
secretary as follows:
"Manager" the Associated Press:
The King attaches great importance
to the impartial sentiments of the
American press. I have mailed you
official documents from the Congo
Free State, in. which you will find all
the facts essential to a full and truth
ful statement of the case.
"CARTEON DE WIART,
"Secretary to the King."
It is feared that later reports may
reveal a greater loss of /life. Much
stbek will be killed. The tornado swept
a path 300 yards wide. . l

Speaking of the condition of the Em
peror, Embassador Meyer said: "Em
peror William looks extremely
well, just as he did when I saw him at
Kiel last summer. His voice is as
strong as ever and he is in excellent
spirits."

She Awoke.
It; was night now.
Ah, Well, night was as good as the
day. What did it matter? V
Nothing mattered now, neither time
nor tide nor circumstance, for. was she
not deadâ the woman of his heart?
Of course, they had had their little
differencesâ what married couple does
not?â and\ the tears {filled his eyes at
memory of some of .their spats. He
had so often been in the wrong. She
she was an angel, and they had loved
each other. .
: Now she lay dead before him. How
had this thing happened? How had
this great grief come to him? Why had
the Master given her to him but to take
her away?.

attention is to be paid this year to

expensive trifles, some of them worth

topped with a huge rhlnestone, on
which was a design of wreaths traced
out in fine rubies, with studs of em

favorite, stones for -the making of these

Half the asparagus crop of the State
was destroyed by the recent floods In
the Sacramento Vallev. The growers
of that delectable vegetable have seen
their asparagus beds utterly destroyed
by the rush of waters and now they
face ruin. The price of asparagus will
be high this year and It will be well
indeed if ordinary people will be able
to' place the vegetable: on their tables.
What is more, the canneries of the
State will have no crop with which to
work and as a consequence many peo
ple will be denied employment by the
closing of the industry.
This gloomy picture of the future of
asparagus is painted by Professor
Ralph E. Smith, professor of plant
pathology at the University of Califor
nia. . Professor Smith has .just re
turned from the asparagus country.
He "says he saw nothing but ruin on
the entire trip. On thousands of acres
of land on Bouldin Island this : vege
table has been killed. Andrus Island,
Tyler. Island and all the other low
land islands that have provided a
prosperous living to thousands in
other years are bare of. crops.
"The asparagus beds are all under
water," said Professor Smith to-day at
the, university. "Mr. Hickmott, one of
the. largest growers on Bouldin Island,
informs me that his entire crop is. lost,
which means an immense loss. to him.
His company packed 120,000 cases of
asparagus last year out of 300,000
packed in California, so you can see
what the loss to him amounts y,to.
Other, men have the same>story to tell.
"About the only places that have not
suffered are the farms in Alameda
County, but the acreage is insignificant
compared -to the islands under cultiva
tion in the Sacramento district, and
the yield will not anywhere cover the
loss." *

2148 Center Street, March 27:
Physicians as Patients' Confidants.
That physicians should be accorded
the confidence of their clientsâ perhaps
in a larger measure even than clergy
menâhas always been pretty generally
recognized. This confidence is, Indeed,
freely bestowed in a good many direc
tions, sometimes, in fact, to an entirely
unnecessary extent. The physician is
frequently made acquainted with in
ternal family matters which have ab
solutely no bearing upon the case tor
the treatment of which he had been
called in, and which are therefore not
of a. nature to exercise the slightest in
fluence upon such treatment. In this
way the physician is sometimes drawn
into the position of general family
father confessor. He will be made the
confidant of the husband in regard to
things which should be kept a secret
from the wife; the wife reveals to him
things of which the husband is to know
or suspect nothing; the daughter pours
the little secrets of her heart Into his
more or less unwilling ear on the un
derstanding that he must not under
any circumstances divulge them to her
parents, and the young man appeals
in the strictest confidence to the doctor
with regard to his sexual experience,
or, rather, lack of experience. The pic
ture is complete enough without the
special mention of the cook and the
butler. And as the medical father con
fessor no more than the clerical one can
betray the confidence reposed in him,
he Is in the unenviable position of hav
ing something to conceal practically
from every member of the household
with regard to every other member.
"While this general confidence, and
consequent familiarity, lies to a certain
extent In the very nature of things, it
cannot by any means be likened to
a bed of roses, except perhaps for the
stings of .the thorns. There can be / no
question that the doctor who has at
tained to the position of the family
confidant "via medical practice" is des
tined to experience a gradual but un
mistakable decline in the power he
wields and in the reverence and recog
nition which his counsel once inspired.
He Is not spared the truth of the prov
erb that "familiarity breeds contempt."
and he may be sure that in the event
of a ' serious sickness the family will
insist upon calling in a second, con
sulting physician, and eic transit gloria
mundi! It is, however, not only the
ethical part of the question that re
solves itself to the disadvantage of the
medical confidant, but also its conse
quences from a monetary point of view.
The more familiar the relations become
between family and physician the less
will the latter be compensated for the
time and knowledge he extends, and
many an overfamiliar physician has
experienced, to his detriment and dis
may, that the familiarity he enjoyed
was the, only compensation for his ser
vices that he ever received.-rAmerlcah

Anglicizing Japan.
A Japanese Minister, now in his own
country, has taken decisive measures
to root the national customs, the na
tional social ceremonies out of his own
household. He has engaged an Eng
lish lady, not as governess, but entirely
to set the example of English manners
to hia children. English manners are
in truth so exceedingly vague and neg
ative that> no written code could pos
sibly give an Idea of them. Nothing
but the very genius of mimicry could
possibly grasp them. Therefore the
sons and daughters sit around and

The unpleasant weather of the last
week has caused a slight depression in
the local real estate market, nearly ail
of the dealers reporting few actual
transfers of property, but many in
quiries, and they are confident that as
soon as the weather clears up there -will
be a record breaking sale of property
of all descriptions. Values remain firm
and rents In many parts of the cit> :
show a slight upward tendency. In tho
business district few stores of any kind
are to be had at any price, and loca
tions In business blocks now In course
of construction are all taken up.
The most important transaction of
the week, and one of the most Im
portant of the present year, was the
purchase of the vacant block of land
between Telegraph avenue and Grove
street and Thirtieth and Thirty-first
streets, 16S0 feet front in all. by A. J.
Snyder from the heirs of the Coleman
estate. This la one of the â¢ choicest
pieces of residence property in the city J
and It will be at once subdivided lntt
suitable building lots. Mr. Snyder in
tends to commence the erection of sev
eral handsome houses at once. The pur
chase price is In the neighborhood of
$50,000.
Another important transaction wag
the sale by Wiseman, Holcomb Sc
Yajing to D. P. Durst of Wheatland of
sixty acres of fine suburban property,
located on . the Redwood road, near
School street, in Fruitvale. The sale
was made on behalf of Messrs. Price.
Belcher and Smith, and the considera
tion is understood to be about $50,000.
The tract will be subdivided for sub
urban residence lots.
HOMES BEING BUILT.
Many homes are being built in the
vicinity of Fruitvale and Elmhurst and
It Is expected that as soon as the rainy
weather is over many more will be
started. Twenty-five contracts have
been let for homes to be erected on the
Sather tract and work will be begun
as soon as weather conditions permit.

Pursued by a determined spouse, Guy
E. Covey is now laughing at the au
thorities from acrbss the Oregon line,
while there is an interesting' tangle
here between lawyers and the authori
ties as to who is to blame for his es
cape. Mrs. Covey has been on her hus
band's trail for many months trying to
recover'her two young sons, whom-'he
has taken away, from her. When 'she
finally succeeded in locating him in
Alameda County she swore to a crim
inal charge of not supporting his rer
cently born infant. It was from the
process in this case that he has made
his escape.
The wife states that Covey took an
unfair advantage of her. He ran away
with her two boys and at different
places has begun divorce proceedings,
but she so far has managed to locate
him in time to spoil his efforts in that
line. He had begun an action in the
courts here and was on the road to suc
cess when she arrived. She says that
she was detained in Portland on ac
count of an interesting family event,
but as soon as she was sufficiently re
covered took her Infant and came on.
Covey was located near San Leandro,
and Constable Olympia: of that town
was given a warrant for, his arrest,
sworn to by the wife. This fact was
called to the attention of Olympia. and
he released Covey until a. new warrant
could be drawn up, as a wife cannot
swear to a charge. against her husband.
Covey did not wait for a second war
rant, but dismissed his divorce proceed
ings and left. It is now claimed that
Oylmpia exceeded his authority in al
lowing Covey to go, and Mrs. Covey's
attorneys threaten him with ouster pro
ceedings if he does not get Covey back
again. Â¦>:' .*?Â¦Â¦â¢
On the other hand, District Attorney
Allen says that Olympia was in the
right, that the warrant was palpably
defective, and places the case in the
same category as if a wrong man had
been pointed out to Olympia to arrest.
He also states that. Olympia is. an ap
pointive officer and, could resign at any
moment and be reappointed, and the
ouster threat is a bluff.

in the morning. A goodmatch was ex
pected, but the spectators had to "con
tent themselves with a poor exhibition.
Robert Variel and Drummond Mac-
Gavin, the crack team representing the
University of California and California
Tennis Club, won from the Murdock
brothers; Hamilton and Percy, with
the greatest ease.
MacGavin and Variel won the first
set a week ago, and the score was 2-2
in the second set. Play was resumed
from this point, and the Alameda
County experts were able to win but
one game. Two of the three sets played
were love sets. The score in favor of
MacGavin and Varie! was 6-0, 6-3, 6-0.
The park players had barely started
when the rain commenced to fall and
play had to again be postponed. Only
one match was completed. In it Her
bert Long, the rapidly improving
youngster from the California Club,
won easily from E. P. Finnegan of the
second class. The score was 6-2, 6-1.
Norman Ambrose, the holder of the
cup in the second class, lost the first
set to Marius Hotchkiss, and the score
was about even in the second. Lewis
beat Skaggs. The latter, after losing the
first, was taken ill in the "second and
forced to retire. Finch and Brabant
started an interesting match which had
to be called off when the Bcore stood
3-3. No matches were played in the first
class.
The players from Lowell High School
will hold their annual tryout for the
academic contest on the California Club
courts this morning. The drawing re
sulted as follows: Â¦ .
Preliminary round â Cowden vs. Sea, Baker
vs. Cowgill, Wilcutt vu. Luce.
First round (upper half) â Hellman vs. SiÂ«e
llg, Goold vs. M. Long, Goodwin vs. Cutter.
First round (lower half) â Wallace a bye,
Dryden vs. Gunst, Cannon >s. Smith, RobUoi

Not the Limit.
Signor Zanetti, the magician, had
been displaying his dexterity' to an in
terested crowd of sp^ctators in a
Kentucky town. Stepping forward,
he said: . - . .
Â¦ "For my next trick I will require
a small flask of whisky. Will some
gentleman accommodate me with the
loan of a Dint flask?"
No one stirred. The magician was
plainly nonplussed. With an appeal
ing gesture he said:
"'I had received a different impres
sion than this as to Kentucky cus
toms. Perhaps you did not under
stand me? Will some gentleman
kindly loan me. a pint flask of
whisky?"
Again there was no response, and,
briefly apologizing, the magician said
he would be compelled to omit this
from h'is repertory for that night. He

tall, lank. man in the rear of the hall
rose. .
"Mistah," said he," "would a quart

While the Boosters have been form

the lines in which they have been long

"Alameda County has accomplished
much in the way of advancement in
the last" two years. Our elec
tric railway systems have been
largely ' extended - and by that
means all surrounding towns
have been brought so muijh nearer to
our business houses. A competing
ferry has begun business arVd the lines
connecting with that ferry will in- j
crease the building of Oakland and j
make a greater city. Â¦
â¢The tidal canal has been complet
ed. Interests have been developed on
the Alameda County water front. The
tunnel has been cut through that con
nects Oakland and Contra Costa Coun
ty. The ship building and ship re
; pairing interests of Alameda County
are thriving, as any one will see. A
safety harbor for all revenue cutters
will be on this side of the bay. There
are many other circumstances that are
making for a greater Oakland, and it
: is the office of the Roosters to assist
in all ways to help Oakland along."
The two officers of the Boosters
who have been already quoted regard
ed Oakland from the point of view of
men who are engaged in largely fur
nishing building materials and fuel.
A different but not less material ver
sion Avas supplied by the treasurer, A.
J. Snyder, who is engaged in the real
estate business and so is in direct con
tact with the strangers from abroad
and from many parts of this State who
are seeking homes in Oakland and
other points in Alameda County.
"Fifteen factories have been locat
ed on our bay shore in two years,'
Raid Treasurer- Snyder. "We are going
to have three overland roads coming
into Oakland. We are going to issue
bonds and provide for many improve
ments that will enhance the desirabil
ity of Oakland and increase Its advan
tages in several directions.
, "I have been watching Oakland
carefully for twelve yeara. In that
time there have been many changes
and the progress of this city has al
ways been forward. We have not
gone ; back one bit. Xow every indica
tion is fine for growth. Strangers are
coming in here every day to make in
quiries. They are buying much Ala
meda County real estate. We have lots
of room for growth and the building
section covers a great area, for the land
is practically level, so. that there is not
much, grading to* be done when a
home site is to be made ready to re
ceive Its buildings. We hope that
transcontinental freights to Oakland
will be cheaper than they are to San
Francisco. They ought to be, for
there is not so much handling to be
done when freights stop on this side
of the bay and originate here. Our
population Is increasing steadily and
rapidly."
OFFICERS OF THE OAKLAND
BOOSTERS WHO HAVE UNDER
TAKEN IMPORTANT TASK.
Total abstinence is not one of the
many principles of good conduct incul
cated by Mr. Xorris. He finds whisky
the medicine best suited to most of the
complaints that elephant flesh Is heir
to, and the patients have" a most un
holy appreciation of alcohol. In fact,
they only need opportunity to become
habitual drunkards, and on one occa
sion Mr. Xorris, having administered a
good dose of whisky to a performer
which was out of sorts, had the morti
fication of seeing the unprincipled ani
mal refuse to do Its tricks. Instead, It
sat down on the stage and laughed at
him.
Mechanics' Pavilion is now being pre
pared for what can be truly regarded
as one of the leading amusement
events of the season, the incomparable
Norris & Rowe's big show opening
there on April 2 for nine days. The
public eagerly looks forward every year
to the return of this meritorious at
traction, and the announcement that
the opening performance will be held
this week will be hailed with joy by
young and old.
The management is to be greatly
commended in affording the amusement
loving public an opportunity of wit
nessing the greatest animal show on
earth without the disagreeable features
attendant upon a performance given
under canvas. Comfort and safety are
the first consideration of Xorris &
Howe, and Mechanics* Pavilion, when
the mechanics have completed their
work will rival the famous Madison
Square Garden ln-Xew York City as a
place of exhibition. *
The results of Clarence Norris' ele
phant school will be seen in fine new
acts presented by Fargo, Duchess and
Hero. In the winter quarters of Xorris
& Rowe's shows, at San Jose, Mr. Xor
ris. famous as a trainer of animals,
spends strenuous days in the winter in
mastering the natural stupidity and the
natural intelligence of the elephant. He
finds stupidity easier to manage, for
elephantine intelligence runs towillful
nf-ss and unrehearsed effects in the
ring.

The history of the Oakland Boosters
is very well known. The Oakland
Board of Trade organized, with the
Southern Pacific Company's co-opera
tion, an excursion of 300 persons, who
started on February 8 to visit the
southern part of California. Pasa
dena, Los Angeles, Riverside, Colton.
Redlands. Pomona. Catallna Island
and other points were viewed.
The Los Angeles Chamber of Com
merce extended Its hospitality and
everything that the southern counties
have done to improve their condition
was brought within easy observation
of the observant tourists from Oak
land. On the trip to Catalina Island
a rope .committee was organized In a
spirit of fun. When the tourists re
turned to Oakland a meeting was
called of the rope committee and from
that meeting the organization of the
formation of the Oakland Boosters has
resulted. â¢ .

Grand High Booster Coplin is working
hard and "with good effect so that the
Boosters have been heard of through
out the length and breadth of the Pa
cific Coast already. When Mr. Coplin
was asked for some particulars about
the form of organization that the
Boosters have formally adopted, he
produced the constitution and by-laws.
From them some paragraphs are ta
ken for "the use of any other commun
ity that may strive to emulate the ex
ample of the Oakland people. A few

James P. Taylor is the second vice
president of the Boosters. .He is
also a solid business man. Whrm he
was asked what prospects Oakland
has, he spoke, from a point of view
different from that of ; President
Hogan, but his hopeful utterances
were in the same â¢ strain and his be
lief was founded on equally sound
considerations.
Mr. Taylor is connected with the
coal business and is allied with large
Interests.* '.'I can see Â¦ clearly,"./ Mr.
Taylor said, "that if the Government
will give us proper consideration . in
channel making for our/ harbor we
will have a great volume of commerce
to handle. -" Appropriations have been
made and work has /been performed
that Is of value to Oakland- an'd- to th<Â»
people of all . Alameda^tCounty. We
have two transcontlnenitil,; roads now
in Oakland and will, have more. There
would be no difficulty Hnibrlnging' all
ships and rail s together in Oakland
harbor if we had a few' feet more
water.- When the Government listens

President Hogan paused at his deskâ
this interview and all others with of
ficers of the Boosters taking place dur
ing business hours and at business
places â and after telephoning resumed
with enthusiasm:
"Now, when I talk about Oakland I
am naturally pleased with the topic. So
are all loyal Oaklanders. While we nat
urally are satisfied with our natural
advantages, which are great, we are
also delighted when our claims receive
such strong Indorsement as they, have
been given during the last few years by
great aggregations of capital from the
outside.
"We believe heartily that Oakland is
on the right side of the bay for busi
ness. The Standard Oil Company has
emphatically indorsed this view by lo
cating af Point Richmond a great and
growing plant. The Santa Fe Railroad
system has evidently the same view. It
is now In Oakland. The Western Pa
cific Railroad and the Rick Island are
morally pure to come through Oakland.
I think that the Western Pacific will
be running its trains In within five
years on the overland business.
"According to the last postofflce cen
sus, which approximates the real fact,
Oakland has a population of about
83,000 In round numbers. Land .for home
sites on this side of the bay Is cheaper
then It is In San Francisco, and the cli
mate and the size of lots make the
eastern shore much more desirable as a
place of residence. We have a com
peting ferry, and that is proving to be.
a great agency in attracting home site
buyers. The Boosters are back* of a
legitimate proposition. They will co
operate with the Oakland Board of
Trade, the Oakland Merchants' Ex
change and with all other organizations
and with every individual in" Alameda
County who entertains the sam$ pur
pose of boosting^flrst, last and all the
time." .
"You will see by reference to. article
two of our constitution and by-laws
that we provide that we shall boost in
every legitimate manner anything that
will tend toward the development and
betterment of Oakland. It is also made
the duty of each member to use all
legitimate means to counteract the ef
fect, of any 'knocker' whenever he or
she may appear, and to report the same
to the executive committee for such ac
tionfasflt may deem. fit. â Anyman or
woman who shall sign the roll and ac
knowledge allegiance to this pro
gramme is eligible for membership."
"You have great faith in the future
of Oakland?" was asked.
"Every one who knows the facts re
lating to TDakland has faith in it," re
marked President 'Hogan. "Only a
'knocker' ever gives out any different
idea. Why, just see what Oakland has:
From here .to Contra Costa in one di
rection and practically to San Jose in
the other there is bay shore for slte3
of manufacturing plants. That entire
area, being on. the oast shore of the
bay, will eventually bring business and
prosperity to Oakland, to which it is
tributary largely from a geographical
point of view. A strong start has been
made in the establishment of manu
facturing concerns on the bay shore.
Fifteen such have been established be
tween here and the boundary of West
Berkeley in the last two years."
TOPIC IS PLKASIXG.
"We have formed an organization,"
said President Hogan, "which has not
for Its prime purpose to originate, but
is actuated by the desire and endowed
with the ability to get behind such en
terprises as may prove beneficial to
Oakland and boost. Our name exactly
describes what we intend to do and
will do.
The president of the Oakland Boost
ers is Hugh Hogan. He is the manager
of a lumber company- that' does a large
business, and so he is in ready touch
with many lines of business that
concern the advancement of the
charming and thriving city of Oak
land. To him application was made for
information concerning the hopes of the
Boosters and the solid basis* on which
the hopes rest. Mrl'Hogan Is busy, and
that Is one reason why he has time to
do something for Oakland., All busy
men find time to work.
Alameda Cormty fgrnlihea _*,,
a striking example <rf~develop-""
ment and growth, due largely
to the energy and enterprise
with which the people have
met the responsibilities Im
posed upon them by their Im
portant position. Alameda
County is a place of charming
homes and dcllzhtfnl home
life. Its business, manufact
uring and commercial future
is -very bright. There Is noth
ing lacking in Alameda County
to conduce to the happiness of
the dwellers therein. .Much
that has been accomplished
and much that Is hoped for hi
material development looks to
the organizations of patriotic
'citizens for its origin. A fine
work has been performed by
the Oakland Board of Trade
and by the Oakland Merchant-*'
Exchange. The Oakland Boost
ers, the most, recent, body to be
formed for progress hi Oakland,
has already gained prominence
by reason of Its alms and the
character and large number of
Oaklanders who have become
connected with it. Alameda
and Berkeley and other com
munities also hare strong or
ganizations.
That the people of the State
miry appreciate and understand
how and why Alameda County
is so rapidly forging ahead, it
is purposed by The Call to give,
on successive Monday morn
ings, for a period, accounts of
the methods of the affiliated
promotion bodies of the county.
This morning readers will read
nbout the Boosters. Next 3Ion
day morning the Oakland
Board of Trade will be de

day the Oakland Merchants*
Exchange will be given space.
In turn the other organizations
of the county will receive at

REV. BRAXKE'S ADMOXIT1OX.
At St. Paul's German Evangelical
Church the Rev. Paul Branke, the pas
tor, confirmed a class yesterday with
impressive ceremony. After the con
firmation the Rev. Mr. Branke spoke of
the importance of the step the newly
confirmed had taken. He said in part:
Christ deserves the best word you ever ut
tered, the gladdest song you ever *angr. the
healthiest do> you ever lived and the strongest
heart throb you ever felt.
I have led you now to the crossroads and I
have :>olnted out the way. I can now only
pray. "Lead them In the way e\Â«r]astlng."
The thirty who were confirmed and
who will receive their first communion
next Sunday are:
One thins is needful still, a friend to jour
ney with you, and where shall we find a friend
like Jepus? â¢ . .
Confirmation of thirty candidates
took place yesterday morning at the
First English Lutheran Church, the
pastor. Dr. E. Nelander. performing the
confirmation rite by laying on hands,
according to the usage of the Lutheran
church. At the conclusion of the rites
each candidate was given the right
hand of fellowship by Dr. Nelander. In
addressing the newly confirmed Dr. Ne
lander said in part:
You will need flrtt the staff of faith to lean
on. For thl? journey be appareled In hop*:
put on the sandals of service; take the word of
God as food on your Journey.
DR. XELAXDEIt CONFIRMS.
At St. Mary's Cathedral Archbishop
Montgomery blessed the palms, and the
ceremony was intensely impressive. The
music accompanying the exercises was
very beautiful and splendidly rendered.
The Passion was read in English by the
Very Rev. Father Prendergast. His
Grace Archbishop Riordan was in the
sanctuary during the- service.
At St. Ignatius Church there was an
immense attendance and the ceremony
was imposing. The service of the bless
ing of the palms began at 10:30 o'clock,
the Rev. Father Edward Allen being
the celebrant. All the Jesuit commu
nity, the priests and professors of St.
Ignatius College were in the sanctuary,
together with thirty-six acolytes. Imme
diately after the blessing of the palms
a solemn procession was organized,
consisting of the Very Rev. Father
Superior John P. Frieden, the clergy
and the acolytes, which wended its way
through the aisles of the church. The
male choir meanwhile rendered the lit
urgical vocal music. The mass followed,
during which the Passion was read ac
cording to St. Matthew. The blessed
palms were distributed among the con
gregation.
At St. Dominic's Church there was
the usual Impressive Palm Sunday ob
servances, and at St. Francis, where
the attendance was also large,- the
palms were blessed and distributed. At
the Paulist Church, on California
street, there was also a service in ac
cordance with the holy day.
There were large attendances of wor
shipers at the Roman Catholic churches
yesterday morning, when the blessing
of the palms was generally observed
and processions were formed and palms
distributed.

Though the bow was long the great

of the Samurai. Many years, and the

by his devotion to the sword and its
exercise, but also-V/y physical training,
and by the practice of the delicate and

could fight, and fight effectively, with
any, even the rudest weapon, and at

inated by militarism. Originally the
Mikado hail been the real as well as
the nominal head of the empire, but in
the Middle Ages the royal power of
the Mikado wan^d, outshone by the
mftittry power of the Shogun. his
commander In chief. Held at first by
royal appointment In time of war, the
Sh.ogun'B office gradually came to be
permanent, restricted first to men of
high birth end afterwards to represen
tatives of two particular clans; finally
it became purely hereditary, the sov
ereign retaining merely the right of
Investiture. Henceforth, the royal
5>ower was a mere shadow, so attenu
a'spd that -when, shortly before the rev
olution, the powers of Europe were
negotiating treaties with Japan the
negotiations were carried on by them
with the Shogun in the belief that he
was the actual reigning monarch.
While the Mikado retained in his
court at Kioto the nobles of high birth
asd Intellectual eminence, the Shogun
gathered round him at Yeddo the terri
torial nobles, or daimio, men whose In
fluence lay in th^ir landed possessions
and their military skill. The daimio
ruted their fiefs according to their
owjn wills, but owed the obedience of
vassals to their feudal lord. And, as
the Shogunate had become hereditary,
fo did the higher military sub-posi
tions, held by the leading families, be
come hereditary also; as, too, the Sho
jrun surrounded himself with the mil
itary noble?, so also did these, under
the necessities of their offices and cir
cumstances, gather about them their
military retainers, men who made war
The profession of their lives. Finally
these, in turn, handed down their of
fices and privileges from father to son,
u.ntil *here came forth at last a dis-
Mnct and separate class, to whom ul
timately the bearing of arms was re
stricted. The more troublous grew the
tl.-nes, the more important did the sol
dier become, the sharper the line di
viding him from the mere working
member of the population and the
greater his pride in himself and his
contempt for the civilian. On the one
Eide was the warrior, the strong, the
wielder of weapons, the honoredâ on
the other the artisan, the weakly, the
worker, the despised. Thus the Sa
murai stood out supreme, first (under
the nobles) of the population, wear
ing the two swords as sign of his
birth and proud position.
It la now a mere commonplace, to
dwtfl upon the wonderful rapidity
with which, lesg than forty years ago,
Japan with one stride advanced from
her mefiieral feudalism to the front
rank of modern civilization. Not less
remarkable than the fact itself Is the
character of the revolution of 1S6S, and
of the class from which was drawn the
majority of the men to whom that
revolution was due.
The Samurai were the unique pro
duct of Japanese feudalism and In the
â¢spirit of the Samurai is to be found
the most striking feature In the his
tory of the event, together with the
best explanation of the sequel and of
the enthusiasm, unerring rightness
and lofty patriotism with which the
nation is marching on its road of pro
press to-day. A country which could
produce each a class was capable of
great things.
The Samurai of Japan.
LAST week was another quiet and uneventful week
in trade, and the animation which characterized
the two preceding weeks was not visible. There
was no great speculative spasm, like the panicky col
lapse of. the cotton boom, to excite commercial circles
and business proceeded on conservative and normal lines.
As for the cotton catastrophe, it is a strange fact to
state, but it actually caused satisfaction in all lines of
cotton manufacturing, and ' several important centers,
such as Fall River, Lawrence, Philadelphia and Liver
pool, reported actual rejoicing among'' manufacturers
over the clearing off of the fevered atmosphere, which
enables both manufacturers and merchants to look a few
weeks into the future and obtain a definite idea as to
where they stand in reference to cotton values.- Since
the failure of .Sully the cotton business has shown more
steadiness and stability and. though the ultimate effects
are not yet apparent, the situation is much clearer and
therefore more satisfactory than when the boom was on.
Commercial reports from all sections of the country
were satisfactory. The weather was hardly as pro
pitious for gerieral businesses it had been for-. a fort
night and storms over wide areas cut down the distribu
tion of merchandise and otherwise hampered trade, while
,the labor question, which had fallen into comparative ob
scurity as an immediate factor, again showed itself in a
disturbing form here and there throughout the country,
not seriously, but just enough to show that it was liable
to break out again without much notice. These two fac
tors tendjed to diminish the favorable returns of the pre
ceding fortnight and set the expanding spring trade back
a peg or so. Increased demand for building materials
showed that constructive work on a large scale was im
pending, and the Jull in it indicated that possibilities of
labor controversies alone were retarding much building
that otherwise would have been well under way.
As far as the usual commercial statistics went there
was not much change in the general situation. The bank
clearings of the country fell off 6.1 per cent as compared
with the corresponding week in 1903, with the leading
cities about evenly balanced in the columns of losses and
gains. The aggregate clearings were $1,877,000,000, and
as the index point of these clearings for some time past
seems to be about $2,000,000,000, the inference is natural
that any exhibit under the two billion mark shows a
recession and anything over it a gain. The failures for
the week were 226, against 214 for the same week last
year.
There was nothing new in the great staples to excite
especial comment. The wheat market was quiet all over
the world, with few and narrow fluctuations, except at
Chicago, where quotations fluctuated according to the
varying condition of the crop, which is the governing
factor of the market at present. Wheat is in such ample
supply all over the world that there is nothing existent
to change the price of the grain one way or the other,
and whenever any market varies it is owing to its own
local conditions. The winter wheat crop of the United j
States is not looking as. well as usual, according to the
best reports, as the fall planting was backward and the
weather throughout the winter more or less unfavorable
to the growing plant; but there has been no serious
damage on the whole and the prospects at present are
for a good crop. Provisions are in ample supply in all
positions and the markets everywhere are running along
quietly under the usual normal fluctuations. Wool and
hides quoted steady to firm, with a fair demand for
both raw and manufactured goods. More frequent ad
vances in iron and steel, though slight, show less pressure
to sell and more disposition on the part of buyers to
place orders hitherto held back since the turn of the year.
Trading in Wall street has been more active since the
Northern Securities cloud disappeared and for several
days it looked as if another bull campaign were under
way; but a threatened rebellion against the plan of re
adjustment by the Union Pacific interests put a sudden
damper on the sanguine expectations of the bulls and the
market relapsed into a feverish and hesitating condition,
where it remains. The money market stands precisely
where it has been for many weeks, .funds being in large
supply everywhere and interest rates normal.
With the advent of spring the railway conditions are
improving and present indications are that the gross re-
Ceipts for March will show some increase over those of
a year ago. They tfave been falling behind for a few
months. Thus far the month's returns make a showing
better than in any preceding year in spite of the un
favorable weather. There is a better wholesale, jobbing
and retail trade all over the country, according to the
week's reports from the different distributive centers.
General business in jj California continues active. The
foreign trade of this port is still large and no complaints
are heard from either exporters or importers, except in
the wheat trade, which is making a poor export exhibit.
But barley, oats and hay have for some time been in
active demand all over the coast, as the American, Rus
sian and Japanese governments have all been and are
still large purchasers of forage for shipment to the
Orient." Japan, in particular, is making very heavy pur
chases of barley, and the American Government is tak
ing so much hay that its demands upon stocks have
largely offset the weakening influence of the recent rains.
These latter have been so copious, especially in the
southern part of the State, where they were sadly
needed, that they practically insure abundant 'crops of
grain, hay and fruit as well as of the minor products
of the soil, hence a general feeling of confidence in an
other good year is perceptible all over the State. Con
siderable damage by submersion of productive areas
along the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers has been
done, but the gross benefit to the State is far in excess
of any local injury by overflows.
The influx of new population into the city and State
from the Eastern and Western sections of the country
continues unabated and is leading to considerable en
thusiastic figuring as to the prospective population of
San Francisco and California several years hence. These
sanguine expectations may or may not be fully realized
but the fact is indisputable that immigration into the
State is very large and of the choicest quality* and is
likely to continue indefinitely. This produces a very,
cheering effect upon everybody and is doing as much as
anything else to make times active and good throughout
the' entire State. Thus, with this large immigration,
brilliant crop prospects, abundance of money and a brisk
and continuous demand for the products of our farms,
California is warranted in looking forward to . another
very fine commercial and agricultural year. - ..:â¢?Â¦'
At the forthcoming St. Louis Expo
sition there is to be a restaurant for
dyspeptics, managed by a woman who
has won a reputation as a lecturer on
hygiene. Baked apples are to be the
specialty. Let the visitor's indigestion
assume whatever form it will, the
baked apple is to be depended upon to
cure It. Sometimes (In patent medi
cine advertisements, particularly) indi
gestion is pictured as a horrible, an
gular, unfeeling monster. The caterer
to the dyspeptics has arranged, says
the New York Evening Post, to pelt
thisdragon with baked apples until it
faints and dies. Baked apples soothe
the jaded stomach, please the fancy,
and, when they are rich and sugary,
delight the taste. Biscuits And cake
will be "barred" from this gastronomic
haven; it may be that bananas will
also be ejectedâ the experiments have
not as yet gone far enough to deter
mine that point.

There was a etrange commixture of
nationalities In the Peninsular War.
There were Spaniards fighting on both
sides. Thousands of them, who surren
dered wholesale at the battle of Es â¢
pinosa, took part afterward in the ter
rible Moscow campaign. Four thou
sand of them were reconveyed to
Spain from the Baltic by British naval
officers in 1812. Portuguese troops
were drafted Into Napoleon's forces
and died like files in that disastrous
business. It need not be stated what
gallant allies they proved to us when
drilled and organized by that grand
Irishman, afterward Field Marshal
Lord Beresford. to whom the church
of Ireland owes its useful "Marshal
Beresford's fund." The Duke of Wel
lington ardently desired to have these
experienced soldiers under him again
In the Waterloo campaign, but the
Portuguese Government ungratefully
refused leave. There were Swiss regi
ments on both sides. There were Ger
laans in both armies. Not only was
the splendid King's German Legion a.
tower of strength to the British army,
but the Fifth Battalion of the Sixtieth
Rifles (the Royal Americans, In which
Duncan Heyward, of the "Last of the
Mohicans," was a major), were as early
as 1798, when they served in the Irish
rebellion In County Wexford under Sir
John Moore, composed* of foreigners
and were In the Peninsula chiefly
made up of German deserters from
Soult's army. That there were Irish
gralore in the Duke's command goes
without speaking. The deeds of the
Eighty-seventh and Eighty-eighth,
Faugh-a-Ballaghs and Connaught
Rangers, though they were "Picton's
iheivin* blaguards," live In. martial
story. But few know that Napoleon
had an Irish regiment, and that it
served in the Peninsula, and was un
der his banner in 1815, though not ac
tually at Waterloo.
We have a curious account of their
gallant service In that fascinating
though sometimes I think apocryphal
book, the "Memoirs of Baron Le Mar
bot." Marbot reminds me strongly of
Brigadier Etienne Ggrard; they must
have been first cousins at least. Massena
had commenced his ill-fated advance
on Portugal, where he was destined to
be foiled by the wonderful lines of Tor
res Vedras. Marbot states that his ex
pedition very nearly came to an end
at Viseu through lack of foresight on
his part. He made his artillery march
on the extreme right of the column,
away from the masses of his Infantry,
its only protection being an Irish bat
talion In the French service and 'a com
pany of French grenadiers. Marching in
single file more than a league in length,
the park was proceeding slowly and
laboriously by difficult roads when sud
denly on its right flank appeared the
famous partisan. Colonel Trant, at the
head of 4000 or 5000 Portuguese militia.
If they had surrounded the convoy and
made a determined attack all the ar
tillery, ammunition and provisions
would have been captured or destroyed.
But Trant, as he himself said after
ward, could not suppose that a general
of Massena's renown and experience
could have left unsupported a convoy
I so essential to the safety of his army,
I and imagining that a powerful escort
) must be close at hand he advanced with
extreme caution, confining his attack to
the leading company of grenadiers, who
replied by a heavy fire, which killed
some fifty men. The militia recoiled in
I alarm, and Trant, doing what he ought
to have done at first, overlapped a' por
tion of the coavoy. As he advanced he
discovered how weak was the escort,
and sent a flag of truce to the officer in
command, summoning him to surrender
or else he would attack all along the
line. The French officer adroitly con
sented to negotiate in order to give the
Irish regiment time to come up from
the rear of the convoy. At length they
made their appearance at the double.
As eoon as the French commander saw
them he at once broke off the parley,
saying, "I cannot treat any further,
here is my general coming to my sup
port at the head of 8000 men." Each re
sumed his position, but Trant shortly
left his and made off, thinking that he
had to do with the advanced guard of a
strong column. Thus the game of bluff
was won and the artillery saved, but
the French army soon learned the dan
ger It had been in and great indigna
tion was excited. Ney, Junot.'Reynler
and Montbrun went off at once to
General Fririon, the chief of the staff,
and addressed strong remonstrances to
him. Not satisfied with his explana
tions, the four corps comanders went
on to Massena and had a 'fierce alter
cation with him. However, he pacified
them for a time, but only for a time,
as I may perhaps be allowed to tell In
another communication. â Robert Stave

A RECENT dispatch from Salt Lake says that the
young Mormons throughout the entire State of
Utah have taken preliminary measures to unite
in an organization which shall have for its object the
strict enforcement of the pledges given to the Govern
ment when Utah was admitted as a State. They have
announced a determination to bring matters to a head
at the April conference of the church by declaring be
fore that body a. resolve to leave the religion of the
saints unless the practices of plural marriages on the part
of the heads of the Mormon hierarchy, revealed in so
cold-blooded a manner by President Joseph Smith at
the Smoot inquiry, are done away with immediately. V-."
This stand taken by the younger element in the Mor
mon church is a worthy one, for it is indicative of the
spirit whith should permeate the whole body of the sect
in Utah. It is the elevation of citizenship in the United
States over membership in the Church of Latter. Day
Saints. . From the time when Joseph Smith, the first
prophet, shut himself up in his farmhouse in New York
and read the mystical tablets down to the present day
the exercise of the Mormon faith has been inimical to
the exercise of good citizenship among those most ardent
in the creed of Mormon, for the primal docfrine of the
church, as confessed by President Smith himself, is'
obedience to the revelation of God through the appointed
elders, all civil law, to the contrary notwithstanding.
It was this conviction which led to the armed clash
with the militia of Missouri during the Mormon settle
ment there in the late thirties. Again it was disregard
of the laws of Illinois .which moved the Mormons to in
trench themselves in their sacred city of Nauvoo and
withstand siege for several days. After their hegira to
Salt Lake the presence of a body of Federal troops was
felt necessary for the preservation of the sovereign laws
of the United States. But with the lapse of years and
the growth of a younger generation, not so fanatical as
their forebears, nor driven to desperation by persecu
tion, there was developed a seeming amenity to the laws
of the land on the part of the saints which permitted of
the admission of , the Territory to statehood. ,'
The Smoot inquiry at Washington developed the fact
that among the very heads of the church themselves all
pledges regarding polygamy haveubeen utterly disregard
ed and the natural inference might be made' and would be
made that such was the practice from the highest to the
lowest had not this body of young Mormons voiced their
denunciation of the bad faith of the members of the
hierarchy as promptly and with as much vigor as they
have. The movemenl of the young Mormons is a long
step in the right direction and must be productive of
great service to the honor of Utah.

The popular Idea that fish nour
ishes the brain ia pronounced falla
cious by the Lanot (London). Fur
thermore, that paper asserts that it la
doubtful whether any given food in
common use contains constituents
which have a selective action, or the
property of ministering to one part of
the body more than another. Says
the writer:
"As a rule, when a food is assum
ed to have specific reparative proper
ties â as, for example, a so-called brain
or nerve food â the fact really is that
such food is easily and quickly assim
ilated to the body's general advantage
â in a word, in such a case repair
quickly overtakes waste and a real
purposeful nutrition and restoration
are accomplished. The administration
of such elements as phosphorus or
iron in medicine is, of course, a differ
ent matter, but these elements are
evenly distributed in the materials of
a daily diet. It ia often stated that
fish Is a food which ministers partic
ularly to the needs of the brain be
cause It contains phosphorus. As a
matter of fact, fish does not contain
more phosphorus than do ordinary
meat foods, and it certainly does not
contain It in the free state. The no
tion that fish contains phosphorus had
no doubt its origin in the glowing or
phosphorescence in the dark. This
phosphorescence is not due to phos
phorus at all, but to micro-organisms,
The belief, therefore, that fish is a
brain food Is Just about as reasonable
as the idea that because a soup la
thick and gelatinous 'it will stick to
the ribs,' or as sensible as the cele
brated advice to Verdant Green to lay
in a stock of Reading biscuits to as
sist his reading. Fish, of course, la
excellent food, partly because of the
nourishing nature of it3 constituents
and partly because of ita digestibility.
But it is In no sense a specific - for
brain or nerve."

THE secretary of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce
has filed a report in which, while pursuing another
main purpose, he incidentally pays tribute to the
methods of San Francisco business men. He makes the
good showing for Seattle that there are nearly thirteen
hundred manufacturing establishments in the city and
15,000 men are employed in these factories, receiving in
wages and salaries the round sum of $17,000,000 per
annum. The aggregate value of all the manufactures of
Seattle combined is placed at $60,000,000 per annum. â¢
But, says the secretary of the Seattle Chamber of
Commerce, hardly any of the products of Seattle are
sold in Seattle, although they readily find markets else
where. "Whenever Seattle retailers can purchase any
article made in this city (Seattle), made for the same
price, when transportation is 'considered, in Chicago or
San Francisco, the home manufacturer gets the cold
shoulder." Probably the . secretary knows whereof he
speaks and his testimony must be taken, for obvious
reasons, as not unfairly discriminating against Seattle.
Business is governed by fixed rules. An old maxim
of business is that goods well bought are already half
sold. H the retailers of Seattle are able to buy better in
San Francisco than they are in Seattle it follows that the
San Francisco manufacturers .and wholesalers are able
to produce the required articles on terms better suited
to the Seattle retail trade than are those of Seattle. It
will not be argued that Seattle's retailers have any hos
tility to their home products. They undoubtedly desire
to aid in building up Seattle. Their interests and in
clination must lie alike in that direction. Business con
siderations control them.
Making some specific allegations the secretary of the
Seattle Chamber of Commerce says that "instead of buy
ing tea in the Orient and having it shipped into Seattle
by the Japanese steamship line, the terminals of which
are here (Seattle), the merchants prefer to buy in San
Francisco, thereby paying the freight across the Pacific
to a steamship line which has its American terminal at
that point."
This added statement gives credit to the San Francisco
importers as completely as do those that relate to manu
factures and goods sold by San Francisco manufacturers
and jobbers.
This city will not be harmed by this sort of averments.
The point is seen clearly by the Seattle Times, which
proposes that as a remedy for the present commercial
practices of Seattle merchants some action be devised
by the Seattle Manufacturers' Association, the Chamber
of Commerce and the Merchants' Association of Seattle.
It is said as a partial explanation by the Times that "it
is hard to change from old mercantile. associations and
therefore we are apt to be neglectful of the fact that the
same article of merchandise can be obtained in our own
city of equal quality and at as low a price."
Old associations have their value as old friends have,
but in the modern sharp competition of men and methods
for business there is no room left for continued dis
crimination against Seattle by its own retailers unless
there is some other reason to be alleged.
While the statements of the secretary of the Seattle
commercial body will be reassuring to the business men
of San Francisco, it is still clear that they will find no
reason to relax their energies. They will hold their
old trade and secure as much new business as possible
by using modern ideas and availing themselves of their
.natural advantages, among which are cheap fuel and
geographical position.

The Count explained that he had been
educated in England and Canada and
had spent a great deal of his time in
New York, a fact to which he attrib
utes his American ways, so marked
that they are noticeable. Last year,
while sojourning in Montreal, he said
he met George Rowe of Norris &
Rowe's circus and accepted an invita
tion to accompany Rowe this year
around the Western circuit.
"Of course, I'm not part of. the cir
cus," remarked the Count, "but I have
found this way of traveling the best
means of studying human nature, for
you get nearer the people â and you
might add in your article, if you think
it would be of any Interest, that I am
looking for a wife. I haven't come
over here like a penniless nobleman,
looking for a rich woman, and I don't
want a woman of means, for I have a
comfortable fortune. What I want is
a good American wife, and I want to
say right here that during my two
weeks' stay in California I have seen
more pretty women than I have set
eyes on in all the European countries
through which I have traveled. It is
here that you find the flower of wom
ankind."
Then the conversation drifted into
the political affairs of Bulgaria, of
which the Count confessed a great ig
norance, which, he quickly explained,
was due to the fact that he had not
been in Bulgaria for five years. He
had been unjustly accused of political
intriguing and banished, he said, but,
he added, this decree had just been set
aside by Prince Ferdinand and he was
free to return. Count Maurice de Na
varre, however, says that he is serious
ly thinking of renouncing Bulgaria and
his titles and becoming an American
citizen, and as he announced this de
termination he pulled his feet down
from the table, in his room, where they
had been reposing during the interview,
rose from his chair to his full height,
about 5 feet 6 inches, made a stiff bow
and remarked that he would be pleased
to see his visitor acrain should the lat
ter desire further information regard
ing his family or personal history.
"Yes, I hail from Bulgaria," said the
Count, with a drawl peculiar to some
portions of Arkansas. "My ancestors
lied to Bulgaria from France during
the revolution. So bitter was the
hatred of my forefathers for the latter
country that they decreed that their
children should never speak a word of
French and we have never violated this
rule. Upon my grandfather was con
ferred the title of Count in his adopted
country, and by right of inheritance I
now use it."

is much more fascinating than that of
the Atlantic States, from the time when
Cortez started the expedition which
discovered California in 1524, sending a
report of its discovery by one of his
soldiers. In 1536 Illoa brought the first
ship into Lower California waters.
Cabrillo in 1545 was the first white man

served, and the handsome university
man with ideas was warmly greeted.
From this Dr. Ferrand showed the
recurrence of the same schedule of
events as here chronicled in the devel
opment of the West and produced
proofs of the dominance of the West over
the history of the nation. Thus is the
note struck for a new conception of
American history, and it would seem
from the enthusiasm of the "believers"
that the day is not far distant for a
general acceptance of the theory by
those in the vanguard of things.
Following the march of men west
ward, the lecturer said: "New life in
new regions under new conditions gave
rise to new industries, new problems,
new ideals, and produced new types of
men. The frontiersman had a certain
coarseness, but he was strong, prac
tical, adaptive and powerful, with
individualism, buoyancy (from free
dom), optimism and largeness of de
sign, and was a composite of various
races or nationalities. The result is
something absolutely new â the Amer
ican of the Middle West and of the
West." .
"Democracy," said the exponent of
the now thought, "is freedom to rise
from political, economic or social limi
tations or restrictions. Democracy in
Europe is forced, theoretical. In Amer
ica It Is unioue in the opportunity it
offers to individuals. The man in a set
tled community could always escape
from the restrictions that beset him
by going out on the frontier, because
beyond there always existed an area of
unoccupied land.
"Professor Moses makes the state
ment that democracy can exist only in
primitive societyâ and that is what we
have in America."

The. speaker, like unto Professor
Grig*? in that he is young, handsome

is an Eastern man with a splendid
record in history work. He was asso

B. Adams and Professors Wilson. Tur

of like repute.
" Of them he said, "Adams was not
essentially a scholar, but an organizer,
a "hustler," " and capable of inspiring
men with his o-nn enthusiasm. His
ov.-n subject. "Church History." was
to him the basis of all subsequent his
tory, his favorite dogma "Nothing es

ing the foundation for investigations
along that line.

learning adopted Adams' viewe. to the
end that some of the latter required

But there were others who were able
to obtain benefit of his enthusiasm
â¢uithout being dominated by his ideas.
One of these. Turner, was satisfied that

set himself to v.ork to discover what It

ST. PAUL, March 27.â The first trans
continental train to get through the
snow blockade in North Dakota reached
St. Paul over the Great Northern road
at 10 o'clock to-day. Another train
came in during the afternoon, and two
more are expected to reach the city
some time to-night. The officials report
that the line is again open and traffic
has been resumed, though there is still
some delay. ' ;^ r
Passengers on the delayed train state
that they were well cared for, and be
yond the inconvenience of being tied up
there was no suffering.
Officials of the Northern lines state
that this has been one of the fiercest
battles with snowdrifts they have ever
experienced, and that even the immense
rotary plows which were sent against
the drifts, pushed by three heavy en
gines, were almost powerless to cope
with the huge mountains of ice and
snow, and that in many instances
blasting had to be resorted to.
WASHINGTON. March 27.â Senato^
Platt of Connecticut, chairman of thÂ»
Senate Committee on Relations Wit!
Cub?, has received from Major E. G
Rathbone an appeal for a review of hi;
case by Congress. He calls attention ti
the fnvestigation of the protests agains
the confirmation of General Leonart
Wocd made recently by the Senati
Committee on Military Affairs.
Major Rathbone has on file with Sen,
atot Platt's committee a request for ar
investigation of the circumstances uni
der which he was convicted of com
plUity in the Cuban frauds, but no aci
tlon ever has been taken In the matter!
JIaJor Rathbone's interest in thÂ«$
fight made recently against Generaj
Wood was because of his belief thai
General Wood used undue influence In
bringing about his (Rathbone's) con4
viction.
It is asserted also that the late Sen-j
ator Hanna's interest in the case was
due to the belief that llajcr Rathbond
was dealt with unjustly. Major Rath-,
bone uses In his appeal to Congress al
of the comment concerning hl3 case
which was made by Senator Hanna ir
his brief regarding , the "Wood casÂ«
which was offered in executive sessior
and is now a confidential document o.*
the Senate. Major Rathbone bases nisi
claim for an Investigation upon hia
"right to be heard as an American cit-J

WASHINGTON, March 27 -The cen
sus bureau to-day issued a preliminary
report on irrigation in Oregon in 1902.
It shows that the irrigation conditions
there were above the average. Better
methods of management and a more
economical use of the ordinary water
supply are urged in order to greatly in
crease the number of acres that may
be brought under irrigation. In 1902
the number of farms reported was 5133,
with an irrigated area of 439,931 acres,
an increase since 1893 of 51,671 acres, or
1".3 per cent for the three years. The
per cent of Increase f&r the ten years
from 18S9 to 1S99 was 11S.2. In 1002.2555
irrigating systems were in operation,
representing: a total construction cost
of 52,083.609, an average of $813 per sys
tem and $4 75 per Irrigated acre. The
total length of main canals and ditches
was 3653 miles, an average of 1.4 miles
per system.
â¢The aggregate number of acres ir
rigated by the 2417 systems .receiving
water from streams was 428.925 belong
ing to 497S farms. The average cos,t
per acre was H 81. The 114 systems
supplied with water from springs Ir
rigated 10,759 acres on 131 farms, the
average cost per acre being $2 13. Twen
ty-four well systems irrigated 292 acres,
representing 1 24 farms, at an average
cost per acre of $15 27.
The stream systems cost initially $2.
062.1S8 for the 3604 miles of main canals
and ditches, and the necessary dams
and headgatss. The first cost of the
spring systems was $22,953 and the
length of main ditches was 49 miles.
The construction of the well systems
was $-4*36. â¢ '

TACOMA, March 27. â A Dawson
dispatch says that one of the niost im
portant expeditions ever undertaken
by the Northwest mounted police is
that now en route to Dawson from
Herschcl Island in the Arctic Ocean,
near the mouth of the Mackenzie
River. The distance to be traveled is
2000 miles, making it the longest trip
ever undertaken through an absolute
wilderness in the dead of Arctic win
ter. The purpose is to determine
whether it Is practicable to open a
winter route from the mouth of the
Mackenzie River to Dawson. Ar
rangements for the expedition were
perfected last summer. A picked squad
of men were to attempt it, using dog
teams. They were to leave Herschel
Island early in January, crossing the
Rocky Mountains by one 1 of the several
known passes. Mackenzie River In
dians arriving at Dawson some time
ago brought information that the ex
pedition was soon to start. As the
winter has been unusually cold some
fears are entertained for the safety of
the party.

PROBABLE WINNERS,
. Turner has always been considered a
good trial horse, and no one has ever
ran around seeking the Stockton'ne
gro's game. Turner is dangerous for
any kind of an opponent, because he
has a knockout punch and can cross it
over like lightning. Gans displayed a
wholesome veBpect for Turner when
they met. a' couple of years ago, and no
fighter Is anxious to get? in and trade
blows with him. Cordell is a confident
chap; however, and believes he can
beat him at his own game.
The Reliance Club of Oakland
searched for a long time before it could
find . a suitable card to inaugurate to
morrow night another series of boxing
matches. A happy selection was finally
made in the capture of the signatures
of Jack Cordell and.Rufe Turner. Cor
dell is the. most promising of the young
er generation of boxers in this vicinity,
and his friends foresee a rosy future in
store for him. His third professional
bout was with Aurelia Herrera, and it
is a matter of history that, he outboxed
the hard-hitting Mexican at every turn
in the road.
Cordcll-Tunicr Bout Promising.
It is estimated at the Vatican that
the expenses of the coming year will
amount to nearly two million dollars.
About flve millions of the Papal
moneys, invested as a contingent fund;
will bring interest of more than $250,
000, and other property of the Holy
See will increase the certain income
to nearly half a million dollars. It Is,
then, a million and a half of dollars
which the Vat'can must receive from
the contributions of the faithful.
; '.Every Bishop who visits Rome
takes a contribution from the Catho
lics of his diocese. Mgr. O'Connell of
Newark took $4000 not long: ago. It
is hoped that the ninety-eight. Bishops
of America will be able to send to
Rome this year at least half a million
for Peter's pence. The recent falling
off of French contributions have
found compensation ; in the increased
generosity of Americans.

Game for Tacoma, Which Is
Beaten. -
FRESNO, March 27.â Portland won
her first league game this afternoon,
defeating Tacoma in a close twelve-'
inning contest by a score of 4 to 3. The
feature of the game was the clever
fielding by both teams. Thielman for
Portland pitched good ball. Overall for
Tacoma showed wonderful possibilities
in speed, but was a little wild. It was
one of the best exhibitions of ball ever
seen in Fresno. The score follows:

Waldron started the music for San
Francisco in the first inning when he
soused the first ball pitched over the
right field fence for a homer. Then his
teammates took the hunch and clouted
out six runs before the inning was at
an end. Seattle played a good uphill
game with the bat and nearly won out,
but the fielding of the team was bad
and the teven errors helped Uncle to

Chase, an amateur from Santa Clara,
filled Dillon's position at first and made
a big hit with the 5000 fans who watch
ed the game. He handled himself like
a natural ball player. With Baum,
Eager. Chase, Raymond and Cravath
on the team, it comes near being a
"native son" aggregation. Oakland's
first run was made on a base on balls,
two passed balls and an out. The other
run was due to an unusual bit of luck.
With Kruger on second from a hit and
a passed ball, Schafley dodged a high
in-curve which struck his bat and went
for a safe hit, scoring Kruger. The
feature of the game was the batting of
Bernard. Four times at bat netted
him three singles and a triple. Score:

Series With Oakland.
LOS ANGELES. March 27.â Los An
geles made it three out of four for the
series with Oakland, winning to-day's
game by the score of 5 to 2. Baum. a
San Francisco youngster, pitched his
first game and did excellent work. Bar
ring a slight nervousness at the be
ginning, his work was almost perfect.
He fielded well, struck out five batters,
made two sacrifice hits and was as
steady as a veteran with men on bases.
Makes It Three Out of Four for the
ANOTHER GAME FOR MORLEY.
One of Britt's trainers said yesterday
that his bones are as small as a child's
and are all out of proportion to the size
of his body. This doubtless accounts
for Britt's light weight in proportion to
his height and size.
Jimmy Britt was at the head of a
long procession of small boys and curi
ous ones on the streets last evening,
and though his appearance has im
proved somewhat since he left the ring
at "Woodward's Pavilion, his bruised
features still tell of theterriflc battle in
which he engaged.
. In speaking of a second match with
Corbett Jimmy said: "You can say for
me that if Young Corbett wants an
other try with me he can have it. Fur
thermore I will not keep him waiting
as long as he did McGovern and my
self. I'll fight him as soon as my arm
and hands are in good condition."
Dr. Jones made a careful X-ray ex
amination of Britt's right arm yester
day and reported that a bone is broken
between the elbow and wrist. He says
it will be several weeks before the bones
will be knit sufficiently for Britt to do
any amount of boxing. The injury is
the same as the one he sustained in the
Canole fight.

The Independents beat the Thistles
two goals to one yesterday on the Pre
sidio athletic grounds in the final tie
for the California Association Football
Union cup.
The last match of the series for the
championship of the California Asso
ciation Football League was won by
the Oakland Hornets with a score of
11 goals to 0 against the Pickwicks.
This victory puts the Oakland Hornets
fifth in the table . of results of the
league matches for the season and
ahead of the Occidentals and Pick
wicks.
The Independents lost the toss and
had to play against the wind In the
first period. Soon after the ball had
been put into play rain, began to fall
and continued until the end of the
match.
From the start the play was ! fast
and furious, the Independents playing
a quick game and getting past the de
fensive line of the Thistles several
times. Neither side was able to score
in the first period, though the Scotch
team had three corner kicks.
- In the second period the Indepen
dents, having the wind with them,
pressed the Thistles hard and the
clever passing of the Thistles* forwards
was Â» seriously interfered with by the
slippery ground. At last a hard kick
from one of the Thistles' forwards sent
the ball clean between Mechels* legs.
It slipped through the hands of Forbes,
making the first goal for the Thistles.
Later a free kick was Riven to the In
dependents. Duncanson took it, made
a good kick to P. Fay, who headed it
into the net, equalizing the score.
Then an Independent kicked the ball
into the mouth of the Thistles* goal.
Lowe saved It and put it into the field.
One or the Fays then- kicked it Into the
net and the Independent supporters
became delirious. Referee Robinson
simply awarded a free kick. In the last
few minutes of play Mechels scored a
second goal for the Independents, mak
ing the score read: Independents, 2
goals; Thistles. 1 goal. Arthur Robin
son was referee, with C. "W. Irish and

The members of the San Francisco

Golden Gate Park, on Saturday and
again yesterday In club contests. The
weather conditions proved unfavorable
and only average scores were made.
The scores in the distance event were
unusually low. The official scores fol

The defeated player complained of
the balls used, claiming they were too
heavy and not fast enough. The men
played with a regulation Donchue ball
and it bounded around the court as if
fullof;life.
The tremendous efforts he put forth
In the second game had Its effect on
Fitzgerald and he was, to us"e a prize
ring phrase, "all In." Egan showed no
mercy and went at his opponent with
bulldog tenacity and wc-n the third
game by a score of 21 to 5. Fitzgerald
tried hard in the fourth game, but could
make only 9 points. In the sixth Egan
won as he pleased by a score of 21 to 2,
and he also took the seventh game by a
score of -21 to 8.
Egan gave a most remarkable exhi
bition of strength and agility. He was
just as fast on his feet and drove the
ball with even greater speed in the final
game than in the opening games. He
never let up In his work. The specta
tors imagined he had a bat in his hand,
he hit the ball so hard. Egan's style
opened the eyes of men who play
at the game. He used his left hand
with as much skill as his right and
seemed able to hit the ball from any
position. It was his terrific drives that
won him a victory. Even if Fitzgerald
dM get his hands on. the ball he could
only return it weakly and then Egan
did what he, pleased with it.
Fitzgerald played at times like, a
champion, but these flashes of old-time
playing far between. Egan's
youth and strength, coupled with his
splendid control of the,ball,' gained him
new laurels. â¢ â¢ Â¦ j -
Fitzgerald put his man out quickly
in the second game and went in to
win. He threw all his strength into
his serve and had Egan guessing. Fitz
gerald had 12 to Egan's 4 before Egan
got his hand in and then the visitor
ran it up to 11. Both men tired per
ceptibly and they were more deliberate
In their movements. Instead of run
ning back for the. ball, they would meet
it on the fly and drive it out again.
The back wall play of Goth men was
of high order. Fitzgerald split the
back of his right hand In a wild at
tempt to get under a low drive. Fitz
gerald by a series of "kills" and hard
serving won the second game by a score
of 21 to 15.
Egan secured the first ace by a bril
liant "kill" from the back wall. In his
anxiety to serve points .Egan violated
the rule by overstepping the line and
the referee declared "foul" on each oc
casion. Fitzgerald put Egan out with
a low drive to the left corner and went
in and made a point. The two experts
settled down to their Work and played
brilliantly. It was even up â¢ at six
points. Fitzgerald used a stiff left In
returning and killed repeatedly. Fitz
gerald led for a time and then Egan
began to send out a lightning serve.
The score was even up at 17. After ter
rific play On both sides the men were
tied at 18 and then Egan had a little
luck and captured the first game by a
score of 21 to 18.
The first two games were full of fast
and exciting play. Fitzgerald was fresh
and strong, and his admirers believed
he would ultimately win the series, but
Egan warmed to his work, and the
spectators were treated to sensational
playing. From the standpoint of a
handball expert it was the linest exhi
bitlpn of the fascinating game ever seen
on this coast, or, in fact, in the world.
Before the game Henry Corey and
Jimmy White, two clever amateurs, de
feated Joe Collins and Midgy Maguire
in two out of three games. At the con
clusion of their macth the champion
and the challenger entered the court
and were given a hearty greeting by
the big crowd that filled the three gal
lories. J. C. Nealon, the veteran player,
introduced the pair, and also took oc
casion to thank the directors of the
Olympic Club for making it possible to
bring the foremost exponents of the
game to the court and allowing the
members and devotees of the game to
see them in action. He also Introduced
former Alderman Dunne of New York,
an ex-champion, who came here with
Egan and who acted as scorer. Mr.
Dunne took the opportunity to express
his sincere thanks to the members of
the Oylmpic Club for the many cour
tesies extended Mr. Egan and himself.
He stated that owing to illness Phil
Casey, the one-time champion ' and a
favorite here, was unable to accompany
him on the trip.
Al Hampton was selected to referee
the match, and the men hit the ball
around the court to warm their hands.
Egan won the toss, and the spectators
bent forward to watch the play. The
ball was tossed all over the court, and
this made things lively for the pair. It
caused them to run in every direction
in order to return it to the front wall.
The ball was a "humming bird," and it
made one dizzy to watch it shoot
through space.
Michael Egan of Jersey City proved
to the satisfaction of a large gathering
of handball enthusiasts at the Olympic
Athletic Club yesterday afternoon that
he Is without a peer as an exponent of
the famous Irish pastime. He handily
defeated James Fitzgerald, who held
the title of world's champion, and the
manner in which he captured the six
out of seven games played stamped him
as the man upon whom the laurels of
champion should rest. He was Fitzger
ald's master in every department of the
game except head work. His more ex
perienced opponent had the finer points
of the game down to perfection, but
this availed him little, as Egan's terrific
serving and wonderfully fast returns
forced i Fitzgerald to throw aside his
science and bend his every effort to lay
his hands on the fast moving ball.
From a spectator's standpoint the
games were not as exciting as was an
ticipated. This was due to the wonder
ful playing of Egan. After the second
game Fitzgerald's strength began to
wane, and the young giant from Jersey
City redoubled his efforts and won as
he pleased. With all his cleverness,
Fitzgerald could not return the ball
with speed, and Egan had ample oppor
tunity to manipulate the ball as he
pleased. Fitzgerald showed great clev
erness at times in placing the ball. He
frequently drove it low with each hand
and aroused the enthusiasm of the
spectators.

The rain came down throughout, but
the fans in attendance wanted to see
five Innings anyhow. Jack McCarthy
was kind and allowed the game to gj
on. In the sixth It went beyond the
limit and so the umpire held a consul
tation with himself and motioned to
those present to go and seek their fire
places. The score:
The bases were still full and It looked
bad. Anderson hit one that Shock for
got to stop and of course Meany ar
rived. Then Wilson ordered the big:
slab jirtlst to camp under the bench
for a while and a youngster, Charles
Hall by name, essayed to toss a few.
Massey hit him safely and brought Ir
win in and that was the only run they
got off the kid.
Seattle struck her gait in the second
spasm. Two runs came in as soon as
the northern men got a line on the
kind that^Yerkes throws. In the third,
they commenced to punish the sphere
as though it was convicted of a crim
inal offense. Everybody took a ride on
it and when three had been declared
out five runs were marked up for
Seattle.
all kinds of runs while the rain fell.
Score, 7 to 4.
Uncle forgot to stake his charges to
umbrellas in the afternoon. That was
the principal cause of their downfall.
Wilson's colts did not need such things,
so they won. The game broke up at the
beginning of the sixth Inning. The
Juice came so fast that the base run
ners demanded rowboats. Umpire Mc-
Carthy had no naval stores in his col
lection, so he compromised by calling
the game off.
The locals got in right during the
first inning, but instead of going a little
further, they anchored there in the
mud. They made four runs and thought
that was enough to win, but when
Seattle got started it looked like a
funeral procession. The northern stars
rolled 'em up in every round and would
probably be scoring yet if they had
had their canoes with them.
Mr. Shock, he of the gigantic propor
tions, toed the scratch in the begin
ning of the game for the Seattles. He
lasted about five .minutes. Waldron
sneaked in a hit over the third sack.
Hildebrand was passed and Meany
came through with a bingle. Then Ir
win smashed the leather safely and
"Waldron registered. Leahy walked,
forcing Hilde home.
The Seattle and the San Francisco
baseball men parted for a while yes
terday afternoon after hagding it out
to each other evenly in the. first series.
Uncle's bunch nosed out the visitors
at the finish in the morning set-to
across the bay, 9 to 8. They did not
have strength enough left to waddle
through the mud in the afternoon and
the ducks from northern climes made

P. J. Rellly's fast young courser
Clover Blossom won first honors in the
open stake at Ingleside Coursing Park
yesterday, beating Reckless Acrobat in
the deciding course.
The result was a surprise to the tal
ent, the wise ones figuring Reckless Ac
robat a cinch and playing heavily on
his chances at 1 to 4.
In all her courses Clover Blossom was
led to the hare, but managed to out
work her opponents. With Young
Johnnie Rex she was well favored by
the hare.
Lord Brazen, a young greyhound
from the kennels of G. Lacy Crawford
of St. Louis, carried off the honors yes
terday at Union Coursing Park. For a
moment in the' deciding course it
seemed Free Born, a son of Fetter Free,
would take the Hag from the favorite.
The hare favored the latter and he
made the ecore a tie, each having two
points. At the next attempt Lord
Brazen won all the way, taking the
course by a score of six points to noth
ing. The stake winner opened at S to 1
In the long odds book.
Frank Dunn furnished the surprise
of the day in the second round, when
he outstayed and beat the veteran Sac
ramento Boy, which was a 1 to 10
choice.
Despite the unfavorable condition of
the weather there was a good attend
ance and the betting was heavy. The
favorites won all but twelve of the six
ty-four trials. The driving mist puz
zled the greyhounds, and there were
seventeen trials which had to be run
twice. Liberator was the greatest suf
ferer, as he ran five times with Puhal
low in the first round before the winner
could be named.

The fate of the British ship Lamorna
j would seem to be sealed by the state
i ments in the following telegram re
j ceived at the Merchants' Exchange
I yesterday from Victoria, B. C:
"VICTORIA. March 27.â Two boats
found on Leslie Point, marked La
morca-Greenock. One of them is bro- |
ken five feet from the bow, the rest
missing. Also, two large flags, life i
belts, bedding, spars and blocks, the
long oars, all the decking and upper
i works broken in small pieces. Noth
| ing larger than five feet found." :
From this report, together with oth- j
: era of a similar but less positive nat- j
Â¦ ure, it looks as if ship, officers and j
; crew have been victims of the terrible
I storms that have recently swept the
I northern coast. Early last week, when
j news came that papers belonging to a
f ship's mate, oars and the arm and flg
\ urehead which compared with the flg- j
i urehead of the Lamorna had been '
j found, she was immediately placed on
i the reinsurance list at 40 per cent. The
' next day news from Vancouver
j Island that early In *March Indians
j were reported to have seen a ship in
Â¦ distress, which caused the rate to !
jumr- up to 65 per cent. The next day
! it fell back to 50 per cent and Saturday
! it again jumped up to 65 per cent. The
Â¦ news of yesterday. â¢ will undoubtedly
! run it up to &0 per cent to-day. ;
The Lamorna sailed from Tacoma on j
J February 27 and passed out to sea
> March 1. She was in command of Cap
! tain Creighton. â¢
Both ship and captain were well
I known in this port. She was an iron
I ship, built at Glasgow in 1S93 by Bar
j clay. Curie & Co.. and was of 2169 tons
; register. Her cargo consisted of 27,820
j centals of wheat, valued at $34,775, and
I 56.133 centals of barley, valued at $63,
j 284. She was loaded by Kerr, Gifford &
; Co., grain merchants of Portland, Ore.
i The cargo is insured for $105,000.
At the regular session of the St. Pat

The convention instructed the com

DECLARES A '-NEWSPAPER
SANTA ROSA, March 27. â A storjn
which lasted only a short time, but
which was almost unprecedented in its
fury, broke over this city and vicinity
early this afternoon. There was an in
cessant downpour during the morning
and it has continued to rain unceasing
ly since. Almost half an inch of rain fell
during the short time the storm spent
its fury, bringing the record for the
season to more than 42 inches. With
less than half a dozen exceptions, this
is the largest record of rainfall in Son
oma County within half a century. It
is more than probable that a number
of landslides will be reported as the
result of to-day's storm.
The California Northwestern Rail
road has suffered greater, inconven
ience this year in keeping its road open
to traffic than for ten years past com
bined. The county roads in many
places have also been blockaded by nu
merous small landslides and altogether
the present season is one of the worst
Â¦within the memory of the oldest inhab
itant. It is rapidly passing the time
when crops can be planted to insure
good yields and the long-continued
rains have prevented this being done
previously this season. The grounds
in the lowlands are so thoroughly
soaked it is improbable that even with
the sunshine the next couple of weeks
replacing the rains the ground coufd be
gotten into condition for crops this
year. Some residents' of the county
will have to depend on volunteer crops,
but these are usually sufficient for all
needs.
Th" record this season is about 15
Inches of rain more than at a corres
ponding date last season.

Contant lowered the window and, lean
ing out, started to clean it. Before he
had fairly commenced the work the
small double doors of the dummy
sprang open. Contant's feet were
braced against them and as the doors
burst open the unfortunate grlpman
slipped through them and fell In the
street in front of his car. In falling
Contant grabbed hold of a stanchion
and held on. The fender of the car
kept the man from being run over, but
the dragging over the rough street had
its effect.
Among the passengers on the dummy
were three Japanese who. by their
shouts, informed the conductor, T. J.
Leyhe, of what had occurred. Leyhe
rushed to the front. and, releasing the
grip, stopped the car.
Contant was picked up and cared for
until the patrol from the North End
station arrived and conveyed the in
jured man to the Central Emergency
Hospital.
An examination by Drs. Millar and
Pawlickl showed that Contant had re
ceived a severe fracture of. the hips
and that b/>th ankles and his collar
bone were broken.
The doctors express the opinion that
Contant's injuries are not fatal.

BY A MIRACLE
Anna Eva Fay, the woman magi
cian, appeared at the California Thea
ter last night in a series of tests which
she characterizes as "somnolency." A
packed house greeted Miss Fay and
her wonderful mind reading and mag
ical acts created a deep impression on
her audience. Three gentlemen were
called upon the stage In the first part
of the performance to examine the va
rious equipments. The woman magi
cian introduced some wonderful feats,
such as playing various musical in
struments and transforming different
articles while her hands were tied be
hind her back. She then cut herself
loose with a knife borrowed from one
of the spectators.
But the most interesting part of the
performance was the mind reading
test, the last on the programme. Each
person in the audience was requested
to write a question on a piece of paper
and then sign his or" her name. Miss
Fay was. blindfolded and she readily
picked out different persons in the au
dience and answered their questions.
Some of them were very funny and
created a furor of applause and laugh
ter. The Fitzpatrick family and John
Lemuels, a monologist, who appear
with Miss Fay, were very entertain
ing. A series of moving pictures was
shown between acts.
Taffary's dogs are on the list of hold
overs and the little animals perform
with almost human action. Adelina
Roattino and Clara Stevens repeat
their singing and dancing act and are
as popular as they were last week.
The five Mowats, jugglers, do re
markable work at the Orpheum this
week. The quintet give an exhibition
that has never been excelled in this
city and in both single handed and
team work offer more than was ex
pected.
One feature of the show last night
â¢was the appearance of Jimmie Britt in
the audience. The victor of the last
flstic encounter fought in this city
walked up the center aiBle with his
friends and before he reached his seat
received an ovation. Cheers were
heard from every part of the house
and the popularity of the champion
was apparent. Calls were made for a
speech, bnt Britt refused to make one,
but bowed modestly to his admirers.
Wesson, Walters and Wesson pre
sent a farce, "Hotel Repose." It was
full of action and the plot was good.
Coakley and McBride came second on
the programme and gave the audience
new gags and jokes. Their work was
good and they received much applause.
Mazuz and Mazett, in a sketch, "The
Brakeman and the Tramp," did clever
acrobatic work and the make-up of the
tramp was original and characteristic.
James H. Cullen, known on the bills
as "The Party From the* West," sang
several comic songs/ including paro
dies, and retired with honor.
La Belle Guerrero, assisted by Du
faure Philippe, in pantomine work,
continues in her sketch "The Rose and
the Dagger." Billy Clifford, the
"Broadway Chappy," offers a bunch of
new jokes and songs and is called be
fore the curtain several times.

The amateur minstrel jubilee given
at the Columbia Theater last night for
the benefit of the Emanuel Sisterhood
was a success, and the coffers of that
worthy institution will have to be in
creased to hold the large receipts de
rived therefrom.
The audience, which packed the the
ater, was almost entirely in full even
ing dress and presented a brilliant ap
pearance and bestowed unstinted ap
plause upon the clever young perform
ers, who ranged from about 15 to 18
years of ago.
The minstrel show .opened the first
part. " Seated .upon the stage were 40
aspirants for histrionic fame, arrayed
in faultless tltting tuxedos, faced with
brilliant crimson satin. All were
blacked up except the interlocutor.
The songs were fresh and new and
were sung in snappy style, thÂ« soloists
being supported by a chorus'of well
drilled voices. The jokes all had the
advantage of being free from antiqui
ty. Morgan A. Gunst, as the interloc
utor, showed the ease and self-compos
ure of a professional and kept the show
from lagging for an Instant.
The second part was made up of a
sort of semi-fairy spectacle entitled
"The Dandelion's Escape." described
on the programme as being "a rollick
ing rhythm of rot." The honors of this
portion of the bill fell to Woody Col
man, who is a natural comedian and
entertainer as well as a splendid stage
dancer. In his act Colman had the as
sistance of five stalwart ballet dancers
whose get-ups and wigs were decid
edly reminiscent of the style affected
by Gertie Emerson, late of Fischer's.
The finale act was entitled "The Be
wildered Buttercup," in which Morgan
Gunst and the full company sang "Ma
Curley Headed Baby."
The floral offerings were so numerous
that' it was found Impossible to hand
them over the footlights, so they were
piled up In a pyramid in the foyer.
Following was the programme:
The soloists were Miss Millie Flynn
and Mrs. Max Warshauer, sopranos;
Miss Una Falrweather and Mrs. Nelson
Lawrence, contraltos; Chester Rose
krans and A. G. Davis, tenors; Peter
J. Osken, C. V. Lane and G. S. Wanrell,
bassos.
â¢ The prayer service before and at the
conclusion of the cantata was conduct
ed by the Rev. Dr. O'Mara.
Every afternoon this week there will
be evensong at Trinity at 4:30 o'clock
and Mr. Eaton will direct the soloists
and full choir at a special musical serv
ice at 8 o'clock Wednesday night, when
Stainer's cantata, "The Crucifixion,"
will be given.
The persons in the cantata "Calvary"
are the Apostle John, the Apostle Peter,
Judas Iscariot. Mary, the disciples,
Caiaphas. Philo, Nicodemus, Joseph of
Arimathea, the witnesses, the priests
and the people.
Those among the congregation last
night who have had the rare opportu
nity of hearing - Spohr's work by the
great choirs of the East or abroad
would with full Justice and without
bias place the rendition at Trinity on
equal ground with the best that has
been done vocally or instrumentally for
the composition in other musical cen
ters. ,.v-
Organist Eaton had nine soloists. In
dependent of his large and efficient
choir, and the manner of the rendering
of the solos and choruses was almost
thrilling in effectiveness. And with the
accompaniment of the great organ,
nothing indeed was lost from the su
perb religious work.
"Calvary," by Louis Spohr, was given
fcist night at Trinity Church, Gough
and Bush streets, by the Trinity choir
and under the direction of Louis H.
Eaton, the organist and director.
In spite of the very wet weather a
big assemblage of worshipers ventured
out to render devotion and hear the
marvelously beautiful and interpreta
tive music of a master.
