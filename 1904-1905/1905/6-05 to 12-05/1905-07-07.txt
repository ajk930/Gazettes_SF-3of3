Chairman Sbarboro
Says Government Is
in Competent Hands
A. Sbarboro acted as chairman and
made a short talk, speaking as follows:
"Members of the Commercial Bodies
of San Francisco. Honorable Guests,
His Excellency the Governor. Fellow-
Citizens: We have met at the festal
board this evening for purpose of
gri\-ing a hearty greeting to the Hon.
William H. Taft, Secretary of War, and
to the distinguished Government rep
resentatives who will accompany him
to the Orient.
"This is the first time in the history
of San Francisco that we have been
honored by such a large body of prom
inent Government officials at any one
time.
"In the hands of these gentlemen
has partly been for some time and Is
likely for a long time to remain the
destiny of our great country. We con
gratulate ourselves that our future is
in pood hands and that the ship of
etate will be sailed by these gentle
men, led by their captain at Washing
ton, to the ports of safety and pros
perity.
"Many of you gentlemen have per
haps not yet inspected California, and
consequently you do not know that we
hare here a State which; will in the
near future maintain in happiness and
prosperity more people than any other
State in the Union.
"I will therefore call on his Excel
lency George C. Pardee. our esteemed
The San Francisco Call.

Governor, to speak to you about "The
State of California." t
Governor Par dee
Arouses Applause
by Brilliant Talk
When Governor Pardee arose to speak
be was received with tremendous
cheers. He said In part:
"I am called upon to speak on 'The
State of California.' I cannot ' imagine a
greater subject to talk on, and I know I
have no prowess of eloquence to do jus
tice to It. In the first place, in behalf,
of the people of this State, I extend
greetings to the Secretary and to the
other members of his party. We are
glad to have you with us. If I remem
ber correctly some one has said, 'See
Naples and die'; now I want to say this,
that any one who comes to this Stateâ
who goes about and sees the green
trees, the fertile valleys, the wealth of
orange groves, the vineyards filled with
luscious grapes, the fig trees and the
fruits that are native to almost every
clime, that visitor will say, and he will
say it with a loud, strong voice: 'See
California and live!' (Great' cheering.)
"Many explorers of note passed up
and down our favored land, but it re
mained for. that bold pioneer, John
Marshall, to discover the great sold
fields that brought our beloved . State
first Into prominence before the world.
It was this first great gold discovery
that brought Into this State men of
great intellects, men of massive, strong
characters, whose principles : and â¢ bril
liant minds were the foundations' of
making: this State what' it ; is - to-day.
Gold, however, is 'not our. only wealth
to-day. Our wealth to-day* lies in the
fact that in this State we have 1.750,000
happy and- contented people, who :iove
the State, who love the Union, who lovÂ«
the stars and stripes, and in the name
of these people I bid . you all welcome
here to-night.
"The. people of this State are proud
of -the peaceful attitude of the United
States, under whose flag tbeyare so
happy and united. .
"And now, Mr. Secretary, you, who
come here to represent the - foremost
man of the world, President Roosevelt
(tremendous, cheering); â¢ I again say,, we
are happy to have ; you in ; our State. We
hall you and we greets you.; We /wish'
you, a safe trip to .the lands to which
you . are - bound and we wish you a ' saf o
return." (Â§13323 -

upon the interests of the Pacific

"We have. the right man In the right

Judge W. W. , Morrow was the 'next
speaker. He announced at the start of
his . remarks that he was supposed to

that . the Secretary had already ;. been
welcomed by the Governor of, the State

ly what Welcome he was expected to

"It might bo possible," he added,
"that I am to welcome the Secretary

He. praised the 'work of Secretary,
Taft and said he 'was an important fao

speech Chairman Sbarboro called upon

on important questions are memories that
those who - were associated with , him I at
the Cabinet table can look back upon. He
was a man of the finest literary sense, a
poet a historian, and, above all, the
greatest diplomatist . From the standpoint
of diplomacy alone, perhaps, the greatest
this country has ever Â« seen.;: A man .of
singular faculty, for seizing the psycholog
ical moment when, by a'masterful stroke,
he could lead the nations of the earth into
a self-denying agreement that made for
righteousness and peace; < . \u25a0
"And now It devolves. upon me in this

* * * and make them patient while we are instructing them in self-gov

come a solution of the problem."
Schools Jire Growing.
"Discouraging reports come : from the
islands. In one place ladrones have
broken ; out and have been suppressed,
in another a public meeting .denouncing
the Government, or It may bea lack of
prosperity, or the people, as^was * the
case a - short time ago, are , threatened
with starvation. /All these are the ob
stacles In our way and if .we are to be
discouraged we might as well ' go out of
the government-making business.
"No Government can be made in two,
three, five or a decade of years. It
takes-time; to fit and educate a'people.

Philippines that you cannot emphasise

this . year : at - the close lof the . school

I do not care, what so-called leaders
of 'Filipino talk' may say, ' those facts

THEODOSIA BEING BOMBARDED BY
THE KN I AZ POTEM KIN E
Battleship Is Said to Have Attacked the Black Sea Port
Another Report, Coming From Odessa, States That the Revolutionary
MUTINEERS
STILL HAVE
FREE HAND
Naval Officials Rendered
Pow erless by Refusal
iof Black Sea Crews to
Engage the Freebooters
ODESSA, July 6â ThÂ« Kniaz Potemkine
etill occupies the center of the stage htre.
The authorities are well Informed about
her movements and h,er operations at the
various Black Sea ports form the topic
of continuous speculation and comment In
business and official circles. But, as the
opinion prevails here that she' will not
return to menace Odessa, the Odessans
view her doings Interestedly, but not
with any particular alarm. "' '
The fact that the Kniaz Potemkine is
ttiil at large, cruising in the Black Sea.
threatening ports and holding up steam
ships and other craft Is beginning to
bring criticism upon the naval authori
ties, owing to their apparent slowness arid
lack of energy in pursuing and terminat
ing her piratical career.
The torpedo-boats which, it is reported,
are trailing the Kniaz Potemkine. . have
done nothing, although the whereabouts
of the battleship has never been a se-'
cret. The Black Sea is so smaJl that she
has never tM?en out of reach of the fleet,
which loft here yesterday and which Is
popularly supposed to be following the
renegade for the purpose of effecting her
surrender or sinking her. If the fleet is in
earnest, it can easily meet the Kniaz
Potemkine within a comparatively few
hours. The belief it general, however
â¢ and there is general confirmation of it),
that the main difficulty confronting the
fleet lies in the fact that the crews of
the ships are strongly disinclined to en
gage the mutinous battleship. It is re
ported on good authority that the crews
have actually refused to attack her.
In the meantime commerce on the
Black Sea is being slowly resumed and
coastwise and other steamships are
clearing from Odessa on their former
schedules. '- Â£ f '
Odessa is resuming its 'normal life and
the theaters and other public places are
reopening, while street life is about the
same as usual. There. ia.a strong under
current ftf uneasiness; "however, and fur
ther disorders are expected sooner or
later. Just at present the reign of mili
taty law and the recollection of the re
cent lessons are acting as strong deter
rents to unruly persons.- The poiice are
active in making arrests and deporting
suspected persons. House to house
searches are frexjuent and they have re
.sulted In the finding of a number of
bombs. It is believed that practically
a.ll tha Jewfe are armed!
Present conditions are proving a serious
deterrent to business here. The port
shows fair activity and the factories are
resuming, but not -a business man is
coming to Odessa and the hotels are al
most empty. The lack of confidence is
widespread and trade Is very dull.

to-day.

SCORED BY THE PRESS
Declared! by the Slovo to
Lack the Ability to Con
duct Great Negotiations
ST. PETERSBURG. July 6.â M. Mu
ravieff will arrive on Sunday. He will
receive jpeclal instructions from the
Emperor and consult with the various
Ministers , and will leave with ' his
suite for Washington probably about
July 20,. but the date is not absolutely
fixed. Russia has hot' yet received
information as to Japan's. attitude to
ward an armistice.
The Slovo to-day severely criticizes
the selection of M. Muravleff as one of
the Russian peace plenipotentiaries,
declaring, that he has neither the abil
ity nor the temperament to conduct
great negotiations. His rise to the po
sition of Minister of Justice, the paper
affirms, was not due to his faithful
ness to the Ideals of justice, but rather
devotion to the arbitrary, methods
which are execrated throughout Rus
sia. The Slovo recalls ,the "deplorable
incidents which marked M. Muravleff's
connection with the Hartman affair In
Paris and The Hague . conference" as
reasons for expressing the opinion tnat
negotiations under his direction are
sure to be accompanied by many dis
appointments. â¢ '
It is generally, understood here that
M. Muravieff's selection was extremely
distasteful to Foreign "Minister Lams

personal act. ' . ' .

SWEDEN'S WAR
TALK SUBSIDES
Special Committee Warns
Nation That It Is Not
Prepared \ to Fight Norway
JINGOES ARE SILENT
Colonel Bratt Says Only
30,000 Troops Could Be
Sent ;' to the Front
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
CHRISTIANIA.-July 6.â Sweden's war
party has become less aggressive of late,
though the war press continues to spread
stories -regarding alleged threatening mili
tary movements on -the part of. Norway.
These stories, however, receive less credit,
now that Norway has denied them.
The Swedish war press deplores the
fact that the Government subdues the
warlike tendencies of the Riksdag. Swed
en Is warned by the special committee of
the Government that the country Is in
sufficiently prepared to wage a success
ful war. Colonel Bratt, an esteemed
Swedish military .authority, publishes an
article in a Swedish paper, stating that
Sweden Is unable to raise more than 80,000
effective troops against Norway, while
Norway says she can raise 70,000. The ar
ticle has caused much comment In Swed
en. It has produced a sobering effect, af
ter the boasting of the jingoes that 450,
000 men could' be put into the field.. Most
of the Swedish papers think 100,000 men
can be raised, but admit this too few for
the . purpose.
Despite the action in the Swedish Riks
dag for the raising of a war loan of 100,
000,000 kroner <*26.800.000) the general im
pression here is that Sweden is tired of
war talk and will soon, ask:
"Why go ' to war when union Is not
wanted?" .
However. It will be still 'some time be
fore the Swedish mind'wiirbe clear. ;
Norway's business continues undis
turbed. Trade is stimulated by the pros
pect of a good harvest. Tourist traffic Is
large. Fewer Swedes, however, are trav
eling, in the country. \u0084 J..1

to a pitch of angry excitement, that has

.The National Butchers' Association to
day railed upon Chancellor yon Bulow to
employ the full, power of the Government
to save the country from the disastrous
result:- of an impending meat famine. The
trust has forced prices to the highest
point evpr known in the fatherland. Pork,
the suattrancc of the working classes,
has advanced beyond. their reach and the
middle class now looks upon veal and
beef as luxuries. Relief is possible only
through' the opening of the frontiers. Rus

LOS AJNGELES/ July $.â The plan to
hold a convention "of the American "Wine
Growers' Association" In San Francisco

the meeting may be held some time late
In August, but that will depend upon the
decision of the officers of the organiza
tion, and they have informed those In Los
Angeles who are Interested that nothing
definite has aa vet been arranged.'
Alfred Stern of this city, one of the
leading wine producers of this part of the
State, Is a district president of the or
ganization. Asked to-night why the con
vention had been called oÂ«.. he replied: J
The plan to brlns between 225 and 230
members of the association to California on a
special train and hold a convention in San
Francisco originated with tho leading mer
bers in the Â£.a*t. who proposed to make oi
the trip a . summer outing. Elaborate prep
arations bad twen made Jcr the reception of
the ! party here " and the local members \u25a0would
have accompanied them north. Sereral days
ago I received official- notice from tha railroad
officials that the party had abandoned their
proposed trip, owing- to illness In tho families
of several of the most prominent members.
Secretary Vance is -detained at home, owins
to a surgical operation \u25a0which his mother wm
obliged to undergo, and other leaders In th Â»
association are unable to come at to '-3 tlnv>
for various reasons. Therefore tha contention
for the present was abandoned. /
S. E. Secundo Uuastl. who Is also an
officer In the association and a prominent
wine merchant, stated to-night that to
day he received a letter from President
Anderson of the association Informing
him that the members found it Impossible
to come west In a body this month. Presi
dent Anderson, however, Intimated that
they might come late in August.
Vice President Stern of the association
also stated to-nfght that he had been In
formed that a number of members of the
association are In Los Angeles but not
as members of that organization. If they
are here they have failed to communicate
with members of the association and Its

7 A FT TALKS OF PHILIPPINES
Continued Pruni I'npc 1, Column 7.
"If 1 had not been interviewed and
n:ade to take so many different positions
en t ho. Chinese question 1 would not think
it important to "To-state my position In
the natter. I knew Californians have a
â¢ tittinite view and my view generally is
"thi*: We have reached a point in the
life of our nation where we are to be
treated bjr other nations as 'adult male,'
where we expect from other nations some
measure of courtesy and justice as we
would mete out to them. I understand
that all nations of the world know that
we are not obliged to make this conti
nent a dumping ground for their beggars
and robbers and bad people generally, and
therefore we may pause properly and
still stand up and look them in the face.
"I elso understand we have Informed
the Chinese nation that its coolie class
does not amalgamate and become citizens
a::d that therefore we exclude them. That
hne been understood by the Chinese gov
ernment and recognized by us. But on
the other hand we have refused entry to
Chinese merchants and students whoni it
wouM be an advantage to this country
to admit. We should keep with the Chi
nese nation the advantage that we have
by reason of the fact that it believes
~we are not land grabbers in the Orient
and desire to do justice â a position of ad
vantage given us to secure the Immense
Chinese trade awaiting development on
the Pacific Coast.
"And shall we pursue the policy that
\u25a0will insult Chinese merchants and stu
dents and destroy our advantage with
Ciiina in international affairs? I say
no. And the State of California will
say no if the State knows her own In
terests â not only the wealthy men, but
the laboring men. The laboring men
are the bone and sinew of the country.
end every time you Increase our trade
by one hundred million, seventy-five
niillipns are going 1 to the laboring man.
Is it possible for the interests of labor
thiit we will find it necessary to fling
Insulting measures In the face of China?
"I hope I have made plain my view
on the Chinese question.
"I am not criticizing the enforcement
of the law. If by treaty or law It ia
necessary to insult, then those laws
should be repealed.
The Panama Canal
"Is California interested in the con
struction of the Panama canal? I can
not tell you in the snort time allowed
the various plans settled upon those In
charge of the canal by the President
and Congress. In the construction of
the canal thus far Congress has ginger
ly laid down rules that might have re
lieved some of us of responsibilities.
We presumed it was our business in
the absence of Congressional interven
tion to build the canal as cheaply as
v. - c could and therefore when we
wanted vessels we went to England
and Germans- to secure them and looked
over their market and came back. We
found here somewhat more expensive
vessels, butf*T>etter for our purpose, and
now we have two American vessels.
aÂ»j so we expect to proceed until Con
gress shall lay down different rules,
getting material where It can be best
procured, which has so far been in
American markets. The very fact that
we do not intend to stay in American
markets when we do not think the
price is reasonable may induce people
to come to a reasonable price,
"The canal has a railroad by its side.
We had- to buy the railroad when we
bought the canal of the French Panama
Canal Company. We have obtained en
tire control of the, road, which enables
us to do exactly as we choose. We pro
pose to run it and charge an equal rate
for the carrying of goods across the Isth
mus, and all who send goods will be
charged exactly the same rate. It may
discourage American shipping on the Pa
cific side. Snould the policy followed by
the present representatives of the Gov
ernment fall, we must ask other gov
ernmental representatives to carry it out.
"We are trying to run the railroad as
a link In the commerce of the two oceans,
bo that everybody can count upon a
square deal, and It will resemble the
canal. This Is one of the means of keep-
Ing up a competition to the continental
routes. I am not entirely certain that
the results following the completion of
the canal will be what some enthusiastic
Californians expect, but we will try to
give you a square deal, and if upon com
pletion of the canal California loses any
commerce she must turn to the National
Government for help in solving a later
problem.
"I cannot close without repeating again
the depth of gratitude that I and all
,*>e members of the party feel, and I
fewe the enthusiasm of your welcome to
the 'act that distinguished Senators and 1
Congressmen are with me and have done
me the honor to accompany me on the
Philippine Journey, upon the request of
the Philippine Government that they also
make the visit. So they have taken these
100 days out of their busy lives to look
Into the trust that we have assumed as
a nation, which the honor of our nation
requires us sacredly to protect."
Congressman Sereno E. Payne, chair
man of the "Ways and Means Committee
of the House, delivered an eloquent ad
flrcss, to tiCi effect that the markets of
the United States should b* opened to
Philippine products and the tariff barrier
should be removed.
United States Senator Frank P. Flint
responded to the toast, "The Interest of
the Pacific Coast in the Development of
the Philippines." His remarks were at
tentively listened to and frequently ap
plauded.
George E. Foss, chairman Xaval Affairs
Committee, spoke on "The American
Navy." /%y
Foss Speaks for a
Strong Navy and
World Influence
Congressman Foes* speech was in part
as follows:
"It has been said that a navy is an
expensive luxury in time of peace, and
it is; but it must be remembred that it
is an indispensable necessity In time of
war.
"Our naval appropriation act this year
carried $100,000,000. and yet on the basis of
per capita this is a Htile more than tl
for every man. woman ano child in the
country. It is only about 4 per cent of
our fcricgn trade during the past year,
whicn amounted to about $2,500,000,000. It
is 14 per cent of our annual governmental
expenditures, a less percentage than was
expended upon the navy one hundred
years ago. It is only one-tenth of 1 per
cent of our national wealtn,
"There are some who think that -we
ought to stop building the,' navy, but
these people largely constitute 'that class
of our citizens who believe in the idea of
a little nation. They would bÂ« glad to
see us live in- solitude and' isolation on
Â»*Â»â¢ hemisphere and not exert the power
and influence that we are capable of
among: the nations of the world, and if
war should ever come the only thing
which they would interpose would be the
golden rule against me guns of the en
emy; but, sir, mankind has not reached
that state of perfection yet. I trust the
time will come when the war, drums will
beat no longer and when there will be
no necessity for military establishments
of any character, but the time has not
yet come.
If there is any lesson which has come
to us during the last few weeks from
across the sea it is that a navy Un con
stant teadiness is oftentimes able to
strike a blow from which its antagonist
perchance may never be able to recover.
And then there is another thing which
must be taken into consideration. The
only time to build a navy is in time of
peace. There is this distinction between
the army and the navy. It takes years
to build your ships. Ii takes longer to
train seamen than to train soldiers, and
when war comes all preparations must
cease. It is too late to build a navy then.
Every man to the ship and every man
to the gun
"Let it be said, and it cannot be said
too often, that we are building up a
navy for peace, and let this .be our sen
timent: The American navy, may she
ever be ready for war, but may she never
be required to lire a single shot. Let us
continue our policy of building up the
navy for the protection of our interests;
for the defense of our coast line; for the
guardianship of the Panama Canal. And,
sir, we have a President in the iWhite,
House who proposes to build it, fiÂ»r the
maintenance of the Monroe doctrine; for
the protection of the Filipinos, whom we
are lifting fro^n the bondage of supersti
tion and ignorance up into the clear sky
of American civilization; for the protec
tion of our growing trade and commerce;
for that peace honorable in the sight of
man and approved of Godâ that kind of
peace that never makes surrender of na
tional duÂ«f or national honor or national
obligation.
"Let us build as we are building it,
conservatively, along statesmanlike lines,
not moved by the passion of the hour,
but with a fixed and determined purpose
to give our country such a navy that in
every great national crisis she can ever
maintain that calmness and poise that
becometh a great nation and a great peo
ple, clow to anger and plenteous in
mercy, but when she strikes may she
ever rtrike as Dewey struclt at Manila,
for honor, for Justice, for righteousness,
for civilization, and for "that perfect lib
erty of mankind" which under benign
rulings of the Almighty God Is the great
and glorious mission of our America."

quet came to a close.

and Californians '^They Are Quests of .
Mr., and Mrs. A. W. Foster.
PATRIOTIC AIRS ARE PLAYEp â¢
ON TRIP ACROSS THE BA7
Masses of Golden State Fruits off Many
Varieties Are Arranged on the-Rus
- tic Tables to Delight of Visitors.
SHORT AND WITT! SPEECHES
DELIVERED DURING REPAST
Secretary Taft and party, including
Miss Alice Roosevelt, spent the day yes
terday in the Bohemian Club grove:
Many Californians also took the trip.
They were all the guests of , Mr. and
Mrs. A. W. Foster. The outing was
thoroughly enjoyed, though the day
was a trifle overwarm., *
Both Secretary Taft and Miss Roose
velt expressed themselves as delighted
with the trip and the magnificent
groves they passed through. The beau
tiful summer jinks home of the : Bo
hemian Club never looked prettier. ' '
The party left town on the Cazadero
at 8 o'clock. The ferry-boat was gayly
decked v/lth American flags and on the
tallest staff was the brilliant red flag
of the Secretary of War. As the boat
left the dock -the band struck 'up
"Hail, Columbia!" and continued to play
lively national airs until Tiburon was
reached.* Here the party was joined by
Admiral and Mrs. McCalla, who had
come down from Mare Island on the
tug Unadilla. The train which took the
distinguished party to the camp was
decorated with flats and the Secre
tary's flag streamed to the breeze on
the engine-house. -,
The special stopped at Santa Rosa at
10 a. ml nnd took aboard Luther Bur
bank, Congressman Duncan E. McKln
lay and wife and Superior Judge Albert
G. Burnett and wife.
MASSES OF FRUIT.
Immediately, on arrival at the ~grove<
luncheon was served.'. . Small tables had
been arranged in horseshoe shape un
derf+tTte shade of the great trees and all
were decorated with masses of Cali
fornia fruits. There were luscious
watermelons, clusters of grapes of
every shade, hue and variety; rosy
tinted peaches, oranges, apples, .pears.
Miss Roosevelt was charmed with the
sight. She could hardly express her de
light in words at the magnificent dis
play of the, products of the State.
Secretary Taft expressed himself as
surprised at the many different kinds
of fruit that massed together in such
luxurious profusion.
The repast was a delicious 'one. The
feast was enlivened by the music of a
large string band and vocal selections
were rendered by a male quartet.
The speeches were of the most informal
character. Mr. Foster began with a few
remarks about his guests, and then for
nally introduced Secretary Taft. who
made a short speech later, praising the
beauties of the grove.
Judge Morrow, in a few words, told
the visitors about the hfstory of the
grove. He said the big redwood trees
were planted some time in the days when
Moses flourished, that they had slowly
grown during Solomon's time, and had in
creased considerably during Julius
Ceasar's reign, and were still growing in
size and spleandor.
PEUKI.VS OUTDOES MORROW.
Senator Perkins also commented upon
the trees of the grove. He differed some
what in his remarks from those made by
Judge Morrow, as he ' said the . original
olive branch had been plucked from one
of the big trees in the days of Noah
and his ark.
S7lort remarks were also made by Gov
ernor Pardee and the Secretary. The
party oh the return trip was greeted at
TSburon by a large number of the resi
dents of that summer resort. The ladles
came djessed' in white and presented a
pretty picture as the train from the red
woods pulled into the station. > They all
joined in hearty cheers to Mr.' Taft and
Miss Roosevelt as they wended their way
to the ferry-boat.
Miss Roosevelt was attired in a gown

ENORMOUS PRICE PAID

Deal in Beach Property
Ever Made in the South
-
Special XMspatcb to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. July 6.â The largest
deal in beach property ever made here
was consummated to-night when for a
consideration which la not made public
but whjcb is known to amount into the
b'endrods of thousands of dollars, Henry
K. Huntington purchased, outright the
holdings of the Redondo j Improvement
Company, the corporation .which estab
lished that beach resort and which has
made ail of the valuable Improvements
there. Tne eSect of the deal is that Hun
tlngtoa has practically purchased the
toTMi of Redondo.
ThÂ« orixinal tract which the Redondo
Improvement Company held consisted of
one thousand acres and, although a num
ber of lots have been sold since the com
pany has had the place, nearly the entire
holding remains intact, most of the ten
ants having secured only leases upon the
lots which they Improved. v
I Back from the beach proper the town
is regularly laid out, with broad aye
' nues, bordered by fine shade trees. The
streets are now grass-grown, but all
that is needed to make of the place an
ideal beach village is the resurfacing
of these streets.
The stock in the improvement com
pany was owned mostly by the Ains
worth family and Mr. Thompson of San
Francisco and it is their holdings, to
gether with that of others interested,
that Huntington takes over. He has
announced that he will make of Re
dondo the most attractive beach resort
on the southern coast. It is only
eighteen miles from Los Angeles and
has two electric and one steam railroad
to this city.

Meaning of Word "Graft."
The Middlesex Superior Court Is
wrestljng with the problem of defining
the meaning of the word "graft." as
used In the newspapers. The counsel
for a Lowell paper which has been sued
for libel for its use of the word has
offered to submit to the court a brief
defining: the meaning of "graft," or
rather its various meanings, for there
seems to be a use of the word in which
nothing corrupt is implied., in this
sense it means merely the holding of
a public office, the returns from which
may be entirely proper. The courts
will then decide which of the various
meanings of the word must be at
tached to Its use in the alleged libel
Thus it appears that there Is "good
graft' and "bad graft." The English
language, or rather its colloquial use.
Is a wonderful thing, and when we have
the word "graft" meaning something
entirely proper and something entirely
wrong, the person who uses it should
accompany the phrase with a defini
tion. â Boston Transcript.

JAURES BARRED
FROM GERMANY
"French Socialist Leader
Will Not Be Permitted
to Speak in Berlin
YON BULOW'S WARNING
Instructs Embassador Rado
lin to Notify the Orator to
Abandon His Intention
BERLIN, July 6. â Chancellor yon
Bulow telegraphed to Prince Radolln,
the German Embassador at Paris, to
day to Inform M. Jaures, the French
Socialist leader, that the German Gov
ernment thought it best to debar him
from speaking in Berlin on July 9.
The Chancellor's telegram to Prince
yon Radolln was as follows:
"The press has announced that M.
Jaures will appear before the Social
istic meeting here July 9. Against the
personality of M. Jaures I have noth
ing to say. I respect his views on for
eign politics and not infrequently
agree wltli him. I am glad that on
several occasions he has promoted
friendly relations between Germany
and France. The personal value of M.
Jaures is not considered, but the po
litical role placed upon him.
"The leading organ of the Socialists
In Germany, the Vorwaerts. announces
that the assemblage plan is the be
ginning of- the immediate influences of
the Social Democracy on foreign pol
icies, and that a war of/ the classes
will be prompted on an international
foundation. Still more clearly Is the
aggressive intention of the promoters
of this meeting expressed In the organ
of the so-called scientific Socialism,
the New Society, which says:
"The revolution has dynamited the
Russian-French alliance. Now it be
comes the historical task of the German
Social Democracy to do for the French
republic what the holders of power In
Russia are no longer able to do â to pro
tect them from exaggerated claims by
the use of force as the result of impe
rialistic Germany's policy." .
This is the outspoken direction in
which the demonstration leads. The
German Socialists would use the pres
ence of Herr Jaures In Berlin to cover
by his person their hostile endeavors
against the state and national interests.
The imperial Government cannot refrain
from using the means at its disposal to
prevent the party from seeking to de
stroy the existing and constitutionally
established order.
Yon Bulow cites Instances of tho
French Government's Interdiction of
speeches which, it had been announced,
were to be made by members of the Ger
man Reichstag,. and then says:
"Even although it were to be expected
that Herr Jaures would have the tact
to avoid anything that might be un
pleasant for the German and French
Governments, one <Â£annot have similar
confidence in the German organizers of
the meeting. .
"Nearly a year ago Herr Jaures had an
.opportunity of convincing himself at Am
sterdam of how far behind the more prac
tical and patriotic aims of their French
colleagues the German Social Democracy
stand in their contradictory doctrine and
behavior.
"In such circumstances the Franco-Ger
man understanding would gain nothing
by the probable course of events at the
proposed meeting, and I therefore con
sider it advisable that the public appear
ance of Herr Jaures in Berlin shall not
take place."
The invitation to M. Jaures came frbm
the Socialist executive committee ruling
the party, and was designed to advance
the Socialist opposition to the Govern
ment's Moroccan policy and to demon
strate the similarities of view on foreign
questions of Socialists of all countries.
The subject chosen was the task of the
Social Democracy in the preservation of
the world's peace and the solidarity of
the international proletariat.
PARIS, July 6.â Something of a sensa
tion has been created here by the an
nouncement that Deputy Jaures, leader of
the French Socialists, had been prohib
ited by the German Government from
speaking at Berlin next Sunday. The
proposed address attracted much discus
sion, owing to its significance as fore
shadowing the common programme to be
adopted by the Social Democracy of the
two countries.

ROOT REINQUISHES HIS LAW PRACTICE
TO BECOME THE SECRETARY OF STATE
Official Announce
ment to-Be Made
I oJJay .
President Succeeds
in Inducing Him
to Accept.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
OYSTER BAY, L. 1., July 6.â Offldal
announcement will be made by President
Roosevelt to-morrow of the appointment
of Elihu Root as Secretary of State. On
tho return trip from Cleveland, which
ended In Jersey City this morning. Presi
dent Roosevelt was able to induce Mr.
Root to consent to forsake his lucrative
law practice for the chief Cabinet position
as the succersor to John Hay.
Mr. Root's acceptance,' it Is generally
believed, js due, only to his deep friend
ship for the Presidentâ a friendship of
long years' standing. That the office was
offered to him does not surprise anybody
In the dfllcial family." His name was "al
most the only one mentioned for the ap
pointment, since it became known that
Mr. Hay's failing health would compel
him to rel'nquish public life sooner' or
later. . , .. ,
Mr. Root was chosen to represent the
Department of State at Mr. Hay's fu
neral. He was the President's personal
guest on the trip. He occupied a com
partment in Mr. Roosevelt's private car
and they were' constantly together. While
the other official representatives jon the
train were invited to breakfast, luncheon
anddinner on occasions, Mr. Root dined
regularly at the Presidential table.
After leaving Cleveland on Wednesday
afternoon the President and Mr. Root
entered Into a conversation which lasted
until very late, and during which time
they were not disturbed. ; The formal
tender of the office was made then, it is
believed. When, the Presidential train
arrived in Jersey City Mr. Root and Paul
Morton left the train together and came
to Manhattan on thÂ« ferry-boat. Presi
dent Roosevelt was carried on a tug to
the Eong Island Railroad station, waere
another, special train was awaiting him.
Mr. Root was asked on the . ferry-boat
if he was to be. Mr. Hay's successor.
"You must see the President about
that," was his answer. ]
"You have been offered the position?"
was asked. ;
"I will not say a word. Everything
must come from the President," Mr.
Root repeated. > <
ROOT'S GIIEAT SACRIFICE.
Surrender* an Annual Income of a
Quarter of a Million Dollars.
NEW YORK. July 6.â Seldom in the
history of the Government has a man
made the financial sacrifices that Elihu
Root will make, in taking up the port
folio of State laid down by John Hay.
In acceptingthe $8000 salary of a Cab
inet officer he must give up fees esti
mated to havo ; been within the last
year at least $250,000. A Cabinet offi
cer recently said that Root was mak
ing 5275.000 a year. >* ( -. \u25a0
Root's name has appeared in, near
ly every' celebrated legal case In /the
business and political world of ttys city
since he left the War Department. He
appeared' in the Northern Securities
case; he~i3 counsel in. the anti-canal
agitation, which will seek to have Gov
ernor Odell's $100,000,000 canal project
defeated by the courts; he Is the per
sonal counsel for Thomas F. Ryan and
the Metropolitan Street Railway inter
ests; he was retained by Paul Morton
and Ryan in tl.e Equitable Life Assur
ance Society's reorganization scheme;
he was retained by Mayor Weaver of
Philadelphia as personal counsel 'at tho
outset of the war against the Phila
delphia ring; h* has appeared on nu
merous occasions both before the unit
ed States Supreme Court and the Court
of Appeals of this State, his income, it
has been said, being measured only by
his physical ability/
This is what Root has sacrificed for
an $SOOO salary in Washington, to say
nothing of his Presidential candidacy
and BocJal obligations and a method of
living which will probably require an
expenditure of from; $30,000 to $50,000 a
year. ,
ROOT AFTER THE PRESIDENCY.
WASHINGTON, July 6.â The general
impression of politicians in Washington
is that Mr. Root has decided to become
a candidate for the Republican Presi
dential nomination in 1908. \ It is figured
out that he can get the vote . of New
York, and, with the administration be
hind him, it is assumed that he will be
come a very, formidable candidate. THose
familiar with - the j situation - consider
that it is not reasonable to believe that
Mr. Root, after once resigning his offi
cial position and j resuming the practice
of law, would throw it all over in such
a short time and return to Washington
as the head of the State Department
merely to oblige : his friend Mr. Roose
velt and to fulfill jhis; conception of the
duty of an American citlen.
It Is this that has given every Presi
dential aspirant: whose name has been
coupled- even casually with the, magic
figures "190$" the worst sort pf cold
chills. They rcwÂ«'mher the remarkable
eulogy paid to ElihU'Root by President
Roosevelt when ,his Secretary of War
retired to private life less than two
years ago;: they observe themanner In
which the President urged the portfolio
of state upon Mr. Root and they enter
tain; no delusions as to. what the chief
executive's Influence^ will be upon the
delegates to, the 1908 convention.
Mr. Root occupies a unique position in
his relations toward 'politics, business
and statesmanship. 'Although a corpor
ation j lawyer and \u25a0 Intimately l connected
with some of ; the biggest trusts of the
country, no one * here - expresses , a doubt
that his work In any Government;posi
tion would be^ free from bias 'or com
mercialism. : - ' \u25a0- ; - - : \u25a0- - *-

Brave Urged On By Maidens
/Does a Twenty-Hour
Stunt.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JOCO, Mont.; July 6.â Kootic Dorsoe,
one of the best known of the braves of
the allied tribes of the Flathead Indians,
is dead as the result of twenty hours' con
tinuous : dancingv in an effort to win the
prize for the best dancer at a monster
pow wow being held by the five tribes on
the reservation. . #
Dorsoe's tragic end is believed to have
been directly due to the applause of a
number of Indian maidens \u25a0 and some
white persons present at the dance. When
it was'sten that Dorsoe was staggering,
an effort was- made to Induce him to stop,
but the Tndian girls, would not refrain
from singing their praises of Dorsoe, and
the. squaws would not desist from beating
the tom-toms, 'which seemed to awaken
a savage fury In the breast of the dancer.
Twenty hours' of dancing finished
Indian, however, and he feebly made his
way to ihe . river bank, wher he sank in
a heap and, died. Instances have been
known where the" Flatheads have danced
continuously for thirty-six hours. â¢

France Joins America in
Paying Tribute to Memory
of . Admiral Paul Jones
IMPRESSIVE CEKEMONY
Vast -Throng Witnesses De
livery of ;the Body to This
Country^ : -Eepresentatives
PARIS, July 6.â ln the presence of the
highest , dignitaries jof France the diplo
matic representatives of many foreign
governments and civil and naval officials
of the United States, the body of Admi
ral John Paul Jones was formally deliv
ered to the. United States i. Government.
The ceremony was one combining Impres
sive dignity with brilliant' military- and
naval pomp In which the soldiers and
sailors of France and the sailors of
America united in tendering honors to the
Illustrious -founder, of the Amerlcan'navy.
The occasion was unique' and-probably
without parallel, as the funeral was that
of a revolutionary hero who had lain neg
lected in' a foreign grave for more than
one hundred years. Seldom has any
event awakened such widespread interest
in the French capital.
Dense throngs packeu the Champs
Elysees and other principal thoroughfares
to witness the imposing cortege which,
for the elaborateness of its military feat
ure equaled the martial display on the
occasion of the visit of King Alfonso.
The ceremony of delivering the body
was in the â¢ American church on the Av
enue d'Alma at 3:30 o'clock in the after
noon, The inner- portion of this Gothic
edifice was beautifully decorated with
plants and flowers. At the foot of the
chancel rested the casket wrapped in an
American flag and literally buried in
masses of floral emblems.
IMPOSING SCEXE IN CHURCH.
At the right of the altar sat Embas
sador McCormick, Senior Special Em
bassador Porter, Junior Special' Embas
sador Loomis, United States Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge, Rear Admiral Slgs
bee and other officers of the American
squadron. Across the aisle sat Premier
Rouvier with other members of. the
Cabinet, practically the entire diplo
matic corps and officers of the army and
navy. The members of the diplomatic
corps were in full uniform. Scores of
American sailors in the naves on either
side of the altar gave a fitting back
ground to the imposing scene. After
brief religious services General Porter,
wearing evening dress, according to
the French custom, with the red sash of
the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor
across. his breast, advanced alongside
the casket and formally delivered the
body to Mr. Loomis as the representative
of the United -States, and commissioned
Admiral Sigsbee to convey it to the
United States. As the surpliced choir
took up "My Country, Tis of Thee," the
entire assemblage rose and joined in the
strains of the patriotic air. . Eight
brawny sailors from the battleship
Brooklyn then stepped forward and.
raising the casket to tneir shoulders, bore
it slowly, from the church to the waiting
gun carriage. This was draped with
the national colors and was drawn by
six black horses. "The cortege was then
formed and proceeded along the Avenue
d'Alma, the Champs Elysee and across
the Alexander Bridge to the Esplanade
des . Invalides. Republican guards lined
each side of the avenues, holding back
the dense throngs, while" all _ the > % con
verging streets were. closed by barriers
to prevent a crush. â¢ \u0084
SAILOHS CUAHD THE CASKET.
Heading, the procession came a squad
ron of' .culsassiers, * stretching from
curb to curb, with a division of infan
try under General Frery. After them
rumbled the gun caisson, bearing the
nower-laden coffin, with guards of
American sailors on either side. Back
of the cotfln was a long line of distin
guished officials, headed by Ambassa
dor. McCormick, Special Ambassadors
Porter and Loo mis, Premier Rouvier
and his Cabinet, .the foreign Embassa
dors and French generals and admirals,
all .walking, according, to the French
custom. The appearance of the de
tachment of 500 v American sailers and
marines was the signal for enthusiasm
all along the line. Then came another
French division, composed of 'nfantry,
cavalry and artillery.
Arriving at the Esplanade dcs Invalldes
an imposing picture was presented.
The French Government had erected a
large pavilion in which to deposit the
corTin.y The pavilion was richly hung
with crimson velvet, with martial em
blems and battle axes, entwined flags
and v a row . of brass field pieces along
the front. ;i-;;^; i -; ;^ .
Near by rose the gilded dome of the
tomb of Napoleon.
The casket was deposited in the cen
ter of the pavilion while the cortege,
passed/rendering military honors.
Later it was borne to the Invalldes rail
road station and placed in a funeral
car, where, guarded by" French and
American sailors, it started for Cher
bourg.at 10 o'clock to-night.
Mr. .* McCormick gave a. dinner to
night at the embassy in 'honor of the
visiting American officials. The guests
included Premier Rouvier and other
members of the Cabinet.

ASBURY PARK, N. J., July 6,-Presl

will bring to a close the annual conven
tion of the National Educational Asso
ciation. The first address of the Presi
dent will be at the Auditorium and the
second at the beach front. Officers were
elected to-day and directors from the
different States chosen.
There was a slight stir at the meeting
of the National Council over the adoption
of the directors* report relative to re
incorporatlon. The original incorporation
as a national body was for a period of
twenty years, and the association by
limitation will cease to' exist January 26
next. The directors expect special laws
to be passed by Congress and reported
in favor of taking advantage ' of them
and forming a new organization .to suc
ceed and continue the present one. When
the report came up for adoption. Miss
Margaret Haley of Chicago objected to
the approval of the plan. She charged
that the report was a plan to turn over
to a corporation not yet formed the
rights and property of the association.
President Maxwell ruled her out of
order. Miss Haley appealed to the meet
ing from the president's ruling, but failed
to have her appeal sustained. She then
announced she had power of attorney
from a large number of members and
would make a fight in the courts against
the plans. The report was adopted, " but
Miss Haley continued to speak and the
meeting was in an uproar when some one
moved to adjourn. This was carried.
The officers of the association chosen
to-day were:
President, Nathan C. Shaeffer of
Pennsylvania; vice presidents, William
H. Maxwell of New York, Miss N. Crop
sey of Indiana, J. H. Hineman of Arkan

probation. The association declined the
offer on the ground that it was contrary
to Its principles.

Flames That Threaten De

LOSS IS TORY HEAVY
Boy With Cigarette Cause
of Blaze That Destroys
Property Worth $500,000
Spcolal Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
SANTA BARBARA, July 6. â SinoÃ
8:30 o'clock this morning the fiercest
and most terrible of oil fires in- the
history of the State has been raging in
and around Hartnell well No. 2, be
longing to the Union Oil Company, and
which has been flowing 2000"* barrels
a day. All the maoninery, houses, der
ricks , and everything consumable | has
been destroyed. The loss is more than
J500.00U.
The lire was due to the act Of a boy
lighting a cigarette in the tank house
near the well. There was an explosion
and in a moment the place was in
flames. The well has been flowing 2000
barrels of oil a day and the ground' is
saturated with oil for a considerable
distance around the well. In a few
moments the flames had covered the
slight distance between the tankhouae
and the- well and with a roar that could
be heard for a considerable distance
the well was on fire.
As quickly as possible the alarm was
given, though it was scarcely neces
sary, for the flames' which shot into
the Â«ky told their own story.
In a wonderfully brief space of time
every able-bodied man in the field was
on the scene ready to do "what he could
to check or extinguish the flames. But
quick as the men were, the flames were
quicker, and in a few moments they
had licked away everything in the im
mediate vicinity.
The engine-house, tankhouse, der
ricks, machinery and all the buildings
near the well were destroyed in an
amazingly short time. The heat was
terrific and made It impossible. for the
flre fighters to do very effective work
on the well Itself, but they succeeded
in preventing the flames from spread
ing too rapidly after the most heroic
efforts. The flre was fought with
steam, which is recognized as the most
effective method in such cases. It was
with great difficulty that steam pipes
were run into the well.
From tho beginning of the fire the
greatest fear was felt lest the flames
should reach well No. 2, which 13 con
sidered tho greatest gusher of oil in
the world to-day. The distance between
wells No. 1 and No. 2 is about a quar
ter of a mile, but the ground is pretty
well- soaked with oil. the flre fighters
therefore making their stand on this
Intervening space. The fire is now
thoroughly under control. :. r "

signed to work in tlie various parks that
have not been improved, notably the
XTest Oakland Park. Bushrod Park and
Independence Square, together with a
Olimber of smaller plats that have been
tÂ»gleeted for many years because of lack

WOMAN FIGHTS FLAMES
WITH GARDEN HOSE
Mrs. Shaplin Earns
the Title of
Heroine.
Saves the Home of
a Neighbor by
Brave Act.
BERKELEY, July 6,â Hoping to save
the house of her neighbor. Mrs. C. R.
Whitman, from destruction by fire last
night, Mrs. Lutie. Shaplin, whose home
adjoins Mrs. Whitman's, at 1926 Louisa
street, climbed unaided to the roof of
the burning dwelling, directed a
youngster On the ground to throw up
the garden hose to her, and then dis
carded her skirt and bodice to lessen
the danger of being burned herself.
Thus scantily arrayed, the intrepid
woman stood upon the roof of the
burning structure aird, with the hose,
threw a stream of water upon the
names, remaining: until all danger, of
the liouse being destroyed was over. It
was necessary for Mr 3. Shaplin to tear
away the shingles on ttie roof with her
own hands in different spots in cttder
to send the water down to where the
tire had spread in the rafters of the
dwelling. She did not hesitate at any
stage of the proceedings, either In the
daring- climb to the roof by way of a
rear porch, or when her white hands
were blistered and blackened by the
smoking shingles which \u25a0 she pulled
from the roof. The casting off of the
skirt and waist disconcerted her for a
few moment*, as she admitted after
her daring; exploit was concluded, but
when it became apparent that such an
unusual measure was demanded by the
peculiar situation she hesitated no
longer and so the unique performance
was rounded out with true melodra
matic flavor.
The turning building belonged to
Mrs. Whitman, who is an invalid, sub
ject to attacks of heart failure. Mrs.
Whitman aat on tue porch of her home
throughout the r.ffair and did not know
until all was over what had taken
place. It was to save Mrs. Whitman
from the shock which the coming: of
the fire department would nave
brought that Mrs. bnaplin decided to
try to extinguish the blaze herself in
stead of calling in the paid firefight
ers. When Mrs. Whitman learned of
her neighbor's exploit she fainted -and
has since suffered from the shock so
poignantly that a physician's care has
been necessary.
Mrs. Shaplin scouts the idea that she
has done anything ' remarkable when
friends congratulate her upon the dar
ing- and nerve displayed. Except for
a few minor burns and the strain her
arms were put to in climbing to the
roof Mrs. Shaplin was not injured.

was in I-ds Angeles and was receiving
treatment from Dr. T. C. Low, one of
the- physicians of the Bethlehem Free
Dispensary. In corroboration of his
claim he exhibited a card bearing the
name of Dr. T. C. Low. Word has been

Drastic Measures of Wife
Unavailing' and He Is
Committed to the Asylum
OAKLAND, July 6.â Weeping bitterly
over the fact that the husband whom she
admitted she had regularly, beaten was to
be sent to an asylum, Mrs. Julia Wiesen

testimony that resumed in the commit
ment of August A. Wiesenhaven. the hus

her husband, who is a barber, talked
himself insane.
"What did you do whenever your hus
band became violent? asked Judge Og
den. â¢ â¢
"Oh. I just licked him when he got an
gry." replied the wife in a matter-of-fact
tone. "I would knock him down and beat
him with a wet towel till he grew calm.
He used to threaten to commit suicide.
Then 1 would give him a knife or remove
the cover of tho well and tell him to go
ahead. He always cooled down after
that."

perous barber, but that he acquired the
habit of talking so much that his cus
tomers deserted him.

reason had been dethroned and agreed
that he be sent to an asylum. But when

"Walbridge, the agent at Fruitvale. closed
the office at 7 o'clock last evening as
usual, but contrary to his custom, he
left the day's collections In a desk.
The agency does not boast of a safe.
and Walbrldge has usually deposited the
money on hand in the safe of a neighbor
ing store? Last evening he did not so do.
leaving $40 in coin in his desk. This,
morning he found that a window In the
rear of the building had been forced, that
every drawer in his desk had been rifled,
and the money taken.
From the way in which \lhe office was
ransacked it is believed that the thief
knew that the money was there, and
that he made a thorough search for it
until it was found. Sheriff Barnett is
working on the case, but the prospect of
apprehending the culprit is very small.

Several of the Injured Re

ST. PAUL. July 6.â About thirty per
sons were â¢injured, one seriously, in the
wreck of the Great Northern westbound
:'yer at Spring Brook, twenty-one mile.s
< ast cf WlHiston. N. D. Seven cars jvere
lurned by tire which broke out imme
diately after the wreck, presumably
caused by the explosion of a gas tank
under the smoking cer. The mail car
and the special car Joiiet, containing Dr.
Frank Eillings of Chicago and a paiiy
'â¢'f physicians en- route to Portland did
not leave the rails and were unharmeu
by the flames.
The officials of the road here say that
;i was a miracle that numbers were not
k:i!ed, as the train was running at a
high rate of speed when it left th- rails.
According to their report there was no
spreading of the rails, and they are
unable to account for the accident.
As the cars left the track they partly
up-ended, but did not break in two. Most
of those injured suffered from burns, the
flames spreading so rapidly that many
were scorched before they could be re
rcove'd from the wreckage. Dr. Billings
and the physicians in his party- at once
took charge of ' the injured and dressed
their wounds pending the arrival of a
ro'.it-f triiiii from WillUton.
AU cf ihe injured were able to resume
their journey to-day except C. 11. Striek
er, who is reported to be in a serious con
dition. Strieker was in the baggage car
en route from St. Paul to Boise. Idaho,
and was badly cut and bruised. All the
mail and baggage was saved.

STARCH STIFFENS
HER FEATURES
Landlady Will Be
Mute Till Face
Is' Ironed.
MikeMCing Spreads
Pudding Over
Her Head.
Because his landlady, Mrs. J. Keegan,
reproached him for coming to breakfast
wiih a holdover, Michael King distrib
uted the meal on the lady's person and
wrecked the dishes by bringing 'them
into violent contact with her coiffure.
"It's ashamed of yonrself that you
ought to be, Mr. King," said Jirs. Kee
gan indignantly when Mike wobbled
into the dining-room.
Mike retorted with a flapjack that
caught the "lady In the eye, felling her
to the floor. As she arose he emptied
the coffeepot over her head and .the
Java and Mocha blend trickled down her
back. A plate of prunes was next on
the menu. Then Michael sent a bowl of
corn scroll crashing against the wo
man's head. The bowl broke and the
sticky cornstarch entirely concealed the
lady's features.
While she was blinded by the pudding:
Mike began to crack plates over her
iiead. Policeman Nailor arrived Just as
Mike was reaching for the gas stove.
Mrs. Keegan was unable to appear
against him yesterday. The corn starch
has no stiffened her face that her jaws
cannot work. She Is still at the City
and County Hospital, where an effort
will be made to Iron the kinks from her
countenance before long. When she
made an effort to smile yesterday her
face cracked in three places. Mike will
be held on a battery charge on Judge
Mogan's order until the creases are en
tirely removed.
Twelve butchers who were charged
by Food Inspectors with tinting ham
burger steaks were released by Judge
Cabaniss yesterday. It developed that
some of those accused had been embalm
ing hamburger for thirty years.- Igno
rance of the law was the plea.
Judge ..Cabaniss addressed them as
follows:
"The hamburger no doubt looks bet
ter after a coat of paint has been
spread over it. But I believe that most
of the consumers of that dubious viand
prefer their steaks in the wild state.
Anyhow, the law prohibits frescoed
hamburger.
"Personally, I think that a steak is
no more improved by rouge than a wo
man is. I don't care whether you have
been putting oil colors or water colors
on your meat, it's got to stop. When a
man orders hamburger he wants it. and
the order doesn't call for a landscape
or a marine view.
"If you people are not checked imme
diately you will be wanting to sell pho
tographs of lamb chops and sirloins for
the real thing. You are getting toward
the time when a man will walk into a
restaurant and call for a bromide en
largement instead of a porterhouse.
"It's got to stop right here. A butch
er shop is not a studio. Painter, or
butcher, whichever you please, but don't
try to combine the callings."
The twelve promised to heed the ad
monition.
Mrs. Nellie Perry alleges that while
she and two minor children are starv
ing In a Howard-street fiat, -her husband
Is doing the "summer man" stunt at
Guerneville. Judge 'Mogan issued a
warrant for his arrest and he will be
brought before the court to-day.
Mrs. Perry declares " that their
estrangement was due to too much
mother-in-law. Perry's "mother,
says, set her son against, his wife and
she suffered numerous, cruelties at his
hands. She was forced to leave him
about two months ago.
Since that time Perry has not con
tributed a cent to the .'support of his
family. The wtfe declares that from
what she hears her husband is now
spending his time In veranda flirtations,
while his children are on the verge of
starvation.
It broke ex-Policeman Elliott Far
ley's heart when he had to apply to
Judge Mogan for warrants for, the ar
rest of a band of small boys who have
been bombarding his home in the Rich
mond district with rocks. When Far
ley was on ' the force , he made a rec
ord for arrestsand it grieved him when
the boys flung the taunt that he was no
longer authorized to pinch.
The talo is told still. in the depart
raeni of how Farley strained a point
once : to keep uphis record.' It was a
dull' day and Farley searched his beat
in vain for a drunk or any old* kind of
misdemeanor case. . He ' began ; to think
that for once he would' not be able to
contribute to the- tanks.
An idea came to- him and he decided
to act upon It. He. walked up to a
cigar store,- before which stood a long
individual chewing . tobacco.^ In vain
Farley waited for. him to miss the cus
pidor. The accuracy of : the tobacco
chewer.was provoking..
"\u25a0"I'll bet a half you can't, spit to the
edge of the curb,"; said Farley, suddenly.
"You're on,** said the tobacco-chewer,
and easily performed the feat/rJtelffifigS
; "Here's your/ money," ' said Farley.
."Buti ybti: are under, arrest* for; expec
torating in a public place. Come with
me." Wwjfl
: So Farley preserved his \u25a0 record.'

"I tank so too," agreed Oleson.
"I tank I fix it," said Axel.
Oleson tried to dissuade him, but
Axelinsisted.that he must regulate the

rested him just as he was. trying to
figure out how to scale the tower.
"We have a man to wind the clock,
Axel." said Judge Mogan.. "He sharp
ens Twin Peaks, washes the seal
rocks and locks the Golden Gate be
sides. All these things are .taken care
of, Axel. Remember that next time."
And Axel promised never again to
butt into municipal affairs. ..
Jane Frandseh, a remarkably pretty
young woman, and John Hedges, who
looked like the- popular* conception of
a banker, were before Judge I Mogan
accused of running a \u25a0 get-rich-quick"
scheme. Mrs. Marietta Viola declared
that sne gave them $50 in small
amounts, for which she was to receive
treble that amount. Now she. declares
that she is 'unable to secure even the
principal.
The contracts issued by the -"firm"
are so carefully worded that Judge
Mogan was in doubt as to whether the
charge should be grand larceny or con
ducting a. lottery. '
F. Li. Deever and "Judge" Pierce, two
other members of the "firm." cannot bo
located. The cases of the two under
arrest will go over until Monday.

was obtained and the instrument
was Identified as the property of the

he was entitled to keep the microscope.

McQueenie, .' who is \ an ex-convict,

Judge Mogan on a charge of vagrancy.
He promised; to reform and begged to
be given a chance. The Judge let him
out on probation.
"Is this the way you reform?" In
quired his Honor sternly, when Mc-
Queenie was brought before him.
"Well, there ain't no caarge against
me," said McQueenie sulkily.
j.nere will be," said* the Judge. "1
gave you a chance to make a man out
of yourself, but you wouldn't take it.'
Next time you will probably, be sent
to prison for twenty years."
Judge Mogan sentenced McQueenie
to three months in the. County Jail to
hold him for the Mendelsohn affair.
George Graham, accused of misap
propriating small sums' 1 from his em
ployer, pleaded hard' for a chance, to
do better. Because of his youth Judge

F. C. Zimmerman : of â¢ Hackensack, N:
J., and Miss Louise Eimmins of East End
were married, in the home of Rev. Mr
McAnnly, pastor of the Roman avenue
Chrlstiap Church, last evening. : It- had
been arranged : that;; after the ceremony,
there should be a reception in the homo
of the bride's parents and there, were
many carriages to convey the' bridal
party to and from : the clergyman's home.
There was also a brother of .the bride,
who had " brought* a' lion's wagon â¢ from a
circus menagerie, and when the bridal
couple ' was'leaving , the house the bride's
brother arid other guests : bore down
upon them, and, despite their efforts to
escape, thrust them, into the cage and
locked the door.
A brass band had been engaged. .It
headed the - procession, and, followed by
the weddine . guests in carriages, the
march through , the 3 principal streets of
East fend began. The guests. burned red
fire and blew horns, while the angry oc-_
cupants of the cage beat .their hands
against the bars- in futile efforts to
escape. Chairs had been, placed In the
cage for. their comfort and . finding that
all efforts :to escape were useless,, they
sat down and tried their best to: bear it.
The parade lasted an hour and was

SECRETARY TAFT AND THE CHINESE.
Q ECRETARY TAFT, in language that is incapable of miscon
struction, has made plain his attitude toward the classes of
i\(- Chinese who are exempt from the exclusion law. When he
and the President declared that these exempts should have then
rights, and that instead of being treated as criminals they should re
ceive the courtesy due to their character, both were accused of
nullifying the exclusion law. * \u25a0'^. i . ;
KThe as to that law is, that China assented to it, provided
for it in the treaty, and so far hs known that Government has never
sought to evade it. But tiie Chinese are a commercial people." It
is generally admitted thit hi all Asia the best, most enterprising
and most honorable merchants are the Chinese, together with the
Parsecs of Bombay. In Eastern Asia, Java, Ceylon, the Straits
Settlements, the Chinese merchants and bankers are the great com
mercial and financial force. Our Asiatic trade is especially depend
ent upon their good will and participation. If we were the only
source of their supply of merchandise, we might afford to overlook'
their assistance, but we have, in Great Britain and Germany, com
jxetitors who are keen to take advantage of our mistakes. j
. No greater mistake could be made than to class all Chinese as
coolies and deny to them the rights of man. It is this mistake that
Secretary Taft and the President insist shall not be made. They
abate none of the vigilance required for the enforcement of the ex
clusion against the forbidden class, but insist that its rigors shall
not apply to the exempts. What less could they do and do their
duty? Our Government has stood conspicuous among the nations
as the friend of China, in demanding for that empire only what is
just. We have prevented the partition of China. We saved her
SQil from conquest as a possible result of the ( present war. We
refused to take advantage of her forlorn state in the Boxer rebellion,
ajnd did our might to prevent other nations from fattening upon her
weakness.
* As a result of this just and humane policy we had the right
to expect fair equality in the enjoyment of her commercial oppor
tunities. BuUthe Chinese merchants and the enlightened classes
among that people are a courteous folk. They keep their contracts.
They resent injustice. It is useless now to rehearse the instances
in which both justice and courtesy were denied to them by the ad
ministrative officers of this Government through the mistake of
classing them all as coolies. If China, or any other Government,
acted upon the theory that all Americans are of the class that are
jammed and congested upon the east side of New York City, and if
"our merchants, students and travelers upon going abroad were re
fused credit to their passports, and were mewed in such places as
the vile detention shed in this city, we would realize the injustice
and would forcibly resent it.
As for the coolie question, we have to learn that there are
coolies outside of Asia, and we will dignify our policy by equality of
treatment, accorded impartially to the people of all nations. We
are big enough and just enough to do this. When we do it, the
last impediment to our large participation in the trade of China will
be removed. , <
RUSSIAN EFFORTS FOR FREEDOM.
THE Russian, Vladimir G. Simkhovitch, who is a lecturer on
the history of his country in Columbia University, gives us in
a recent review an account of that secret force, terrorism,
which shows what a fluctuating and unknown quantity it is in the
combination of influences that will determine Russia's future. Ter
rorism is such a widely different proposition in Russia from what
it would be in our country that a knowledge of Russian conditions
is necessary before we can understand it at all. The difference is
almost as great as that between- murder and homicide done in self
defense. However much we may believe the methods of terrorism
to be a mistake even in .Russia, we must admit that some of the ter
rorists act under the sway of noble impulses and are framed of the
stuff of which martyrs are made.
It is plain that this Russian savant who holds a responsible
place in one of our great universities does not look upon the higher
types of the terrorists of his country with any such horror as is in
our feelings toward an assassin. Indeed, the giib Vera Zassulitch,
who killed General Trepoff, is almost glorified by the courageous
act she did for love of country and in proud disdain of consequence.
The jury who acquitted her are believed to have given the verdict
of intellectual and patriotic Russia. Russian society, Russian public
opinion, is pronounced morally responsible for the deeds of those
terrorists who have taken justice in their own hands. Turgenieff, a
great man and one of the foremost of novelists, wrote a prose- poem
about the self-abnegation of such an act. The girl is at the thres
hold of her deed. A voice, heard only by her, reasons with herâ
asking if she knows what awaits. "Cold, hunger, hatred, derision,
contempt, insults, prison, suffering, even death?" The. girl replies,
"I know it." The voice said, "Enter, then," and she crossed the
threshold.
The power of the terrorists wax.es and wanes with the amount
of justification they have for their acts. The society numbers
about half a million, but there are vast multitudes more who sym
pathize with them when they do away with such a man as Trepoff,
but who condemn them when they make such a mistake as . was
the killing of the Emperor Alexander 11. That deed of Czar killing
cost them a long setback from the power of influencing Russian
thought. At the present time their prestige is leviving Their in
genious argument of the right of tempering despotism by assassina
tion is gaining ground. "After the St. Petersburg massacre of the
22d of January thousands of the stanchest and most cool r headed
â¢law and order men became terrorists."
JAPANESE PROSPERITY.
JAPAN'S "Financial and Economic Annual" for 1905, issued by
the Department of Finance, makes not only a showing of rapid
increase in prosperity, but the remarkable, one that the. war
has been a stimulus rather than a hindrance to economic improve
ment. On the subject of the budget for' the extraordinary expenses
of the war the report says: "We have in fact evidence from every
direction that the heavy burden imposed by war has not in the least
degree impaired the economic development of the nation." East
year the foreign trade was more prosperous than ever. Deposits
made in banks and postofficc savings banks are the biggest ever at
tained. Economically the nation has not suffered from those evil
effects which usually appear in time of war. â ;i
â¢ In arranging for the burdens of war the Government has levied
special taxes with the result that local taxes have been actually, re
duced. The nation is paying taxes more promptly, than in time of
peace, -and the people seem to have plenty of capital at their dis
posal, as is evidenced by the increased bank deposits, of savings. The
municipal authorities have economized in local expenditure by post
j>o.iing the comparatively less important of the various public un
dertakings. One of the striking indications of Japanese prosperity
is that the exports of raw materials have fallen off to be replaced
by much larger exports of manufactured /articles,: thus' '-.showing 'ttie
development of her industries. _ Since Japan began" to be victorious
in her struggle with Russia her trade with Korea and China has
jumped to a much greater volume. The whole report has the
strength of assured confidence, and certainly those who have loaned
money to Japan, of whom many are' Americans, need not be alarmed
about their investment.
Justice Holmes, of the Supreme Court, says that dealing in futures is
the "self-adjustment of society to the probable." Ever hear gambling, called
Â«nr'i a nice name before?â Kansas City JournaL

MARS WILL NOT COMMUNICATE.
THE ether-ship that had made the
Journey to and from the earth drew
nearer and nearer . to Mars and at
last it alighted. Thereupon the Martians
gathered about It, took the occupant from
his ship and removed the patented air
supplier from his" nose. For a moment
or two he stood totteringly upon his feet
before he l6*oked about him. Then the
Oldest Martian Settler addressed him:
"Well, can we establish communication
with the earth?" the settler asked.
"Sure! But you can bet your sweet
life we don't want to."
"Why not?"
"Just wait till I get a little unmanu
factured air and I'll tell you all about it."
The distinguished traveler took several
gulps of Martian atmosphere, and then
continued:
"When I arrived in the great earth
city of Boschisanyorkadelphia an elec
tion was not far distant. Soon I discov
ered that certain men called 'de gang'
ran to and : fro, yelling, 'Nominate and
elect me! Nominate and elect me!" and
many of these men already were in.ofv
flee, having yelled theretofore, as "I
learned. There were certain men whose
self-respect did not permit them to "ask
for an office the occupant of which
should be chosen by the /people, and not
by himself, but the yellers almost in
variably secured the nomination. 'It Is
a matter of taste,' I said to myself:
'perhaps we Martians lay too much stress
on modesty and decency, and not enough
on nerve and gall.' \u25a0
"So I let that pass.
"Then I read the newspapers, and 1
found that they openly charged the of
fice-holders, many of whom were re
nomlnated, with rascality and. knavery.
'Wait,' said I to myself, 'until the office
holders read these articles. Then won't
libel suits dim the horizon!' But they
didn'tâ not a dim. Every once in a while
an office-holder, was- arrested for cor
ruption, and if he was acquitted his kind
held a praise and prayer meeting, and if
he was convicted tears bedimmed their
eyes. 'It's mighty queer,' said I to my
self. , ,
"Still, I let it pass.
"Still the yell of 'fraud and corruption!'
went up, still damning circumstances
were unexplained, still the silence of the
officials gave affirmation to every charge
against them, and every once in a while
one of them .was convicted amidst the
moans of his fellows.
"But I let it pass.
"'For.' said I to myself, - 'the people
are only waiting till election day. Then
the rascals will hear something drop, and
they will be it/ Well, election day came
around, andâ say, what do you fellows
think the people down there did?" \u0084,
"First tarred and feathered < 'de gang'
and then kicked them out of office,"
several Martians suggested.
"That's where you are mistaken; they
elected the most of them again. -, .'
A. universal groan went up.
"And that's why I say that we don't
want to open communication c with the
earth. The people down there . probably
would corrupt our system of municipal'
government." .
"But," interposed a saintly-looking
Martian, \"we might teach them how to
govern themselves better and. more de
cently."
"Say!" the traveler remarked, "did
you ever meet 'de gang?' "
"Wellâ noâ of ' course not."
"Well then, don't say a word. I have."

Assouan
Dam in
Danger
SOME engineers in New York who
have watched with, interest , ; the
enormous project of damming, the
mighty Nile: at Assouan, Egypt, are re
ceiving reports, from time to time
which; convince them that the danger
of the destruction of the dam, is '\u25a0 in'-fj
creasing rather than diminishing, as
the British engineers would; have -the
"world believe. ' When it, was discovered
that the dam -was not high enough to
furnish the water necessary. for irrigat
ing the entire 'area .which was 'to have
been iraade fertile -by It the proposal
was made that the dam be raised. This
has- been vetoed by the engineers and
they are now devoting. their energies
to protectlng.the bed of the river with
a cement \u25a0floor to prevent the water
from eating under and toppling over
the great pile of masonry which con
fines . the river, says the New York
Tribune. : > .
All prospect of raising the dam has
been abandoned for at least two years,
according to a statement made by Sir
Benjamin- Baker,; consulting engineer,
who recently returned to London from
an inspection of the dam. It will take
this long to complete the pavement
â¢which is being thrown across the river
to : protect the dam. Sir ; Benjamin de
clares that this delay" willbe good for
Egypt, as it will stop speculating in
land. ~ â¢ . \u0084 .
BREAK WOULD BE DISASTROUS.
Perhaps no one" in New York is more
familiar with Egyptian irrigation pro
jects, including the Assouan dam, than
F. Cope Whitehouse, who lives at the
Park Avenue Hotel when not in New
port. He has studied the Egyptian
situation for the last ten years and has
made discoveries by personal explora-r
tion- that have attracted the- attention
of the British Department of Public
Works. ,\u25a0\u25a0' , ;.; ".. \\Â£}- \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 â¢ . \u25a0\u25a0.\u25a0
, "While there is no Immediate danger
of a break In the dam at Assouan, the
situation is rapidly becoming more
grave," said Mr. Whitehouse to a
Tribune reporter a few days ago. "Brls
lsh engineering authorities are sending
out comforting bulletins to the effect
that nothing has occurred at Assouan
which has not been expected. Yet the
very facts that they are taking most
expensive steps to protect the dam and
have given, up the project of raising it
in order to increase the amount of
storage and enable the dam to Irrigate
the district which; the specifications
promised are sufficient cause for alarm.
One must consider that v the breaking
away of the dam would be an 'â¢ Inter
national calamity such as modern dis
tory does not record, and would cause
the* sweeping of every thing In the Nile
Valley to Cairo and the sea.
INFLATED PRICES FOR LAND.
"The Nile rise's about- the first week
in July, after the monsoon occurs in
India and when. the rain is falling over
the whole . of Central ' Africa. . A dam
could not be built which could hold
back this flood, which amounts to
1,000,000,000 tons a day. At this period
at Assouan the sluices in the dam are
opened and the water rushes through
them at a rate of forty miles an hour.
There are 140 of ..t hese sluices, seven
feet wide and twenty-two feet high, in
the dam. They are at different levels,
and by November, when the Nile has
fallen sufficiently, some jof the â¢ lower
ones are shut off and the water grad
ually rises behind the dam and backs
off. The distance covered by the back
water is 150 miles, or, say, the distance
from New " York to Albany. r Its great
est depth is eighty feet â¢ Â£ *
"About this time last year it became
known in Egypt that the project of
raising the dam 19 feet 6 inches, as ap
proved by Sir Benjamin Baker and rec
ommended by Sir W. Garstin, adviser to
the Public Works .Ministry, could not
be carried out This, however, was not
announced until March of this year.
So far the public seems scarcely -to
realize the situation with which Egypt
Is now confronted. There Is a vast
acreage of land awaiting reclamation
which was purchased on the strength
of promises made by British engineers
at : highly Inflated prices.
WATER'S TERRIFIC FORCE.
"It appears that the dam Is being
gradually weakened by the force of
the. water passing through the sluices,
and, according to the new theory of the
stress to which masonry dams \u25a0 are
subjected, advanced by Professor. Karl
Pearson, it Is liable 'to tilt over and a
vertical crack develop, g Then, again,
the bed of the Nile Is being eroded by
the sluices, great holes j being torn by
the force of the water. If this mis
chief be left unchecked the holes will
extend .to the base of the dam: itself
and may eventually undermine the
structure. ' for this ' reason \u25a0 a : masonry
floor is being laid. This is a most dif
ficult operation owing to -the power of
the water. In- one instance where a
block was not properly laid the water
found its way in and moveda piece of
masonry, weighing seventy-five tons. 'lt
even carried this enormous : weight a
considerable distance." \u25a0
Mr. Whitehouse is still at work on
his project to fill the . depression which
he discovered in the ; desert y seventy
miles south of Cairo, and make a, lake
of 250,000 square miles. \u25a0; This lake would
furnish an escape for the I dangerous 10
per : cent*, of ; the ; Nile ';. flood, ; which from
time to time j has caused .appalling j losses
of life and property, and would serve to
Irrigate, an. enormous -district. \u25a0â¢!\u25a0'\u25a0â¢

of his astuteness in detecting any
kind :of a scheme that seemed in
any way . connected with a confidence
game. It is, 1 consequently, with all the
more distaste that he Is forced to listen
to the jokes that his friends are now

â¢A few days ago a well-dressed stranger
rushed into: his office .and sank into a
ehairl "Doctor,",, he 'gasped. "I'm afraidâ
,I;was struckâ l don't know but what- â "
\u25a0 "What's the trouble ?"Jasked thephysi
cian, as the man's voice trailed off into
silence. The , stranger put his * hands to
his side. He ; made several ineffectual ef
torts to -speak before he said: "An auto
mobile struck \ me." -
"Possible internal injuries," thought the
doctor. . - > . . * '
He set, about making an examination of
the patient at once. : It. was hurried, but
it was thorough. He could discover posi
tively no evidence of any Injury done the
man, but he thought It very possible that
some i very serious complication might
arise from the pains of which his patient
complained. -'
"It might be the very -best course for
you to go to one ; of the hospitals," he
told the stranger. The ether dissented.
"1 have an important business deal on in
Los Angeles.'Vhe said; "one that I must
go there to j attend to at once. . As soon as
I come back : I shall come to you again
and then, if you -think it necessary, I
shall go in." ; \
:',The?. doctor .fthdught that this might be
unwise:.' "lf is difficult to tell just how
you may be hurt," he demurred, "but, as
well as I can judge now, you are all right,
except for the nervousness."
"I am so relieved," said the stranger,
wringing the hand of the physician grate
fully. ; "Now, doctor, ; what is your
charge?" Dr. Laner : stated that it was
$3 for the examination^ \u25a0
"All right," sir," said the patient,
promptly. He put his hand down in the
pockets and withdrew, a handful of small
change. , A. ss gold piece glittered in the.
collection. He looked .at it carefully. "I.
don't like to part with that," he said, re
gretfully. "It's my luck. Let's see "if I
haven't something else with me."

Atmosphere of Failure.
WHAT would you think of a young man, ambitious to become a
lawyer, who should surround himself with a medical atmosphere
j and spend his time reading medical books? asks O. S. Marden, in Â»
Success. Do' you think tie. would ever become a great lawyer by following
such a course? No, he must put himself into a law atmosphere, where he
can absorb it and be steeped in It. until he is attuned to the legal note.
He must be grafted into the legal tree so that he can feel its sap circulat
ing through him. \u25a0\u25a0 ;
How long would It take a young man to become successful who puts
himself into an atmosphere of failure and remains in it until he is soaked
to saturation with the idea? How long would It take a man who de
preciates himself, talks of failure, thinks of failure/ walks like a failure
and dresses like a failure â who is always complaining of the insurmount
able difficulties In his way. and whose every step is on the road to failure â
how long would it take him to arrive at the success goal? Would any one
believe in himSor expect him to win?*
The majority of failures began to deteriorate by doubting or depreciat
ing themselves, or by losing confidence in their own ability. The moment
you harbor doubt and begin to lose faith in yourself, you capitulate to
the enemy. Every time you acknowledge weakness, inefficiency^or lack of
ability you weaken your self-confidence, and that is to undermine the very
foundation of all achievement. . . -'
So long as you carry around a failure atmosphere and radiate doubt
and discouragement, you will be a failure. Turn about face, cut off all
the currents of failure thoughts, of discouraged thoughts. Boldly face your
goal with a stout heart and a determined endeavor, and you will find things
will change for you; but you must see a new world before you can live In
It. It Is to what you see, to what you believe, to what'you struggle Incest
santly to attain, that you will approximate.
Questions Hard to Answer.
CAN you understand â
Why a man who has to pay his wife's dressmaking and cleaning bills
will sit in a street car wtih one foot across his knee, so that every
woman who passes him must brush her frock against the dirty sole of his
shoe? ! .
Why any woman who has ever watched a newsboy or an Italian pea
nut vendor make change will slip a dime or a nickel into her mouth while
she is using both hands to investigate her purse or bag?
Why a man who, in bearing and dress, is to all intents a gentleman,
can sit m a crowded street car with a half cold or smoldering cigar in his
hand until the odor from that stub will sicken all the women and most of
the men in his vicinity?
. Why a pretty girl who talks in^a loud voice in public places imagines
that all men who are watching her N furtlvely or openly are lost in admira
tion?
, Why a man In a crowded street car would rather open and shut the front
door for twenty women than move down two feet and hang on a strap?
Why a woman will walk seven blocks to save two cents a yard on a piece
of silk and then, fall .to observe that the butcher is. holding out the bones
and trimmings of her. Sunday roast, and the iceman is occasionally adding
an extra five cents to his bill?/ . : , â¢\u25a0
Why a man will dodge trolleys, drays and policemen In a mad rush to
reach his office and then line up with messenger boys/ tourists and other
men, presumably as busy as himself, to watch a fire company turn a stream
of water on a two-penny blaze?
. Why a woman will rush recklessly in, front of a moving trolley car to
greet a friend, and then threaten to sÂ»ue the motor company because Its man
almost ran her down? . . .
.Why the clerk of whom you earnestly desire* to buy. goods would rather
hear about "Mame's new mohair skirt" than display her employer's stock?

Eminent medical men from all over

Richmond, Va., president of the so

Among- the able and learned papers
read was one by Dr. Thomas W. Hunt
::ig-ton of San Francisco, entitled "A
Review of the End Results in Cases of
rxophthalmic Goitre Treated Sur
pically." In remarks following 1 it. Dr.
Huntingdon said:

Dr. W. H. Carmalt, professor of sur
grcry at Yale University, eeuaking on
Dr. J. E. Moore's paper on "Spina-
Birtda," held that they had not been
very successful in operations on that
condition.
STATISTICS DOUBTFUL.
Dr. Dudley P. Allen, secretary of the
association, read the paper of Dr. Her
bert L. Burrell of Boston on "A Sum
mary of All the Cases of Fracture of
the Spine (244) Which Were Treated at
the Boston City Hospital From 1864 to
1305."
Dr. Burrell stated that he recognized
that statistics may be very deceptive
and that they may be made to prove al
most anything, yet certain generaliza
tions may be drawn from them.
While the figures speak for them
selves, it must be remembered that the
observations and the records were made
by a constantly changing staff of sur
geons.
Dr. Burrell purposely refrained from
drawing deductions from these figures,
for ha found that Dr. Crandon, who had
carefully gone over the records, ar
rived at one conclusion, while he, Bur
rell. arrived at onother.
If two individuals could reach differ
ent conclusions from an analysis of the
fane cases, ot showed clearly the fal
lacy of attempting to generalize from
cases that have been observed and re
corded by many different surgeons.
Dr. Burrell w<?nt on to state that In
juries of the spinal column that were

FILES PETITION
IN BANKRUPTCY
TOPEKA. Kan., July 6.â c/j. Devlin
to-night filed in the United States Dis
trict Court a voluntary petition in bank
ruptcy. This action was decided upon
at a lengthy conference this afternoon be
tween Devlin and his attorneys.
Devlin was in favor of the move be
cause it would ccntrallxe all his prop-
ertles and make easier the settlement
with his creditors, the principal one in
which la the First National Bank. Judge
Pollock granted the petition and an
nounced he would appoint a receiver for
the property to-morrow.
The statement of Devlin's liabilities is
given as follows:
To the First National Bank of Topeka.
Kan*., about $1,200,000: to the Central Na
tional Bank of Topeka. about $300,000; to
the American National Bank of Kansas City
Mo., about $263,000; to the National Bank of
Commerce of Kansas City, about $200,000- to
the Corn Exchange Bank of Chicago about
$160,000; to the Continental National Bank of
Chicago, about $150,000; to the Central Trust
Company of Chicago, about $70,000; to the
Bank of Topeka Topeka Kans. about $30,000
to the Union National Bank of Kansas City
Mo., about $9000; to Hirsch. St. Louis Mo.!
about $VM); to the Merchants' National' Bank
of Topeka, Kans., about (5000; to Long Bros
Kansas City, Mo., about 14000; to the South
western Fuel Company of Topeka. ' Kane.
$138,000: to the Fourth National Bank of St
Louis. Mo., about $200,000. Â»
To the First National Bank of Toluca,
111., the Spring Valley National Bank of
Spring Valley. 111., and two national
banks In the city of New York, the names
of which the petitioners do not know, the
amounts are not givm.
RECEIVER IS XECESSARY.
The petition then names the various
properties owned by Devlin and saya that
the property Is in such shape that it must
be taken immediate charge of by the
court.
T. J. Bradley, receiver of the failed na
tional bank, said to-day that the money
accepted for deposit within two or three
days before the institution closed would
become part of the regular deposits and
could not be considered as preferred. This
money was. It was stated at the time of
the failure, set aside by the bank officials
to avoid criminal proceedings against
them for accepting deposits when the
bank was in a failing condition. If this
money finally is made part of the regular
deposits it is argued that the officials will
be subject to prosecution.
There was a better feeling about the
State House to-day following the discov
ery that the State held the bond of a
surety company for $250,000 to insure it
against loss of money in deposit in the
bank in process of collection. This means
that at least .one-half of the State's
money in the bank is safe. Gov
trnor Hoch was Quoted to-day as saying
that within two weeks he " would require
State Treasurer Kelly to procure a .new
bond 'in place of that signed by C J. Dev
lin.
SAA'TA FE WILL AID' HIM.
The . Santa Fe Railroad is preparing to
extend aid to the Devlin companies until
such a time as a final settlement can be
made. This step is being considered by
the company as the best method of pro
tecting itself from loss. All the. Santa Fe
mines in Kansas are being operated 'by
\ Devlin, and It Is necessary to keep the
mines running in order that the road may
be supplied with coal.
KANSAS CITY, July S.
Gleed returned to-day from Topeka,
where he had been investigating the con
dition of the estate of C. J. Devlin. He
said that as yet no definite policy had
been decided upon regarding the opera
tion of the Devlin properties. "Every
thing that Is profitable," said Gleed, '"will
be kept in operation; anything -that is
not returning money will be shut down.
The whole question will be settled satis
factorily, I think, to-morrow." ...
Gleed said that he had ascertained there
was no foundation ' for the report that
Devlin owed $700,000 In Baltimore. There
is, It Is stated to-day, a probability that

TELEGRAPH COMPANY |i

City Club of New York Demand* Resig
nation of Western Union
Official*.
NEW YORK, July 6.â The Western
Union Teilegraph Company has again
been caught redhandod in selling in
formation to the poolrooms. It has
been caught by the same agency, the
City Club, which one year ago last May,
through the personal efforts of Captain
F. Norton Goddard, arranged with the
officials and sÂ«cured from them a com
plete fitting up of a poolroom on Madi
son avenue. '
This new trap to catch the Western
Union was set before the death of Cap
tain Gpddard, and, following out God
dard's agreement with - Jacob H. Schiff,
a formal demand has been made by
Rev. Thomas R. Slloer, for the Immedi
ate resignation, of President and Gen
eral Manager Robert C. Clowry, David
B. Mitchell, manager of the special wire
bureau, and Superintendent W. J. Daly.
The result of the former exposure
was the complete abolition of the pool

resulting in the loss of 15.000,000 a
year to the Western Union Telegraph

WALL STKEET MARVELS
Counsel for Many Trusts
Accepts Judicial Appoint
ment in New Jersey
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 6â James B. Dili;
one of the foremost; corporation lawyers
of America, was appointed to-day by
Governor Stokes of New Jersey Judge of
the Court of Errors and Appeals of that
State, the home of the trusts. He sur
renders an income of $300,000 a year from
his law. practice to, become a Judge with
a salary of $3000 a year.' â¢ His last private
act was to refuse a retainer of $25,000 of
fered by an insurance financier. ;!' '
No political event of recent times has
occasioned so much comment in jWall
street as this appointment and its ac
ceptance. Although maintaining his resi
dence in New Jersey, Dul has been con
sidered a New York lawyer.: His office
at No. 27 Pine street is In. the heart of
the financial region, close by the Stock
Exchange. Many of the great trusts have
been his clients; indeed, he was the legal
father of a series of them and >he has
been sought In consultation- in nearly
every important financial litigation. Capi
talists, brokers, promoters ; and his
brother "corporation lawyers^ when the
news reached- them, ejaculated this one
word: "Why '!" â¢
According to a close friend of Dill, the
step from the riches of a corporation law
yer to the comparative dignified, poverty
of the bench was taken after mature
thought, in which the rcent scandals of
high finance and the demands made upon
lawyers to save .their capitalistic clients
Trom law had a/ weighty influence upon
his decision. The man who made trusts
in their legal form is now to be judge of
their crimes and misdemeanors. ,
Having accepted the appointment to the
bench. Dill's lips are sealed concerning
his intentions, but an associate, speaking
for him, said to-day:
Mr. Dill goes on Court of Errors and Appeals
not as a frlÂ«n<i ot the corporations, but as a
tttero and fearless Judge. As author of the
corporation law- of -New Jersey he knows
every phase of the trust question. As counsel
during recent years for many vast corpora
tions, he is acquainted with their legal possi
bilities and their limitations. The matter of
Income does not enter into the case. There is
deeper and more serious question than money
or position involved. -Dill- reels that the time
has come when a corporation lawyer must de
cide upon which side lie will ally himself;
whether on the Bide of honesty, of law and of
Justice or with financial schemers who grow
more defiant of the law each year and make
demands upon their lawyers for services' that
conflict with conscientious scruples.
SECRETARY GIVES
EMPLOYERS' SIDE
Claims Printers Misrepre
sented Facts Regarding
Refusal to Agree.
Members of the. San Francisco Typoth
etae claim that their side of the nine
hour question, which is the cause of con
tention between them and Typographical
Union No. 21 and Pressmen's Union No.
24, has not been fairly presented to the
public. ., Secretary John Macintyre of the
Typothetae says that the situation exist
ing Is not a lockout, but a condition
brought on by the printers refusing to
stand by the laws under which the Inter
national Printing Pressmen and Assist
ants' r Union agree to be governed. He
quotes the "Book of Laws" to say that
all questions of difficult settlement are
to be left to the United Typothetae and
International Printing Pressmen's Union
acting in conjunction.
The shops in the city are suffering from
the refusal of the men to agree to the
nine-hour law on; the expiration of the
contract, dated March . 25, 1903, which
called for a trial of the eight-hour sys
tem. - They declare it destroys all profit,
and assert that so long as the union men
persist in refusing to comply with their
rules employes will be brought from the
East. .'. . "1 ; \u25a0\\u25a0\u25a0 â¢ '.
The typographical men call the notice of
a renewal \of the ' original schedule a
strike, but the Typothetao claims that it
is -not. for any. of their former employes
may return to work when they agree to
the new working time.
Secretary , Macintyre says that the
eight-hour law is not mentioned in the
"Book of Laws," and is, therefore,, un
constitutional. Salaries are | not ' to be
kept at the same standard, according to
Macintyre, if the old schedule is adopted,
unites the union men come to agreement
on the issue. â¢\u25a0' He. says that the employ
ers are willing to pay the men- for, the
extra time," If such a demand is ' made,
and "will do all possible for an.amicable
settlement.

Searching for Indian Tribe
Beyond Large Lake Not
Yet Eeached by Whites
Spec'al Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
NORTH ADAMS, Mass., July 6. â Un
expectedly two expeditions into the
Labrador wilds, led respectively by
Mrs. L'eonldas Hubbard Jr., widow of
the ill-fated explorer, who met J his
death there last year, and by A. Dillon
Wallace, the New York lawyer, who
nearly lost. his. life, in his attempt to
save his companion, Hubbard, have met
and for a distance of several hundred
miles traveled in company. Mrs. Hub
bard has (sent this information to her
friend and counselor/Rev. James Saw
yer of Williamstown.
Mrs. Hubbard prepared her expedi
tion with great secrecy and Wallace
did not know of her Intention to make
the â¢ hazardous' trip until his plans,
which were openly announced, > had
been well completed. The two parties
started about the same time, but by
different routes, finally, meeting at
Rlgolet, where the Wallace party
boarded the boat upon which was the
Hubbard party and remained on board
until Gillieport, which is near North
west River,' was reached.
Georgre Elson, an Indian guide, who
was with Hubbard and Wallace last
year, Is with the party of Mrs. Hub
bard, although Wallace, without the
knowledge *of Mrs. Hubbard's inten
tions, had tried to, engage him to guide
his party into the wilds. Elson told
him that he did not intend to guide a
party this year, and great was Wal
lace's surprise to find him with Mrs.
Hubbard, who had obtained his ser
vices some months ago.
At Gillieport the Wallace party left
for. Northwest River to prepare for its
long journey inland and Mrs. Hubbard
remnined there, outfitting and making
final preparations. It is not probable,
although possible, that the two parties
will take the same route"lnto the in
terior in their search for the tribe of
Nauscapee Indians, which is supposed to
live beyond L*ike Michikamsau, the big
interior lake, which was seen but not
reached by the Hubbard expedition.

OMAHA, July 6.â Right under the noses
of the police, within three short blocks
of detective headauarters, "Pat" Crowe,
notorious as the kidnapper of "Eddie"
Cudahy, being in .urgent need of ready

Crowe had only one assistant, so his
share of the booty will be large enough
to keep him in money for some little

* When the Chief of Police heard of the
robbery he sent for his fellow chief in

the robbery was the work of "Pat"

DUNNITE SHELL
WREAKS HAVOC
World's Most Powerful Ex
plosive Crumples the Heav
iest of Battleship Armor
NEED NOT HIT TAEGET
Capable of Sinking Vessel,
Even Though It Fall
Far* Short of Its Mark
Special â¢ Dispatch .to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK. July 6.â That- a 12-inch
shell loaded with only a small charge of
dunnite, the world's most effective ex
plosive, will crumple the inside of the
heaviest armor-clad vessel, though the
shell fall short of Its mark by twenty
feet, has just been demonstrated at the
beginning of a series of tests at . the
Government proving grounds at Sandy
Hook. The first test was solely for the
purpose of determining a safe distance
at which the huge target, built to repre
sent a section of an armored side of a
modern battleship, could be moored from
the shore and the observers assured of
freedom from harm from the fragments
of the exploding shells.
For some time the experts of the ord
nance bureau of the army have known
of the destructive effect of the explosive
substance, which, named after its in
ventor, Major Dunn, is a closely guarded
Government secret. Foreign nations have
sought in vain to learn it 9 composition.
Meantime the manufacture of armor
piercing shells filled with the explosive
has gone on until now the arsenals of
the United States are filled with them
and almost all the ships of the navy and
the sea coast fortifications have a battle
ship supply on hand, ready for an
emergency.
What the Government experts did not
know, however, was the probable effect
If a shell shoilld fall short of Its mark.
The shot fired within the last few days
has gone far- beyond expectations of the
experimenters.
"to thoso who were fortunate enough
to witness the recent tilal the affair was
Intensely spectacular. A floating mass of
woodwork, in dimensions the size of a
battleship at its water line, was moored
off shore. Then, delicately, the 10,000
pound projectile, with a scant charge of
twenty pounds of dunnite, was submerged
four feet in the water and approximately
fifty feet from the floating structure.
Then all scattered to a place of safety;
an electric button was pressed; those on
shore felt the , ground . tremble, while a
column of water shot into the air 250
feet. When the target was again brought
to the shore the effect of the explosion
was plainly manifest and it was of such
a nature that the deductions were readily
drawn.

LONDON, July 6.â Miss May Sutton of

ladles' .tennis honor , of all-England, de
feating by : consistent work throughout
all .the aspirants for the championship
nowheltfiby Miss D. K. Douglas, whom
she meets on Saturday. :A ' battle royal
Is expected, as 'the English woman is a
fast player and a good general, while
Miss" Sutton throughout the tournament
exhihlted form never equaled at "Wim
bledon.
That Miss Sutton's triumph is most
popular was shown when she defeated
In two straight sets Miss C. Wilson, who
played beautiful tennis and only suc
cumbed after a hard fight. The spectators
rose In a body and cheered the young
American again and again. \u0084;'..
To-day's match proved to be the hard
est Miss Sutton had yet struck. There
were four deuce games In both sets. The
American was tired at the commence
ment of the second set and the ' Kentish
champion seemed to be winning when
Miss Sutton rallied and ultimately won.
She played a magnificent back line
game and her drives kept her opponent
from getting near the net. .Miss Sut
ton's victory was very popular. An enor
mous gallery ' witnessed , the motch and
roundly cheered the young American win
ner.
In the ladles . open doubles Misses

PERILS TO PASSEXGEHS y
OX FOUII TRACK RAILWAYS
Lobs Freight Trains* Buckle and Cars
Are Crowded Over on Other
Tracks.
â¢ We wish to draw attention to the fact
that this catastrophe at Harrlsburg
shows, in a most dramatic way, what
a great peril the passenger trains on
four-track railroads are exposed to in
having to sweep past the wholo length
of the many forty and fifty car freight
trains, which they meet so frequently
in traveling through . busy manufac
turing- districts such as those traversed
by the Pennsylvania Railroad. It is a
fact well . understood by railroad men
that the enormous length to which
freight trains have grown of late years
exposes them to exactly the kind of
accident which caused the recent dis
aster, namely, the crumpling up of the
train" when the brakes are suddenly ap
pliedif the action of the brakes is not
uniform throughout the whole length
of the train. If a freight train of forty
\u25a0Or fifty cars and weighing over 2000
tons is traveling say, twenty miles an
hour, and the air brakes are applied
and act simultaneously and with equal
efficiency on every car, the whole train
would be brought to rest without any
danger of crushing or displacing the
cars. But if the action of the brakes
should be faulty, and the brakes should
be set hard on say only the first half
or third of the train, the enormous
momentum \ of the . last half or two
thirds, expending Itself on the portion
upon which the brakes are In full ao
tion, brings a crushing strain which
the cars are unable to withstand, and
they are forced into one another or
twisted from the track and> thrown
sidewise onto the adjoining tracks. It
Is well known among railroad men that
accidents of this kind are extremely
frequent and that they constitute a
standing menace to fast trains on the
adjoining passenger tracks â a menace
that, cannot be safeguarded by signals,
not, at least, if the wreck should take
place when the express is within a
short distance of or passing the freight
train. This is one of the perils to
which -the recent rapid , growth of
freight traffic and the endeavor to
cheapen its transportation by using
enormous engines and trains of exag
gerated length have brought ns. The
only safeguard against it is the exer
cise of eternal vigilance on the part
of the engineers of passenger trains,
and the most careful use of the air
brakes on the part of the engineers of,
long and heavy freight trains.âScien

An English gentleman of limited means
had married recently into a very prolific
family. There was prospect of an addi

"Twins," reflected the gentleman." "are

Lead jfclie Crack Britishers
by Five Points at the
End of First Pay's Shoot
CONTEST A VERY CLOSE
Captain McLean Confident
His Men Will Carry Off
Honors at Long Ranges
RISLEY, England, July 6.â The Ameri
can team of riflemen was five points to
the good after a remarkably close shoot at
the 500 and 600 yard ranges on the first
day of the contest for the Sir Howard
Vincent shield against ths Queen's West
minster Volunteers. This lead was se
cured at the 500 yard ranges, the score at
600 yards being even at 369.
Captain Robert McLean said to a rep
resentative of the Associated Press that
he was satisfied with the result and was
confident the team would be able to hold
its own at the long ranges. 800 and 1000
yards. When the Americans left th,e 800
range with a five-point lead they received
a round of hearty cheers from the on
lookers. The Americana made 43 and the
Westminsters 46 bullseyes at 500 yards
range.
The competition was one of the clos
est ever witnessed at Risley. and the
keenest was taken In It as the
day's shooting was closing. The West
minsters fired quicker than the marks
men of the Seventh, and finished
fifteen minutes before the Americans.
Bacchus, one of the Westminster reserves,
led the scoring. At 600 yards he scored U
bullseyes and four inners. being but four
short of the possible score.
Stevens, of the Seventh, at 500 yards hit
the bullseye 12 times, but he had two In
ners and one magpie at 60i> and his score
fell to 69. spoiling a good beginning. The
next highest to Becchus for the West
minsters was Mansfield, also a reserve
man.
Stall led the Seventh with 134. After
the shooting, the teams were entertained
at tea by the Westminsters, the latter" 3
band playing during the function.
WORK ALREADY DO.NE
OX PAXAMA CANAL
Chief Knsinter Wallace Tells What
Has Been Accomplished and What
Is Proposed.
The work done on the Isthmus during
the past nine months is more significant
in the fact that it 13 largely preparatory
to the work that is to come, says Chief
Engineer Wallace of the Panama Canal
in Harper's Weekly.
Engineering parties are covering tfle
entire isthmus, making surveys and
checking the French dataâ mapping and
surveying the streams and finding out
the discharge of the various water
courses, in the Chagres River particu
larly: taking borings to determine tfie
character of foundations available for
dams and determining the geological for
mation of the isthmus along the canal
line. This work is being done to verify
the data which, were found in the French
archives and to "secure additional Infor
mation. " - â¢
In the engineering and construction de
partment during the month of March
there were 5000 men employed. In tKs
force are 700 Americansâ civil engineers,
clerks, foremen and mechanicsâ men oC
the higher grades and directing opera
tions, including steam-shovel men and
trainmen. There are 1100 native artisans
âmachinists, carpenters, bricklayers and
other skilled artisansâ composed of Ja
maica negroes, Spanish. Central Ameri
can peons, all classes of labor other than
Americans.
In addition to this, in the sanitary,de
partmentâdraining swamps, clearing Jun
gle , and .work of that character, and
serving as officials of the zone govern
ment, police force, etc.â there are practi
cally 2500 men. This force of 7300 men.
under the auspices of the Isthmian Canal
Commission. 13 increasing dally. For in
stance. In the Culebra excavation a new
steam-shovel is installed about every two
weeks. This means more cars, more en
gines, more crews.
The force engaged in the canal requires
extensive housing. lln the architects' de
partment there .are 964 men engaged in
planning, rebuilding and repairing houses.
That work is being pushed as fast as tha
men can be employed to do It and as fast
as : the materials can be obtained
from the United Statesâ where most of
the material of all sorts comes from.
MUNICH LEADS WORLD
AS THE CITY OF BEE*
Consumption oi the BeTcnge in That
Place Runs to 700,000 Barrels
Annually.
"Munich la the great Deer city of thÂ«
world," said Fritz Sommersen. Memphis,
who has recently returned* from a con
tinental trip. "There are^ nearly 8000
breweries In Bavaria, big and little, of
abcut one to every 1000 Inhabitants. Ths
largest are In Munich, one of which pro
duces annually 7.000.000 gallons of beer,
and there are. two others not far behind.
"The city of Munich drinks every year
700.000 barrels of beer, or nearly, two bar
rels to every man, woman and child la
the place, and pays more than J6.000.000
for It. Taking the whole country.' the
consumption of beer Is 260 Quarts a head
of population. Munich alonfe has nearly
300 breweries, there having: been a steady
Increase in the number ror the last 200
years. In 1600 there were sixty. breweries
In the capital, but the first records con
cerning the brewing of beer date back to
1150. For several centuries after that time
mead, a concoction of water and fer
mented, honey, was the common drink of
the people.
"In 1613 the hofbrau or royal brewery
was ' established, which is still a flour
ishing institution and puts a great deal
of: money yearly into the King's coffers.
When General Grant was in Munich the
hofbrau. was the onlyone of the city'a
sights that ha chose to see and he was
so well pleased with the beer that he
gave the waitress a 50-centx tip."âMil

Ranee of Bees for Â»o tar.
: "The. range of honey bees Is but little
understood," said F. Frank Kllbourn
â¢â¢Many suppose that bees go for miles in
quest x>f nectar, while others think theY
gotypnly for a short distance. It may Be
curious to many to understand how any
one can tell how far the bees roÂ»y fly
but this Is simple when understood Y*Hrs
ago. when the Italian bees were nrst
Introduced in the United State*,' these
bees, having marks different to th* com

obtained the Italian bees they could be

If ,bloom is plentiful close where beÂ«s
are located, they will not, go wry far
perhaps a 'mile in range, but if bloom li
scarce they may fly five miles. Usually
about three miles Lj a* far as they may
go profitably. Bees have been known to

ATTACKS WIFE
WITH WRENCH
Michael Liddy, Whom In
sanity Commission Refused
to Commit, Bent on Murder
TRIES TO KILL SELF
Returns From Country,
Where Relatives Sent Him
to Save Him From Asylum
Michael Liddy, who was allowed to go
free recently by Judge Graham and the
insanity Commissioners after a spirited
contest at the examination as to bis men
tal condition, made a desperate attack
on his wife yesterday morning with a
monkey wrench and had she not been
successful in flight he would undoubtedly
have killed. her. - Failing to take the life
of his wife, he attempted to commit sui
cide by cutting his throat with a penknife,
but in this rash act he was also unsuc
cessful. He Inflicted two wounds on him
self, but they are not at all serious.
When Mrs Llddy preferred the charge
of insanity against her husband a week
ago some of his relatives came forward
and made vigorous defense, among other
things alleging that the charge was made
for the purpose of doing away with him
that a lite insurance policy lor *30uo might
be collected.
11 was finally decided to have the aged
man sent away for treatment. He was
sent to a ranch near Stockton to recuper
ate by his cousin. M. J. O'Donnell of iSel
lota, San Joaquin County.
5 Yesterday morning Liddy returned to
his home in this city bent on murdering
his wife. He set upon her with a monkey
wrench. She battled with him and afttr
being struck several times she made her
escape to a saloon at Nineteenth and Fol
som streets, where she telephoned to the
police. Policeman Wollweber went to the
house and found Llddy locked up in the
bathroom. When he opened the door Lid
dy was lying on the floor with a stream
of blood flowing from the self-inflicted
wounds in his throat.
The maniac made no resistance and he
was removed to the Central Emergency
Hospital, where Dr. Herzog dressed the
wounds. Mrs. Llddy was treated at the
City and County Hospital for a lacerated
jaw. She later returned to her home.
Liddy requested to see a priest and one
called during the day. At times he talks
rationally and at other times his mind
wanders.
DYNAMITE IS NOT
DANGEROUS TO HANDLE
A Child Would' Find Diffi
culty in Making* It
Explode.
"The recent railway accident at Har
risburg has brought out a vast amount
of irresponsible talk about handling
dynamite," said E. H. Clifford, a New
York contractor, who has purchased
tons of that explosive for blasting pur
poses. "The majority of person^ who
talk about dynamite have only a vague
idea, of what it is. Dynamite is not the
dangerous substance it is- popularly
supposed to be. It may be handled
with absolute recklessness by an ex
perienced man and will not detonate
except under well-defined circum
stances. A detonation is about 1000
times quicker than an explosion. Dyna
mite detonates. It does not explode.
"Dynamite in its marketable form, in
order, to tit into drillholes, is shipped
in sticks varying from half an inch to
two inches in diameter and from three
-inches to one foot in length. In the
the early days of its manufacture, be
fore its properties were fully under
stood, there were some unaccountable
explosions that gave dynamite a bad
name it has never recovered from. Time
has made us wiser. /There Is no dan
ger at all in children finding odds and
end 3 of dynamite thrown away by care
less workmen. A child would find a
great deal of difficulty in exploding It.
Every. now and then we read of some
body receiving a supposed infernal ma
chine containing dynamite, which is
promptly immersed in water before it
is opened; If it was really dynamite it
would explode just as readily, under
proper conditions, if it were in twenty
feet of water.
"Dynamite is nitroglycerin held in
an absorbentâ wood pulp, coal dust or
other material â that will hold the ex
plosive tightly. It is a powder of a
resinous nature, varying in color with
the nbsorbentÂ»used. The strength Is
calculated by the amount, varying all
the way from 20 to SO per cent. That
generally used for blasting purposes in
and around New York is 45 per cent.
With the absorbent â¢* and other in
gredients combined so as to obtain
positive results in absorption and to
guard against the danger of any free
acid left in the nitroglycerin. The lat
ter is the only detonating n-operty.
The absorbent neither helps nor re
tards it.
"For. commercial, purposes stick
dynamite is packed in twenty-five
pound or fifty- pound cases, with a
liberal allowance of sawdust. It can
be freighted or stored without danger,
provided common intelligence and care
be used. It is only when Ignorant per
sons attempt to experiment with.it that
It becomes a powerful destroying
agency. In somÂ« States its transporta
tion by rail Is governed by strict law.
It should be. so In every State. In New
York and other cities its transportation
through the streets Is regulated by the
Fire Commissioners. The police have
nothing to do wljh it." â New York

AWARDED ISLAND
WIRE FRANCHISE
Telephone-Telegraph System
to Be Built in Philip
pines by Local Promoters
WLLL BEGIN IN MANILA
Privileges Granted Include
Running Lines Through
out Great Archipelago
A dispatch has been -received from Ma
nila stating that the Philippine Commis
sion has passed an act granting to John
I. Sabin and. Louis Glass of this. city a
franchise to construct telephone and tele
graph" systems throughout the Islands.
John I. Sabln Is the president and Louis
Glass is the vice president and general
manager of the Pacific States Telephone
and Telegraph Company.
Their comprehensive plan includes the
locating of exchanges in the principal
cities of the Islands with long distance
telephone connection and also a tele
graphic connection. Besides these im
provements cables will be laid among the
various islands.
Manila will In all probability be the
headquarters of the new- company. Al
ready an agent of the company la on the
ground attending to the preliminary
work. â¢At present there is an antiquated
Spanish system in the islands supplying
service to only frve hundred patrons. It
is high priced and very slow and un
popular. .
The promoters of the new system In
tend to invest half a million dollars in the
project. As the systems expand the
amount will bÂ« increased, so that in
time as the business demands a cor
poration will be formed to keep abrea3t
of the development. It will start, how
ever, with money invested by Sabin and
Glass, although possibly a third party
may al!K> be added. In working the tele
phone and telegraph in conjunction, but
one wire will be used, as over a long
distance wire both a telephone conversa
tion and a telegraph message can be con
veyed at the same time without inter
ruption of either.
CAPTAIN SMITH'S
MAINE POCAHONTAS
She Saved Him From the
Indians at Gardiner
The history of Captain John Smith
and his love affair with Pocahontas is
generally known to most everybody
who has made any study at all of the
history of this country, but very few
know of Smith's other Pocahontas in
Maine.
It was in 1614 that Captain John
Smith made a trip to what is now Gar
diner, and it was there thi3 other Po
cahontas incident occurred. The Ca
bassas tribe of Indians were presided
over by a chief having headquarters at
what is now Gardiner, then known as
Cabassas, and who had a daughter
named Seboois, famed among her tribe
for her beauty and erace.
She was, unfortunately, smitten at
once with the gallant captain, who
was, by the way, the first white man
to visit these parts and who was re
ceived with great cordiality.
Smith had with him a lieutenant
named Hunt, who was of a quarrel
some nature and disposition and prone
to mutiny. When the time came for the
party of whites to depart Hunt's mu
tinous spirit showed itself, and with a
small party of followers he left Smith,
going in an opposite direction. His
party took with them as captives sev
eral of the tribe of the Cabassas.
The chief, considering the whites
one party, by a great mistake followed
Captain Smith's loyal band, which
camped for the night about four miles
from the present location of Gardiner.
Seboois, wishing to warn the captain,
hurried on before the party of enraged
Indians, but arrived too late, for as
she arrived at the camp the first volley
of arrows had been delivered.
Thinking to save Smith, she flew to
him and threw her arms about his
neck and In that position received an
arrow in her breast which caused in
stant death.
The chief was sorely stricken at the
accident and ordered hostilities to
cease.
This allowed Smith an opportunity to
explain that it was the other party
that did the kidnaping. After the sor
rowful return and the burial of Seboois
near what Is now the Randolph church
the red men went in search of Hunt,
and he was overtaken near Norridge
wock * and his entire band exter
minated.
Captain Smith had the martyred Se
boois to thank for hi 3 life, for the ar
row that reaci^e d her heart was meant
for him. This is the story as found in
some very old papers near Gardiner.â

The Cotton Market.
The New York wires of E. F. Huuon &
'.'o. yesterday caid:
"The cotton market continues to rule much
us we predicted a month ago. when we called
your attention to the bullish possibilities as we
taw them at that time. T\me has strength
ened our beMcf in a treat big bull market In
tins commodity, and from best opinion we can
set from the South and New York we are
led to believe the maxkev has only fairly start
ed. Conditions warrant sensationally higher
rriees. The crop at present with most favor
ahle weather conditions from this time on to
ricking iierlod will Â£*U fax short of worlds
rr-quireroents. and even with the reserves from
f\& crop will be scarcely enough to go around,
\u25a0tt eather :s all against it and has been for
some time. Trivate reports are positively
alarming and spinners the world over are get
â¢ing anxious as to next year's supplies. One
of the strongest bull arguments to our mind
that one can advance on cotton is the average
I rice of S.ROc obtained for last year's crop of
\u25a0\u0084000.000 to 14.0u0.000 bales. This crop looks
k? ten and a quarter million bales at b*st."
The Coffee Trade.
The New York circular cf Henry Norclinger
& Co. tays:
"Whi> the most important contentions we
V.aye htld and expressed with reference to the
improvement In the etatistical position of
i-oCee for the crop year 1904-C5 have been
borne out fey actual results, the market has
not responded to this Improvement; on, the
contrary, -with the realization of the better
ment in the actual position, speculators be
came more aggressive in their efforts to de
press values, wa* we must acknowledge that
tuecess fcas accompanied these efforts of late.
The reason for this success ir.ay be found in
â¢.he fact that there was a big interest accumu
lated by another set of speculators, who took
fright when they found that their hopes of
an enhancement of values were dashed to
pieces Just at the time when they expected
them to be realized.
â¢â¢Speculative offers tro-fi Brazil for ship
ment during the coming fall months at a con
siderable cut In price kelow that actually
ruling in Brazil helped along the decline andt
induced some holder* not only to get cut of
ihe article entirely, but to make short salts
a? WCU The market for actual Coffee, on
the other hand, was hardly influenced by 'these
maneuvers, and commercial grades of desir
able Qualities are virtually unchanged from
a month ago. A healthy demand for them
has bÂ«en and is ttill existing, and the stocks
â¢of these grades have become very small. .
"An addiUonaT* fact, and one which we
consider of great importance, has been brought
cut during the past crop year, and that Is,
shat the eonsumvticm of Rio and Santos
toffee has overtaken the production to the
extent cf LTSy.uOt) bags, of which 1.250, tw0
1 a&s have been taken from visible stocks, and
fully 500.000 bags out of invisible ftockn
'.-to'eks In the hands cf distributors in the in
terior of Europe and the United States): this
means a consumption of Rio and Santos Coffee
curing the past crop year of about 11,750,000
bags.
\u25a0â¢The world's visible supply is now down to
â¢where it was three years ago. The Increase
in the same during the two previous years
has been fully wiped out during the crop year
jurt finished.
"The new crop year begins to-day, and It
is well to take cognizance of the fact that In
the pa*t two years about 60 per cent of the
Brazil crops reached fchipplng ports during the
-.v.ontas of July to October Inclusive. We
must, therefore, be prepared for a heavy
movement to ports during that time.
"With reference to the future statistical
r-ofit!on cf Coffee, we can foresee a further
improvement of magnitude curing the crop
year Just beginning, even though we should
have 500.000 bags, cr even 1,000,000 bags.
mere Rio and Santos Coffee than we had last .
year. As an offset to this possible increase
ir. the Brizliian crops we will have a decrease
in the receipts of mild Coffees in Europe and
the United States of fully 500.000 bags, and
we calculate on an increase in the consump
tion of ai>out 500.000 bags without regard to
a.r.y duty agnation which we may encounter
later la tie year.
"The question which confronts the trade is
'Ms: Can & reduction in supplies continue
for acy length of time without having a cor
rTponfilr.g erect on values? We for our part
doubt this seriously."

Xfvr York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. July c.â The coincidence of
the free eelline of stocks to take profits yes
terday \u25a0 and the t>ublicatlon of an Interview
with a prominent speculative leader speaking
with great confidence of the prospect for
-much higher prices had the effect of leaving
feentiment a -rood deal unsettled to-day. The
desire was shown hew far the realizing sales
of yesterday had effected the distribution of
holdings from the hands of the powerful oper
ators who have conducted the advance and
whose motive for further Drotection of the
market would thus be lessened. There was
' further selling of stocks, in fact, at available
' pportunities and under cover of sustaining
--Â» ' -*ctacular movements in otter carts of the
lift.
The volume of dealiscs fell below the total
rf yetterday and tbei-*- was an absence of
ror.-jestlon of covering in Reading and Union
Pacific.
The buying of Reading e&mc Â«from many
quarters under the encouragement of the bold
leadf ri-fcip in the movement and the seemingly
Irresistible character of tn-s advance. .The
only news en the stock -Aa* the general asser
tion of ltf high earnlne power and
the bod. predictions circulated or the
extent to which it was intended yet to carry
the movement. Erie was affected in sympathy.
The n^ui&Ucn in Union Pacific was fostered
fry rumors of ar. intended extra dividend on
the stock. Southern Pacific and St. Paul
phritved Imrrovcraent. Tennessee Coal Cucta
b!Â«<l en comparatively smsll dealings. This
sheet deflr's the limit cf the important move
sii'nts cf the day. Time loans were firmer in
/Tie arid !t is rrobable that consideration of
.r,* mace)" oatlock fcad a restraining effect
*-j th<! market. Parip renewed its takings of
*:cid in the London market and thÂ« sterling
rate <ieclirÂ»d In Paris. The possibility of
further expert cf rcld from New York Is thus
kept oven. Receipts' on account of Klondike
â¢-sold are constantly replenishing tbÂ« New Tork
supply now. It is expected alw that the
Government bones to be released by the re
turn of Government deposits on July 15 will
go protrr-tly Into use for new issues of bank
rotet. This would add to the available supply
of currency and facilitate an outward- move
ment of go'A. The effect of the subscription
to the Japanese loan seemi- to be viewed with
more uncertainty. Even where the \u25a0 proceeds
of the former loan were left on deposit here
the sh'.ftin; in the loan account caused some .
Â», temporary disturbance In the money market, i
f atlsfacttoTj 1Â» felt tvÂ»t the authoritative In- j
tlmatlon that no ---ihtdrawal of the loan pro- I
ceeds Is Intended before the last of October. \
A larsre sum of the last Japanese loan re
mains on deposit In New York and is placed
In call lean here, so that the Japanese Gov
ernment's handling of Its balances might have
an Important effect on the New York money
market. The digestion of profits was per
sistent and as a rule the day's important gains
Â«re restricted to a few stocks. The closing
tone was Irregular.
Bonds were Â«Vady. Total eales, par value,
$4,339,000. United States bonds were un
changed on call.

Future Grain and Provision's.
CHICAGO. July Uâ The wheat market wa*
weak from the start. September was down
%c to 'Ac to ii@%*: at'72%(j<2!%<.v
The main . factor, of weakness was the im
proved weather condition, a . contributory fac
tor was the decline in the price of wheat at
Liverpvjol. Sellers wer* given increased i en
courasenient by -the movement \u25a0of 'wheat In
the Southwest. This led to heavy selling of
the July option and there was a sharp decline
In the price of that delivery. Other months
were decidedly affected by the profit taking In
July. Uerore the end ot the lirst hour Sep
tember had declined to. SO'/^c. On' the break
commission houses purchased, frirely. The buy
lug resulted In a quick upturn, September ad
vancing to S7%@S7Â»io. The rally was helped
by a dual report made by : twi> well-known
crop experts tstlmaUng tha total yield ot win
ter wheat at 350,0u0,000 bushels to 305.000.0C0.'
whereas inferences from Government ' figures
make the yield about 435,000,000. The mar
ket, however, lacked any fresh damage re
portsUo give confidence â¢ to the bulls, and on
that account Â« reaction soon occurred, follow
ing renewed liquidation. A prominent long
was credited with liberal sales during the last
hour of -.trading. The market closed ' weak,
with September l^c down, at SC%Â®SO%c.
'Sentiment in thecorn pit Inclined the bull
ishness.. A firm tone prevailed at the close.'
September closed at 65Uc.
Weakness of wheat caused moderate profit
taking In pats, resulting in an easy market^
September closed }4<? off at 311-Je* \JT
Provisions were firm at the start as a rptrflt
of decreased receipts of hogs. The slump in
wheat| however, caused some profit taking,
resulting in a slight Ices. At the close pork
and lnrd were each dowit^^c and ribs were
a shade lower. f ~~^-

BARLEYâ The market was firmer ' yester
day, with cash grain and futures both higher.
The . trading In futures was heavy and the
advance was due to light receipts and reports
frohi the country that the .crop was not turn
ing out as well as expected.' From 'the Butte
and Colusa ' sections come reports that the
crop will be 80 per cent un<W previous esti
mates, as the threshing returns are making
an unfavorable showing. TWs talk has re
duced the estimates of many operators from
a 700,000-ton crop to afcout a 500, 000- ton crop.
Hence the current^Jlfmness.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Receipts of â¢ deciduous fruits, while still
large, were less liberal than prevtously and
with an Improved demand /for local consump
tion .' the market had a healthier tone, and
close clearances of come. varieties were readily
effected. Peaches: were In light supply and
higher and prices of Flams. Prune* and Apri
cots were steadier. One brand of â¢ Plum*
known as the Peach variety sold up to 75Â«
per crate. Apricots In bulk were well carea
for by the regular trade at higher prices, ana
occasional sales for canning account were re
ported At $20 per ton. FlÂ«s were in light
receipt and firm at 65@730.f0r ordinary pack
ages and $1 for large river boxes. Apples ana
Peats were steady for choice stÂ»ck. while low
grade offerings were neglected and weak. The
continued hot weather held Melons steady. The
first Nutmeg Melons for the season appeared
from Clarksburg, on the Sacramento River.
One small andlone large box came in and sold
for $1 and $2 respectively. Berries. ruled weak
under continued heavy receipts and surplus
lots J of Loganberries. . Raspberries and largo
Strawberries went to the canners at the In
side rates. All kinds of Citrus fruits ruled
firm under light supplies and a brisk demand.
Stocks of Lemons were extremely light and
available supplies .cleaned up readily at
sharply advanced quotations. The.- steamer
Santa Rosa, which arrived In the afternoon
from southern ports, brought less than 1000
boxes. v

\u25a0 The trade continue to report firm markets

WOMAN ON BOARD OF CURACAO
RENOUNCED BY HER DAUGHTER
Mrs. Maria Hernandez Tells
Pitiful Tale of Inabili
ty to Land Because No
One Will Care for Her
IS AGED, PENNILESS
AND NEAELY BLIND
Her Child Is Mrs. Aureiia
Demoro of Berkeley, Who
Is Now Living on Her
Kanch Near Santa Cruz
GRANDCHILD SAYS
SHE MUST RETURN
Scorned by the grandchild who loved,
as a little one, to creep into her lap
and coo sweet -words to her. and
neglected by a daughter who appar
ently has ample means to support her,
Mrs. Maria Hernandez, 72 years of
age, penniless and suffering from an
affliction of the eyes that will shortly
leave her sightless, lies cooped up In
the Bteerage of the steamer Curacao,
â¢whence the Immigration officials have
not allowed her to come because
she has no one to support her. If she
is not rescued from her predicament to
day she will be deported back to Mex
ico, where, friendless and without
xibillty to earn the most frugal of liv
ings, she says that she will * slowly
starve to death.
From the under deck of the Curacao
yesterday Mrs. Hernandez told her piti
ful tale of a life of devotion to those
whom 6he loved and a final casting out
by them. She cannot speak a word of
English, but in perfect Spanish she re
cited her story.
PERSUADED TO GO TO MEXICO.
Her daughter is Mrs. Aureiia Demoro
of 2834 Telegraph avenue. Berkeley,
wife of the well-known sea captain,
Raphael Demoro, who died nearly a
year ago. The grandchild is Miss Au
reiia Demoro. who lives with her
mother. According to the etory of Mrs.
Hernandez she has lived with Mrs.
Demoro for many years and helped to
raise her family of four children. All
-went well until Captain Demoro died
and then her relations with the family
were not so pleasant. Finally, says
the old -woman, she was persuaded last
January to go to Mexico to visit her
sister for a short time. Mrs. Demoro
paid her passage there and gave her a
little money. Shortly after her arrival
in Mexico her sister, who Is poor, had
to go Into the interior to attend to
her sick husband and Mrs. Hernandez
was left to return to her daughter in
Berkeley. She had no money, but she
managed somehow to reach the seaport
of Ensenada, where she told her tal*Â»
to Mrs. Fussllier, a passenger on the
Curacao, and the latter paid her way
to San Francisco.
Happy then was Mrs. Maria Hernan
dez at the thought of soon being back
with her daughter. She could hardly
\u25a0wait until the ship was moored and
when the gangplank was lowered she
was the first there. Then Immigrant
Inspector de la Torre stopped her and
told her she could not land until she
brought some one who would vouch for
her keeping. Never fearing, the
wrinkled old woman sent word to her
daughter that she bad returned.
AUHEUA SAYS "GO BACK."
That very afternoon Miss Aureiia
Demoro, the grandchild, came down to
the boat. "I was very glad then," said
Mrs. Hernandez, "but Aureiia said that
I must go back and that they would
not take care of me. and I have been
left here. It doesn't seem possible that
I am to be deserted by my own people
like this."
Mrs. Demoro Is now at her country
home near Santa Cruz. Miss Aureiia
came up to Berkeley on Saturday and
\u25a0went down to the dock to nee Mrs.
Hernandez. "She will have to go
back," said the girl yesterday after
noon. "When Ehe left us in January
to go and see her sister It was to stay
there and we will not take her back
now. She is only mother's step
mother, not her real mother."
The Demoros are \u25a0well known people
of Berkeley. They have an elegant
home and are reputed to be wealthy.
Mrs. Hernandez says that she is the
real mother of Mrs. Demoro.
CiriXCSE PAPER ADVISES
CCTTnVG OFF OF PIGTAILS
Declares It to Be Only a Manchnrlan
Cnston and a Bait for Rude
White Boys.
The Chinese Free Press, organ of
the reformers, advises all Chinese In
the United States to cut off their pig
tails and commends the patriotic ex
ample set by Lee Pew and Wong Tsun,
laundrymen of Vallejo, who on July 4,
as a token of respect for this country,
shaved off their dangling braids. Tho
Press naively adds that Lee and Wong
had been annoyed by boys and rough
\u25a0white men "jerking the bell rope"
-whenever they came by. The advice of
the Free Press Is as follows:
"We advise 'all Chinese to follow
their example and not allow their fond
ness for a Monchurian custom to deter
them from doing away Immediately
with this badge of enmity between
them and the people of America."

WISH TO REVIVE
DAIRY EXCHANGE
Next Tuesday afternoon, at a meeting
to be held at the rooms of the Board of
Trade of San Francisco, the movers for
the rehabilitation of the old Dairy Ex
change will finally test the sentiment of
the commission houses in this matter.
This was determined upon at a meeting
that was. held yesterday. Some .weeks ago
the subject was. broached at a meeting
of dealers in dairy produce. A committee
was appointed. to frame a plan and this
committee reported yesterday.' W. H.
Roussel presided.
A long discussion took place. Some of
the dairy produce dealers were in favor
of voting at once upon the adoption of
the report. Others, in view of the fact
that several wholesale houses were not
represented at the meeting, suggested de
lay. It was finally voted that a copy
of the report should be sent at once to
every commission house In the city that
deals in dairy produce and that means
should be taken to ascertain the senti
ment of every concern. Some dealers
said that unless the movement was unan
imous, It would fall, others favored ac
tion it 75 per cent of the trade approved
of the report. The recommendations Of
the committee are as follows:
That the old Dairy Exchange be opened up
for active work; that a market quotation br
established by actual sales on the floor of the
exchange, the quotation to be known as. the
official or exchange quotation of Kan Fran
cisco; that the press be furnished with a basis
for street quotations in accordance .vitfi the
actual conditions and regulated by a commit
tee appointed for the purpose by the exchange,
to consist of three members; that jusa changes
a s are necessary shall be made in the by-iaws
to permit wholesale dealers, manutaiturers
and brokers to be eligible tor mei.ibsrdhip,
the fee to be $25, each member to put up a
note for $500, such note to become t.ollestlble
as security for fines and penalties, and. if
tines and penalties are not paid by an ' offend
lnc member his note shall be collectible in
proportion to the fine and the member shall
be expelled from the exchange; that the
monthly dues shall be $10; that an official
rater and weicher for butter, eggs and cheese
shall be appointed; that a standard of grades
ahall be established; that a rate of fine* shall
also be established; that the exchange Khali
be open to the press, the representatives of
the press to be furnished with admission cards
good for a year; that exchange meetings hhall
be held every Tuesday and Friday, that the
minimum quantltfes for sale shall lxÂ» 1000
pounds of butter. 25 cases of egg* and 1000
pounds of cheese; that tha old constitution and
by-laws be changed to conform to th;se pro
visions; that tha old board of directors, with
the exception of Mr. Halght, deposed, who v
to be succeeded by Mr. Harrold. shall be con
tinued.

COLLINS TRIAL
BEGINS TO-DAY
Judge Lennori Orders That
the Selection of a Jury
Be Proceeded With at Once
O'CONNOR TO DEFEND
Alleged Bigamist Makes His
Usual Efforts at Obstruc
tion and Irritates Court
Judge Lennon of Marin County, sit
ting in Judge : Lawlor's court here,, has
ordered that the trial of George D. Col
lins, attorney, accused of bigamy for
marrying Clarice \u25a0 McCurdy in Chicago,
when he .had' a wife here, be proceeded
with this morning. > .
Collins made another appearance in
court yesterday. i_ The alleged bigamist
was without counsel and he asked Judge
Lennon for time lin which to secure ex-
Governor James H.Budd, who is in Ne
vada, trying a mining case. When as
sured that all the continuances^that could
reasonably be granted him had been al
lowed, he suggested the names of Charles
D. Heggerty j and;D. M. Delmas. Heg
gerty declined, saying he was not a
criminal lawyer, and the court c*ould not
be assured that Delmas was at present
within its Jurisdiction. Judge Lennon
finally appointed Thomas O'Connor. â¢
Argument on points raised by Collins
and O'Connor took. so much time that ho
jurors' were secured. The court an
nounced that it would enforce the actual
beginning -of -the:' trial at 10 o'clock this
morning and ordered jurymen. and wit
nesses to be present at that hour.
Collins* appearance was a strong point
in favor "of. a motion he made for a con
tinuance on the ground of physical in
disposition. His -face was pale and
drawn. .' . \u25a0
Charlotte Newman-Collins was ready to
give her testimony and the many, other
witnesses who have so far been secured
in the case. were present.
At one point of the proceedings Judge
Lennon rebuked District Attorney Bying
ton. ' Collins was mourning the absence
of Governor Budd from the city and beg
ging for a continuance of two weeks
when the District Attorney exclaimed:
"If your Honor please, cbunsel for the
defense has . already been granted too
many privileges."* Judge Lennon ex
pressed himself as indignant that an as
sertion accusing the' court of favoring
the defendant should be made and said
in substance that the court would use
its own discretion as to when Collins was
overstepping legal bounds. ',"Â»
The court was. obviously irritated, how
ever, by the tedious methods of gaining
time which the defendant employed dur
ing the afternoonâ mostly arguments
against the legality of the Grand Jury.
Judge Lennon denied his application for
habeas corpus. .
Collins wanted; the Indictment for
bigamy quashed, because he declared it
unconstiutional mv regard to number,
quoting the code of civil procedure as
evidence, r
To-day the prosecution will endeavor to
impanel the Jury, notwithstanding the
objections of the defendant.
STUONO ACCUSATION v
MADE AGAINST UNION
Employer Tells of Difficulties
Witli the Cooks and
Waiters.
Suit was filed yesterday by E. J.
Crawford, who keeps a restaurant
1329 Market street,' to enjoin the Cooks
and. Waiters' Union from interfering
with his business.
â¢Crawford alleges that, at a recent
date a committee of the union called
at his place of business and told him
that he would have to discharge his
cook, who was behind in his dues as a
member of the union.- Crawford says he
offered to pay the dues, but the union
men were obdurate and refused to rea
son with him, demanding that the cook
be discharged. \u25a0\u25a0'
Crawford says that he refused to
comply with .the demand and then the
committee informed him that he would
have to discharge a non-union waiter in
his^employ.. Instead of discharging the
waiter, Crawford continues, he instruct
ed him'to Join the, union: The waiter
tried to Join, but the officials of the
union told him that there were enough
waiters ali?eady in San Francisco and
that he could not become a member.
Then, continues Crawford, in his
complaint, the committee again waited
on him, presented three "closed shop"
agreements for him to sign and an
nounced that if he did not sign them
and discharge the cook and waiter com
plained of within five minutes a boycott
against . his place would be declared.
Crawford says that he refused to sign
the papers and ,wtthin twenty minutes
sandwich men and pickets were march
ing up and down in front' of- his' place
crying out that it was unfair and em
ployed scab ; labor. .

or interfering with the children in any
way.
The report that the Talbot litigation
would be settled out of court is thus
disposed of, all indications, now point
ing to protracted and bitter litigation.
The -motion for the modification of the
restraining order is Talbot's first ap
pearance in the suit and is the natural
sequence of the chagrin that was his
when the court called upon him to fur
nish a $20,000 bond before granting him
permission to take | his little sons out
for a good time on the Fourth.
\u25a0: The court, says Talbot, through his
attorneys, Jordan Â£ Brann, has no right
to limit the care and custody of the mi
nor children of the parties herein to the
plaintiff, especially as the plaintiff is
not a fit and proper person to have
their custody. Furthermore, it Is set
forth, the court is without jurisdiction
to make such an. order, nor has the
court - jurisdiction to restrain the de
fendant from handling his separate
property as he sees fit, -the community
property of the parties herein being
sufficient to meet any demands the
plaintiff may make.
The order to show cause will be
heard by Judge Murasky this morning.
FATHER -IS "BLINDED,
MOTHER GOES INSANE
Overwork and Worry of Self-
Sacrificing Woman Un
balances Her Mind.
Overwork and worry, caused by a
desperate struggle to support a- blind
husband and I three ' young children,
brought Mrs. Delia Sheehan to the de
tention ward at the Central Emergency
Hospital yesterday, her mind totally
unbalanced. Her two ( little girl 3, aged
IX and 9 years, and her helpless hus
band accompanied her. One of the chil
dren led the blind father; the other
clung. tightly to her. mother's skirts and
shrieked with grief when the insane
woman was locked In a cell.!. .
Jeremiah Sheehan, the,- father, was
working as a carpenter until an acci
dent blinded him permanently three
years ago. The . mother was forced to
work to support the helpless family.
iNot being a strong woman, the task
was more than she could stand. Her
mind began to fail and when she was
alone she gave way to despair entirely,
though she. k*pt up an assumption of
cheerfulness, somehow before her hus
band and children.:
With the help of her brother, Timothy
Hayes, she managed to keep. the family
alive. But a few days ago the unfor
tunate; woman's "mind .gave way alto
gether., She will be committed to a
State asylum. ,The two little girls, El
len and May, were taken in . charge by
Miss Garrity, jj probation officer of the
Detention Home. ---

STREETS WILL
NOT BE SWEPT
Attitude of Eagan and Maes
tretti on Teaming Contract
Will Stop Cleaning Work
DISPUTE NOT SETTLED
Aigeltinger Is Willing to
Recognize Clute, but His
Colleagues Are Obdurate
In all likelihood the work of clean
ing the streets will come to a sudden
stop In a day or two owing to the re
fusal of Public "Works Commissioners
Eagan and Maestretti to abide by the
terms of the contract awarded by the
Board of Supervisors to A. B. Clute
to furnish teams to the city at $4 63
each. Commissioner Aigeltinger stated
yesterday that he would refuse to
sign any demands for teaming at the
old rate of $6. He holds that even
If the contract Is Irregular because It
was awarded^ by the Supervisors In
stead of by the Works Board the fact
that the city will effect a large saving
was sufficient justification to approve
the contract. His colleagues are ob
durate, however, and the dispute U far
from being settled.
The City Street Improvement- Com
pany and J. G. Harney yesterday fur
nished the necessary teams for the
carting away of the street sweepings
so work in that connection was not
stopped. Supervisor d'Ancona of the
Supervisors' Street Committee In
formed Harney Wednesday that his
bills for a day or two would be passed
in order to give the Mayor an oppor
tunity to sign the Clute contract, but
after that no bills for teaming would
be passed unless Clute's teams were
hired- by the Board of Works. If
Eagan and Maestretti persist In their
course the cleaning of the streets will
be stopped entirely pending the adju
dication of the dispute by the courts.
Aigeltinger Is also wrought up over
the fact that some $4300 In the fund
tor the repair of bituminous pavements
has reverted to the unapportioned fund
and is now unavailable because Eagan
and Maestretti refused to vote for a
resolution asking 'the Supervisors for
authority to expend the money for re
pairs before the fiscal year expired. .

The Board of Works yesterday di
rected the City Enginer to prepare
plans and specifications for the widen
ing and paving with asphalt of Mission
street, between Fifth and Ninth, for
which money is available under the
bond issue. It was stated . that the
Draymen's Association desired a basalt
block pavement, but the board decided
that the property-owners, who ex
pressed a preference for a noiseless
pavement, were entitled to considera
tion. '. .
A reauest was made of the Super
visors for authority to award a con
tract for building: the abutments to the
Third-street bridge at an estimated
cost of $12,000.
The board ordered the paving: with
basalt blocks of Harrison street, be
tween Fourth and Fifth, except in front
of the Whittier School, which will be
bltuminized.
Contracts, were awarded to the City
Street Improvement Company for the
grading of Buena Vista avenue for

appropriation. The notice is prepara
tory to the bringing of a suit for back

prived of their positions. The Civil

OPERATION AVOIDED
EXPERIENCE OF HISS MERKLEY
She Was Told That an Operation Was
Inevitable. How She Eacaped. IS
When a physician tells a woman sufÂ»
fering with ovarian or womb trouble
that an operation is necessary, the very
thought of the knife and the operating?
table strikes terror to her heart, and
our hospitals are full of women coining
for ovarian or womb operations.
There are cases where an operation /
is the only resource, but when one con-
siders the great number of cases of
ovarian and womb trouble cured by
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Cora-
pound after physicians have advised
operations, no woman should submit to
one without first trying the Vegetable
Compound and writing Mrs. Pinkham.
Lynn, Mass., for advice, which is free.
Miss Margret Merkley of 275 Third
Street, Milwaukee, Wis., writes:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â
"Loss of strength, extreme nervousness
shooting pains through the pelvic organs,
bearing down pains and cramps compelled
me to seek medical advice. The doctor, al tor
making an examination, said I had ovarian
trouble and ulceration and advised an opera-
tion. To this I stronxly objected and decided
to try Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound. The ulceration quickly healed, all
the bad symptoms disappeared and I aaa
once more strong, vigorous and well. "
Ovarian and womb troubles are stead-
ily on the increase among women. If
the monthly periods are very painful,,
or too frequent and excessive â if yon
have pain or swelling low down in the
left side, bearing down pains, leucor-
rhcea, don't neglect yourself : try. Lydia
EL Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
