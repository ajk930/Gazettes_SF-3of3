"WASHINGTON. Dec. >.â An increase In
membership in the Interstate Commerce
Commission .is to be provided for, in* a
bill soon to be introduced Jn Congress. .
Whether the reorganised or rebuilt com
mission will jb{ , a sfive^^grÂ£3ilne
\u25a0 lur-mbersr o lnstead of live; ""has rlor ~y*f
tbcon determined by the Republican mem- !
t>crs who expect to shape the final till. ;
The feeling is practically unanimous In !
favor of some increase. Supporters of
President Roosevelt's policy say this will
come because he wants it. Senators, rec
ognized as speaking for the railways, say
it will come because the commission must
be materially Vhanged if it is to have ad
ditional powers.
Much work under the surface is being
done" by tne Republican members of the
IriterFtate Commerce Committee of the
Senate toward agreement on the general
lines of a bill to receive the support of
those Senators honestly anxious to Incor
porate the recommendations of the Presi
dent into a law, yet equally anxious to
prevent the passage of legislation in
jurious to the great railroad interests of
the country. These men are positive of
their ability to draft a measure which will
cure the existing rate evils so far as they
can be cured by Federal legislation, with
eut putting on the statute books too dras
tic a law.
Thcro appears to be no limit to the Irri
tation and 111 feeling occasioned Jjy the
appointment of Franklin K. Lane of Cali
fornia to be a member of the Interstate
Commerce Commission. There was a
marked increase in the adverse criticism
to-day. The opposition to I>ane Is not con
fined to the Senate, where action must
be taken on his nomination, but members
9f the House of Representatives are ex
pressing themselves with every indica
tion of dissatisfaction and resentment.
The President has served notice that in
po case will he withdraw the nomination ;
of Lone, and the Senate must either con- [
Erm or reject him. The selection was de
termined on last summer. If the Senate ;
docf not act, the President will rcappoim :
l*ne at the end of this session, thus keep-
Ing his eervlec continuous. <
The nomination of Lane, which wa* re-
Cerred to the Interstate Commerce Com
mittee, was not taken up by that commit
tee at Its meeting to-day, and the subject
was not discussed. Senators Aldrlch, For-
Rker, Kean. Elkins and Cullom. all mem
bers' of the committee, are much dis- ;
turbe<J by the selection, primarily because
it makes the commission Democratic, and
further because they are apprehensive of
T^ane'Â« attitude on many questions that
tnust come before the commission for de
termination.

VISITING THIS CITY.
Mrs. W. E. Corey, wife of the Eastern
steel magnate whose reported infatuation
for pretty Mabelle Gilman, the actress?,
is said to have caused an estrangement
between them, Is at the Palace Hotel.
She arrived early yesterday morning.
Her object in visiting San Francisco at
this time Is unknown. She positively
refuses to' talk on the matter.
With Mrs. Corey .is . Miss Ada. Corey,
her sister-in-law, who Is said to have
remained loyal to the wife of her broth
er throughout all the trouble. Miss. Corey
Js from Pittsburgr. Misses Margaret Gray
and Anna Risher of Pittsburgr." personal
friends of Mrs. Corey, are also with her.
It was not until after Mrs. Corey and
her party had been at the Palace several
hours that the - public became aware of"
their v. presence here. They were given
four rooms on the first floor of the hotel
and went to them at once. Mrs. Corey
did not come out all day. Miss Risher
and Miss Gray, however, appeared in the
corridors of the hotel- during the after
noon, Indicating that they were "not try
ing to keep their presence here Becret.
The Corey party came to San Francisco
direct from Reno, Nevada. Mrs. Corey
and her elster-ln-law have been there for
nearly a. month, with the evident inten
tion of securing a residence. They rented
a cottage and to all intents expected to
remain there over the winter. It is re
ported that Mrs.. Corey is thus giving her
husband an opportunity of securing a
divorce on the ground of desertion.
Mre. Corey is a charming, middle-aged
woman. She Is quite 'pretty and speaks
with a gentle melodious voice. She is
rather short in stature. Her hair Is quite
dark. She shows gentle rearing and the
sympathy of all who know her seems to
i be in . her ' favor. \u25a0
She positively refused to be inter
viewed. - "I have \u25a0 nothing- to - say,"_- she
' said, / "and prefer not \u25a0< being asked ; any
questions. I am very sorry that I cannot
talk just now." The members of her
party, are equally, silent over the. ,re^
ported troubles between \u25a0 Mrs. . Corey and
her husband. \u25a0/.'JSBBO

gone, to San Francisco. She is accom
panied- by; her sister-in-law. She left
shortly after 7 o'clock last evening and
will be. gone about- three months."
i . The above is the substance of a tele
j phone message .received from the Reno
: home of the Coreys io-nigrht. it was
(sent by a woman who says that her
name is Aubreon. She is the much-talked
of mysterious friend of 'the Coreys, but
at last has consented to allow her name
to be used. 1 A half hour previously she
had stated that Mrs. Corey was very
nervous, confined to her room and suf
fering from the shock caused by the un
t pleasant notoriety of being* accused of
coming to Nevada to get a divorce, for
which she is to receive J1.000,000.
"Mrs. Corey is ill and nervous," said i
the Aubreon woman, "and cannot see any
one- tonight. She will give out a state
ment at 3:30 o'clock to-morrow." No one
at the depot saw Mrs. Corey or her 618-'

they took the Tonopah express.

Refusal to Answer.
Thomas F. nynn. who ovrai the coatrolllnc Interest la the. EqaltabU
Life Assurance Society, yesterday- refused to answer rertala questions
nsked by the Â»w; York Invest lsatlng committee ns to* his relations witli
I. H. Ilnrrlman, and In consequence District Attorney Jerome T*aÂ» re.
quested to proceed against him. Ryan admitted that Harrlman had ea
deavored to secure part of the Hyde stock after Ryan had purchased It
but refused to divulge what means Harrlwan had uned to try to force
him to share.
NEW YORK, Â»Dec. B.â The legislative ,
committee which is investigating life in
surance conditions to-day determined to
send to District Attorney William T. i
Jerome . a request that he Institute, pro
ceedings against Thomas F. Ryan, finan
cier and : owner of the majority of the
stock of the Equitable Life Assurance So
ciety, to punish Ryan for . refusing to
answer questions before the committee.
Ryan had refused to answer when asked
what " E. ; H.- Harriman, president of the
Union " Pacific .'and Southern Pacific Rail
road companies, had said to him . when
Harrlman- tried =, to induce him to share
his control of the ' Equitable Socle ty with
Harriman. . .
. Ryan was asked whether Harriman had
threatened that results , disastrous to
Ryan's Interests would ensue, or if Har
rlman had told him that some ; action
would be taken by the State Legislature.
;or* any officer of the Government, unless
Ryan consented to share his stock with
him. Acting on the advice of ' his : attor
ney, Paul D. Cravath, Ryan declined to
answer those questions, although Senator
Armstrong, chairman of the committee,
directed him ' to do so. Ryan, however,
Sid answer one .question by saying that
Harrlman did not tell him at that . time
there would. be. a legislative investigation
of life Insurance business unless he gave
up part of thÂ« Hyde stocV.'
Ryan had already testify i that he had
secured . control; of the Eqviutble Society
by paying James H. Hyde JG.MO.OOO for 502
shares of the total 10a) shares of the so
ciety.
"After you -bad bought that stock, wa.%
there any. proposition to share it with
you?" asked Charles "E. Hughes, counsel
for the committee.
RYAX REFUSES TO AXSWER.
/"Am I . obliged J to answer that ques
tion?" asked Ryan.
'; VI 'think you "ought to, Mr. Ryan," said
Hughes. .
"E. H. Harrlman deslrtd - to share the
purchase: with , me.' and I ' refused to per
mit 'that," replied Ryan. ' '
;Ryan' : said * that he thought .Harriman
made'his' request* on the > day/that ; Ryan"
bought ; : the i stock, and - the ; pur-]
chase was publicly; announce^- .
\u25a0^ : "What J ' did- Harrlman Â«ay; to yon- to ln
fluenoo you. to make thÂ» sÂ»lÂ»?"
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
"I do not think. Mr. Hughes. I ought
to be called upon to answer a question
like thatâ to characterize or state sl con
versation I had privately with Mr. Harri
man," said Ryan.
Paul D. Cravath Interrupted by saylnjc
to the chairman: "I feel bound to say to
my client. Mr. Ryan, that, while he should
testify most fully to what he did ami
what he planned to, do, he cannot, unless
ha chooses to do sa voluntarily, be re
quired to attempt to state conversations
which Mr. Harrfman or any ather man
had with him." i
To this Hughes replied:. "I deem the
matter important In two aspects; in the
first place, that tha committee may un
derstand .the motive which may actuate
those who desire to obtain control of the
stock of the insurance company, and the
proceedings which may be taken to ac
quire It; and. s?cond, that we may know
.whether there is any truth in the report
that there was any suggestion that life
insurance conditions in this State wouM
be* investigated If Mr. Ryan did not ac
cede to Mr. Harrlman'B request. I think
that we should have full lisht upon thei
transaction, and I hope that Mr. Ryan
will feel that he can do another public
service by advising the committee fully."
Cravath said that Ryan would testify
freely as to facts, but that he was not re
quired to state what Ilarriman said -to
him in private conversation.
"Mr. Ryan," said Senator Armstrong,
"the committee directs you to answer the
question."
The following colloquy ensued:
Ryanâl will answer to it so far aslto
state that I refused to snare the purchase
with Mr. llarrimaa.
DID lIARRI3I AX TIIR BATEX r
"What. did Mr. Harrlman say to you in
connection " with the, matter?*.*- asked
Hushes.
Cravathâ MyÂ« advice is that you are not
required to answer that question.
The chairmanâ Do you refuse? .
Ryanâ l refuse to answer on the advica
of- counsel.
"Did 'Mr. Harriman say. -that ther<Â»
. would be any result Injurious to your in
terests in case you .refused, to admit him
to share in the ownership?" asked Hushes.

In Government circles at the prospect of

the danger, but it mipht Ue i-ompllcated
by an immediate general strike through
out-the empire. The workmen's ccunci!

elon that It wculd bp unwise to employ
the supreme fighting tool t-xcept to

they decided to reserve ail their. *trength

A period of comparauve calm, lasting a

January strugc^. In a fortnight heavy
snows are likely to put an end to the j
if-isn of j.iilago. arson and murder in the i
couhtr>'. and the lull will give the Gov
i-rnnunt a chap.cc to accomplish some
iÂ«Â»>S tar.elble und the sober-minded an
orpcrtunity to reflect. The latter, how
<-.*r, v.ili hardly enter into the equation,
x'he Raijical editors are already organ
izing a movement to defy the new prcs*
law even before it is issued. This law
aboÃshes the censorship In cities, but not
Is. the country. While it Is based on the
principle of the rerponsibility of editors
tK-forÂ« the court*, It includes, besides the
I'.^uai Inhibitions against Jese majeste, pen
alties, lines and imprisonment for incita-
Uonk to strike which threaten the safety
oi the state and which may cause muti
nies- In the army and navy." Such inclta
tions. It Is raid, are Â«Ij*o punishable v.ith
exile. As the oubiiphert! have agreed :o
act together, there certainly will be an
lOLher, struggle.

M. PetrunkcvStth, who is credited with
harboring the ambition to â¢succeed Count
Witte: as Premier, modestly declined ta
tus^est a p:opei- man when questioned
fon the subject, saying that v.as the pre
rogative of the sovereign, but he em
phatically expressed the opinion that a .
rÂ«=a.l Liberal Ministry would instantly
change the situation and rally to its sup
port not only the Zemstvoists. but the
Constitutional Democrats in general and I
the maÂ«s of the orderly disposed
p**opie who have not associated them- â¢
eeives with the socialistic revolutionists. '
'Jlioush many of his colleagues might be
ready to accept or compromise suffrage
on an indirect basis for the country per
**uially. M. Petrunkevitch was of thÂ« opin
ion that the people's hope* were so iixed
in universal, direct and secret suffrage,
that it was doubtful whether the elections
<ould be held under any other system.
lJe;-::dcs, .M.Petrunkevitrh was .skeptical as !
io whether Wiite's government would ac
cept the compromise offered. He believed
like . reactionary influence might refuse :
to so beyond the plan for the extension :

RYAN ON STAND
BLOCKS INQUIRY
Continued From Page 1, Column 7.
;i Cravathâ l give out the same , advice,
;| Mr. Ryan, that you are not required to
j | answer that/question.
' S Ryanâ Same answer.
At the order of Senator Armstrong, the
I last \u25a0. two 'questions were repeated to
Ryan, who again refused to answer, say
[j ing hÂ« did so "on advice of counsel." V
! Hughes then asked: "Did Mr. Harri
, man say to you there would be an Inves
tigation by a committee of the Legisla-
I ture, or that steps would be "taken to
have an investigation by a committee of
{the Legislature of either House of any
I insurance company or insurance-com
panies if you did not permit him to share
in the ownership?"
Cravathâ The same advice..
Ryanâ He did not say that. '-
"Now. did he say that any action on
r the part of the Legislature or any official
'or officer of the ' Government would be
! taken In the. event you refused to accede
i to his request?"
! Cravathâ l advise you not to answer
j that question.
j Ryanâ l refuse to answer on the same
: grounds.
! "Now Mr. Ryan, I think you will be en
! tirely free to say What you said to Mr.
| Harriman," said Hughes,
j Ryanâ Well, I told Mr. Harriman 1
I wanted to be free and did not want any
I partners in the transaction,
j "Did you tell him why?"
! "My principal reason was that I wanted
, to make this trust deed in my own way."
. "Did you tell him that?"
"I did."
j "What did he say to you?
Cravathâ l advise you that you are not
required to answer, Mr. Ryan.
Ryanâ The same answer, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairmanâ Mr. Ryan, the commit
tee does not want you to think that it is
seeking to be onlciqus in the matter.
Ryanâ l know that you
The Chairmanâ lt thinks you performed
a great public service and is only seek
ing to get you to complete that service.
Ryanâ l still feel that I should not be
required to answer.
The Chairman â The committee directs
you to answer the question which is asked
I in regard to what Mr. Harriman said to
you. â¢ Do you ' still refuse?
Ryanâ l still refuse, on advice of coun
i sel. ' \u25a0 '
IN FEAR OF A PAXIC.
In reply to further questions bearing on
this subject, Ryan said the relations be
tween Harriman and himself were quite
strained for several days and that the
! upshot of several interviews' between .flu*
1 two men was that Ryan told Harriman
that he'intended to carry out his original
plan regardless of what he or any one
else might do. Harriman would nave
taken any part of the stock which he
could havo got, said Ryan.
The witness again declined to answer
when he was asked whether Harriman
offered to put any share that he might
get into the trust which was afterward
created by Ryan. Neither Hughes nor
the members cf the committee insisted
any further \u25a0vp f on;answers on this subject,
but' asked !Ryah ; 'about r i6ther l matters.
Later in .the day, however, '" Senator
Armstrong made an announcement that
the committee had determined to trans
mit a certified copy of Ryan's testimony
to District Attorney Jerome with a re
quest that proceedings bo instituted by
him to punish Ryan for refusing to an
swer the questions.
, "This course is rendered necessary,"
said Senator Armstrong. *'by reason of
the fact that the committee has no sum
mary power to punish for contempt while
the Legislature is not in session."
Counsel for Ryan gave out a statement
to-night in which they stated that if the
committee had decided to refer the mat
ter to the District Attorney, there should
be no difficulty in ruling as to whether
or not Ryan Is compelled to answer the
questions.
When Ryan was asked why he paid
nearly $5000 a share that paid only 7 per
cent dividends he replied he did It to
avert liquidation that would cause the
greatest panic this country has ever, seen
if the Equitable Society were forced Into
the hands of a receiver by the situation
prevailing when he bought the stock.
Frightful losses, he said, would have fol
lowed such a receivership, -and his own
large enterprises would have, been seri
ously affected. To take this company out
of the hands in which it was going to
destruction and give it a clean, econom
ical and efficient management, and re
store its prosperity for the benefit of -all
honest interests. Ryan testified, seemed
to him to be worth doing, and that was
one of his reasons for buying control of
the property.
Ryan declared that he regarded as ideal
the plan now in operation by which a
board of trustees votes the stock' he
bought, and that he has promised to make
the trust perpetual and intends to do so.
If. however, the Legislature ' so decides,
he will not object, he said, to the election
of a majority of; the board of directors
by the policy holders direct.

Secretary Taft Eaises ; tlie
Question; of Japanese and
Chinese for the Big Ditch
WASHINGTON, Dec. Â».â ln his report
to tho President, Secretary of War Taft
says, in part: .
At the date of the last reports received from
the military departments (October 15, 1905)
th* actual streng-th of the regular army was
3750 officers and D0,0Â«4 ' unlisted raen.\ Of
these 45,502 are in the United. States and
11.903 in . the Philippine Islands. There has
been a net decrease during the year . of 360.
The preponderance of enlistments In . â¢ the
Western States was undoubtedly due In: part
to the large number of enlistments- in San
Francisco, many of which ' were probably
cases of re-enlistment of former soldiers from
the Philippines : but, even . if . the enlistments
at San Francisco are omitted, the ratio' for :
the Western division Is still higher than the
average, Indicating that this section ot the
country is a fruitful Held for recruiting.
The quartermaster general reports that the
receipts of the transports sailing from San
Francisco, if charged for at the lowest ratea
offered by commercial lines for similar service
would amount to $1,058,374 for passengers and
$C4i,2Sl for freight, a total of 51.705.1535. This
does not include any credit for the transporta
tion of families of officers, soldiers and em
ployes or other persons not entitled to public
transportation payable from an appropriation
of the bnited States Government or. for the
transportation of persons, animals, supplies
and money carried for the Insular Government
of the Philippines. This gratuitous service
durinp the year, based upon the lowest rates
offered for transportation would have amounted
to $ - <7<J,CSS tor passengers and $102,240 for
freight, a total of $478.1)33. â¢
The total expenditures for operation and
maintenance of the transport service, including
wages, repairs, coal.*, supplies, miscellaneous,
shore and all other expenses incident to the
care and maintenance of transports, amounted
for the year to $1, 54.1,031. .
Several pages of Secretary Taft's report
arc devoted to a recital of his differences
with Mr. Wallace, formerly chief engineer
at Panama, who resigned about one year
ago. The report exhaustively describes
the vast work done on the isthmus in the
way of improving sanitary conditions and
collecting exact information. The pay
roll at present amounts to something liko
$000,000 a month end 13,000 laborers are be
i ing employed. This observation is . made
upon the subject of labor:
Nearly all the labor upon the isthmus Is
now negro labor from the West India Islands.
It is very poor. The* question remains to, be
decided whether we . shall attempt to secure
Chinese or Japanese labor. It has been held
by tha Attorney General that the Federal
eight-hour law applies to those employed by
the cannl commission. I was at first disposed
to think, the 'effect 'of the law would be good,
becauss we could have three â¢ shifts every
twenty-four hours. I am assured, however, by
.Air. Stevens and Governor Magoon that Its en
forcement only Interferes with Rood work.
The fact that no white labor can be
found to stand the work In the tropical
sun ought to. remove the question from
the.forum of ordinary . trade union labor
discussion, says the Secretary.
PAYS TRIBUTE
TO MR. BALFOUR
LONDON, Dec. B.â Joseph Chamberlain,
speaking at Oxford to-night, paid a strik
ing tribute .to Mr. Balf our, the retiring
Premier, who, he said, would leave a deep
Impression on the minds of, his friends
throughout the country. He asserted that
nothing had arisen which in the slightest
degree affected hl3 personal or his politi
cal relations with Balf our. Referring to
the new Government, Chamberlain said
the country had now ; passed into the
hands of the home - rulers and "Little
Englanders." Sir Henry Campbell-Ban
nerman, it was hts opinion, intended to
give Ireland home rule by installments on
the hire system. Chamberlain charged
Sir Henry with having made a bargain
with John Redmond along these; lines.
He asked what would be thought, when a
British Premier took his orders from the
enemies of his country and when'he^used
his high position to undermine the con-,
stitution which he was there to support.
Chamberlain then turned to finance
matters, repeating his old arguments and
contending that the suggested tax on
wheat would be practically insignificant
and would be compensated .for in other
ways. , â¢ :
The Times this morning says that Sir
Edward Gray will probably become Sec
retary for Foreign Affairs in : the-Camp
bell-Bannerman. Cabinet, while all the
Liberal Imperialists except Lord Rosebery
will hold important offices. The Times be
lieves that Sir Robert Threshie} Reid.' will

MITCHELL OVER.
Aged Oregon tan Dies

Hospital.
Death Saves Him
From Disgrace of
Prison Cell.
Portland, bee 8. â united states
Senator John Mitchell died at the Good
Samaritan Hospital in this <ity at
11:40 o'clock this forenoon, death re
sulting from complications which fol
lowed the removal of four teeth at a
dental oJEre yesterday morning:. A
hÂ»morrhsgÂ« of unusual severity fol
lowed the removal of the teeth and
despite the application of the most
powerful methods known to dental
science the flow- of blood could not be
stayed. Physii-ians wore summoned to
the dental office, but the combined
scientific knowledge of the dentists
and physicians could not stop the flow
of blood. The Senator's condition soon
became alarming and it v.':Â»s . deter
mined to remove him to the hospital.
When the Senator reached the hos
pital hf waf in a very weakened con
dition and it became apparent that
unless the flow- of blood was" soon
stopped iife would pass out.
Senator Mitchell had lons beer. a
Fult'erer from diabetes and other viti
ating: diseases and in his weakened
physical condition rapidly succumbed
to ~.hf Inevitable weakness following 1
such violent hemorrhages and lapsed
into a state of semi-consciousness
iar!y In the evening:.
Four physicians â Dr. A. J. Giesy, Dr.
Georgre F. Wilson, Dr. Kmil Pohl and
Dr. Jjinfs O. C Wirey â 'worked over
the Senator and art a late hour last
night temporarily stopped the hem
orrliagre, bet trie relief was of but short
duration and again the blood began to
flow Intermittently* continuing during
the evening and through the night. At
an early hour this morning a severe
vomiting spÂ»ll further weakened the
Senator ar.d it became more and more
apparent that the end was approaching.
All during the night saline solution
tv-is ifije<-ted into the veins to furnish
more fluid for the circulatory system
and to stimulate the sluggish circula
tion.
The diabetic coma . into which the
Senator lapsed became more and more
pronounced, despite the frequent use of
powerful stimulants and only occa
sional evidences of returning vitality
rewarded the untiring efforts of the
physicians and nurses in attendance.
Several hours before death the injec
tion of saline solution was discon
tinued and more powerful heart stimu
lants resorted to. but- with' no effect
on the rapidly sinking man.
After daylight the Senator's condi
tion grew worse and pronounced indi
cations of mortification became evi
dent, especially in the ankles, knees
and hips. S~vÂ«^ral hours before death
ihf action of the hÂ»-art at times be
came almost imperceptible and the
breath came in short spasmodic gasps.
As the end approached the symptoms
became mojv^_und more pronounced,
death ensuing at 11:40 o'clock.
At Senator Mitchell's bedside when
lie passed away were his son-in-law,
Judg^ W. O. Chapman of Tacoma,
Wash., and J. H. Price, nephew; Mrs.
Lottie Price, niece. and Mrs. May
Barth. niece, all of this city. Several
friends of Senator Mitchell had left the
bedside shortly before death came.
John Hippie Mitchell was a Far West
man. He left his native State, Penn
sylvania, where he was born (Wash
ington County, June 22, 1fe38,), in IS6O
and came to the P;ieifit Coast. He
spent pome time in California, first at
fcan Luis Obispo and then in San Fran
e!*eo. practicing law. and later moved
to Portland, Or., where he continued to
practice his profession.
He had received a fair education in
the public schools of his native county
and at the hands of a private tutor, and
ai the early age of 15 had begun the
etudy of law. By the time he was 20
he had made a name for himself as
one well read and well versed in legal
literature.
Though yet a young man he took a
very prominent place in his new home.
Oregon,* and in the stirring times of
JS6O-61 was a large factor in frustrat
ing the plans for a "Pacific Coast re
public" and turning Oregon to the
Union side.
In 1861 he was elected Corporation
Attorney of Portland and served one
year. Then he was elected on the Re
publican ticket to the State Senate and
served four years, the last two of
which as the presiding officer of that
body. In 1565 he was commissioned by
the Governor as lieutenant colonel of
the State militia.
In 1&66 he was short in the party
caucus but one vote for the United
States Senatorship. He was soon after
chosen professor of medical jurls-

STATEHOOD BILL
MAY BE PASSED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.â A compromise
is being arranged by which statehood
legislation will be accomplished at an
early date' and ,w!thout a protracted dis
cussion. The Republican leaders of the
Senate who have heretofore been success
ful in preventing, the passage of the
statehood bilk have agreed to permit the
adoption of c\ -enabling act for Arizona
and New Mexico as one State," provided
the people of each Territory vote on the
question separately. A. definite reply to
this proposition has not been given by the
advocates of single statehood, but it is
understood they will * acceptr~
â¢ The only drawback to the suggestion
I lies in the time and manner of voting.
The Senate leaders desire to have
! vdte taken in each Territory at the same
| time that a constitution is adopted and
State officers chosen. This is sallsfac
: tory to the people of New Mexico, but is
opposed by those of Arizona. . At present
It Is estimated that Joint statehood will
be overwhelmingly rejected In Arizona.
It Is argued that If the question Is de
cided at the same time as the State offi
cers . are elected, personal campaigns
waged by candidates and those interested
In the election to the United States Ben-,
ate would overcome this opposition and
the result would be the acceptance of
Joint statehood with New Mexico.
The single State advocates are" willing
to - accept the plan outlined by ; the Re-^

have a separate vote on the question of
acceptance. It Is now virtually certain
that If this cannot be secured the origi

means that Arizona ', and New/ Mexico
will be admitted as one State and Okla

COLLINS'
DEFENSE IS
OUTLINED
Attorney Charged With Per
jury Spends Three Hours
in Opening Statement to
Jury and Tells His Story
WOMEX PRO3IINENT .
IX THE COURTROOM
Fair^Sex Listens Attentive
ly to Defendants 'First
Connected Account of His
Relations With Newmans
In the courtroom presided over by Judge
Lennon, filled with spectators, two-thirds
of whom were women, alternately ad
dressing his remarks to the jury and the
Judge, George D. Collins for. over three
hours yesterday outlined the plan of his
defense. For the first . time he' Co!d a
connected story of his relations with the
Newman family from the time he first
met them until the cfcse of the prosecu
tion's last witness.
The statement of the defendant attor
ney occupied both morning and afternoon
sessions, and indicates a general denial of
the points In the charge against him, a
stronger denial of the testimony so far
elicited and an attack along technical
lines upon the answer on which â¢ the
charge of perjury is based. Collins, in
short, asserts that the signature to his
answer was not witnessed by a notary
public, and that the answer was filed
without his consent, Â« thus ending the
charge of perjury against him.
During Collins' passionate address the
twelve jurors, probably^ the most intelli
gent that ever sat in, Department No. ~,
followed every move of the defendant
with searching eyes and gave him undi
vided attention. Collins, with the knowl
edge that he is fighting for his freedom,
and for the woman he has lately mar
ried, used argument, eloquence and every
art at his command in unfolding the
plausible story of the wrong either done
by or against him.
"intensely .interested, the women in the
courtroom and. those connected .with the
case listened breathlessly to every word
of the accused man. Clarice McCurdy
Collins, daintily gowned, sat beside her
husband's attorneys flunng the after
noon. Charlotta Newman Collins sat be
side her sister, .Florence, at the prosecu
tion's table.^ Both were dressed in black.
Clarice Collins sat with downcast eyes,
while Florence and Charlotta frequently
exchanged looks and comments, and
Charlotta shook her head negatively sev
eral times as Collins made some startling
assertion. ' -.
WOMEN IN COUIIT.
The women in the courtroom appeared
of the better class, ajid their bright
dresses gave color to thefotherwise formal
"^cene. . Many \ prominent men occupied
the benches, including lawyers and at
taches at the City Hall. Judge E. B. llar
tinelli of San Rafael sat .within the rail
ing, while among the spectators were ex-
Senator Frank French and the- recently !
acquitted Julio "Uriburi.
Collins began his statement in the morn
ing, after. Dr. Nathan Rogers had testi
fied regarding his signing of the death
certificates. The witness said he signed
the certificate of Agnes Collins on the
authority of Collins, jvho said that she
was the wife of hie brother, who was
then at sea. lie explained the signature
on the child's certificate by saying that
he glanced at the top. saw the name Col
lins and then signed the certificate.
In opening his statement Collins moved
that the trial be postponed to December
25. t0 enable him to call upon Father M.
D. Conolly, who performed the marriage
ceremony. The motion was overruled, and
Collins began "his outline of defense.
The defendant said he first met the
Newman family when he was 17, and be
came: interested in the struggle of Agnes
Collins, who was supporting the family.
He said the defendant aided the girl as
much as within his power while then a
law student, and in the early part of 1889
he married her. This marriage was evi
denced by a legal contract and Agnes
Newman .became his wife. The document
was witnessed 'by a Dr. Huston; and his
daughter, Jenny, and given into Agnes'
custody. Agnes was interested especially
In Charlotta, and asked the defendant to
prcvlde for her, which was done.
THE DISPUTED MARRIAGE.
Agnes then asked the defendant for a
religious marriage and he acceded to the
request. Together with a friend . and
client the defendant asserted he visited
the marriage license office and: there
signed blank records', as he was in a
hurry, and left his friend, James Mul
cahey, data with which to fill the blanks.
Through some error "Charlptta" was the
name inscribed as the wife and "Agnes'*
as the witness. This mistake, claimed
the defendant, was g-epeated in the mar
riage certificate. â¢_.
Collins will ' try to prove he took the
certificate from Mulcahey. without looking
at It, told Agnes to make arrangements
for the religious marriage, and appeared
with her the next day before Father
Conolly. In the church, he says, he of
fered *the license to the priest, who told
him to bring it to him after the cere
mony. This ceremony, he solemnly as
serted made Agnes his . wife in the eyes
of the church. .
â¢After the ceremony the news was pub
lished that Collins had married Charlotta
Newman and Agnes requested the de
fendant to investigate, j He visited the
church, and . in the absence of Father
Conolly saw the j assistant and together
they found the marriage certificate,
wfiiGh.on its face bore the names of
Charlotta , Newman and, George D.- Col
lins. The paper, was without Indorse
ment' on the back, : and to enable' it: to
be found on Father Conolly's return, Col
lins said he indorsed the; names that ap
peared on the face of the document. '
Collins alleged \u25a0he made several \ at
tempts, to -have the error corrected and
added that the law was not complied
with, In that the document was
with the Recorder more than thirty days
after the ceremony. The defendant : said
he made several visits to the^ Recorder's
office after May ; 15, 1889, .when the cere
mony was performed;: and 'the: document
was not recorded until /January ;25, 1890.
DEPLORES ; FILTH ; IN' CASE. -
Collins then denied that he. ever Intro
duced ? Charlotta as his wife,' and main
tained r that' he ; had '; always publicly pre r
sented Agnes as his. wife. He^ said i that
on every occasion of the, birth 'of; a- child

IS FORFEIT
FOR CRIME
3lrs. Rogers Pays the Death
Penalty in the Vermont
State Penitentiary for the
Murder of Her Husband
GOVERNOK REFUSES
TO (H* ANT REPRIEVE
Woman Faces the End With
the Same Stoical Indiffer
ence That Marked Her
Demeanor Since Her Arrest
"WINDSOR, Vt.. Dec. SJâWithout a
tremor and without a word Mrs. Mary
Mabel Rogers to-day inarched to her
death on th* sallows at the State Prison
here and paid the. penalty of the mur
dering of her husband, Marcus Rogers,
at Bennington on August "13, 1902. To
all appearances Mrs. Rogers was- the
calmest person in , the- chamber, of
death. She tacexi her end with the same,
â¢Stoical indifference that has marked
her demeanor ever since her arrest,
more than three years ago. . ,
Greutly to the relief of those offi
cials ivho were assisting in executing
the sentence of the law. Mary Rogers'
last hour was remarkably-free from
harrowing incidents.' If had been feared
that the woman's wonderful nerve
would desert her at the final moment
and that she would be carried to * the
scaffold in a state of collapse. Intslead,
however, Mrs. Rogers met death
bravely.
There were no sensational incidents
In. connection with the hanging. 'The
woman's neck was broken at the sec
ond cervical vertebrae, and ..she lost
consciousness' Instantly the drop fell.
A* few feeble, convulsive movements of
her pinioned hands were the. only evi
dences that vitality had survived the
first shock.
The drop fell at 1:13 p. m, and , Mrs.
Rogers was pronounced dead by the at
tendant physician at 1:27Â»i. The wo
man's feet barely, touched the floor for
an instant, but the deputies on the
platform of the scaffold immediately
tightened the rope,and raised the un
conscious form a couple of inches.
MOTHER WILL BURY BODY.
An hour after death was pronounced
the body wasjjiken from the prison [to
the railroad station and the coffin was
placed on board the 2:65 train and sent
to Hooslc Falls, X. V., where Mrs. Rog
ers' mother lives. Interment.will be at
HI. Mary's Cemetery in that town. .-\u25a0
Although Mrs. liogers remained calm
until the end. she ate nothing to-day.
Prison Matron Durkee prepared break-,
fast and carried jt to Mrs. Rogers' cell,
but the prisoner declined it.
}: At noon another meal was sent to
iAlrs. Rogers^:ami again -she refused to
'eat: 1; â¢'\u25a0 \u25a0 : ***" -\u25a0 ":.' â¢' . --;. v
Since the death-watch was estab
lished about ;ten days ago Mrs. Rogers
had eaten heartily until to-day and
had slept soundly. Last night she re
tired at 11 o'clock and awoke - this
morning at's.
During the last few days Mrs. Rogers
spent a great deal of time in crochet-,
ing tokens for; relatives, and friends.
Every night her crochet hooks were
taken from her for fear that she might
do herself some injury, but were re
turned the next morning. She read the
Bible a great deal and received a num
ber of calls from clergymen.
Up to within three hours of her death
Mrs. Rogers consoled .herself with the
hope that she-would not'be executed.
It was shortly after 10 o'clock' this
morning when she was informed that
Governor' Bell had denied her a. third
reprieve.
TAKES LIFE OF HUSBAND.
* The crime for which Mrs. Rogers suf
fered the death penalty was the mur
der of her'husband. Marcus Rogers, at
Bennington on August 13, 1902. At the
time the" crime was committed Mrs.
Rogers was only 19 years old. She had
been separated from her husband for
some time and was desirous of-marry
.ing a. young man.- named Maurice
.Knapp. On the day of the murder Mar
cus Rogers went to Bennington to visit
his wife and that night she arranged
to meet him In the woods near the
Walloomsac River. While' caressing
him she induced him to allow her to
bind his hands and while he was
powerless she chloroformed him. In
this she was aided by Leon Perham, a
half-witted boy, who, was the son of
the woman with whom she boarded.
Another woman, Estella Bates, was
present.. -Â« , ' '\u25a0
After chloroformingÃogers Perham
and Mrs. Rogers rolled the body into
the river, where it'was found the next
day. In order to divert;suspicion the
woman- wrote, a. note, to which she
signed her husband's name, giving, the
Impression that he had committed sul-"
cide. -
-Immediately after, the murder, Mrs.
Rogers endeavored to collect her hus
band's:^ life Insurance, amounting \u25a0to .
$500, and'- also made (arrangements to

HISS AND JEER
IN CONFERENCE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Dec. B.â Hisses, catcalls,
hoots and jeers marked an unusual scene
at the immigration conference being held
under the . auspices of the Civic Federa
tion J| in * the Concert Hall of Madison
Square garden thl* afternoon. Yx'alter
Macartltar of California, secretary of the
Chinese and Japanese Exclusion Society,
was the ' object of the displeasure shown
by sixty or more delegates from all part*
*of the Union, and his speech was tem
porarily cut short by a remarkable out
burst of feeling against him. He had
arisen to debate on the Chinese exclusion,
question, following a speech made in
favor of the modification of the law gtven
by Ng Poon Chu, a Chinese editor of San
Francisco.
"Mr. Ng." said llacarthur, "Is a
wealthy man. He hasn't been " here
twenty-flve years for nothing. He travels
around the country at large expense,
while the American editor* on the coast
have to push a pencil to make '*
That was as far as Macarthur got. Mr.
Ng had made himself a favorite with
those present by his speech and they
grew angry. The noi3e which followed
drowned Macarthur's voice, and when thÂ»
Jeering died away the speaker, flushed
with embarrassment, hesitatingly con
tinued on a new line of discussion. He
spoke only a short time longer, however,
as the demonstration he had aroused
evidently had discomfited him greatly.
All the speakers with the exception of
Mr. Ng were against any modification
of the exclusion act. A committee
appointed yesterday then brought In a
set of resolutions. They Indorsed that

ADOPT A KESOLUTION
Delegates Voice Sentiment
on Proposed Agricultural
School and Then Adjourn
SANTA ROSA, Dec. 8. â This morn
ing's session of the State Fruit Grow
ers' convention was devoted to the.
consideration of California's viticul
tural interests. Andrea Sbarboro, the
San Francisco banker and secretary ot
the Swiss-Italian Colony, whose Im
mense vineyards are located at Asti in
this county, spoke at length on vine
yards and wines. He said in part:
At the present time the great wine producing
countries of the world are France, Italy and
Spain, -where this healthy beverage is not
considered a luxury but an actual necessity,
both for the poor and for the rich. What I
most desire to Impress you with is the fact
that ln these countrlc-s where all men, women
and children use wine at their meals intoxi
cation is a<most unknown. In the countries
where wine is not produced, especially ln Eng
land and the United States, the curse of
drunkenness prevails to an enormous extent
and causes these Anglo-American people more
misery than any other evils which exist in
these countries. '
It \u25a0 1* only, a few years since it was discov
ered that the Vita Vinefera, tho trua wine
Krape. would grow in the United States, but
only in the State of California. Here it thrives
Just the same as the grape grown ln France,
Italy and the Rhine. . .
To make viticulture successful in Califor
nia, two things are required. First, we must
make as good a wine at is made in any other
part of the world. Second, we must find a
market for oiir wines.
The first point we have reached. "When wine
makin? was first commenced ln California all
kinds of people went into the wine-making
business. They learned how to make wine
"by the book," and thus generally made mis
erable failures. The first wine made, there
fore, gave California a black eye. The science
of wine mnklnsr cannot be learned "by the
book." It is only by long- study and years of
actual practice that the wine-makers can learn
to turn out a really good wine. . However, we
have now passed the experimental stage. The
Incompetent wine-makers have gradually gone
by the board and the industry now is prin
cipally in the hands of experienced people, who
have made this Industry a life- long study both
in Europe and California. The secret of good
wine-making does not consist in only properly
fermenting a certain quality of grape, but
many different varieties of grapa must be
fermented separately, and after the first year
the wine made by these different qualities of
grapes must be blended In a proper proportion
to make the wine required by the trade, but in
order to produce the real fine wine of delicate
flavor and brilliancy, long time Is required.
Some have said that California wine does
not Improve with age. This is a great fallacy.
When it is properly made and properly rsreked
from one tank to another, in order to remove
the sediment. California wine acquires the
same noft dPlicate flavor, the same bouquet
that is found in the rare fine old wines of
France. Italy and Spain.
To educate the American people to the use
of wine at their table is the great problem ber
fore us. The solution of this great problem
would remove the curse of drunkenness from
the people of our country, a blessing devoutly
to be wished for. Now, what is the cause
of drunkenness? It Is a very simple question
to answer.- Â»It is the Immoderate use of whis
ky and strong alcoholic beverages. Wherever
wine 'is not generally produced like in Holland,
Russia, England and the United States,
drunkenness largely prevails, while ln the
countries where grapes are produced and wines
are made In large quantities, such as France,
Italy and Spain, and where all the people use
wine at their meals; ' consuming - twenty-five
gallons per annum per capita, intoxication is
practically unknown. Now. therefore, here we
have the practical solution for the removal of
the cutse of drunkenness ln the United States,
because California can produce enough wine to
supply the American people with twenty-five
gallons of wine per capita and of as good a
quality as is produced in Europe, and thus be
come one of the great wine producing countries
of the world. We have a practical proof of
tho correctness of this assertion by the fact
that the State of California consumes more
than two-thirds of the wine which Is used in
all the States in he Union, and here we find
lees drunkenness than in any other State in
the Union.

way, a prominent shipper of Dry
Creek Valley, also spoke, and George
B. Baer, Postmaster, of Cloverdale and
an orange grower of that section, read
an interesting paper on the citrus
products of Sonoma County. " The last
paper of the morning session was by
H. B. Rawley. A number of resolu
tions were adopted, among them being
one petitioning Secretary of Agricul
ture "Wilson to extend the investiga
tion of the fungoid disease and urg
ing California representatives in Con
gress to support all reasonable mea
sures looking to an increase of the
funds for the use of the Agricultural
Department In order that more extend
ed Investigations may be made in mat
ters affecting the Interests of the fruit
growers of the country.
After one of the most successful
gatherings in the history of the or
ganization the convention came to a
close this afternoon. One of the most
spirited discussions of the week was
brought on by the action of the com
mittee on resolutions in recommending
the adoption of resolutions condemn
ing the idea of locating the proposed
State Agricultural Farm at some point
near the State University. The reso
lution reads as follows:
Whereas. The State Legislature at the last
session passed a bill appropriating $150,000 for
the purchase and equipment of a State, farm
to be under the jurisdiction of the Board ot
Regents of the State University;' and
Whereas, Efforts are being- made to locate
the farm close to Berkeley and make of it a
laboratory venture; and '
Whereas. Such a plan is opposed to the in
tent? of the farmers* - bill and wishes of the
horticultural interests of the State; therefore
be it **\u25a0â¢ / ' \u25a0 .-. \u25a0-\u25a0-.-\u25a0
Resolved, That we declare it the sense of
thlÂ» convention that the farm should be located
away from Berkeley and conducted in a man- j
ncr that will enable the horticultural Interests
of the State to obtain practical benefits.
Judge Carroll Cook of San Francisco,
who has ;been in attendance at the
convention all week and who has a
farm near Glen, Ellen, spoke strongly
in favor of the resolution. Edward
Burwick of Monterey opposed it. Other
speakers followed, but the resolution
went through with a rush.

GREAT INTEREST
IN BOND ISSUE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. B.â As was expected,
the attendance at the mass meeting held
at Turn Vereln Hall to-night to discuss
the forthcoming bond election was large
and the interest was g plainly mali^ est.
Every reference to the bond Issue was
the occasion for loud applause and it
needed but a hint from the speakers to
arouse the liveliest- enthusiasm. The
meeting was called at the instance of tbe
Alum' Rock Park bond commlttea of
Five Hundred and Its purpose was to en
lighten the Dublic at large as to the va
rious improvements i contemplated in the
bond issue of $355,000. t0 be voted on next
Tuesday.
J. O. Hayes presided at the meeting and
stirred the audience by his vigorous in
dorsement of the bond proposition. He
declared that there was just one thing
which he . regretted and that was . that
more public improvements could not be
included In the present bond issue. Joseph
D. Radford, president of the First Na
tional Bank, declared that the I extension
of the sewer system, the Improvement of
the public schools and fire houses and
all the other measures contemplated ln
the bond election were necessities save
the bond Issue of $100,000 for the improve
ment of Alum Rock. . This was ln the na
ture of a luxury, but ' It would mean an
additional tax of but two-thirds of 1 per
cent and this should be willingly borne.
Dr. William Simpson, the county Heallh
Officer, pointed out. the hygienic require
ments of the city with reference to sew
ers-and urged that every citizen should
support the present movement to improve
and extend the service to every section.

OFFICERS RAID
GAMBLING DENS
PDTALUMA, Dec. B.â Deputy Sheriffs
Gilliam and Boswell of Santa Rosa cre
ated a great stir in Petaluma this after
noon when they made a systematic raid
on all the cigar stores and saloons, gath
ering in a full wagon load of plunder and
making wholesale arrests. The raid was
directed against the slot machines, which
were recently reinstalled, but the pool
rooms also suffered, and roulette and
crap tables and other gamblers' para
phernalia were confiscated.
A few weeks ago a gambling device, al
leged to be protected by patent, was in
stalled here and allowed to run unmo
lested. This made the owners of card
machines jealous, and so they brought
out the machines laid away some months
ago. Among those arrested are City
Trustee E. A. Husler, J. Lopus. Ed
Gardner, F. Ward. AY. D. Ayers. E. P.
Oonway, C. "Williams and others, about
twenty in all.
The owners of the machines have held a
caucus and. retained Gil P. Hall as coun
sel, and will fight the case. "If we must
lose our machines," said Trustee Husler,
"all gambling- must stop.' even poolselling
at the Kenilworth Park races next
spring."

HIS "DASH OF HIGH LIFE"
COSTS BED-MAEER DEARLY
Spends a 3lontli's Salary
and Is' Arrested for De
frauding a Jehu.
Fired to Emulation by the
Stories -Told Him by
Hotel Guests.
| When His Money Is Gone He
Remembers His Unpaid
Hack Fare.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
With a cash capital of fSO, one
j month's wage, earned by him as cham-
I berman in a hotel at Turk and Taylor
â¢ streets, William Summerlee buoyantly
\u25a0 went forth to gratify a long-nurtured
i desire to purchase what, in the par
j lance of the Tenderloin, Is termed "a
I dash of high life." When he was ar
1 rested at California and Kearny streets
ion the charge of defrauding a hack
i driver, he was both penniless and in-
I toxlcated. As the jehu failed to ap
i pear in department No. 1 of the Police
i Court and press home his accusation,
â¢ Judge Mogan continued the hearing
! until this morning and ordered that
' the complainant be compelled to at
! tend.
Enough testimony was adduced,
however, to satisfy the court that Mr.
Summerlee was to some extent a vic
tim of example and environment. In
his vocation of bedmaker It was his
duty to oust from their respective
rooms such guests as were exceeding
the quota of slumber to which they
were entitled, and among these he en-
i countered quite a number of gentle
j men whose reluctance to shake off the
I drowsy god's influence was caused by
i the combined lateness of the hour at
j which they had retired and the so
] porific effect of the stimulants which
i they had imbibed while "taking a dash
!of high life." It was the recountal of
I their nocturnal experiences, although
j incoherently delivered, and In some
I cases thickly Interlarded with expres
â¢ eions of penitence, that flred Mr. Sum
j merlee with yearning to emulate. :He
I asked one unrepentant late riser, who
i had arrived in an automobile at the
hotel, how much the "dash" had cost
him, aside from his headache, and the
reply quoted a pecuniary figure great
er than the querist's salary for a year
amounted to.
"But," said the recent dasher, apply
ing a freshly saturated towel to his
brow, "you can cut out the chug chug
wagon and still have a good tiir\Â£. A
hack can give you a gay run for your
money."
That was how Mr. Summerlee came

THE SAN-IfRANCISCO GALL;; SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1905.
. Senor Lopez was as -hear to the ideal
I "bum" as anything that had ever come j
i within their observation. - !
j The swart countenance of Senor Lopez
i was framed in a soiled towel, tied under
his chin, and his bushy black hair pro
truded in a wisp from each side of the
bandage.
"Why do'eshe wear that thing?" the
| Judge Inquired.
"He had it on when we arrested him,"
Patrolman Evett replied, "and he
wouldn't take it off. He was sleeping 1
under a rose bush in the front yard of
a swell residence on A' an Xess avenue
and the servant girls who notified us .he
was there were awfully scared. He lay
upon a big doormat and an old potato
sack^as spread over him."
Senor Lopez denied he was a vagrant â
unless a tourist en passant could be so
classified. He was en route from his
native state of Sonora to visit relatives in
Northern California, and slept under the
ro?e bush because in the land of his
birth it was no offense to slumber out-o'
doors, indeed a majority of the inhabi
tants would rather slumber there than
under a roof. The bandage oTI his) head?
Ah, yes. He wore it to prevent his ears
from invasion by predatory insects while
he slept. The doormat and the sack
cloth counterpane he had brought from j
Los Angeles, and he did not steal them.
. He had just arrived in San Francisco
when the so-vigilant police arrested him.
"We had been after him a couple of
weeks," put in the policeman, "and all
the servant girls in that nefghborhod
were afraid to go out at night, lest they
might stumble over him-"
"Ah, heaven, how untrue." sighed Senor
Lopez.
"Thirty days," said the Judge."

Patrolman Kramer and when she ap
peared before Judge Fritz the bridge of
her nasal organ was bruised and crim

"She was sitting upon a sidewalk at
Stockton and Pacific streets," the ofHcer
averred, "and when I; requested her to
rise and walk she tried to do so, but
failed. Then I caught a whiff of her
breath and realized she was helplessly
intoxicated."
"What you smelled," said Miss Udell,
with a show of asperity, "was Jamaica
ginger, which my doctor prescribed for
a cold in the head. And you found me
sitting upon the sidewalk because I
had just been tripped up by a loose
spike. If the sidewalk had been prop
erly nailed down I wouldn't a-toppled
over."-;/..-,;.
"It was a concrete eidewalk, your

It having been proved that Charles
Laramis, from Australia, was not the
person who had rifled private mail
boxes In the vicinity of Bush and

APPROPRIATIONS
WILL BE HEAVY
Over Eight Hundred Million
Called For in Estimates
Placed Before Congress
MOKE THAN LAST i YEAR
Navy and the Postoffice De
partments Show Largest
Increases in Their Figures
WASHINGTON.; Dec. \u25a0â¢: S.â A statement
was issued .by .â¢\u25a0the,-.- appropriation's com
mittees of the Senate- and House" to-day
summarizing the estimates for.appropria
tions to.be made at .the present session
of Congress for the" fiscal year. 1307. The
total for all purposes 'aggregates ' $803,
23C,-ils. | These estimates are greater than
the appropriations - for the current year
by $19,170>155. The War Department asks
$863,463 less than was appropriated last
year, and , the river and harbor item,
which last year amounted to $78,181,875, Is
omitted entirely this year. With these ex
ceptions every department of the Govern
ment has asked for more money than
the current appropriation. The two
largest increases are asked by the navy,
521.229.035, and the Postoffice Department,
$12,187,976.
The emergency bill, appropriating $11.
000,000 for immediate use in the construc
tion of the Panama canal, will be taken
up by the Senate on Monday. -The discus
sion of the measure probably will occupy
three or four days following the lines of
the debate which occurred in the House.
It is expected that the Senate. will amend
the bill to restore the $5,500,000 cut out
by the House, thus making a total ap
propriation of $16,600,000. f.
The Democratic Senators held a con- i
ference to-day, at which they authorized"
the Democratic steering committee to act j
for them in the matter of filling minor
vacancies on the-Senate committees. Sen
ator Teller was designated as a member
of the steering committee to fill the va
cancy caused by the retirement of Sena
tor Cockrell. Senator Gorman was re
elected chairman of the Democratic cau
cus, Senator Blackburn 'vice chairman
and Senator Carmack secretary. There
was some discussion of a rumor that
the Republicans would seek to reduce the
Democratic representation on committees,
but it was stated that Republican mem
bers on the Committee on Rules had
given assurance to the contrary.

ACTION URGED

Hitchcock Suggests That the
Acceptance of the Park Be
Made Positive by Congress
TELLS OF LAND FKAUDS
Proposes Legislation .Which*
He - Hopes Will Help to
Check Evil in tie ' West
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.â ln his annual
report Secretary Hitchcock of the Inte
rior Department devotes much space to
the^land fraud cases. In recommending
legislation to check the evil, he says:
Ho statement that I could make would give
the. ; reader a complete conception of the re
sponsibility and labor Involved or o" the <les
: peration and fertility o*. resource of the forces
! trith which we have had to contend. Kever
i tbeUss, much has been done, bat much ro
| mains to be done. \Y*hat ~ has been accom
plished, however, . will . go â¢ for naught unless
\u25a0 CongTees by . appropriate legislation prevents
the recurrence of the offenses that hare bsen
unearthed".
One of the most conspicuous facts that has
been developed by the so-called land fraud
investigations - Is that the timber and stone
act, the desert land act and the commutation
clause of - the homestead law are the oon-
I venlent handmaidens of crime; that they have
! afforded the most effective means for the con
; eplrators with whom we have had to deal to
.fraudulently transfer - the title of the public
domain from the Government to themselves,
and unless they i are repealed or materially
modified or amended, > substantially as hereto
fore repeatedly recommended in my annual re
ports - and by the Public Lands Commission,
they will continue to constitute the most dan
gerous menace to the Integrity of the public
domain.
Attention is also called to the fact that
among those indicted for various- offenses
against the public land laws are the names
of persons who were employes of the Govern
ment, come In high places, others in places
not so exalted.
Executive officers are of necessity very
largely dependent upon the indorsera of appli
cants for public place in determining the fitness
of eiuch applicants for the positions sought. If !
such indorsers will look more carefully Into
the character, reputation and fitness of the
applicants whom they recommend, disregarding
all other considerations, protection in a larger
measure against this class of offenders will be
obtained.
The ' Secretary suggests that the office
of Receiver of | Public Moneys, at each
Lg.nd Office in the country be abolished.
The result will be the saving of 5230.000
.annually to the - Government.
The report. treats the Yosemite Park in
detail. Referring to the transfer of the
valley to the nation by the State of Cali
fornia, Secretary Hitchcock says:
. I cannot too ' strongly urge upon CongreM i
the Importance of at once adopting measures
which will eet at rest any question a: to the
purpose of the United States to accept the
retrocession Iby the State of California of tie
Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree
Grove and thus preserve the entire country
embraced In these parks "for public use. resort
and recreation forever."
It is further recommended that for admin
istrative purposes "In tha management of the
Marlpcsa Big Tree Grove a parcel of land cf
approximately one mile In length and two
\u25a0 miles in. width, immediately south QT the Yo
\u25a0 semlte National Park and abutting the Big
Tree Grove on the north, be included wltl .n
the metes and bounds of the Yosemite National
Park and made a part thereof. ,

Three months ago Cliic-f Hodgkins
was accused by a "Dr." L. M. Harri
son, a West Oakland inidwile, of ac
cepting a bribe- of $100(1 Iron; her in
return for otficial favors when she was
arrested under suspicion of causing;
Mrs. Jennie lliroth'B death. The Com
nii.ssioÂ«ers invited Mrs. Harrison to
substantiate licr accusations, and set
a time for hearing, at whk-h the wo
man agrt-ed to be present, ahe did not
appear, and made no explanations. The
board exonerated the Chief. At that
; time the story was current that he
would be retired. But no move wa*j
made. It was said that Mayor Mott
was willing: to accept Hodgkins' resig
nation, that Commissioner Turner was
favorable- to the CJiitf, and that Com
missioner ftlcElroy was neutral, wait
ing for a move el&ewftere. Hodgkins
insisted he was in a false position, and
would not resign while any suspicion
attached to him. He was then in poor
health, and for months has been under
the constant attention of Dr. William
S. Porter.

But the clouds have blown away
now and with his physical condition
pressing upon him the Chief thinks he
can with good grace ask for rejief
from his duties. Yesterday was the
twentieth anniversary of Chief Hodg
kins" service in the Oakland Police De
partment. He began as a special po
liceman under Chief W. R. Thomas,
was advanced to the regular force un
der Chief Peter Pumyea after two or
three years. He served as clerk and
court bailiff under Chief of Police
John W. Tompkins; was promoted to
sergeant by Chier Louis Schaffer; be
came a detective by recommendation
of Chief C. E. Lloyd, and served also
in that department under Chief W. F.
Fletcher, whom he succeeded when
Fletcher was retired. Hodgkins was
appointed Chief June 7. IS9B. He has
occupied that post under the adminls-'
trations of Mayors Snow, Barstow, Ol
ney and Mott. a record never before
equaled In the Police Department.

Among his' largest pieces of work
was- the breaking up- and' arrests of
the:"fcsig Foot" Gordon-Root gold brick
gang, which operated with Oakland as
headquarters and cleaned up more
than $125,600. Hodgkins also: sent to
prison the gang- of thugs headed by
Tommy Fonte, who murdered Thomas,
a West Oakland saloon man; shot Rob
ert Vincent, a butcher; robbed the Ala
meda and the Grove-street power
houses and a dozen places of business
in Oakland. In the gang were Scott,
McCoy,. James Downing and "Red"
Lynch. Hodgkins is accounted one of
the cleverest police detectives on the
Pacific Coast. One of his strong points
Is "sweating" of prisoners, a process.
which enabled him to work success
fully the Fonte case. Three years ago, j
while arresting a gang of tramp burg
lare at the foot of Madison street,.'
Hodgkins ' was injured by Jumping
from a roof into the yard where thfc
gang was in hiding. He did not re
cover. In that crowd were Courtney
and "Leadville" JimV who were mem
bers of the gang that killed Police
man Robjns,on in Ban Francisco.
Concerning his resignation, Chief
Hodgkins said to-day: ' j
I have had the cubject in mind for months.
My health i* poor and I have been under In- J
tense physical suffering l<tr a long time. But
bo long as any falee charges were banging over '
me I would not think of arktng the Commls- !

the care of a physician for several
months. But .Â»he stood all of this, she

JAMES NAGLE LOSES
OFFICE OF TRUST
Judge Coffey Removes Him
as Executor of Mrs.
Doyne's Will. '
1 Stubborn to the last, James Nagle. de
clared guilty J of sharp practice as execu
tor of the will of the late Elizabeth
Boyne, refused to resign his trust when
given the j opportunity yesterday, so he
was removed by Judge Coffey. The court,
not wishing that Nagle should rest under
l the odium of adverse judgment, gave him
every opportunity to avoid the same by
resigning. But Nagle wanted no kindness
shown him by the court, wjth the result
that his wish was gratified, and he was
peremptorily removed.
Nagle was? accused, and the accusations,
the court held, were sustained by proof.
It was shown that he entered Into a col
lusive' suit with his brother, Charles G.
Nagle, to enable the stripping of the es
tate on an alloyed unjust claim, and also
that he included in his account as execu
tor a bill for $500 for funeral expenses,
when the undertaker's books show that
he only paid $38S in full settlement of the
bill.
When the judgment of the court was
pronounced against Nagie he asserted
that ho would appeal from it, "because,"
he said, *'he had done nothing that could
be deemed wrong by any man."

DEATH MYSTERY
IS NOT SOLVED
Police Search in Vain for
Clews to Clear Up 'the
Latest Oakland Puzzle
HAT AND GUN MISSING
Detectives Begin to .Accept
Theory That Man's Wounds
Were Not Self - Inflicted
[ OAKL.AXD. Dec. $.â More than twen
j.ty-four hours have . elapsed since the
; body of an unidentified man. who .-had
been killed by a gunshot wound in the
head/was found on the rocks of the
"broad gauge, mole, but the police ixrt*
no nearer v solution of the mystery
than â¢â¢they, were when the body was
found. All to-day the detectives have
divided their time between trying to
establish the man's identity ana rind
ing his hat and the 3:2-caliber pistol
with which his life was brought to a
close.
* Slowly the police, who at first ad
vanced', the -theory of suicide, are ac
cepting the theory of Dr. O. D. Hatn
lin, the autopsy surgeon, that they are
called upon to unravel a murder ease
of deepest mystery. Detectives are
still divided on their theories, but De
tective Kyte. who has done the prin
cipal work on the case, admitted to
night: that the theory of murder
seemed more tenable than that of sui
cide.
To Detective Kyte was given the
task of finding the dead man's hat and
the missing revolver. He found
neither, *\u25a0 tilthough he spent several
hours at" the point where the body was
found and along the rocks of the mole.
He was also unable to find any trace
of blood on the rocks.
.MAJVV VIEW BODY.
- All day long callers who thought
they might identify the dead man vis
ited the Morgue and scores of persona
viewed the features without results.
It was thought by the police that the
victim might have been a racehorse
man and a number of racing men were
taken to the Morgue. Not one could
identify the dead person as any one
who had ever been seen around the
track at Emeryville. Besides these
men and women with missing relatives
called at the Morgue, with similar re
sults. The police have no report pt
any missing man whose description
tallies 'with that of the one lying on a
slab at the Morgue. '
One reason why the police thought
the dead man might have come from
the race track was that there was a
mark on one of his low cut shoes. The
footgear had, formerly been -Of tan, but
had been blackened and on one shoe
the blacking had been worn away. A
theory was advanced that he might
have been a trainer at the track and
that the mark on the shoe was caused
by frequent contact with a stirrup.
But" it was shown that If such were
the case both sides of the shoe and
both shoes ' would have \u25a0 been worn In
that manner. "It Is more likely, the
police now say. that the shoe was
worn by contact with the rocks on
which the body was found.
Dr. .W. S. Porter, who made a care
ful examination of the shoe, has a
theory that the man was the driver of
a delivery or other wagon, and that
the mark on the right side of the
right shoe was made by constant con
tact with the wagon brake. While Dr.
Porter and Dr. Hamlin differ on minor
details they are agreed that the -man
whose bpdy lies at the Morgue was
the victim of a foul murder. Drs.
Curdts and Reinle. -who assisted Dr.
Hamlin at the autopsy, are of the same
opinion. Dr. Porter said: l v
I believe with Dr. Hamlin that the ab
sence of powder marks on the dead man's
forehead indicates that murder has been dor.c.
From \u25a0 the condition of the body I would nay
that it had been in the water about thirty-six
hours, The fact that the nose was broken,
that an eye was bruised and 1 that there was
an ant^-mortem contusion over the left ear
lead me to believe that the man was eneaired
In a fist fight and that he was probably shot
by* one of the friends of his opponent. While
this is merely a matter of conjecture, there
seems to me no reasonable doubt that the man
was murdered. S
SEARCHING FOR CLEW'S.
Early this morning Detective Kyte,
to whom Chief of-Pollce Hodgkins de
tailed the handling of the case, took
M. B. Maurice and A. Pivor, the^boys
who made the grewsome find while
fishing from the mole, to the point
about 1000 feet from Bay street, where
the body was found, but the tide was
still too high for a systematic search.
Kyte returned to the scene this after
noon, but was not rewarded for his ef
forts. Kyte says: ,
The . boyÂ» said there was blood upon the
rocks, but I could find no trace of it. Still, it
might have bÂ«Â«n washed away by the waves.
That should have happened, however, before
the boys found the body, because Dr. Ham
lin is of the ouinion that It had been in the
water for at least forty-felght hours. This
would lead to the belief that the man was
not murdered on the rocks, but was washed
aehore. \u25a0â¢-..-
In the absence of any identification a theory
has bean advanced that the dead man may have
been one of a Bang that came from San Fran
cisco tn do potn-e crooked work; that he was
ehot either by his intended victim or bis pals,
and his body was thrown into the bay. Until
the body iÂ» identified, however, that theory Is
about as valuable as the other* that. have
been advanced. , ' -\u25a0\u25a0 . \u25a0 â¢
. Of one thing I feel sure â that if It is a casts
of murder, the objÂ«ct was not robbery. The
pocketa had not been turned inside out, and
a robber would have left in them some article
such as a knife or a pencil. Another th|nr
that dee Dens the mystery Is the absence .of
powder marks, either on the forehead or In
side the wound. - The fact that the bullet en
tered the center of the forehead and took an
upward course to the right tends to prove
little.- The wound may have been self-inflicted
or inflicted by another. â¢
. The laqndry mark on" the victim's
collar, which was T 423 X. was respon
sible for a rumor this afternoon to
the effect that the victim might have
been .E. C. Morrison, a railroad man
of; Tracy,,' who is well known in Oak
land. Such a laundry mark was reg
istered to Morrison in a San Francisco
laundry office,, and it was learned that
Morrison was . in West Oakland
Wednesday. but an investigation
proved that Morrison is alive and at
tending to his railroad' duties at Tracy.
/The "efforts of the police are now di
rected '\u25a0'\u25a0 toward establishing the ; dead
rnan|B Identity.- < ~/;-C

SHIPBUILDING CORPORATION I
FILES IXSOLVEXCV PETITION
Famous Alnmnla Concern Finds It
Cannot Make Money After Death
of Its Two Founders.
A petition of Insolvency was filed
with the County Clerk yesterday by
the Hay & Wright Shipbuilding Com
pany of Alameda Point. The corpora
tion will be able to pay about 50 per
cent of Its Indebtedness. It was quiet
ly Roinar out of business and pay-
Ing oft its indebtedness when the at
tachment of a creditor named Henrix
forced the petition as a protection ti>
the other creditors.
The firm of Hay & "Wright, under
which name it was formerly known,
was one of the oldest shipbuilding firms
on the coast. In 1903 Wright die-t
suddenly, and the next year Hay fol
lowed. The firm had been made a cor
poration shortly before, and It at
tempted to continue the business after
the two founders had died. The cor
poration was unsuccessful, and decided
to go out of business. The yards havo

WYXEKIC AT ACAPULCO
Epidemic of Spinal Meningi
tis Compels British Steam
er to Stop at Mexican Port
The Pacific mail liner City of Para,
which arrived yesterday from Panama
and v.-ay ports, brought an unusually
large shipment of gold and silver treaf
tne, tha product of Central American
mines. The total value of the shipment
was J246.258 55. Of this JIIG.iCO was made
up at jroid bars from the Kutters mine in
Salvador. The balance of the sold and
silver came from Mexico and was shipped
on the Para at Mazatlan. There was
silver bullion valued at $01,275, and gold
and silver bars worth $63,000. Then there
were precipitates and slag, both rich in
mineral.
Among the passengers on the Para was
A. M. Garland, special coast agent for
the Pacific Mall Company with head
quarters at Guatemala City. Mr. Garland
la mentioned as the probable successor to ,
Alexander Center as the company's gen
eral ag:Â«nt at this port. Garland's place]
may be given to S. Silverstone.
E. R. King, traveling auditor of the
I'aeiflc Mail Company. aJso was a pas
>^rger on the Para.
The British steamship Wyneric was in |
quarantine at Acapulco when the Para
Jpft there. On the voyage from Panama
to Puget Sound an epidemic of spotted j
fever- or spinal meningitis developed on j
loard the Wyneric and she put into j
Acapuieo because the craw was not in fit
< undition to navigate the vessel further.
A Â«al!or and the ship's carpenter had
died and among those suffering from the
crcadful disease wae the captain's wife, j
The doctor who boarded the vessel when j
she anchored at Acapulco was compelled
by the authorities to remain on board and ,
the people on the City of Para were tin- J
able to learn the full extent of the |
Wyneric's misfortune.
The Para brought oniy 502 tons of cargo
and !!? pas-enters, among whom wore:

The anti -American boycott ha* reached this

Chinese sailors, firemen, cooks and waiters,
\u25a0who, by reason of the exclusion act. may not

rived <jn Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday
mid yesterday there streamed on board the

:.uthing doing in the trading line on Wednes
i:^.y. Not even a pair of suspenders cx
â¢ ! ansTfd hands on Tliursday. and yesterday the
<-.->;.>rrat* Dacksmen learned how the Sperry

docked on Tuesday notices in Chinese were
tacked up all over the chip. These notices
\u25a0 a'.:- d the attention of every pig-tailed mem
l>Â»-r of the Mar:chur'a'Â« crew to the existence of >

try siar.t-eyed sailor or yellow Vfjieman
to bay as muci as a collar button from any
foreJco devil that offered his wares for sale on
th"? liner's decks during her stay in this
.-\rt:^r!'.an port. So fax the Manchuria's Mon
golians have followed the e'ict of the boy
cott notice to the letter and at 1 o'clock yes
;Â«rday there filed out of the Pacific Mall dock

NEW YORK. Dec. B.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of. Trade to-morrow will
say:. Trade broadens In a healthy manner
in response to ; lower temperatures and
holiday ;dcmandj - Staple lines of heavy
weight \u25a0 wearing \ apparel are readily dis
tributed, and ' the movement of Christmas
goods promises to . add one more to the
many , new , high records established by
1905. have made further advances,
Dun's Index numbering $105,312 on Decem
ber 1,; against $103,858; a month previous,
and the ; past week has brought a still
higher level.
'-.There -was;- nothine in; the state docu
ments .to .disturb confidence. Industrial
activity is' showing greater progress than
at any. previous, time, and railway earn
ings in November were 6.1 per cent larger
than last year's.
: Foreign. commerce; at this port for the
last week showed a , gain of $1,119,395 in
imports, and a- decrease of $2,421,005 in ex
ports, as compared ' with the same week
of 1904. ,-; ' > 'â¢\u25a0 '
Recent, purchases of hides supplied the
leading tanners j for ; some time to come,
in a few cases contraots covering saltings
as remoto as February-.- Packers' stocks
are so light that they do.not force 'sales.
Consequently the market is light.
Failures this week numoered 232 in the
United States, against 239 last year, and
24 in Canada, compared with 26 a year
ago.
Eradstreet's to-morrow will say: Holi
day; trade began earlier than usual, and
promises to break all records, but retail
trade in seasonable goods, reflecting ir
regular weather, cold ; early, but mild
later, fluctuates in volume. Wool Is dull
and fancy fleeces rather easier v on sea
sonable: quiet in that line, but primary
markets are still strong, I and good re
ports come from clothing, trades.
Railway business continues remarkably
heavy, gross receipts for November prom
ising an increase of about 9 per cent over
last year.
\u25a0 < Current bank clearings testify to the
immense turn over in all trade lines in a
November total largely in excess of any
month ever recorded.
Business failures for the week ending
December 7 number 203,- against 188 last
week, 231 in the like week of 1904. 241 in
1903.. 247 in 1902 and 222 in 1901. In Canada
failures this week number 31, against 25
last week and 23 this week a year ago.
Wheat (including flour) exports for the
week ending December 7 are 4,245,162 bush
els, against 3,706,00 last week, 1,139,369 this
week last year, 4,607,610 in 1903 and 3,761.
047 in 1902. From July 1 to date the ex
ports are 52.523.387 bushels, against 31,256.

S Reasons Why We
Don't AsK for Money
UNTIL OUR PATIENTS ARE
Cured to Stay Cured
FIRSTâ We have confidence in our ability to
cure all cas^s coming under the head of OUT
Specialty, which is confined exclusively to
disease and disorders of MEN ONLY.
SECOND â We never accept a case until we have
made a thorough examination and feel con-
fident we can cure it
THIRDâ We do not believe a physician is en-
titled to his fee until he has proven to the
satisfaction of the patient that he can cure him.
FOURTHâ Our fee is so small, being only $12.>0,
: that we believe any honest man will pay
it after he is cured.
FIFTH â There are so many impostors and un-
reliable SO-called specialists that we believe
our methods will in time prove our superior-
ity and hence be the more profitable.
SIXTHâ Our enormous practice, built up on these
lines, proves the fact of all our statements.
SEVENTH â Should a patient pay us in advance he
might quit treatment before being perma-
nently cured, and our reputation would be
thus jeopardized.
EIGHTHâ ShouId a few dishonest patients refuse
to pay- after they are cured, the loss would
be only $12.50 each, and we could stand it
with more fortitude than if it were a big fee.
NINTHâ Many honest men without ready money
might otherwise neglect themselves and thus
become incurable, while our Not-a-dOllar-
until-cured motto enables them to take ad-
vantage of our special skill and pay at their
leisure.
TENTHâ Last, but not least, we desire to reach
/the poor as as the rich man, and by
making our fee only 512.>0, payable on such
easy terms, we thereby increase our business
and secure lasting gratitude from thousands
who would otherwise remain afflicted if it
were not for this liberal offen j
All of the above reasons we are willing to verify and practically
demonstrate to the most skeptical. Our offer is to you, to every one,
only $12.50 for a cure, payable at yoar convenience, in such sums as
you can spare. Could an offer be more generous? It savors of hon-
esty. It is honest. .No matter, what your trouble is â if you suffer from
neglect, for want of money or from unskillful practice â here is an op-
portunity to get the services of a skilled specialist, a graduate physician,
with years of ripe experience in treating complicated and special dis-
orders of men only. It will cost you nothing to talk to us, and may be
the means, of restoring you to health and happiness. AVhy not call to-
day? Our offices are very private. You see only the doctor.. If you
cannot call, write for blanks, as we extend the same liberal offer to those
wh6 cannot call. In fact, there is no excuse for being disordered or
sick while this liberal offer remains. it is a gift of priceless value,
within the reach of all.' Remember, only $12.50 for any disease. I

NO RUSSIAN LEADER.
THE blind and pitiful revolution in Russia goes on, unchecked
and unled. A brutal blood thirst is upon the people and is
slaked by slaughter of the Jews, who seem tp be a target for
ai! parties, the loyal Cossacks cheerfully joining the disloyal revo^
lutionaries in murdering and robbing that defenseless people. The
army and navy are no longer reliable agents of the Government
and the unfortunate De Witte seems to have let the situation slip
out of his hands, and is as much lacking in influence with the people
as the most despised of the Grand Dukes.
The army in Manchuria, often whipped by the Japanese, starv
ing and desperate while waiting for repatriation, has added a new :
terror to the troubles of the Government. If left where it is, it is
likely to massacre its officers, and if brought home it is ripe to join
the revolution. The hand of the Government is everywhere par
alyzed, and order is unknown. It seems to be a fearful breakup of
"the whole social and civil order. Even murder is not systematized
and riot seems for the sake of riot, and is not for some ulterior
purpose, such as final order and * peace. Mechanic and mujik, the
urban and agrarian population, seem to feel only that, repression
being removed, now is the time to wreak vengeance on somebody,
and they are rather indifferent as to the class or personality of the
victims.
It is the first revolution that has seemed lacking in a head and
a purpose. There is no formulation of a grievance, and no driving,
even through blood, to a definite purpose. What is done so far ;
seems to be instigated by the socialists. The heads of socialism
in Europe should be impressed by the fact that their present respon- ;
slbllity for the Russian uprising is a trial of their dream. If they
prove themselves capable of leading only in destruction, and to
have no constructive capacity, then their dream is ended. They have
the sympathy of Tolstoi, but he makes a weak showing as a leader.
He has been a capable and copious critic of what is, but has shown
no capacity as a leader toward definite and organized reform. In
any other country the movement would by this time be in definite
shape. It would have taken form. It would have said what was
wanted, and the purpose of all this violence and defiance would be
known to all the world. That has beeivthe case in revolutions ai
the Anglo-Saxons, Celts and Gauls, Germans and Scandinavians.
No matter how confused the aspect they presented, a purpose could
be traced in their most complex evolutions.
This is not yet the case in Russia. The Government has made
repeated concessions, but without effect. That would not signify
if this national mob could march upon some definite point. But it
goes on milling, like a cattle herd in panic, and no opinion can be
formed concerning'it and its purpose.
To a far outsider one thing is apparent. If present conditions
continue there will be a military dictatorship, class will play against
class, the revolution that has no head will be suppressed, partly
by exhaustion, and the lid will be on Russia again and the autoc
racy, restored as the representative of social and civic order, will
renew its historic policy of repression. The people will return to
their former subjection, and all the violence and bloodshed will
have been in vain.
All this will be for the need of a leader. The collapse of De"
Witte seems to be certain. He is not supported by the middle class,
is rejected by the nobility, and has no influence with the great mass
of the people, who are now in the hands of socialists. The only
choice so far apparent is between autocracy and anarchy.
The Russians seem to be lacking the saving quality of imagina
tion. The}- seem to be sodden. It was the French imagination that
directed the revolution of 1793. Certain ideals appealed to the
imagination. Liberty, equality, fraternity, became the motto of
that bloody struggle, and the imagination and its ideals softened
even the prolonged slaughter of The Terror. It was the romance
of murder, the poetry of spoliation. Pet names were given to the
guillotine, and music and poetry were enlisted in the ranks of the
destroyers, who destroyed with their hands and reconstructed with
their imaginations. .
FRESH WATER SUPPLY FROM THE OCEAN.
SUGGESTION of great possibilities of fresh water supply is
given in a paper by Professor C. H. Hitchcock of Dartmouth
College in the December number of the Popular Science Month
ly. It is a study of fresh water springs in the ocean and within a
few miles of the shore. Enough is known of the existence of such
springs to warrant the belief that there must be vast quantities of
fresh water discharged in this way through undiscovered springs,
and perhaps close to big cities and to fertile soil where the water
:s needed for drinking or for irrigation. Some of these springs show
artesian conditions and will rise 32 to 42 feet by the pressure of the
supply. There is a porous water-bearing stratum beneath an im
pervious cover. Piercing this by boring gives access to a water
supply that will rise quite a height without pumping.
One of the most notable examples of this condition is- at the
island of Oahu. The plantations on this island have made valuable
use of the water for irrigation purposes. On one plantation 5000
acres are so irrigated. Though the pumps work continuously the
water never fails. Close to the coast line no pumps are* needed, as
the water rises 22 feet. At Honolulu such water will.' rise 42 feet.
At Oahu they reach this water-bearing stratum by boring 300 to
400 feet. Some of these springs well up so powerfully as to prevent
the ocean water from commingling with the fresh in cases where
the artesian water fines its own outlet through a crevice in the im
pervious strata. Powerful streams are said to discharge millions of
gallons of water through artificial openings very near the sea shore.
These are believed to continue some distance out to sea and then
to well up mingled with the ocean billows.
Professor Joseph Le Conte, in his "Geology," mentions the ex
istence of fresh water springs rising in the ocean near Hawaii.
Around the Florida coast there is much of this water, and at many
places it is bored for and utilized. The wonderful Silver Spring,
which bursts a full-grown navigable river immediately from its
source, is given as an example of the underground conditions that
produce the under-ocean springs. It is the rainfall of a region far
away, perhaps, and the water filtered through miles of sand. Elise
Reclu}?, the great geographer, speaks of such springs existing east of
the Isle of Pines.
All this suggests the possibility that in the future many big
seaboard cities may discover that they can obtain an abundant sup
ply of pure drinking water almost at their doors by searching under
the ocean for what is now going to waste and mixing with the
brine. It certainly stands to reason that if so many outbursts of
fresh water in the sea are already known there must be others yet
to be discovered.

THE ISLE OP BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
Listen, my daughter, and you shall
hear a tale that was told me by my
grandmother's grandmother the last
;time that I was incarnated, and the
only reason I chance to know it is
oecause I have such a good memory.
Once upon a time, so my great-great
grandmother said, there was a land
in which the women became very
much dissatisfied with the men, who
were horrid things, and so they held
v, great meeting and resolved that they
would go to a beautiful island of which
they knew and there establish a repub
lic for women only. So one fair -day
they sailed away to the island, elected
a Presidentess â who appointed a Cabi
net of Ministeresses â a Vice Presiden
tess and other officeresses; established
some perfectly lovely Dargain counters,
and soon had things running smoothly
and beautifully. They then burned
their ships, so that none of them would
be tempted to return to the horrid men,
and you never did see anything so per
fectly cute as the ; republic. It was
just too sweet for anything. '
\u25a0" But after a time it was observed that
the women used to walk upon the sea
shore, each by herself, gaze toward the
land of .the men and sigh, "If there
were only, just one here, it wouldn't
seem so â " They never completed the
sentence, and so my great-great-grand
mother did not know why they
sighed.
Well, after a time there came up a
mighty storm, and in the course of it a
man, still living, was cast upon the
bÂ°ach of their island. Now. wasn't
that horrid? The women immediately
\u25a0held a mass meeting to decide what
should be done with him..
"Of course," the fair Presidentess re
marked in her opening . speech,- "we
cannot be so cruel as to let him die.
Somebody must care for him and took
after him,, and inasmuch as the wel
fare of this republic has been placed
in my keeping, I feel'that it is my duty
âthat is, I â well, I 'will make him my
charge.'
"Not so, my honored Presidentess."
the Vice Presidentess hastily inter
posed; "my duties are less onerous than
yours. I will look after him."
"He clearly comes within my prov
ince," said the Secretaryess of Foreign
Affairs. "I will attend to his case."
"No, I will,", cried all the other Sec
retaryesses, and after that all of the
unofficial electors said that they would.
\ "Clearly we must take a vote," sug
gested the Presidentess. "and the one
who receives the most votes will care
for this odiou3 creature."
So 1379 votes were cast for 1379 dif
ferent women. . '. " .
.Then the trouble began, and within
five minutes every woman there pres
ent looked: as if she had attended a
bargain sale that afternoon. Fortu
nately, however, at this point the poor
man committed suicide. He said that
he couldn't afford to take the chances
of living.
My grandmother's grandmother said
she didn't know what happened after
that, as she left the happy island* and
swam to the mainland, but she had âun
derstood that the other women did the
same. /

THE SMART SET
Never was a debutante launched under |

Ing the "coming-out" party given to Miss
Evelyn ClifTord by her parents, Mr. and
Mrs. J. B. Clifford, last .evening.
The commodious rooms of the Hotel
Melville on Van Ness avenue were placed
at the disposal of the young guests, and
a pronounced air of festivity filled the
dwelling 1 . ;
The entrance hall, reception rooms and
all apartments on two floors gave evl- ;
denco of balmy pines, bay and other for
est greens, the house being a wilderness
of boughs and branches. Among these
were profusely mingled aright red ber "
ries, which, catching the glow of many
colored lights, fairly scintillated their
warm hue.
The large dancing j hall below likewise
presented the forest effect and here a
merry assembly danced away many
hours.
Miss Clifford, in her beautiful graduat
ing gown of richly embroidered lace, was
radiant with happiness and this event of
triple motif will linger indelibly in- the
minds of all attending.
With the celebration of her eighteenth
birthday the fair bud was presented to
society by her parents, who also tormally
nunounced her engagement to Sylvanus
Farnham. and, with the wedding day still
a year away, Miss Clifford and her fiance
will be among the winter's most-sought
for favorites.
Receiving the guests were Mrs. Clifford,
weaiing a white net robe, over white
taffeta: Miss Elsie Clifford' in a very
handsome French importation of pink
point d'esprit over pink chiffon; Miss Eve
lyn Clifford in white; .Miss Lillian .Wil

\ schoolgirl, sivinsr Â«s it does a certain breadth of shoulder and a
corresponding slenderness of wiistllne to the unformed figure of the
demoiselle. The one pictured shews a pretty combination of Henrietta,
richelieu pleating and broad velvet ribbon, tb6 latter used only for the
ceinture and bretelles,. The, fitted lining may be used or omitted, ac
cording! to. taste, but 1 when used v flexible featherbone will be found to
yield better 1 results for, the girlish figure than will a stiff whalebone.
The: yoke; is all in one section, the trimming so disposed as to rive the
appearance of being in two parts; and the richelieu pleating I a applied
with a headlns of a narrow; guipure -Ipsertion." The waist is shirred

SECRET DEAL
IS DISCLOSED
The promoters of the new Ocean Shore
Railroad have closed a deal whereby they
secured a large piece cf property fronting
on the north side of Mission street and
the east side of Eleventh ..street and the
weet side of Tweifth street, where they
will locate their central passenger depot.
Work on tho new structure will begin
Just as aocn as the franchise, which is
in the hands of the bireet Committee of
the Board of Supervisors, is granted.
The deal was closed ninety days ago,
and sJnce that time the officials of the
road have been endeavoring to keep it a
secret. The sale was made by Thomas
Magee & Sons to J. Downey Harvey
and Walter B. Deane. The property waa
owned by Mrs. Vanderbilt and Mrs. Oel
rlchs and is a valuable tract. The con
sideration is being kept a secret by the
railroad people.
The location for the new depot is one
of the most central in the city and an
ideal site for railroad passenger head
quarters. The deal waa finally closed by
Attorney Burke Corbet, representing the
j Ocean Shore Company, and Thomas Ma
gee & Sons, representing Mrs. Vanderbllt
and Mrs. Oelrichs.
CONVENIENT FOR PASSENGERS
The new depot will be in touch with the
Mission street electric line as well as
with the Market, Howard and practically
the Fourteenth street roads. Passengers
can be quickly transferred to the various
portions of the town when they alight
at the new station by means of the dif
ferent car lines in the .immediate vicinity.
This portion cf the city bids fair to
become a great railroad center within the
next few years. The Western Pacific offi
cials are understood to have an option on
the prcperty at Ninth and Bryant streets,
the site of the ill-fated Pacific National
baseball park, and when they get ready
they propose to build a handsome passen
ger depot there.
The new der>ot at Twelfth and Mission
streets will be a large and commodious
one. The Ocean Shore road's purchase
embraces 550 feet on Mission street and
275 feet on Eleventh and Twelfth streets.
Plans have already been submitted by
the architects, but as yet have not been
accepted by the company. However, it
is understood that the depot will be a very
handsome affair and In the words of At
torney Corbet "a credit to San Fran
cisco."
NO FREIGHT IN NEW DEPOT.
Not a b't of freight is to be received
at the depot. It will be strictly for pas
sengers and will be fitted up in the most
elaborate and up to date style. Tho
freight depot will be located at Army
and Vermont streets, well out In tbe
Potrero.
The Ocean Shore people have already
made known their intention of establish
ing a branch passenger depot In the Sun
set District, where passengers for this
portion of town may alight and go to
their homes without being Inconvenienced
by riding downtown.
The announcement that the depot will
be situated In such a central portion of
| the town will mean much for the railroad
1 and will also boom that portion of the
city to a great degree. Nearly every dls
j trict of the town will bÂ« practically
j brought Into contact, as the various car
lines can take the passengers to the
downtown. Portrero, Mission and West
ern Addition districts In a very short
time.
The Ocean Shore officials have not
made any arrangements with the United
Railroads whereby passengers might be
transferred from one road to the other.
It is not yet known what action will be
taken In regard to this matter, as the
Ocean Shore people are undecided.

THE SAN FRANCISCO : CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1905:
GOLD IN GRAVEL CHANNEL
ENRICHES CALAVERAS.
Mono County Seeks
to Exploit Its
Deposits.
Trinity Makes Dis
covery of Millions
in Cheap Aline.
A large grave! channel has been dis
covered, according to current reports,
in Calaverae County, as the result of
one year of development. If the Cala
veraa Prospect is not mistaken, the
discovery "is likely to prove a sur
prise to inining men and to create si
mining excitement in the district ex
ceeding anything of recent years." In
dications were I'ound of an ancient do
posit of gold a year or more ago. It
was inferred sagely that the gold in
'sight was not 111 the true channel, but
appeared to be the overflow from a
larger deposit. Tho Prospect gives thÂ«
particulars of what followed:
To find this deposit now became tho object.
A drift was run irom the bottom of tnÂ» ehaft
toward the 'east In bedrock. Atter running for
some distance the bedrock disappeared and did
not again appear till seventy feet had been
run. In fact, the true channel had been dls
covtred, though at first this waa hardly un
democd, and it took considerable further de
velopment to disclose tho itupendous nature oJ
the discovery. \u25a0 " i
I>rlfts were run along: this channel, up
raises made and winze* sunk, till Jlnully tha
whole iriKantlc scheme was dlsclceed. So far
the workings show thirty-three feet of gravel
that will prospect all th<s way from 10 cents to
$1 a pan. in one thort section JIOOO was
taken out In drifting. In the winze which has
be*n sunk In the channel to a depth of eight
een feet the gravel grows better with the
depth, and the gold Is coarser. The rim rock
of the channel Indicates that the action has
bÂ«*n from below and that the gravel has been .
thrown up, the overflow upon the surrounding j
bedrock Riving the gold that has been taken i
from the ground already worked.
It will be noted that this is an entirely new
discovery. None of thÂ» geological maps that :
have been published give any hint of a gravel
channel in this vicinity. Yet here it is now
disclcsed for a quarter of a mile, with such
clearly defined rims that It can be accurately
mapped It runs northwest and southeast,
crossing the river at a sharp angle. Its depth
can only be surmised. No attempt has been
made to go deeper tMan the elÃhteen foot
winze, though other winzes have been sunk at
different places, showing unvarying: . results.
Not a panful of dirt but what will show gold
and the gravel growing cleaner and heavier
with depth. There is no cement and no clay,
ncthlng to prevent free washing.
Now that the channel" has been defined the
process ef working it in a systematic- manner
will be commenced.
The discovery will give an Impetus to pros
pecting in this vicinity. We believe this la
the greatest gravel discovery since the early
days, and that It will mean much to this lo
cality.
MONO HAS FACILITIES.
Having the facilities for mining on
a large scale, the people of Mono
County are seeking capital for develop
ment. The Bridgeport Chronicle-Union
reviews some of the existing conditions
In Mono, and supplies facts that appeal
to the enterprising man of capital. In
part the Chronicle-Union says: .
One of the greatest needs that this country
has to-day is a cheaper form of power, so that
industries as yet undeveloped may in their turn
add to the national wealth. Mono County Is
fast puehlng Itself to ths front as a mining
world; new discoveries are being made eveiy
day. From all parts of the mineral
belt comes encouraging news as to
the wealth of our country, We ara
In the middle of a vast mineral deposit,
which in no far distant day will speak for
Itself. In the advancement of the mineral in
dustry we have an abundance of water and
heavily#timbered forests, which play an Impor
tant part in the development of this enterprise.
Water power Is plentiful; the altitude of our
streams and our mountains of "perpetual snow
add to the virtue of the water supply. Elec
trical power may be generated In many ways,
but in none more practical than by the use of
water.
Here we avail ourselves of one of nature s
resources without In any way exhausting her
reserve supply. The development of electrical
tnergy on a commercial oasis upon a given
stream and with a given fall will depend upon
a variety of conditions, and here in the heart
of this -great mining belt we find them. Elec
tric power, when once installed and In opera
tion, is conceded to be the cheapest motive
power than can be obtained. Two well known
properties In this county have Installed electric
l<ower for lighting, mill and mining purposes.
One is In cour6Â« of construction and others are
In contemplation. From far away Los Angeles
comes an unlimited amount of capital and in
fluence seeking the controlling Interest of the
water of the Owens Kover to be used in the
generation of electricity for the southern city.
Out6lde capital sees our possibilities and is
clamoring for a foothold on our waterways.
Not only have we an abundance of water to
aid In this industry, but we have our heavy
timbered forests as well, which iÂ» in a measure
considered one of the most expensive items of
a mining company. Four chief factors compose
tho mining enterprise: the value of the ore, the
cost of production, cost of transportation and
1 the cost of reduction. Tne sum of the laet
three must be first or the mine will have to
close down. Mining, properly understood, is a
business In which the gain or loss is the result
of the balance of these conditions, not an ex
cavation of treasure whoee enormous value
renders other considerations Insignificant. In
tha three costs mentioned above the principal
elements are wood and water.
MILLIONS PUOMISIfiD.
A story that sounds like a raining
romance of the old times in California
is told by the Redding Searchlight un
der the taking caption of "Paying
$50,000 for a $2,000,0.00 Gold Mine.'"
The story relates to the acquisition of
the Bonanza King mine in Trinity
County by the Treadwells. The story
i.i its essential details, taken from tho
Searchlight, Is as follows:
The owners regret to sell for $50,000 a mine
from which nearly $100,000 has been taken in
a week or two byâlew than a dozen miners,
and in which the Treadwells say there is now
$2,000,000 In sight.
By the terms the Treadwells were to hayÂ«
one year In which to decide whether they \u25a0
would pay $50,000 for tho property. They were
to do development work under the bond, but
all the ore or gold taken out during develop
ment was to remain at the mine and revert to
the owners In the event the bond became for
feited at the end of the twelve months. In the
event the Treadwells purchased the mine, the
values taken out during development under the
bend were to be theirs.
No one dreamed that such -Monte Cristo
wealth would be so quickly revealed. Joseph
Porter, repreeentlng tho Treadwella at the
mine, out a unjall forco of miners at . work.
They ran a tunnel only clx feet farther when
they encountered the rich chimney of ore from
which $20,000 in gold waÂ» taken almost before
they turned around. It was this Quantity of
ore or gold, taken over a month ago. that
startled the mlnlnjr world, and made . the Ho
nanra Klnx famous. Development work pro
gressed and beyond the Dhenomenally rich
chimney the ledge showed up ore going hun
dreds of dollars to the ton.
There are 168 stamps in operation. in
the quartz mills of Trinity; County
among the following mentioned minea:
Brown Bear 20. Chloride : Bailey 30,

ACTIVITY AT PEAVISTB.
: .The Truckee Republican reports ac
tivity in the Peavine district. In part
it declares:
Peavine district is receiving &' great: deaf, of
attention and the recent reports from I that sec
tion Indicate that Is is worthy "of consideration
on the part of Investors, for tl ha? not only pro
duced a creat deal of money In the past, but
all recent exploitation work seems to more
clearly than Â«ver demonstrate the fact that de
velopment only is necessary : to assure large
bodies of phenomenally rich ore.* No doubt this
will be a great surprise to a number of those
who In years gone by have s put â¢ mosey / in
mines there. Peavine !s like a number of old
districts In Nevada., which are now ' coming to
the front, and has every : promise of :a ' large
yield of Uie srecious " metal as a > result Â» of
U^ittmÂ»tÂ« . development. . Several \u25a0 companies
have be*n operating In this : Held /for . eeveral
months, and with gratifying. success. -I- . â¢
The Bed Bluff News reports that the
Midas mine at PJarrison Gulch is ready
to resume:
The Mldaa mine at Harrison Gulch, about
sixty miles due west of Red Bluft, has about
completed the retlmberln* of ' the - main shaft
and the extensive alterations and repairs that
have been under way for some months, 'and' it
Is said that the management intends reopening
at an early date with a full \u25a0 fores ot men.
The twenty stamna of the mill have had a
longer rest than ever since the \u25a0 mine waa
started, and the Improvements have . Included
tho making of a double compartment shaft.
The property has been under the one manage
ment for about tÂ«n years. Vice President L. A.
MclntoÂ»h has been the managln* owner. He
has met with almost uniform Buccess In hi*
conduct of the great plant, which is generally
supposed to â¢ represent an investment .well up
to the seven figure*.
DEALS 3IADE IX PLACER.. ;1
Several mining deals. In Placer
Cob.Mty havo recently taken place. The
Plactr 'Republican says of them:
The Eclipse-Morning Star mines have been
sold. Thene comprise the Eclipse, Morning
Star and Good Easter veins, C. LÂ». Wilson of
San Francisco being the buyer. The Valley
View mine has been sold and the new owners
are sinking a shaft on the property.' This
property, . formerly known as the Whisky Dig
gings attracted at an early stage of mining
puch "men as liarpending; Cronlea and others,
but It was seen that only, smelting would do
Ju*ti#e to the ore. Large, cropping* \u25a0 of Iron
belts are on this property containing Iron and
copj>er pyrites rich in gold and silver, and
where decomposed near the surface have been
worked for the free sold. _
The Â«ear Valley Smelting Company has ac
quired a section of lar.d between Ophlr and
LJncoln and will commence the erection of a
smelter. This will produce an ouUet for tha
baÂ»Â« ores ar.d concentrates of the Ophlr camp
and will mean much to the. whole of western
Placer County, as it will be situated so to as
make the copper deposit, around Lincoln and
Sheridan tributary to it.
The Hathaway and Eureka mines are under
bond to Eaetern parties. ,' -

Thomas J. Duffy, miner by profes
sion and lawyer by attempt, lost his
case yesterday . in the United States
Circuit Court by, a nonsuit ' granted
by,- United States District Judge-Han
ford on motion of J. C. Campbell.
Duffy sought to recover $1,580,000- for
damages and for gold extracted from
placer claim No. 1 below discovery
on Anvil Creek. Nome mining district,
by Jafet Llndeberg and hls v associates,*
who, he alleges, unlawfully ousted him
in July. 1599.
Duffy acted as his own attorney, for
which reason he was unable to get
certain testimony admitted, not know-
Ing how to go about it. For the same
reason he failed to" prove that he was
the owner of the claim at the time of
his ejectment. 'On the contrary his
own witnesses. virtually testified
against him when they 6aid"that-the
ground had been staked off already
when Duffy placed them on guard.

Handicaps Are in Progress
ms Course at Ingleside
for Two Handsome Cups
The second eighteen holes of the horne
snd-home golf ma-teh between teams of
?ipht lafiles representing The San Fran
:isco Gulf and Couiitry Club and the Clare
siont Country Club will be flayed on the
:ourss of the Clarernont Country Club on
Tuesday, the 12th inst., nine holes being
played before and nir.e holes after lun
:heon. The scores will be reckoned with
those made last Tuesday on the Ingleside
links, where the Ba :i Francisco team se
cured an advantage of C% points. Each
match won counts one point and 'each
hole after the deciding- one counts half a
Â»x>int. The \u25a0winning team will 'capture a
handsome silver trophy, which will be
come a permanent adornment of its club
house. As each team has an advantage
on the course with which It is most famil
iar, the Claremoct ladies should play a
"lose match with the San Francisco
slub's representative*.
The Mulllns cup. presented by C. F.
Mullins, the well-known insurance man,
to the ladies of the Ban. Francisco Golf
B.nd Country Club, is the newest trophy
to be foucht for on the Ingleside course.
s"h* first handicap competition against
bopty for the trophy â¢was held on the
Inglesids links on. Thursday. The second
will be held on some later day to be
determined. The names of the winners
of the two competitions will be engraved
tepon the trophy, the winner of the flret
Contest being barred from the second.
Ilia two winners will then play off at
Jnatch play with the same handicaps and
thÂ© winner will become the owner of the
trophy.
The principal competitions among the
men of the Ban Francisco Golf and Coun
try Club during: the winter will be for the
i>og:ey handicap cup, the ftrst competition
for which, held on Thanksgiving day,
was won by Captain J. S. Oyster, -who
received five strokes on eighteen holes
end finished four down. John Lawson
uid T. Q-. MeConkey tied for second place
\u2666rith five down. Six competitions In all
axe to be held, the same man not being
permitted to win twice. The name of each
winner will be esgravtd on the trophy
and th#>- six winners will play together
with the same handicaps as were allotted
to them in the competitions, against
bogey, match score. The winner will
:Â«ptttre the trophy.
Association Football Xotr*.
It is possible that Harry Bird and
Andrew MoLachlan of the Oakland
Hornets may take a rest to-morrow.
Bird hurt his hip somewhat In the
opening game of the season and, Mc-
Lachlan's foot received an injury in
last Sunday's game and swelled con
siderably. In the event of their ab
sence their places will be taken by
tlcnroe and Duncan No. l.
It is possible that the Rover-Hornet
match may be -without an official ref
eree. The Rovers have made objec
tions to some of the referees appoint
ed by the California Association Foot
ball Union and the union may refuse
to appoint a referee for matches In
which they are engaged. In that case
a referee who Is not a member of
either club must be secured : on the
Tround.
Arrangements will be made for' a
natch between the Oakland Hornets
Â«nd an eleven of Stanford University,
to be played in January- As the match
Is intended to be a display of the
game, In which the Stanford men have'!
liad little training or practice, it Is pos- \u25a0
sible the Hornet forwards and the I
Stanford defense may play against the I
Stanford attack and the Hornets' de
fense, or vice versa. Such a division
would equalize matters and produce a
closer contest. '\u25a0\u25a0!â¢-!

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. S.â
The San Diego Rowing Club is anxious
to have the crews 6T Stanford University
and of the University of California row
agalnat each other at Ban Diego some
time next spring. The San Diego people
also include an offer to bring the track
teams of the twoâ universities to their
town at the same time for their annual
Intercollegiate field meet.
No definite financial offer has been made
| the athletic authorities of the university,
but the people of San Diego seem anx
ious to secure these Intercollegiate con
tests. It is probable something may
come of the proposition. - .
P*waÂ« Woman's Diamond Kin*.
Mrs. Millie Klnghorn, 238
street, obtained a warrant from Police
Judge Cabaniss yesterday, for the ar
rest of W. D. Frey on a oharge of
felony - embezzlement. She says that
Frey desired to purchase her diamond
ring, valued at $350, and she allowed
him to have possession of it so that he
could show it to some friends. . She de
manded Its return repeatedly, but he
always put her off with some excuse,
and a day or two ago she. discovered
that he had pawned the ring on Sep
tember -10. Frey was in trouble some
months ago for passing a fictitious
check on William Lyons, saloon-keeper
on O'Farrell street.

THE SAN FRANCISCO. CALL, SATURDA^x DEGEMBER^UQO^
COLD WEATHER
SUITS GUNMEN
Ducks Are Plentiful and
With Favorable Conditions
Shooting Shou ld Improve ,
The duck shooters are hoping for a con
tinuance of the present cold wc-ather, as
it Is sure to improve their favorite sport.
The ponds formed by the recent rains
have dried and the v birds must now seeK
the preserves for- feed and water.
j The full moon is at once an aid and a
detriment to the shooters. It is expected
to oring down a great number of north
ern birds, which- will improve the sport.
At prcÃ3xit it is said to impair the shoot
ing, as the birds come in to the preserves
at night to feed and then return to the
safe waters of the bay. in iho day time.
To the surprise of some veteran duck
shooters some of the tfest sport has been
obtained in the afternoons recently. This
is particularly true on the Sulsun marsh
in the vicinity of the Field arid Tule and
of the Family Club preserves.' This is an
almost unheard of condition, the birds
usually working best in the morning.
The members of the Alameda Gun Club
hav e had excellent shooting recently on
their Sonoma preserves. Some market
hunters in lloatlng. blinds in. the vicinity
are not exoectedto improve the shooting
for the clubmen.' -/
Dr. B. F. Alden secured a limit bag of
"cans" on the Empire Cub preserve on
Wednesday. This Indicates how plentiful
these fine birds are. The mallards are re
ported to be here In greater numbers than
in former years. Thoteal and spooneys
are also plentiful, but the sprig have dis
appeared.
The "cans" have been secured in num
bers at Lakeville, near Petaluma, and
also on the San Antone slough. Some
days they work well for the - guns and
nothing will frighten them. On other oc
casions they are very wary and avoid all
suspicious . objects which might . harbor a
man with a gun. ,
Otto Feudner shot near Alvarado last
Sunday and killed, the only ouck which
came within range. ' There was no shoot
ing in the vicinity, . although there were
many men on the marsh. .
The quail shooters seem to have had al
most a blank this. season, few, good bags
being resorted.
Captain A. J. Webb of the trapshoptlng
section of the Empire Gun Club was the
victim ot a robbery recently, which de
prived him of his fine collection of prize
cups and medals. The robbers took a
highly prized gun won at the Midwinter
Fair, but left his most "valuable gun. In
cluded inthe collection of medals was one
valued at $200, won at the Portland Expo
sition, which Mr. Webb must replace. -It
was , a perpetual challenge trophy, and
was not to become the property, of any
one man. the") winner holding it for one
year.

The horseless- age, . which many
peoplo predicted some years^V since
would follow the general use of auto
mobiles, seems larther < away, than
ever. Instead of the horse being forced
into the background he is' becoming
more popular and, apparently, rnora
indispensable as time goes on.
This Is proved by the strong demand
and the good prices which prevail in
the* sales ring and also by the record
entry of higtily bred horses ...\u25a0 which
marked ail me 'shows in the East last
year. The national show In Madison

records both for quality and ; for . the
number of horses .-entered in the

bred hackneys recently .from M. . H.
Cochrane of Quebec, Canada, a widely,
known importer, of these horses. All
of them have .won; blue ribbons "in

VAMPIRES AEE SECOND
Five Games of Association
Football Will Be Played
on Four Grounds Sunday
I The Berkeley "Wasp 3 were scheduled to
I play a game of Association football
against a 'team of British sailors from
â¢the Seamen's Institute, San Francisco, at
: Freeman's Park, Golden Gate, this after
moon.r noon. The Seamen's institute team was
to have been captained by the Rev. Mr.
Collison, who Is a good player. It has
been found necessary to postpone the
game, as six members of the Institute
, team were ordered to sea yesterday.
i To-morrow there will be five matches
,of Association football, four for the
) championship of the California League
and one friendly contest. On the cricket
ground, at Webster street, Alameda, the
Hornet "Reserves, a new organization, will
play a friendly matcn agains.. the second
eleven of the VAmpires, the ball being
kicked off at fl a. m. The team of the
Hornet Reserves is made up of Fewster,
Boalkeeper; Martin, right back; Houshol
der, left back: Bowden. right halfback;
Lassiter, center halfback; Falk, left half
back; Macdermld, outside right; G. J-
Lowell, inside right; Monroe, center for
j ward; TV. McGregor, inside left; W. B.
I Duncan, outside left. .
i At 2:20 p. m. on the ground, at Webster
| 3treet, Alameda, the ball will be kicked
j off in a regular championship match be
i tween the Alameda Eagles and the Santa
1 Cruz eleven, A. W. Wilding being. the ref
! erce. At Freeman's Park, Golden Gate,
! the Independents will meet the San Fran-
I clsco eleven, C. W. Irish being the referee.
\ The Oakland Hornets will encounter the
, Albion Rovers on the ground at Seventh

Park, Sacramento, the Vampires will play
against the Sacramento team, John Came
ron being the referee. The kick-off will
be at 2:30 p. m. in each match.
The closest and most interesting
game to-morrow will be between the
Oakland Hornets - and the Albion
Rovers, the Vampires being almost cer
tain to dispose of the Sacramento
I eleven and the Independents being
! practically sure of a victory over the
San Francisco eleven. The Eagle and
Santa Cruz teams should have a good
contest, as the visitors are keen to
score in the table of league results,
while the Eagles will -be on their own
ground and have played strongly
against the leading teams.
The Hornet/Reserves met on Wednes
day evening and organized for a series
of games during the winter. The fol
lowing officers were elected: Captain,
Charles B. Martin; secretary, Orrin J.
Lowell, property man, R. W. AJacder-

TENNIS CRACKS
ARE TIRELESS
Wielders of Backets Will
Be Busy on the Courts
Until the Year Ends
YOUNG ENTHUSIASTS
Schoolboys Plan Several
Tournaments on the Gold
en Gate Park Grounds
A number of tennis tournaments will
be played on the courts before the en J^
of the year. The California Club w>fi
have a handicap doubles event on tha
24th and 25th and probably a class
single 3 on the 31st and on the Ist ot
January. Besides these events the Ju
veniles and the fair experts of the
park will participate in several tour
naments. Tha Golden Gate Club has
nothing scheduled till the first Sunday
i in the new year.
The Christmas vacation of the school
children will keep the public courts
at the park occupied for the next three
weeks" The Juveniles, under the di
rection of Mr. Marvin, are planning
several tournaments. The first event
will be played to-day. It will be a
handicap doubles for the three-time
ciipa. The trophies have been won
twice by Harold Getz and Louis Levin
son and once by Robert Strachan and
MorTls McLaughlln.
These two teams are easily the best
In the club and it is likely one or the
other will score another victory.
Strachan and McLaughlin will be the
most heavily handicapped team In the
competition.
The young ladies are likewise plan
ning a seCies of events for the vaca
tion period. The first tournament will
be a third class singles event for a
new cup. It will be played either to
day or early next week.
At the park to-morrow the finals of
the handicap doubles tournament com
menced two weeks ago will be played.
The match will be called at 2:30. The
opposing teams will be the Guerin*^
brothers â George and Henry â oj79*
Clarence Griffln and Herbert LonÂ£.
The latter will allow odds of 15 and
owe 15. The easy victories of the
Guerin brothers would Indicate ulti
mate success, but for the apparent un
derestimating of Long and Griffln by
the handicappers. The latter, for some
reason or other, were placed on the
owe 13 mark, while the other teams.
composed of first class players, were
put on the owe 15 C-6 mark. If Long:
and Griffin were where they belong tlie
Guerin brothers would probably have
an easy time winning, taking their
match with Adams and Janes as a cri
terion. The latter are at least as good
as Long and Griffln. but failed dis
mally against the brother team. With
the handicaps as they are the match
to-day should prove a close one and a
victory for either team would occasion
no surprise. ?,O. '"
It is probably the first time a team
as ranch as 15 aboT* scratch baa
reached thÂ© finals of a handicap event
at the park. "While the match will
hardly bÂ» as Interesting from the spec
tators' point of view as It would with
two first class teams opposed to each
Other it will tend to encourage tho
poorer players. i
As a developer of stars Coast Cha l^.
plon Janes is certainly a success. 1/ â¢
; has held the title but three month*
and already he has brought a like
number of young cracks Into promi
nence. First Carl Oardner took Jane*
Into camp and then Clarence Griffin
accomplished the feat apparently with
out effort. Both players "were by no
means unheard of. but their defeat of
the champion caused their stock to
rise.
Janes' defeat at th* hands of Mel
ville Loner last Sunday was the worst
blow of all^ The " champion figured
that Long 1 could hardly win a set. Tho
clever high school boy has been say-
Ing little, but dally practice worked
wonders and also the undoing of Jane*.
Long's victory Is another Indication of
either an abundance of class, as somo
claim, or a lack of class, as still others
maintain.
On the ISth inst. there will be a
class singles tournament for members
of the Golden Gate Junior Club. It
will not bÂ« for th* three-time cup 3.
but" for special prizes. A bicycle ha*
been offered for first prize in tha third
class. \u25a0
In the past a class singles tourna
ment has been held each year on Now
Year's* day at, the California Club. A
like event will probably be played on
the Ist.
have - been made - against them, they
have yet lost two matches, whereas tÂ«- *
Vampires, with four goals again t"
them. have lost but one. Z.A

Game Well, but He Stows
His Man Away With Bight
BOTH LACK THE CLASS
01 lie Hornbuckle Outpoints
George Murray in a Four-
Koiuul Go Full of Punches
Perry Davis is a champion amateur
heavyweight boxer no longer. He got his
last night when Bob Ward brought over
a haymaker In the third round of their
mix-up at Woodward's Pavilion and the
eventful mix-up came to an abrupt end.
Davis was handed several chances to
bring the contest to an end but he over
looked them all and then got. stranded on
the mat.
The exhibition was a pitiful one as far
as fisticuff science went, for neither
t'ould do any good in the matter of land
ing punches. Ward was a green one. Any
one could tell that, for he did not know
how to hit nor how to block nor anything
else about the game. Davis seemed
Hfraid and would not wade in, though
Ward turned turtle many times and of
fered chances* galore for his opponent to
break In with a haymaker.
In the third spasm. Ward hegan to get
a bit aggressive. He reached up a couple
of times and managed to tap Davis on
the jaw. These told and the champion
weakened. Finally he went to the carpet
and his legs became tangled up with his
thin. All Ward had to do was to stall
around till the referee said it was all over
and then he emerged a champ.
The beet bout of the evening was the
mix-up between George Murray and Ollie
Hornbuckle, which the latter captured
on a decision in a wind-up that was a
whirlwind and a spirited affair all
the way through. Hornbuckle used a
straight left that was working all the
time, and though Murray sent him to the
carpet twice he managed to rally and
stall and at the end of the mill every
thing was his.
The rest of the bouts resulted as fol
lows: Jim Kane knocked out Jim Brad
ley in the third round, Joe Leahy stowed
Jack Gilroy in one round, Kyle Whitney
stowed Otto Knock away in two rounds,
Charles Webber outpointed Eddie Conroy
and Johnny Murphy secured the decision
over J. Erwin.

JURY IN WHITTIER
CASE STRIKES. SNAG
Puzzled Over a Point and In
structed to Find tor
Defendant.
In the suit of Nellie T. Henry against
\\ . F. Whlttler to recover damages for
alleged breach of promise, the jury yes
terday, after deliberation, could not agree
on the point involving the statute of limi
tations and Judge Buck instructed it to
bring In a verdict for the defendant.
Something that promised to develop Into
a scene during the trial yesterday oc
curred while Attorney T. C. Van Ness,
representing the defendant, was arguing
the case to. the 'jury. '.-Mr. -Van Ness said
that admittedly; Mr. Whlttier had given
Miss Henri' a few . small presents, but
they were simply as a reward to her for
her efforts to massage hla arms free of
rheumatism and out of consideration of
the fact that she was poor and needed the
things he gave her.
Mrs. Mamie Vayola, a sister -of the
plaintiff, resented the statement that any
member of her family was poor and
jumping to her feet, said: \u25a0
?"For one I won't stand for that state
ment. We are not so poor as you would
have people believe, and I. resent your
statement." :\u25a0 â¢ 7 7
"Sit down,"- sternly ordered Judge Buck.
"Any further interruption of these pro
ceedings .by You \u25a0" will result in judicial
condemnation of your conduct. You have
no right to interfere."
Mrs.' Vayola subsided and . argument
proceeded.'; It was nearly 5 o'clock when
the jury retired to deliberate.

Xfw York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, Dec. 8. â There was a rood
<W1 or excitrfinÂ«Â« in the money market con
d'.tior.g to-flay ar.d the stock market was in
c^'ri to feverlehness from time to time.
J>iH^<--!.":e8s there was a variety of vigorous
%tÂ£vu atlve movements and no Â»?rtous dam
Â£Â«<â¢ tc. values was shown, even at the -weak
- jÂ«ir.ts In the market. The money situation
Ir^'.-e'.ved the principal attention from the side
of p?' ? f'ble relief of the situation from the
adoption of measures by the Treasury Depart
rr.ent. There was a very persistent cocvic
t: r. that the Stcrelarj' of the Treasury was
about to deposit Government funds in the na
ti r.a'. banks or to take other measure* whi;h
wouid relieve the stringency of money In New
York. There was some disappointment on
the opening of the i-tock" market that no an
nouncemeot was awaiting the operators in
:h, market when thpy came down to business
ttr-day. Lattr it was asserted with great
l-i.^itiveness that an ar.nouncement would be
made in Washington at 1 o'clock of the action
t-j !>e taken. After the Cabinet meeting at
V/as-hinEtr-n. when S*crftarj- Shaw denied that
any action had bet^ tai;en or was immedi
ately contemplated, there were again some
signs of disapjtolEtment among speculative
curators, but this a^ain jjas?ed and prices
: stiffened up &caJn. The money market itstTf
: was less Feverefy stringent than yesterday.
â¢" It was EupiÂ»se4 that this was due to the
teSoeace: of the common expectation that ac
t: '. I y the Treasury Department was to be
taken to-day. The banks. however, made
larger offerings of funds at the Stock Ex
â¢ \u25a0 har.ge than yesterday, although the renewal
rat^ was commonly 20 per cent, as compared
with an oper.tr.g rate of IS per cent yester
: dB.v. By midday the rate had fallen consid
i drably and worked Mow 15 per cent before
"i>erat;ons were over for the day. As
Fridays loans carry over until Monday this
rrlaxa'ion Â«aÂ« r*gzr<ied as ail the more sig
nificant. The rates for foreign exchangt
moved up again and put an end to talk of
â¢Â»rsaÂ»jeTr;entB of Fold for import. The pre
ilmir.ary *-sthnates of the week's currency
toiov,?m<>ntE save r.o promise of anything but
a weak bai.it statement. The week* absorp
tion by the sub-treasury of $2,734,000 has
bÂ»en sujh lemented by a small movement on
balccce to the Interior on the regular Â«x
press m'jvÂ«-n-,ent. The indicated cash loss
liT'fore riws ever $3/>do.ooo, or considerably
ln Â»y ? than the purjilus oxistinjt last Satur
'V % I' WUI be seen, that these factors offered
no *j"?.t promise for money relief. The high
iatÂ»-s tor money at the end or the week, how
â¢ er, hay* un<i<->ubte<3ly turned some interior
fj;T>IiCF ihls- way. and there have been re- ;
< ' pta also from Canada. The rise in sterling;
(Kchmnse Â«a* regarded as slgniScant. Yes
t'-!-:Â«y'6 rew surTHen of money In London re
pnltlnK from \\~.e exchequer bond redemption
tr<- mostly in the control of the Bank of
]::e'.at;d, and it \e not cxjiected that, they
v U V* more than sufficient to correct the
vefckr.ess o' the reserve." of that institution,
tttllcn haÂ« been abnormal for the season for
|r-.n.< time vast. Exchange at Berlin and
Vienna also moved apair.st London to-day, in
iirnv.rs; the continued pressure from these
â¢â¢>urr-es upon London, wnich will lessen the
â¢jrobabllitj- of that market eurrenderinsr Bold.
While the tone of the stock market continued
to show remarkable resistance to the money
situation the volume of dealings showed some
contraction. The conspicuous upward move
ments were also in special etocka. Amalga
msTe^S f""op"w-r was especially strong, with a
I further advar.ee in the price of the metal, and
other industrial* interested in coowr moved
in sympathy. The rise In People" Â« Gas was
due to reports of an agreement with the
municipal authorities. Tennessee Coal was
under the influence still of supposed contest
for control. The Pacific* responded to the
*tr-.r.g showing r,f r.et earrings for October.
, Miry ctocks touched the highest of the day
in tlie 9nal hour under the influence of the
Amalgamated Copper movement, and the clos
' {:p ws etronÂ«.

. Vj THE COPPER STOCKS.
To-day'g market was the most active for
coppers In several years. Copper Range Bos
ton Consolidated. United Copper, North Butte
and Amalgamated, all showing extreme
strength and making new h!?h records without '
any reaction. It Is Impossible to pick out any j
epeclal buying, as every - brokerage house is I
activa In the market, but the volume of trad- '
ing Is the largest elnce 1&99. New York is
taking a prcminent part in our market, realiz
ing the value of dividend-paying copper stocks
and the floating supply around these prices is
beins rapidly lessened. The money market is
etill tight, and it does not seem possible for
the present pace to be continued without re
action.

XÂ«w York Cotton Market.
COTTONâ Our market opened 1 to "3 down
â¢nd trading was rather light during the early
session, with small traders evening up pend
ing the ginners' report. This was somewhat
larger than anticipated, and the market broke
some 30 points, but not as much as expected.
The buying on the decline was good. While
we have no comparison to go by, and the Gov
ernment not stating what per cent of the crop
remains to be ginned, it leaves us in doubt as
to the actual out-turn, but nevertheless the
world has . awakened to the fact that the crop
If small compared wlh previous years, and with
the trade conditions as they are to-day such
a croo will demand jrood criers.

the lowest point' of the day. rAt the opening

offerings and as a result a large portion of the
loss of yesterday -was regained,, May . advanc

continued small movement in - the Northwest.

\u25a0 Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The only noteworthy feature of the fruit
market was the arrival of about 5000 boxes of
Persian Datts of the 1905 crop. The receivers
asked 4%Â®5c psr pound, and quite a few sales
were reported at those figures. Local trade in
other lines was quiet, as usual on Friday,
and there being no movemtnt to speak of in
shipping channels, the market was quiet all
around. Gratis and Strawberries were offered
f.t Eharply reduced price 9, but found few buy
ers. thÂ»- Â«tock being too poor to attract trade.
ThÂ«re was very little doing in Apples, Pears
or Persimmons, and quotations for all three
descriptions were nominally unchanged. Some
Orange handlers reported a fair inquiry for
the large sizes of standard Navels, but the
upper grades were neglected. The other Citrus
goods were quiet at unchanged quotations.

off tho drydock and was tied up' to the
adjoining wharf. The origin of- the tire

DAMAGING TESTIMONY
IS GIVEN BY NURSES
Some Interesting; Tales -Pro
duqed at Trial of Cap
tain Rose.*
Miss Gretta . Hell Meuser and a Mrs.
Marguerite Salter, nurses in tho gen
eral hospital at 1 the Presidio, were
called as witnesses yesterday to testify
against Captain Robert \V. Rose, Twen
ty-first .Infantry, who is now being
tried by a . general court-martial on
charges unbecoming a gcnUraiuiriinii
I aii'omcer. While their testimony is de
! nied to the puulic, it is generally uhder-
I stood that it is, of a" very damaging
nature and sufficient, without other tes
| timony, to \yarrant the disjnissai oftne
captain from the service of the Army.
Captain Kose, it.'"now . appears,' nas
been .very unpopular with his superior
j officers for some time and it was Only
{ his rtne record while in Cuba aud some
! Influential friends, whohave evor stood
! by him,, that have stayed the court
martial to the present time. While In
the Philippines heleda life of dissipa
tion, which ; broke down his general
health, and after only a few months" 1
service in the .'islands he was sent to
the general hospital at the Presidio for
observation arid' treatment " for an af
flictibn contracted. in . the.islands.
He arrived from Manila on the trans
port Sheridan and was admitted to tne
hospital on October 13. On the follow
ing day he, had trouble -with the ward
surgeon and charges were filed against
him.These charges were never brought
to court, however, and the ' captain was
permitted to remain in the hospital un
til October 17, when he was charged
with a more serious offense and asked
to' leave. \-
It is alleged that during the four
days the captain was permitted: to re
main iii the hospital his conduct toward
the nurses wks not .the. best and on' the.
fourth day ; they "Were obliged ' to" ask
the commanding officer to protect them
from his" insults. - Charges were imme
diately preferred, and, -although his
friends again came -to his aid,' the of
fense was considered to be of such a
serious nature' that it could not be
overlooked. : "

With Diplomas in Hands
;\u25a0â¢.' The ; class * of i December, : 1905, of the

given an ; entertainment by the rest of
the'school. \u25a0 This entertainment consisted
in the presentation of a farce, "A Girl's
Secret," and was a pretty thing. .
There are six- hundred and fifty young
ladies at the Girls' High School, and' at
2 - o'clock yesterday afternoon they
whirred out of their classrooms and
rustled up the stairs to the big hall above
in animated disorder. There were prob
ably enough chairs for them all, but such
is not the; way of young femininity.
Nearly/every chair \u25a0 held j two, and there
were vacant rows at the sides and the
back.
The result was a very compact massing
of palpitating colon in the center of that
large hall and a medley jof i twitterings
that made of it a bird' cage." AlsoJthere
was a vague but unmistakable scent o!
caramels. When the twittering moderated
at times, (as it really did) it became a
humming, and that,-;? with the fragrant
caramels, changed the hall from a. birdi
cage to a bee. hive. .' J .
It was a very happy assemblage and it
needed little provocation 'to /cause explo
sions of crystalline laughter .that . shot'
Uke skyrockets to the dome above.- . The
young ladles laughed when their prin-'
cipal clove the curtain "and stood before.

NAVARRO SHOOTS
TO KILL BROWN
Because he thought he had been fcwin-
k dled'by "James Brown, a saloon-keeper,!
Joseph Navarro yesterday shot and seri
ously wounded Browv. The shooting oc
curred in.lhe'saloon ot Henry Horwege at
Pine and 6upont streets. As Brown ran
out of the place, the blood streaming from
a woundin his neck, Navarro fired at him
again, but missed. -He would have fired
the third time at the fleeing man, but Po
liceman John Farrell caueht his hand.
i-The injured man was taken to the Cen
tral; Emergency, Hospital, where he lies
in a precarious condition. Navarro is heid
: at. the City Prison pending developments.
He declares that he acted in self-defense.
He says that Brown struck him and would
have followed up the attack had he nut
shot to defend himself. Â» - r
Brown is the proprietor of a saloon at
the corner of Bacon place" and Pine street.
The saloon once belonged to Navarro. who
has been laboring under the delusion that
' nr -Teas ; "done" , out ; bf. it.
f ; When Navarro entered the saloon he ac
costed Brown in a' friendly manner and
invited * him ?to have a"- drink. Brown ac
cepted - and, the pair were conversing
amicably whefi Navarro drew a revolver
and fired: . The bullet narrowly missed the
jugular vein. * ;
Brown made the following statement to
-Warrant Clerk Costello: ; "The man imag
ines that I skinned him out of the saloon.
He has been sore at me ever since. When
I met him . this afternoon he seemed to be
friendly and *asked me . fo have 'a drink.
'I ; had no . quarrel - with him /&t/ &t all. He
shot me without any provocation." _
Navarro/ admitted to Detectives Bra!Â«
and * Taylor that he had \ not . carried the
revolver until : yesterday. The detectives
believe that it was a cold blooded attempt
to commit murder. â¢
