STRYCHNINE IS FOUND IN MRS. STANFORD'S STOMACH AND A BOTTLE
OF THE DEADLY POISON IS LOCATED BY POLICE IN NOB HILL MANSION
PRISON DOORS YAWN FOR THE MURDERER OF THE AGED PHILANTHROPIST
'HE analysis of the stomach of Mrs. Jane L. Stanford, at Honolulu, it is learned at a late hour this morning on
-^ positive authority, reveals the presence of strychnine. Yesterday a bottle containing the poison was found hid
den away at Mrs. Stanford's residence in this city. These two points are an important stride toward clearing up the
mystery, and arrests are likely to follow. It is now established that the aged philanthropist was murdered and
the discovery of the bottle of poison is regarded as clinching evidence against members of the household retinue.

The horror of the crime, the promi

and police are working on the case in
ninny cities. *
l At a late hour this moraine comes
the startling information that during;
a search of Mrs. Stanford's residence
on Nob Hill by detectives yesterday a
bottle containing: strychnine was
found. This brines the perpetration
of the murder close home, so to speak.
It is hardly to be believed that Mrs.

strychnine?

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1905.
DETECTIVES
KEEP THREE
UNDER WATCH
Still Imprisoned
in Stanford
Mansion.
With the seeming certainty of the
shadow on a dial circumstances are
slowly rounding to a point where the
police believe they will soon be able to
reveal to the world the identity of the
person or persons guilty of the coward
ly murder of Mrs. Jane Stanford.
Although it is known that Acting
Chief of Police Spillane, Captain of
Detectives Burnett and Captain Cal
lundan of Morse's Detective Agency,
who are harmoniously directing the in
vestigation of the mysterious case, are
united In their suspicions, and would
not hesitate long in making arrests, it
was learned yesterday that they agreed
at a conference to defer action in that
direction until the return of detectives
from Honolulu, whither they go to-day
on the steamship Alameda.
It is possible that an arrest may be
made a few days In advance of the re
turn of the officers, provided that in
the meantime unexpected develop
ments in Honolulu warrant the arrest
of any of the persons suspected.
As said in yesterday's Call, the in
vestigation by the police has finally
singled out three persons, closely con
nected with the household of the late
Mrs. Stanford, as the most likely cul
prits, and to these three the police
have added another name, that of a
man who may be proved an accom
plice in the diabolical crime.
There 1Â« no longer any reason to-con-

m Â»
ceai the names of those Involved in
the theory of the police, for even the
suspected persons know that suspicion
is upon them. They are under strict
guard and keenly appreciate that if
they should show any disposition to
leave their places of abode they would
be restrained by the officers of the law.
It will later devolve upon these per
sons to explain many matters connect
ed with the last days of Mrs. Stanford
in this city. Through their statements
the detectives hope to weave a thor
ough net of circumstantial evidence
around whatever one of them is guilty
of the crime and bring the latter be
fore the bar of justice, where he or she
will be called upon to plead to a
charge of murder. All the suspected
persons have already been subjected to
a questioning by the detectives work
ing on the case and much conflicting
testimony has been gathered.
JEALOUSIES EXIST.
The investigation has revealed the
fact that much ill feeling exists be
tween the former members of the
household of the late Mrs. Stanford.
Jealousy of an extreme form, that has
undoubtedly been responsible for many
cruel insinuations against others, has
been exhibited by at least two of the
persons now under police surveillance
and this fact has placed them in an
unenviable light. In fact, it has helped
the detectives In finding a possible mo
tive for the crime.
What the police are now most eager
ly seeking is a clew as to the time and
place of purchase of the strychnine
that was found in the bicarbonate of
soda taken by Mrs. Stanford. It is
the accepted theory that the person

Servants.
who placed the poison in the Poland
water In Mrs. Stanford's California
street home also mixed the deadly
drug with the contents of thÂ» small
bottles of soda she carried in her trunk
to Honolulu. As has already been pub
lished, two packages of bicarbonate of
soda have been found by the detect
ivesâone at her home in Palo Alto, the
othfr in her house on California-street
hill. The package at Palo Alto was
in its original form when discovered
and when analyzed showed that it had
in no way been tampered with. The
package of soda found in the medicine
closet in Mrs. Stanford's room at the
California-street mansion had been
opened and a portion of the contents
(a proportion sufficient to flu the bottle
ohe took to Hawaii) removed. As in
the first case of analysis, the soda
taken from the California-street house
proved to be pure.
Naturally the inference drawn by the
police is that Mrs. Stanford, foresee
ing the probability of a need of bi
carbonate of soda during her ocean
trip to Honolulu, caused a small bottle
to be filled with a portion of the con
tents of the package of powder found
later in Ihe closet; and then immedi
ately arises the theory that some one
very close to the much-loved woman
stealthily mixed the powder with ihe
poison and placed the bottle where it
would be noticed and packed away In
her trunk.
POLICE SEEK MOTIVES.
Who were the persons so close to
Mrs. Stanford? is the police query,
and the answer is forthcoming. They
were Miss Berner, Mrs. Stanford's pri
vate secretary, who had been Intrust
ed with nearly every secret possessed
by the departed woman; Miss Elizabeth
Richmond, a maid; Miss Nora Hop
kins, also a maid, and Ah Wing, the
faithful old Chinese, who was down
in Mrs. Stanford's household ledger as
cook, but who waa more of a body ser

CHEMISTS DEVELOP
TRACES OF POISON
DURING ANALYSES
MAKE REPORT TO POLICE
Local Authorities Receive Bot
tle That Contained Fa
tal Grains.
All doubts that may have existed
here during the last three days as to
whether Mrs. Stanford's death was
due to strychnine poisoning were dis
pelled yesterday when a brief message
was received by the police to the ef
fect that the Honolulu chemists had
discovered traces of the drug in a por
tion of the woman'B stomach that is
under examination.
The fact that only a portion of the
stomach had been analyzed suggest
ed to Attorney Wilson, whose wisdom
is being accepted by Acting Chief of
Police Spillane and Captain of De
tectives Burnett, inasmuch" as he is
well acquainted with the legal phases
of the case, the advisability of having
a more thorough analysis made. Ac
cordingly a cablegram was sent to
Honolulu directing the chemists to
make an analysis of the entire stom
ach and also the other organs of the
dead woman. It was these instruc
tions that were responsible for the de
lay of the arrival of the eagerly look
ed for report from the islands.
Later In the afternoon the authori
ties of Honolulu sent word that the
chemists had commenced their work
and expected to complete it some time
this afternoon. The brief announce
ment of the discovery of poison in Mrs.
Stanford's stomach was most timely,
for to-day the local detectives leave on
the steamship Alameda for the scene
of the recent tragedy and eagerly
awaited this information as a guide
for their work in Honolulu, which they
will map out on their voyage.
Ever since the first news of Mrs.
Stanford's death was received here her
brother, Charles Lathrop, and a num
ber of friends, among them Dr. David
Alto. As to any possible guilt being
attached to Miss Berner, the police ap
pear and in fact pretend to take lit
tle stock in the suggestion that she
might have had any motive in ridding
the world of a mistress who had
seemingly loved her, reposed in her ev
ery confidence, built her a handsome
home for her parents in Palo Alto, paid
her the magnificent salary of J2OO a
month, taken her abroad with her and
finally made her a beneficiary in her
â¢will.
Here is the argument set up by the
head of the detective force in rebuttal
of the frequent Insinuations against
Miss Berner:
"If," says he, "the theory that tlie
same person was guilty of the two
crimes of poisoning Is entertained, does
it not appear unreasonable to suspect
that Miss Berner, a smart and clever
woman, after failing in one attempt to
poison her mistress, when It would
have been possible to shift the sus
picion to others by whom Mrs. Stan
ford was surrounded, would be Insane
enough to repeat the crime In far away
Honolulu, where she would have no
chance to place the blame on others,
who were not with her there, and when
she knew that several detectives here
had been thoroughly Investigating the
circumstances surrounding the first
case? And then arises the question as
to what motive Miss Berner could have
had other than a very poor one of
hastening the transler to her of a lump
sum of money that Mrs. Stanford's
will provided should go to her after
the death of her mistress."
TRYING THEORIES.
Eliminating Miss Berner from the
circle of suspicion the police have
found themselves vigorously scenting
the trail of > - 'instances that involve
the names of >nds Richmond, Miss
Hopkins and the factotum of the Stan
ford household, Ah Wing. The latters
case is quite a serious one to the head
of the city's detective force. It has
been claimed by many of Mrs. Stan
ford's old friends, and even a few of
her relatives, that Ah Wing was the
most devoted being that ever crossed
her threshhold and served in her em
ploy. It is set forth that Wing, be
lieving that he was to be remembered
in the will of his mistress and know
ing that nte position, with a salary and
many perquisites, to which few Chi
nese in this country are accustomed,
was pert ectedly contented with his con
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Starr Jordan, have been a bit Skepti
cal about the report and were not in
clined to accept the murder theory
until more definite Information waa
received. Now that all doubts are
cleared away it is expected that the
relatives of the dead woman will
exert every possible energy to assist
the authorities In gaining the neces
sary clews that will bring to â¢artii
the person guilty of the terrible crime.

who had been working on the first case
of attempted poisoning.
Whether this bottle is the one from
which the murderer took thÂ° poison
that was placed in the Poland water
that Mrs. Stanford drank and later in
the bicarbonate of soda which caused
her death is a secret that tho police
will not divulge. When seen last night
regarding the reported discovery of thÂ«
strychnine Captain Callundan immedi
ately turned inquisitor, but when he
found that his interviewer possessed
only the meager facts he refused to
talk further, shielding himself behind
the well worn excuse that whatever In
formation he had in the case of Mrs.
Stanford belonged to Attorney Wilson
and Charles Lathrop and It remained
for them to first divulge It.
Both Attorney Wilson and Charles
Lathrop were as silent as Callundan
on the subject, the former explaining
that there are many matters in con

thought of jeopardizing them. Further
it is said by those who are in sym
pathy with the Mongolian servant, that
he had had many and better oppor
tunities to murder his mistress and at
times when he could have gained pos-Â»
session of large sums of money which
he, and he alone, knew were secreted

All this sounds- food to the ears of
everybody but the police. In their
years of experience with crime in thÂ«
Chinese quarter they have not
strengthened their sentiment In favor"
of the Mongolian and while willing* to
concede that Ah Wing may bo an ex
emplary Chinese servant and worthy
of all the confidence that was reposAd
in him by Mrs. Stanford and her rel
atives, they have their own views and
are acting in Wing's case as they deÂ«m
proper under the mysterious circum
stances in which the supposed murder
is enveloped.
Wing had been in the employ of
the Stanfords for over twenty-one
years â a circumstance, so thÂ« police
contend, that might be used against
him in advancing a theory that would
seriously involve him in the killing of
Mrs. Stanford. Every Chinese, as near
ly every one !n San Francisco knows,
looks forward to the time when ha â¢
may return to the flowery kingdom
and live out his remaining years in
the comforts that his accumulated
wealth may afford him. Wing is ad
vanced In age and probably, had Mrs.
Stanford lived a few more years, her
servant would have resijrned his Job
and returned to China. It is not beyond
a possibility, the police argue, that
Wing had already made up his mind
to return to the Orient and longed to
get the money which he had been In
formed Mrs. Stanford's will provided
he should some day revive. Of course,
all of thL? is on'y theory and the po
lice candidly say that they have not
yet got any damaging evidence against
Wing, but are holding him as a matter
of precaution, if not as a suspect, cer
tainly as a valuable witness, who will
be needed whenever the trial of thm
accused murderer is begun.

STRYCHNINE IN
POLAND WATER
Chemist Makes Report
in Local Poison
ing Case.
The following is the report that
Chemist L,. Falkenau made to Mrs.
Stanford of his analysis of the Poland
water of which she drank when pois
oned in this city on January 14:
"San Francisco, Jan. 31, 1905.
"Mrs. Jane L. Stanford.
"Dear Madam â A more thorough ex
amination of the liquid and residue
contained in an open bottle labeled
'Poland Water,' in which strychnia
had been found by qualitative examin
ation, led to the tollow:ns conclusions:
"The strychnia was in the form of
the crystallized alkaloid and was prob
ably impure. The total amount of
fixed matter contained in a fresh sealed
bottle at Poland Water' received frc-m
LÂ»r. Boerkke equals 8 parts in 100,000
parts and reacts slightly alkaline.
The total amount of fixed matter con
tained in the liquid examined equals
36.3 parts per 100,000 parts. Strychnia
is soluble at the rate of about 14.8 parts
in 100,000 of waterâ pure water. The
solution examined was a cold saturated
solution, as there was about its equal
weight of ur.dissolved strychnia found
with it; consequently, assuming that
the Poland water was in both cases
identical, there are only 22.S out of
36.3 parts in 100,000 accounted for, the
balance probably consisting <-f Impuri
ties or admixtures of the strychnia
originally introduced.
"a water-glass full, 5 fluid ounces,
would hold in solution about 0.8 grains
of strychnia. According to Taylor's
Medical Jurisprudence, 0.5 grains of
strychnia pro-ved fatal in the case of
Dr. Warren in fourteen minutes, but
people have been known to recover
from doses of seven grains. The ordi
nary doso (U. S. D.) is one-twentieth
of a grain.
"The very small amount of material
originally submitted to us made it lm
posaible to determine the nature and
quantity of other substances than
strythnia and the residue of the Poland
water. The undissolved strychnia was
not in the form of powder, but in
broken crystals. There were indica
tions of traces of brucine in the
strychnia, which points to its being
a common article of commerce."
it aeems strange that more precau
tions were nc-t taken to protect the life
of Mrs. Stanford, once it was posi
tively known from the chemist's report
that murder had been attempted. A
f.;rave responsibility would appear to
rest somewhere because the confiding
woman with years heavy upon her was
not guarded from fiendish hands.
Frc-m all accounts no steps were
taken to save her from harm. Even
the investigation that followed was
not carried out to definite results.
To the public every effort was made
to discredit the reports that Mrs. Stan
ford had been poisoned and that her
life was spared only because her stom
ach rebelled against an overdose which
it could not assimilate. Persistently It
was asserted that the sensational
rumors were the result of a canard
that irresponsible servantÃ had started

ALL SUSPECTS
WITHIN REACH
Burnett Is Ready to Act
When the Evidence
Is Complete.
"Everybody we will want is within
reach," declared Captain Burnett yes
terday after a visit to the Stanford
mansion and a consultation with At
torney Mountford Wilson and Captain
J. J. Callundan of the Morse detective
agency.
The California-street mansion, where
the first attempt was made upon the
life of Mrs. Jane Stanford, was visited
in the morning by Captain Burnett,
Captain J. J. Callundan and Detective
Harry Reynolds. A statement from
Ah Wing, the cook suspected by Miss
Berner, was obtained by Captain Cal
lundan.
The purpose of visiting the house,
Captain Burnett says, was to familiar
ize himself with the rooms. He tried
to question the suspected Chinaman,
but the Oriental sullenly refused to
comprehend the questions put to him
by the captain of detectives.
The three detectives went carefully
over every inch of the mansion. Spe
cial inspection was made of the room
where Mrs. Stanford swallowed the
poisoned Poland water. A minute ex
amination was made of the quarters
occupied by Ah Wing.
All thrco detectives are reticent as
to the result of their investigations. It
was intended to keep the visit to the
mansion secret in accordance with ihta
plan of veiling all suspicions and evi
dence until the proper time.
Immediately after the consultation
Detective Harry Reynolds was detailed
on the case. The results ol the con
ference were closely guarded.
It is known that details implicating
members of Mrs. Stanford's household
were handed over to the captain of the
detectives, and the local police are
ready to act with a rush whon the de
layed result of the inquest is given
out.
"We are waiting results from Hon
olulu," said Captain Burnett. "Every
body wp want is? within our reach. We
can arrest, them any time we want
them."
In reference to the servants held
dose prisoners in the Stanford house
hold, the captain of detectives said:
"We are holding no one under close
surveillance. 1 do not know that thoge
people are being held. They are not
imprisoned by my orders."
Though the local police will not
expose their hands untn the complete
reports arrive from Honolulu, they are
not lying idle.
On returning from the conference
with Wilson and Callundan, Captain
Burnett held a long consultation witfi
Acting Chief John Spillane. It is evi
dent that they are laying plans that
are nearly completed.
It is common gossip and generally
understood that the results of the
analysis are being purposely withheld
in order that the local detective force
may complete the chain of evidence
they seem confident they have ob
tained.
"Something may happen any min
ute," admitted Captain Burnett yester
day afternoon. "We are expecting it
and we are ready to act at a moment's
notice. We are expecting word at any
time.
"The people out of town, Beverley and
Miss Richmond, are where we can
reach them. They are not being
guarded by my men, but we are cer
tain of them if they are wanted."
The entrance to the Stanford man
sion on California Btreet is carefully
guarded. No one is permitted to even
go near the door of the place where
the first attempt was made on the dead
philanthropist's life.
The inmates are being closely
watched by private detectives. Wheth
er any evidence regarding the first at
tempt has been found the watchers in
the mansion will not say.
The entire force of detectives is
watching night and day on the trails
of every possible 6uspect. The trap is
being laid and the signal for it to be
sprung will come from Honolulu. When
the results of the chemists' analysis

TECTIVES WORKING ON THE
CASE AND TWO SUSPECTS.
MISS RICHMOND
IN DEEP GRIEF
Feels Keenly Tact That
Suspicion Is Cast
on Her.
PALO ALTO, March 3.â "There is no
question in my mind but what Mrs.
Stanford was poisoned. She never
committed suicide. Life was too dear
to her." These were the words of Miss
Elizabeth Richmond, who was Mrs.
Stanford's maid for nearly two years
and was in her employ up to January
27. Miss Richmond was in the room
in the California-street home of Mrs.
Stanford on January 14, the day when
the first attempt was made to poison
her mistress.
Miss Richmond said t^-'Jay: "I am
sensitive of the terrible clou ' that rests
upon us and I want to have the de
tectives clear the matter up. Until
they find the perpetrator of this awful
deed I shall never be at rest. Where
erer 1 shall go, no matter to what part
of the world, I shall always Imagine
that I can see people pointing their
fingers at me and whispering to one
another: 'There is the woman who
was present when Mrs. Stanford drank
the poisoned mineral water.' I only
wish this matter could be cleared up.
I have been with Mrs. Stanford con
stantly for one year and nine months.
Mrs. Stanford talked to me on every
subject. She frequently spoke of re
ligion. 'The stories that are afloat that
phe was a spiritualist and that she had
made a deep study of occultism are
without foundation. She was very
broad-minded and investigated all re
ligions and creeds. She has always
been in accord with the Episcopal
faith.
"At one] time she said to me after a
long' discussion on religious ' matters:
'Miss Richmond, if it had not
been for one little thing I should
have been a Roman Catholic' She
then : added, . -There . 'â â  is good â â  In
all :> religions ; and : I;, am interest
ed , In, them . all.' As I ; said before,
life was : very dear to Mrs. Stanford,
and for this reason she wag continu
ally â  planning for the improvement * of
the Leland Stanford Jr. University.
That thought L was always uppermost In
her mind. She has said to me dozens of
times," 'I : hope m".. life will be spared '-: to
me for many years to come, that I may
be able to-fully, carry out : the ideas of
my departed husband.',.'' ','.; '
"The report: that her mind was fail

bright, and > remarkably so for, a wo
man of her age. v' Her i memory was

In the mansion on the hill where
Mrs. Stanford's life waÂ« attempted are
Ah Wing, the cook, whom Miss Berner
suspected; Lee, second oook; Wong,
second butler, and Misa Mary Gaffney.
The latter is not regarded as a suspect,
as she was not in Mrs. Stanford's em
ploy when the attempt was made, and
the theory is that the poison that was
found in the bicarbonate of soda bottle
was put there at the same time the
first attempt, was made.
Yesterday afternoon there was evi
WILSON THINKS
IT WAS MURDER
"In Interest of Justice"
Refuses to Discuss
Suspicions.
Mountford S. Wilson, the .attorney j
who is looking after Mrs. Stanford's |
affairs, at last admits that in his opin
ion Mrs. Stanford met death by pois
on administered with purpose to take
her lire.
"It certainly looks now as if Mrs.
Stanford was poisoned and that it is
a case of murder," he said yesterday.
Then he was pressed for informa
tion as to whom he suspectea, and his
answer was: â 
"In the interest of justice I must
refuse to discuss the matter."
The attorney had several consulta
tions during the day with Captain J. J.
Callundan of the Morse detective
agency and devoted himself during the
day to directing the Investigations. He
worked on the theory that the guilty
persons had been definitely ferreted
out.
Wilson refused to divulge the con
tents of Mrs. Stanford's will, from
which some important light might be
thrown on the tragedy. On the theory
that the motive for the crime lay in
the bequests that Mrs. Stanford had
provided for her household, knowl
edge of the contents would strongly
reinforce deductions.
The testament has undoubtedly
beef* opened by the lawyer in order
to assist the detectives. It is believed
that the suspects were aware of what
was bequeathed to them, for Mrs. i
Stanford in her loving kindness had
undoubtedly talked to some of them
of the provisions she had made.
Charles G. Lathrop is now more in
clined to the belief that his sister was
murdered, though he refuses to ex
press an opinion.
Whitelaw Reid of New York who is
one of the trustees of Stanford Uni- !
versity, called yesterday on Mr. L,a- j
throp and Attorney Wilson. During |
the winter he has been residing at j
Millbrae. He will be present at the I
meeting of the trustees on March 11. j
dence around the Hall of Justice that
developments were expected momenta
rily. The murder of Mrs. Stanford was
the sole topic of discussion.
"Give every assistance in your pow
er" are the orders of Actinp Chief
Spillane to the Captain of Detectives.
The Acting Chief has been informed j
of all the evidence gathered and the
accusations heard by the detectives,
but is unwilling to declare on whom
suspicion points.
"We are waiting for a message from
Honolulu," said the Chief. "We ex
j pect it any minute. Then we will act."
Last night one of the results of the
| conference held by Captain Burnett,
1 Attorney Wilson and Captain Callun
i dan was given out. Detective Reynolds i
!is to leave for Honolulu to-day. Ac- j
cording to Acting Chief Spillane he will \
interview Miss Berner as to every de
tail of the attempted poisoning and
the murder of Mrs. Stanford.
This was the principal reason of â¢
i Reynolds' visit to the Stanford man- |
! sion. He wag to gather what threads
I of evidence hÂ« could find here so as to
I have a grip on the case when he :
reached Honolulu.
Captain Callundan has promised j
Captain Burnett that he will give him j
a history of the case from the start.

ceived last night by Captain Spillane

TAKES VOYAGE
AS COMPANION
Miss Hunt Recently
Went Back to Posi
tion She Had Left
Miss May Hunt, the maid who was
with Mrs. Stanford on her last trip to
Honolulu and at her beside when she
died in agony resulting from the
strychnine, has been in Mrs. Stanford's
employ for many years. In all this
time- she was treated with great con
sideration by her mistress and during
a period of four years, when she en
tered upon a business venture in this
city, she was financially assisted by
Mrs. Stanford.
Miss Hunt's mother was a matron at
the St. Mathew's School at San Mateo,
and it was through her that Miss Hunt
came to enter the employ of Mrs. Stan
ford. At that time the young; woman
became a maid in the Stanford man
sion on Nob Hill and her gentle man
ner and refinement won her the confi
dence of the woman by whom she was
employed.
In 1900 Miss Hunts mother left her
position with St. Mathew's School and
came to this city and her daughter, de
siring to be with her mother, decided
to leave the Nob Hill residence. During
Miss Hunt's period of service with Mrs.
Stanford she had saved tt considerable
sum from the bounty of her mistress,
and with this she decided to open a
lodging-house.
This lodging-house was situated at
1029 Franklin street, between Ellis and
O'Farrell. and Miss Hunt conducted it
for nearly five years. During this time
she made several calla on Mrs. Stan
ford at her residence, and was always
received with courtesy and cordiality.
At first these visits were merely social
on the part of Miss Hunt, but later, as
Ihe lodging-house proved a financial
failure. Miss Hunt appealed to Mrs.
Stanford for assistance, and was gen
erously aided.
Soon after Miss Hunt opened the
lodging-house Mrs. Stanford decided to
take a trip to Europe. The fact that
Miss Hunt left Mrs. Stanford's employ
to be near her mother precluded the
possibility of the maid accompanying
her. During the trip abroad Mrs.
Stanford was accompanied by a
courier.
Soon after Mrs. Stanford's return the !
position of maid was again offered j
Miss Hunt, but the lodging-house was ,
doing fairly well and the offer was de- }
clined. Upon Miss Hunt's refusal of
the position Miss Elizabeth Richmond |
was engaged and continued until a |
few days after the poisoning in Jan- j
vary last.
Subsequent to the poisoning Mrs. '
Stanford was advised by Dr. Boericke
to seek a more salubrious clime and
she decided to take the Honolulu trip.
In the meantime Miss Hunt ,had given |
up the lodging-house and accepted the I
position of maid to Mrs. Stanford for j
the trip to the islands.
She was engaged by Mrs. Stanford !
in the tirst week of February of this j
year and assisted Miss Berner in the i
preparation of the luggage and ar- i
rangements for the ocean trip.

DEATH RECALLS EVENT
**On February 6 Mrs. Stanford en
tered the Stanford Pharmacy and
asked for three ounces of bicarbonate
of soda. She asked ma to place it in a
bottle with a neck large enough to per
mit a gpoon to enter. M 133 Bertha
Berner, the secretary, who accompa
nied Mrs. Stanford, said, 'Never mind
a bottle. Wrap it in paper. We have
a bottle at the house for holding bi
carbonate of soda.' " * -
This is the statement of W. E. Jack
son, head clerk of the Stanford Phar
macy on University avenue, Palo Alto,
and he is certain that this is the bi
carbonate of soda that Mrs. Stanford
took on the flight of the poisoning in
Honolulu. There was no possible
chance of the strychnine being mixed
with the fciearboTiate of soda in the
drug store and no strychnine has been
sold there for several months.
When the word of the poisoning
reached Palo Alto, Jackson looked up
the record of the sale and took the
original package of soda, from, whirh
he took the three ounces aaked for by
Mrs. Stanford, to his attorney.
Jackson says that Mrs. Stanford
drove in from the Hotel Vendome In
San Jose, accompanied by Miss Berner.
After he placed the soda in the paper
the couple drove to the estate. Jark
son has been employed in the Palo
Alto Pharmacy for four years and has
an excellent reputation.

In fact, every movement made in the
case seems to he made at the instiga

It is certain that no arrests will be
made here until the chemists have
completed their investigations. Sheriff
Henry declares that he will take no
decisive action until he is certain be
yond a shadow of doubt that Mrs.
Stanford's death was caused by strych
nine poisonmg.
'T'ntil that time we can make little
progress in the investigation," he says.
The stomach of Mrs. Stanford is
closely guarded by the police in the
Board of Health building. Two chem
ists are constantly on duty going for
ward with the work of making the
analysis. The task is presided over by
City Chemist R. A. Duncan.
The town is in a ferment over the
affair and the morbidly curious have
to be kept away from the building.

aging 1 expressions of opinion regarding
the guilt of another of : his late mis
tress' employes. Whom he has ac
cused is a secret with the police, but
it is admitted that Wing does not sus
pect Miss Bernor.
Strangely, Miss Berner, notwith
standing statements to < the contrary,
has said that she suspected that Wing
had pome guilty knowledge of the
first attempt to poison Mrs. Stanford.
Miss Berner's mother' has admitted to
the police that her daughter intimated
to her shortly after the discovery was
made that poison had been placed in
the Poland water and that Wing was
under suspicion.
While, seemingly willing that some
of their movements in connection ; with
Ah Wing.. should become public, the
police are trying to . guard with \ the
greatest '.secrecy every ; act, ; theory: and
lact concerning Miss Richmond, who.
with the former Stanford butler, Bev
erly, is \ being closely, watched at the
tatter's home on San' Mateo Heights.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1905.
the Attorney General was at variance
with the local police. He was indig
nant over the article and declares that
it is grossly untrue.
The strain of the implied suspicions
is wearing on Miss Burner and May
Hunt. Both show evidence of the
â train and avoid being seen. Miss
Berner seemed annoyed when the
publication of her statement regarding
Ah Wing was revealed to her.
"I will talk no more except upon the
advice of my attorney," she said. May
Hunt is equally uncommunicative,
both acting under advice.
Speculation is rife as to what will
be the immediate action of the High
Sheriff when the result of the analysis
or of the investigations of the San
Francisco police warrant an arrest or
several arrests. Theories of all sorts
are plentiful here, but the most pop
ular one is that the poison was placed
In the bicarbonate of soda bottle In
San Francisco.
The Sheriff has received requests
from Mrs. Stanford's relatives that
every organ in the dead woman's body
be turned over to the chemists. It is
evident that they are now satisfied
that she was murdered.
A rumor that a second bottle con
taining strychnine was found in Mrs.
Stanford's medicine chest Is denied by
the police. They declare that there
were no traces of strychnine found in
any of the bottles except the one con
taining bicarbonate of soda.
Up to 11 p. m. the chemists were
still at work on their analyses. No
results were given out, but a complete
report is expected to-day.
Although not the slightest intimation
is being given by tho head of the de
tective force that he has a particle of
evidence to substantiate a charge of
guilt against Miss Richmond, it is well
known that of all the suspicions enter
tained by the Police Department and
the detectives of the Morse agency
the strongest are being directed to
ward the former maid of the woman
lying dead In Honolulu.
In searching back in the career of
Miss Richmond it has been found that
she and Beverley were not kindly dis
posed toward Miss Berner, a fact the
police attribute to jealousy. It is said
that there were frequent attempts
made by members of Mrs. Stanford's
household to discredit Mtss Berner in
the mind of her mistress, but that tho
latter, whose confidence in her private
secretary could not be shaken, met
these efforts with a prompt rebuke that
only tended to intensiry me ill feeling
of those who were arrayed against
Miss Berner. Within the past forty
hour? Miss Richmond has publicly
stated that she had rÂ«j idea who the
murderer cc/uld be, but was willing to
assist the police in every way to find
the guilty one. In statements made to
members uf the detective force who
have subjected her to examinations,
Miss Richmond is said to have occa
sionally thrown out bitter insinuations
against Miss Berner and in a manner
that has suggested to the police that,
if the former maid was not inclined to
suspeot Miss Berner of the awful crime
that the officers are trying to trace to
a perpetrator, she would not be sorry
if the guilt could be fixed upon thÂ«
woman who stood between her and
Mrs. Stanford.
BEVERLY IS BITTER.
Beverly also seems to entertain a
similar feeling in the matter and shows
much uneasiness since the discovery
was made that he is being shadowed.
As a matter of fact, and Miss Rich
mond has long been aware of it, the
former maid and the butler, now liv
ing on San Mateo Heights, have been
under the watchful eye or the detec
tives of the Morse agency or of the
regular force for a number of months.
Criminal history contains many in
stances where persons, with minds
soured against other members of the
households In which they have long
been employed, have plotted to undo
those against whom they were embit
tered. To attempt the poisoning of a
person with the unholy idea of cast
ing the blame upon an innocent one
has been a theory that the local police
havp not ignored in their careful in
vestigation of the murder of Mrs.
Stanford, not that they particularly
expected to trace such a heinous mo
tive to Miss Richmond and bring
Beverly into the shadow of the gal
lows as an accomplice, but with the
vague hope of possibly fixing a crime
of that character on any member of
the Stanford household.
Miss Berner was frequently the last
to see Mrs. Stanford before she re
tired. If her mistress wanted a drink
of any particular medicine or water it
was often the case that Miss Berner
would order the maid or Wing to bring
it and then serve it to Mrs. Stanford
when the servants had retired. Had
any one in the Stanford house sought
to unjustly fasten a crime upon Miss
Berner no opportunity for successfully
accomplishing such a deed would prob
ably have offered itself than the scene
at night when the private secretary
and her benefactress were left alone in
the latter's apartments.
MISS HUNT FREE.
Although Miss Hunt, who accompa
nied Mrs. Stanford to Honolulu, has
been named in connection with those
who had access at all times to her mis
tress' private apartments, it was em
phatically said yesterday by one of the
police detectives working on the case
that as yet not the slightest suspicion
has been attached to her. Similar are
the facts, in so far as the police are con
cerned, regarding Miss Nora Hopkins,
one of Mrs. Stanford's maids, who is
now staying at the Stanford home in
Palo Alto. Miss Hopkins has never
been under suspicion. Several times
she has been visited by detectives at
Palo Alto and this fact gave rise to
the impression that she is being
watched. Two days ago she suddenly
left Palo Alto, and the story was cir
culated that she had departed myste
riously, but investigation yesterday re
vealed the fact that she had been hur
riedly summoned by the police to this
city to furnish them certain informa
tion, and after a two hours' stay at the
Hall of Justice she returned to Palo
Alto, where she has since remained.
Yesterday morning Captain Burnett,
Captain Callundan and Detective Rey
nolds visited the Stanford berne <>n
California street and made a careful
inspection of the upper fioor of th*Â»
premises with a view to familiarizing
Detective Reynolds with the situation
in order that he would be better able
to work upon the various theories as to
the source of the poison given Mrs.
Stanford on the night she partook of
Poland water. Before leaving the house
the officers held a long talk with Ah
Wing and Mary Gaffney, the present
housekeeper. During the afternoon the
detectives were ir. consultation with
Attorney Wilson at his office, and there
learned that another day will elapse
before there will be definitely learned
from Honolulu the result of the au
topsy on Mrs. Stanford's remains.

SELBY JURORS
ARE FOR MERCY
In Judge Lawlor's court last night
I^aac Selby was found guilty of as
sault with intent to commit murder.
His offense consisted of firing a re
volver at Judge Hebbard in his court
100m in November.
Accompanying the verdict of guilty
was a strong recommendation for
mercy, owing to the testimony intro
duced tending to prove the unbalanced
condition of the accused man's mind.
When the case was called yesterday
Mrs. Teresa Selby, the divorced wife
of the defendant and the person over
whom the trouble arose, testified as to
her ex-husband's freaks. J. Larsen. a
locksmith who had known Selby in
Australia, said that the man labored
under Borne queer hallucinations. The
jury retired soon after 4 o'clock, and
its verdict was returned three hours
later.
dering who could have committed the
awful deed that brought Mrs. Stanford
to her untimely end. The question of
Mrs. Stanford's death having possibly
been wrought by her own hand is now
entirely dispelled. The students are
loth to believe, however, that any one
could have been instrumental in re
moving one from earth who has done
nothing but shower kindnesses upon
her feFlow men. The name of the be
loved benefactress has been on the lips
of every student here to-day. They
all ask the same question and that is.
"What was the motive? Why should
she have been poisoned?"
The gay college life has for the nonce
been entirely dispelled. Everything
about the campus is quiet and students
go to and from recitations talking in
subdued undertones. Charles G. Lath
rop, the brother of the poisoned wo
man, departed on an early train for
San Francisco this morning. Prior to
his leaving here a number of employes
in the Southern Pacific Company who
had been befriended by Mrs. Stanford
gathered about Lathrop and expressed
to him their sympathy in his great be
reavement. Lathrop was much over
come by the simple testimonial of af
fection for his sister. His eyes filled
with tears and he was unable to speak,
so he mutely shook hands and then
hurried on board his train.
Detectives from San Francisco have
been closeted with Robert Berner. the
brother of Bertha Berner, but Robert
has refused to give out what the pur
port of the visit was and. in fact, tried
to evade the question that they had
been there at all. However, the fact
remains that one of the shrewdest men
In the detective business has this end

Miss Bertha Berner, Mrs. Stanford's

at Oconomowoc and was a schoolmate

she left Oconomowoc and went to Cali

LEAVE TO-DAY FOR HONOLULU.
Dr. David Starr Jordan, Timothy J.
Hopkins and Detectives to Sail.
To-day will mark a new step In the
police investigation of the poisoning of
Mrs. Stanford. Captain Jules Caluan
dan of Morse's agency, who has had
full charge of the case for the Stan
ford interests, and Detective Harry
Reynolds of the local department will
leave this morning at 11 o'clock on the
Oceanic Steamship Company's boa-t
Alameda from the Pacific-street dock.
Captain Callundan, who is the pick
of Morse's agency, probably knows
more about the case than any other
man. He was immediately given
charge of the entire Investigation at
the time of the first poisoning in Jan-,
vary and has been working thoroughly
and patiently since that time.
On behalf of the trustees of the Le
land Stanford Jr. University, Presi
dent David Starr Jordan of the uni
versity and Timothy J. Hopkins of the
board of trustees will also leave on the
Alameda for Honolulu. They may ar
rive in time to return with Mrs. Stan
ford's body on the China, which is
due here on the 16th. During Dr. Jor
dan's absence Vice President Branner
will take charge of the affairs of the
university.
RETURNS TO PALO ALTO.
Rumor of Nora Hopkins' Disappear-
ance Is Dissipated.
A sensational rumor was started yes
terday that Nora Hopkins, a maid at
the Stanford mansion In Palo Alto, had
suddenly disappeared 'from the college
town. It was set at rest later in the
day by the return of Mis 3 Hopkins to
the residence in Palo Alto. The report
gained large proportions that Miss
Hopkins had fled and that the police
were frantically searching for her.
Miss Hopkins was summoned to San
Francisco Thursday by Mountford S.
Wilson to confer with the detectives
employed in the case and the necessity
for catching a train on short notice oc
casioned her hasty departure and the
circulation of th 9 rumors.
Miss Hopkins stayed over night in
San Francisco and returned to the
Stanford Palo Alto residence yesterda-y
morning and at the train refused to
make any statement. She said that she
was admonished by the detectives to
say nothing.

NEWCHWANG, March S, 10 p. m.,
via Tientsin. â The Japanese have oc
cupied the first Russian station east of
the Liao River. The Mukden trail is
closed and persons who have invested
thousands of dollars In contraband
goods are threatened with bank
ruptcy. It is reported that there is a
large Russian force at the second sta
tion east of Liao.
ST. PETERSBURG. March 3. 5:30
p. m. â According to the latest informa
tion from the front,, the battle is now
general and of the most desperate
character. The losses have been ex
ceedingly heavy on both sides during
the preliminary fighting. Although It
is not officially admitted, it is regarded
as certain that General Kuropatkin Is
directing all his efforts to the with
drawal of his army to Tie Pass. It is
now practically a rear guard action,
but the task of extricating himself is
proving very difficult. The Japanese
have not only driven In his left, but a
column is already reported to have
crossed the Hun River east of Fushun.
At the same time the Japanese are
pressing the Russian center under cov
er of the flrf- of their eiege guns and
General Kuropatkin is gradually retir
ing before tb2 Japanese advance. The
efforts of the Japanese to envelop the
Russian right wing have been unsuc
cessful, but It has been forced back
almost on a line with Mukden.
Two Russian divisions were dis
patched to head off the wide flanking
column advancing from the Liao Riv
er toward Sinnintin (about thirty miles
west of Mukden), but according to the
latest advices they were too late, the
Japanese having entered the town yes
terday.
No official figures regarding the
losses are obtainable, but according to
unofficial reports the Russian losses up
to last night were nearly 7wO men.
General Rennenkampf particularly
distinguished himself during the fight
ing in the mountain passes southeast
of Mukden.

It looked as If the contents of the
ark had been turned loose in San Fran
cisco laat night when Norris & Rowe's
Circus paraded. But this circus could
go the ark a few better. The inhabi
tants of that antedeluvian vessel were
all right in their day, but if Noah

said. "Mine was all right in my day,

CZAR ANSWERS
PEOPLE'S PLEA
PT. PETERSBURG. March B.â ln the
Alexandra Palace at Tsarskoe-Selo.
surrounded by the ministers and a few
members of the court and with the
Empress at his side. Emperor Nicholas
this afternoon affixed his signature to
a rescript containing his Majesty's de
cree to give elected representatives of
the people an opportunity to express
their views In the preparation of the
laws of the empire.
This Is the autocracy's final response
to the agitation in favor of participa
tion by the people in the government,
which has brought Russia In the last
few months almost to the brink of
revolution. No condition in the regime
of autocracy is Involved for the present
and it means neither a constitution nor
a national assembly. At the same
time it recognizes the principle of the
people's right to be heard regarding
laws under which they must live.
Whatever the result may t>e the docu
ment is sure to mark an epoch in Rus
sian history as Important as the sign
ing of the emancipation manifesto, the
forty-fourth anniversary ot which It
was intended to signalize.
The signing of the document came at
the end of a dramatic scene, the climax
of which was an Impassioned speech
by Emperor Nicholas to his minis
ters, in which he declared that he
' sought only the welfare of his sub
jects.
â¢ I am willing," the Emperor said,
"to shed my blood for the good of my
people."
The humor in which the rescript will
be received Is awaited with the keenest
anxiety. Extremists are expected to
denounce the government for steering
' a middle course, yielding something In
the form of popular government while
j retaining the essence of autocracy;
: but the government does not hope to
satisfy this class. If it rallies the
; moderates to the support of the gov-
I ernment it will be satisfied.
The workmen left tnerr meetings In
St. Petersburg this afternoon, threat
ening to renew a general strike. To
night the streets are again full of
(Vissackn and every preparation and
precaution has been taken In anticipa
tion of possible trouble to-morrow.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1905.
Ed fireworks set off at Intervals made
light for the procession.
The cavalcade started from Mechan
ics' Pavilion and filed down Market
street, headed by a platoon of mount
ed police. Following the police were
the bareback riders and a display of
blooded ring and racing stock that ex
cited universal admiration. Shetland
ponies, elephants, llamas, deer and elk
in harness and a cosmopolitan brigade
of animals made the second division
the center of interest.
Among the equines was the famous
high Jumping horse King. He has a
standing challenge to Jump against
anything from a bullfrog to a kan
garoo. King seems to have springs in
stead of hoofs. This is only one of
the wonderful animals in Xorris and
Rowe's Circus. They have twenty
clowns, all kinds of acrobats, gym
nasts, aerial bar performers, flying
trapeze artists. Jugglers, tumblers; in
fact, everything that a circus ever had
and some that no show ever had be
fore. The circus will open this after
noon at Mechanics' Pavilion.
STRANGE WILL
OF A VETERAN
Leaves a Fortune of $50,000
to Three Children He
Deserted 45 Years Ago
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOISE, Idaho, March 3.â A Btrange
story has come to light here In con
nection with the filing of the will of
the late John Wood, who died a short
time ago. Before his death he made
a will leaving his property, valued at
$50,000, to his children.
None here knew he had children, al
though he had lived here thirty-five
years. It now seems he left a family
in Crawford County. Missouri, in 1860.
They thought he had gone into the
Confederate army and waa killed. His
right name was Bruce Wood. His wife
and three children are still living, but
he had never communicated with them.

SEVEN KILLED AND SCORE
INJURED IN TRAIN WRECK
PITTSBURG. March 3.â Seven men
were killed and a score of persons were
injured to-night in a rear end collision
of special trains bound from Cleveland
to Washington on the Pittsburg, Fort
Wayne and Chicago Railroad, carrying
Ohio delegations to the inauguration.
The first train of seven cars carried
a battalion of Ohio National Guard en
gineers. It stopped at Clifton, eight
miles west of Pittsburg, to remedy a
hot box. The second train, with the
same number of cars, carried the Tip
pecanoe Club of Cleveland, a band and
twenty-five women. The special trains
were running close together and the
rear brakeman of the forward train
did not have time to run back. The

PASTOR TELLS
OF GREAT WORK
Rev. Robert F. Coyle of Den
ver Describes Success of
Evangelists in That City
READY FOR CAMPAIGN
Dr. Chapman and His Party
Will Arrive To-Day and
Meetings Begin To-Morrow
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, March 3.
The Rev. Robert F. Coyle, formerly
pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of this city, and now pastor of
the Central Presbyterian Church of
Denver, Colo., who has come to Oak
land to assist in the great evangelistic
campaign which will begin next Sun
day, addressed the members of the
local churches this evening at a mass
meeting held at the First Congrega
tional Church. Dr. Coyle's subject
was "The Remarkable Religious
Awakening Recently Experienced In
Denver." and he spoke especially of
the success of the meetings held for
men only.
In conclusion Dr. Coyle said:
Our largest churches were too small to ac
commodate i those who wished to attend the
afternoon meetings and especially on Sun
day afternoons. One of the unique features
of our campaign in Denver was the great
midnight parade through the tenderloin dis
trict of the city. In this procession hun
dreds upon hundreds of our best men and
women marched side by side, ringing gospel
hymns as they went, and ' specially selected
workers handed out Invitations to the keepers
of dlvee and saloons and their customers to
attend the great mass-meeting in the Curtis
Theater.
After the parade this large place of a.nuee
m^nt was packed to the doors. Dr. Oetrom
ned to the people with most telling el-
ihe day of prayer in Denver was in every
way the most remarkable that city has ever
â¢ xporif-n^ed. Between 6<*O and tiOO of our Den
ver business* houses closed their doore from
11 :30 b. m. to 2 p. m. to give their employes
an opportunity to attend the meeting?. More
than 28,090 of our peopie gathered in the va
ri.js downtown theaters to listen to the gos
pel story. The results of our meetings were
in every way most gratifying. Thousands have
already united with the churches and the
spiritual life of the entire community has
been greatly quickened.
Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman and his
party, numbering thirty persons, will
arrive in Oakland to-morrow and the
evangelistic campaign will begin on
Sunday evening. Tickets of admission
are now being distributed for the
meeting for men only, which will be
held at the First Congregational
Church at 3p. m. next Sunday. \t
this meeting Dr. Chapman will "speak
on 'Some Things About Dissipation
Infidelity and Morality."

REPUBLICAN* PARTY
Delivers Ringing: Speech at Ahlen on
the Eve of President Roosevelt's
Inauguration.
OAKLAND, March 3. â Frank K.
Mott, the Republican Municipal
League and Democratic nominee for
Mayor, delivered an address this even
ing at Pizzola Hall, Alden. He spoke
of the inauguration of President
Roosevelt and said that it seemed ap
propriate to talk a few minutes upon
the good that has been accomplished
by the Republican party, as repre
sented to-day in this nation by a Pres
ident whose devotion to the public
welfare has been almost unequaled in
the history of the United States. We
who are Republicans can well feel a
sense of proper pride in the fact that
we are allied with the party of The

Must Face Serious Charge.
BERKELEY, March 3. â John Mc-
Meekin, a cigar dealer, residing at
1&00 Shattuck avenue, was arrested
to-day and taken to the County Jail,
charged with a felony, being accused
of abducting Morris LÂ«ntz, ag-ed 15
years, and Victor Wise, aged 14. The
charge was preferred by the parents of
the Lentz boy.
The youths were taken to San Jose
by MdMeekin, it is alleged, where they
rfinained two days, the police sending
them home last night. The story told
by the boys led to McMeekln's arrest.
Lentz resides at Milvla and Vine
streets and Wise at Delaware and
Grove streets. McMeekin is said to
have assured the youngsters that they
were of the build for race track
Jockeys and that fame and fortune
awaited them abroad in the saddle.
He took them :u? far as San Jose they
allege, and then left them to shift for
themselves.

DRESS FAR TOO MUCH
UNDER ARREST FOR THEFT
Seventeen-Year-Old Girl Strangely Afflicted
With Desire to Steal.
PRETTY SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL OF OAKLAND WHO 13 UNDER AR
REST FOR STEALING $80 AND A PAIR OF OPERA GLASSES FROM HER
BROTHER. Â£HE HAS BEEN IN TROUBLE BEFORE.
OAKLAND, March 3.â Three times
within a year has the love of fine cloth
ing and jewelry got pretty 17-year-old
Nora Jordan into trouble. The girl is
under arrest charged with theft. She
stole $80, a pair of opera glasses and a
small revolver from the room of her
brother, Frank Jordan, who lives at
062 East Thirty-third street. When
Jordan reported his loss to tho police
it was thought that burglars had en
tered the house during the absence of
the family, but after an investigation
the detectives decided that it was an
"inside job," and suspicion was at once
directed to Miss Nora, who had been
in trouble before.
When the ?irl was taken to the po
lice station she vehemently denied any
knowledge of the theft. Finally she
weakened and confessed that she was
the th'ef and told where the things
were hidden. She expressed no re
morse for the crime. She smilingly told
hhw she had stolen the money and val
uables from her brother's room while
she was alone in the house.
When scarcely more than a child the
girl committed her first crime. She
vas only 15 years old. She was sent
by her brother to deposit $40 in a local
bank, but instead of so doing she wrote
the entry in the passbook and spent
ATTACKS MADE
UPON BALFOUR
Lister Vnionists Denounce
the Premier and Spread
Alarm in His Following
LONDON, March 3.â The revolt of
the Ulster Unionists against the Gov
ernment is increasing In intensity. At
a meeting of the newly formed Ulster
Unionist Council at Belfast to-day an
gry denunciations of the continued re
tention of Sir Anthony P. MaeDon
nell, Under Secretary to the Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, and Wyndham,
the Chief Secretary for Ireland, were
heard, coupled with threats to fight the
Government at all points.
The Ulster men and Nationalists
profess to be convinced that Premier
Balfour does not dare cut Sir Anthony
MacDonnell adrift, because he would
then be free to publish compromising
correspondence with prominent mem
bers of the Government.
Some of Balfour's sturdiest adherents
are becoming alarmed and are urging
the Premier to take tne party into
his confidence by calling a meeting or
by other means to consult as to the
best manner of meeting the serious
situation.
Chamberlain's speech at the Tariff
Reform League is regarded as an addi
tional warning to the Government.
The occasion for its delivery was the
election of Viscount Ridley to replace
C. Arthur Pearson, who recently re
signed the presidency of the Tariff Re
form League.
the money. When her brother went to
draw the money he found that he had
no funds.
The matter was hushed up by the
girl's family, who have done their best
to keep her straight and have given
her everything their moderate means
allowed.
In the latter part of 1903 Nora ob
tained a position as a domestic with
Mrs. Morris Edelstein of 662 Fifth
street, and soon afterward her employer
began to miss valuable articles of
clothing and jewelry from her ward
robe. The thefts were traced to the
servant and on January 28, 1904, she
was arrested. Mrs. Edelstein, how
ever, refused to press the charge
against the girl and she was released.
Six months later, while in the em
ploy of E. J. Bardon of 560 Fourteenth
street, she denuded the wardrobe of
her employer of articles of fine wear
ing apparel and on July 7 she was
again arrested. She plead guilty when
arraigned in the Police Court, but on
account of her youth she was placed in
charge of Probation Officer Miss C.
Anita Whitney. Last December she
was released from probation and im
mediately commenced to steal when
opportunity presented.
The police regard the girl as in
corrigible, but it is not likely that her
brother will prosecute her.

that body almost through with its
work of disposing of conference re
ports on the great supply measures of
the Government and a few measures
of public importance.
A feature of the proceedings was
the general desire of the members to
abstain from obstructive tactics and
permit the disposition of business.
Speaker Cannon wielded the gavel
over the entire session and maintained
the best of order. The only object
which gave rise to any considerable
debate was the conference report on
the river and harbor bill. By an over
whelming vote the House refused to
agree to a motion by Sibley to concur
in the Senate amendment, and the
bill was sent back to conference. The
conference reports on the Indian and
postoflice appropriations were agreed
to, finally both measures being passed.
The conference report on the naval
appropriation bill was called up by
Fos3 of Illinois. In division, 100 to 89,
the House concurred in the amend
ments, thereby fully passing the bill.
Other bills were passed as follows:
Authorizing the Secretary of State to order
manufactured riftts for the use of rifle cltlbs
under regulations prepared by the national
board tor the promotion of rifle practice.
Authorizing th* President to allot and dis
tribute Indian tribal funds to such Indians as
In his judgment may be entitled to th-em by
reason of their advanced civilization; relating
to the construction and maintenance of roads,
schools and the care and support of insane
persons In Alaska; to further prescribe the
duties of the Secretary' of the District of
Alaska.
Kalanianole of Hawaii addressed the
House on the subject of leper condi
tions in Hawaii, in answer to some
suggestions made yesterday that one
of the islands be used for a national
leprosarium, including persons from
the United States. He protested
against the proposal on the ground
that it would be destructive to the in
terests of that Territory. At 5 o'clock
the House took a recces until 8 o'clock.
On reconvening Hemenway pre
sented the conference report on the
civil service appropriation bill and it
was agreed to with little consideration.
In the Public Eye Again.
Sammy Small, the youthful son of Dr. P.
D. Small, has again attracted attention
by certain improvements he has made
upon the well-known talking machine
â the phonograph. The entire details
of this latest achievement of the prod
igy will be found on the first page of
next Sunday's Comic Supplement.
OREGON ROAD
CHANGES HANDS
Columbia Eiver and North
ern Line Said to Have Been
Joined to Hill Interests
PORTLAND, March 3.â The Orego
nian will say to-morrow: The Colum
bia River and Northern Railway has
been sold for approximately $1,000,000.
presumably to Eastern capitalists,
though in reality, it is thought, to the
Northern Pacific Railway Company.
In a few days the formal transfer of
the stocks and property of the com
pany will be made from the old owners
to the recent purchasers.
The Columbia River and Northern
Railway Company is composed largely
of Portland and Oregon capitalists, and
is a road running from Lyle, on the
northern bank of the Columbia River,
to Goldendale, a distance of forty-six
miles. The company also owns a fleet
of steamships consisting of four ves
sels, the Regulator, the Bailey Gaiaert,
the Dalles City and the Metlaco.
If it Is true that the road has passed
into the control of the Northern Pa
cific it would appear that the old
dream of a north bank branch of the
Northern Pacific into Portland has not
been forgotten.
COTTON STEAMER DESTROYED.â New
Orleans. March .'!. â The Ouchlta steamer Co
lumbia wus partially destroyed by fire to-day
shortly after arriving from Monroe, but the
crew escaped safely. The Columbia was a new
boat. Much of the cotton on board will be
saved.
SENATE HOLDS
LAST SESSION
Resolution Authorizing Ac
ceptance of Re-cession of
Yosemite Valley Adopted
CONTINUES IN FORCE
Present Act Governing the
Panama Canal Zone to Re
main Law Until Changed
WASHINGTON, March 3. â The Sen
ate to-day found itself far less pressed
than usual on the last day of the ses
sion of Congress. The last of the ap
propriation bills having been passed,
the session was given up largely to
general legislation, and, when neces
sary, to conference reports on appro
priation bills. During the day the
final reports were presented on the
naval, the postoffice, the Indian and
sundry civil bills, leaving only the
river and harbor bill and the general
deficiency bill to be considered in their
final stages.
During the day the pure food bill
was definitely displaced.
The joint resolution continuing in
force the present law applicable to the
Panama canal zone was unanimously
udopted, but not until after several
Senators had expressed themselves in
frank language concerning the atti
tude of the House, to which they at
tributed the failure of the conference
on the bill.
The resolution was agreed to on a
roll call, 69 years, no nays. It is as
follows:
That the provisions or section 2 of an act to
provide for the temporary government of the
i-anal aone at Panama, the protection of the
canal works ar;d other purposes, approved
April 28, 10i4. be an<T hereby are continued In
force until the expiration of the session of the
Fifty-eighth Congress, beginning the first Mon
<lay in December, lwij. unless other provision
be sooner made by Congress.
Miscellaneous bills, as follows, were
passed:
Authorizing Gila County, Ariz., to
issue $40,000 worth of bonds for the
construction of a Courthouse.
Permitting- two young Chinese to re
ceive military- instruction at West
Point.
Cockrell resigned from the commit
tee in charge of a new office building
for the Senate and Teller waa ap
pointed to fill the vacancy.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took a
recess till 8:30 o'clock.
At 8: SO o'clock Perkins called up
and the Senate passed a joint resolu
tion authorizing the acceptance of the
re-cession of the Yosemite Valley as
an addition to the Yosemite National
Park and appropriating $20,000 for the
care of the park.
Hale then presented the first con
ference report on the general de
ficiency report. In answer to a ques
t'on in the conference to an inquiry
from Gorman, Hale said the conferees
hacf failed to reach a decision on the
House provision appropriating $190,
000 to pay mileage to and
members of the second session of the
present Congress. Gorman expressed
the hope that the Senate would not
yield its position for a moment. He
added the opinion that if the provision
should become a law it would create a
national scandal.
The report, as far as it went, was
agreed to and the Senate decided to
ask for another conference.

WASHINGTON FARMERS GET
HIGH PRICE FOR WHEAT
All the Grain In Their Hands and
They Sell at Their Own
Figures.
TACOMA, March 3. â If the state
ments made by Tacoma dealers are
true, the farmers of Washington are
enjoying a privilege that has seldom
been that of the farmers of any other
section. When asked why Tacoma
wheat prices remain unchanged while
the prices In Chicago are suffering
declines Alexander Balllie, resident
manager of Balfour, Guthrie & Co.,
said to-day:
The Tacoma quotations are nominal. ; The
farmers of ' Eastern : Washington .* make their
own 'price* and '.those, who want the wheat
must pay them. Practically all of the wheat
in- this State ' new â¢ is in - the hands of \ the
farmers. In many instances millers are pay-
Ing record prices for wheat with which to fill
orders bockel weeks, a?o for Oriental and
South American shipments. Puget Sound ex
porters are dclne nothing.

Commission Approves the
Chiefs Recommendations
for Improved Equipment
WATER MAINS LACKING
Spring Valley Company Is
Taken to Task for Its FaU
ure to Provide Protection
The Fire Commissioners yesterday
approved the recommendations of
Chief Engineer Sullivan for the Im
provement of the Fire Department
equipment. The recommendations fol
low:
That a fifty-foot lot bÂ« purchased
on Presidio Heights and that a house
be erected thereon for a new truck com
pany to be Immediately established
and also of an engine company, which
will soon be needed, as truck company
6 at Oak and Broderick streets is
more than two miles from a district
largely inhabited and containing many
institutions.
That new houses be built for engine
companies 9, 24 and 6 and truck com
pany and a lot on Eureka street be
purchased for engine house 24.
That four second class engines, two
trucks and one chemical engine be pur
chased.
That 350 new hydrants be set on new
mains in various parts of the city.
The Commission will request the
Supervisors to provide for the Im
provements in the next budget.
Sullivan calls attention to the danger
to which the city is exposed on Pine
street from Stockton to T yde and
Gough street from Bush to Geary
owing to the neglect of the Spring
Valley Water Company to lay mains.
He also calls attention tq the con
tinued failure of the company to fur
nish protection to the Oceanside dis
trict.
Joseph Hayden, hoseman of engine
17, was promoted to be lieutenant of
the same company. D. W. Moriarity
was appointed a hoseman from the
civil service list.
The Commission adopted the new
substitute list as follows:
C. Benn, Tom Bolger, James Bran
nan, C. Brown, J. Bunner, J. Con
lon, JF. D. Cconey, T. Cheatham, J.
Crowley, G. Curran, M. Dunn, C. Fer-

AL'TOMOBILE RULES
MUST BE OBSERVED
Fresno Man Objects, but Park Com-
missioners Overrule Him in
Interest of Public.
The Park Commissioners received
some unsought for advice from T.
Kearney, the Fresno capitalist, con
cerning rules and regulations govern
ing: the licensing of automobiles, but
the Commissioners ended the debate
by showing that they were perfectly
well satisfied with rules now in vogue
at the city's pleasure ground. There
were present at the meeting Presi
dent Adolph Spreckels and Commis
sioners Cummings end Lloyd.
Mr. Kearney said chat it had taken
him two days to obtain permission to
operate his motor car in Golden Gate
Park and he could not see why the
Commissioners did not recognize the
permits issued by other cities of the
Union as evidence of the competency
of the drives. President of the Com
mission Adolph Spreckels said that he
had made a study of the subject and
had become perfectly satisfied that
the Park Commission rules were
framed In a spirit of equal rights' to
all and would have to prevail.
The report of Superintendent Mc-
Laren included recommendations that
ordinances be introduced through the
proper channels to prevent loungers
from sleeping in public squares and
also to prohibit dogs being led be
hind carriages or bicycles in parks.
He al?o recommended the enlarge
ment of the bear pen, now that there
had been an addition to bruin's fam
ily. It was shown that In certain
work of grading the superintend
ent had saved a deal of labor and ex
pense by utilizing the Point Richmond
drain, into which sand Is shoveled
from ground to be graded and car
ried into a place to be filled by the
flume waters.
Alta Parlor. Native Daughters of
the Golden West, were given permis
sion, under supervision of Superin
tendent McLaren, to plant a memo
rial tree in Alta Plaza.
Xow that the City Attorney has ren
dered an opinion that certain prop
erty heretofore claimed by the city is
part of Lafayette square the Com
missioners will have Superintendent
McLaren proceed to improve it to
conform to the balance of the square.
He will report on what work and ma
terial are necessary to said improve
ment.
The California Indian basket ex
hibit in the park museum may be
purchased for the city. A popular sub
scription to the fund for purchase of
the exhibit, which is worth $5400.
has been started with the following
donations: Adolph Spreckels, $500:
M. H. de Young, $500; Reuben H.
Lloyd, $100.
If time were money all tramps
would have the price of a meal.

A SEA LEVEL GANAL.
EVERYTHING concerning the Panama canal is of intense in
terest to the Pacific Coast and to the whole trade of the Pacific
Ocean. The choice between a lock and a sea level canal has
decided by the engineers of the commission in favor of the sea
icveJ waterway. We believe that this will be satisfactory to this
t*y and to all the nations concerned in deep water trade. The
will be about $200,000,000, hut this will finally be taken up by
rh* superior economy of operation over the lock system. An expert
examination has shown that the dredging and cutting necessary for
a sea level plan will prove less costly than was estimated and will
bring it clearly within the capacity of our resources without any
.strain upon the national finances.
The engineers, mindful of the experiences had on the Suez canal,
point out that if built at sea level a future enlargement can easily be
made. This was done on the Suez. If a lock canal be built, the vast
locks are a considerable part of the expense, and if future enlarge
ment become necessary the locks will have to be wholly reconstructed,
and while this is going on the use of the waterway will be en
tirely suspended. On the other hand, a sea level canal may be deep
ened or widened with no interruption of its use. The difference in
cost between a sea level cut and a lock canal of 60 feet summit is
552.462.000, and if it be an 85 feet summit the sea level ditch will
-42.000 more. The extra expenditure is justifiable in view
of the results to be attained by it, and the Government will not find
much if any opposition to the sea level plan.
It is expected the work will require twelve years in execution.
The Suez canal was nine years in construction, and it presented no
such difficulties in cutting as are encountered on the isthmus of
Panama. While the Suez canal, when once begun, took less than a
decade to complete, it had been in contemplation for ages. Canal
work in Egypt attracted the attention of the Pharaohs. Rameses II
wanted to connect the Nile and the Red Sea by a canal which would
have been part of the present waterway. This work was actually
undertaken by Darius. In his turn Haroun al Raschid, the great
caliph, a cotemporary of Charlemagne, actually projected the Suez
canal, practically upon its present lines. But the constructive energy
(f the Pharaohs was diverted to pyramid building, and the great
Haroun grew afraid of some military disadvantage from the work,
f.nd abandoned it. In those days the nations did not well understand
wer of treaties to regulate the use of such a facility for com
merce.
The next great figure in history to take up the subject of the
canal was Bonaparte, who had it among his great plans in the East.
Finally. Ferdinand de Lesseps took up the matter in 1849, an d was oc
cupied in maturing it until 1854. His plan for a tide level cut was
opposed by English engineers, who insisted upon a summit and
locks. This opposition affected the nations concerned, which had
me together in a treaty. Finally, the Frenchman won, and the
rk hc^an in iB6O and was finished in October, 1869.
Of course we have great improvements in machinery since then,
and engineering experience has gained much in the thirty-five years
since De Lesseps finished his great work, to begin a greater in his
old age and fail. His plan for the Panama canal was for a sea level
ditch. P.ut he was balked by the cost of cutting due to the machin
ery aud appliances that were at his disposal. Progress has changed
the conditions under which he operated, and improved devices enable
the economical execution of work the cost of which in his time was
appalling. He stopped in the Culebra cut. Our American engineers
have put modern appliances into that cut, and the results confirm
them in the conclusion that only a sea level canal should be built.
The scone <>f De Lesseps' failure is the impulse to our success. As we
gather experience while the work goes on, it is entirely probable that
American ingenuity will so add to the efficiency of the machinery
that further economy in time and cost will be possible.
The cost of the Suez canal, dug in sand, was about $100,000,000.
If we connect the two oceans in twelve years at a cost of $200,000,000
the greater work will justify the greater cost. If it be distributed to
the years required for the work it will be only $16,666,666 per year,
an expenditure that will not be felt. If we avoid war until 1916 and
escape its drain upon our resources, that they may be devoted to this
greatest work of peace, we may complete it out of our current reve
nues without resorting to the issue of canal bonds. If this be so we
will make a record that has not been attained by any other nation.
We bought the French franchise and the work already done and paid
Panama out of an accumulated surplus in the treasury, and if we
finish the canal without issuing bonds and paying interest, the effect
upon our financial position in the world will not be the least of the
benefits that will come to us from the canal.
THE BUFFALO BILLS.
THE literature of divorce contests is being enriched by the suit
between Buffalo Bijl and Mrs. Buffalo Bill. He is a picturesque
figure who has stood before kings, and, his wife says, has also
stood before mean men and likewise mean women. She charges that
while he was enlightening all Europe and this hemisphere in the
various methods of equitation, as practiced by red Indians, Cholos,
Bedouins, cowboys and Cossacks, he was also picking up a job lot of
bad habits that made him an uncongenial conjugal partnef ; there

a his part. Bill, being a scout, naturally scouts these accusa
tions and declares that, as far as nature permitted, he has striven to
be a model and humble husband, with all that is implied thereby."
pVhile shooting clay disks from the saddle and riding to the daily
fesctie of the overland coach, his heart has been true to Poll, who is
Mrs. Buffalo BilL The affair assumes international importance. The
marital misfit of the present King of Saxony and the entanglements
of that light-hearted old party, the King of Belgium, are second to
this wild West divorce. Crowned heads in Europe call for the morn
ing paper to read. the latest from Buffalo.
( >ne of the serious charges brought by Mrs. Bill is that Mr. Bill
drank whisky out of a teacup. What did she want? Did she expect
him to drink it out of a bucket? The evidence shows, any way, that
the two are incompatible, and the court must put them asunder in
their old age, .and Bill must go forth alone in the world with his
td cowboys, his whirling dervishes^and his Bedouins.

GOTHAM BOASTS OF A UNIQUE DEVICE WHICH MAY
DISPLACE THE OFFICE MESSENGER.
THE messengers in offices in the
financial districts who take the
cards of visitors to their em
ployers have a rival. It is a
machine and It does the work
better than man or boy, says the New
York World.
James B. Dill, the corporation law
authority, has installed one of the ma
chines in his offices at 27 Pine street.
Mr. Dill was the first to discover the
machine and. a number of bankers,
lawyers and railroad men who daily
visit him have been so Impressed with
its peculiar utility that it is probable
many offices will soon be equipped
with it.
The machine is an electrical con
trivance with two small cabinets, one
in the reception-room and one on Mr.
Dill's desk In his private office. The
cabinet in the reception-room is fitted
with a roll of paper and a peculiar
pencil, to which is attached a slender
electric wire. The paper runs over an
electric contrivance which transmits
every movement of the pencil to the
cabinet in Mr. Dill's office. This latter

Their contents, of tiny looking glass

our Puritan souls have conquered
their last vestige of prejudice against
improving on nature. It was not long
ago that there were still a large num
ber of unsophisticated and straitlaced
folks who looked upon the powdered
face aa but a slight degree removed
from the painted one in scandal, says
a writer in the New York Sun.
Occasionally a rebellious sister, who
preferred sin to a shiny countenance,
would tamper with the shocking stuff,
tut she seldom had the courage of her
convictions and would dab the powder
on slyly in the extreme privacy of her
chamber, and she took infinite pains
to hide all traces of it, boldly denying
that she and It were even acquainted.
This was in the narrow minded
North, of course, for in the South

cabinet is also fitted with a roll of pa-
per and an electrically connected pen-
ell, the latter being different in sev-
eral details from the pencil in the cab-
met in the outer room.
When a visitor enters the outer room
the clerk there learns his name and.
taking up the electric pencil, writes it
on the paper in the cabinet. The In-
stant he begins to write the pencil in
the cabinet on Mr. Dill's desk also be-
gins to write, reproducing exactly all
of the peculiarities of the clerk's hand-
writing. Any message which the vis-
itor may wish to send can also be com-
municated to Mr. Dill over the queer
machine. A test of it showed that it
will also transmit drawings.
The advantages of the machine over
the ordinary messenger are many. A
man like Mr. Dill, who has many im-
portant conferences every day and a

a Southern, girl applies powder will
make her Northern sister hold her

Certainly the vanity case affirms
that women, if not more bold about
wearing powder, are more open about
putting it on than they have been be
fore. Such a charming trifle is not
made to be hidden from the public
gaze, and when a pretty woman in
a restaurant or a street car calmly
opens her vanity case, holds the mir
ror out at a comfortable angle and
painstakingly powders her Gibson
nose and chin she is sure of a large
and deeply interested audience.

The president of a large railroad
system who saw the contrivance in

that it could be depended upon It
would be of immense value to rail-
roads.
Misunderstanding of telegraphic or
ders, he said, was responsible for a
majority of the railroad accidents in
this country, but when the officials
made their investigation to fix the in
dividual responsibility there was al
ways a dispute between the sender and
receiver of the telegram as to which
had made the error. If the message
could be sent and received in the hand
writing of the same man, he said, the
responsibility would be absolutely
fixed and, knowing this, all railroad
employes concerned with the movement
of trains would be doubly careful.

JIMMIE'S COOK
E. W. SARGENT
/^OME in," said Jimmle Cas
â f | well, a little embarrassed.
V^ "You see, the place Isn't
fixed up very well, but I
haven't had any one to attend to
things for a week."
"Help is hard to get," admitted
Grace Gorham.
"But I'm very lucky," commented
Jimmie, regarding the brown hair that
peeped under the dainty hat. He al
ways had liked brown.
"Now, about my place," said the girl
briskly. "How much do you pay?"
"Four dollars a week," said Jimmie
promptly. "I pay you a certain sum
for expenses and you find all material.
It's better that way than having to
come to me all the time for money."
"But isn't that very little, even for a
beginner?" she asked.
"That's the regular price," assured
Jimmie. "Four dollars a week and
$10 for supplies."
"I never would use all that," she
gasped. "I don't suppose you will
need more than a couple of dollars a
week."
"Oh, yes, you will," declared Jim
mie. "The last girl couldn't get along
with that even. She used to touch me
for more every Friday regularly.
Never could imagine what she bought
with it."
"She must have been very hard on
ribbons," suggested Miss Gorham.
"Some girls are. Even at that, she
shouldn't use up $10 worth."
"What have the ribbons to do with
the expense?" asked Jimmie curiously.
"She couldn't spend It for paper,"
explained Miss Gorham. "You could
r.ot possibly use more than a box a
veek. The ribbons are about all else
she had to get."
"Oh, no," he interrupted. "She had
to get bread and meat and things like
that."
Miss Gorham rose, her face a bright
crimson. "I did not come here to be
insulted," she said icily.
"You came to see about a place," he
protested.
"As stenographer," she finished.
"As cook," insisted Jimmie firmly.
"I distinctly told them to send up a
cook."
"The hall boy^sald it was three
flights up," she went on.
"What has the hall boy to do with
it?" he asked curiously. "I never told
h'm I wanted anybody."
For answer she drew a clipping
from her pocketbook. It was an ad
vertisement for a stenographer and
gave the house address, but no name.
Jimmie immediately became con
scious of his dressing gown. It was
all right to talk to cooks in dressing
gowns, but a stenographer â and such
a pretty one!
"I'm sorry," he said humbly, "but
it's the fault of that blame boy. He
meant Miss Cartwright. across the
hall. I believe she writes."
He showed her to the door, but to
his surprise she started down the
stairs.
"Miss Cartwright is just across the
hall â on this landing," he called after
her.
"I â I don't think I want the place,"
she cried, struggling to keep back the
tears. "I don't want to work here."
And she went her way conscious, even
in her anger, that she was rather
sorry that Jimmie had not wanted a
stenographer. Even in a dressing
gown Jimmie was an attractive fel
low.
As for Jimmie himself, he kept
thinking about the pretty typewriter
all the morning and even the arrival
of a well recommended cook brought
no solace to his mind.
Even a telephone summons to dine
with his favorite aunt did not give the
pleasure it usually brought, even when

For a moment Jimmie did not recog
nize her in her flimsy dinner dress. H-^
was merely conscious of a vision of
liveliness in something soft and gr
âor blue, It might have been blue.
Then a cool, self -possessed voice re
marked that she had had the pleasure
of meeting him before. Jimmies daze
became a stupor, from which Â«nly the
announcement of dinner roused him,
and he was half way to the dining
i room before he really realized that the
vision of the morning was beside him
and was saying something to him.
Ashamed to acknowledge that he hail
I not heard, he answered "Yea" at ran
[ dom. and immediately became awart;
j that he had said the wrong thing.
They were removing the fish plates
| before he had the courage to *eÂ«k t*
j penetrate the icy air of reserve in
I which she had wrapped herself.
"What v/as it you asked me when I
said Yes'? he asked " desperately.
"Didn't you understand?" she coun
ter-questioned, unbending a trifle.
"To be perfectly frank," he said
honestly, "I never heard a word. 1
was so surprised to find you here Wiat
my head was in a whirl."
"My father has a theory that his
daughter should be capable of her self
support. I am to nave the old home
on Madison avenue if I can get and
hold a position for three months.
This morning wai my flrÂ»t applica
tion."
â¢ But what wu It you asked?" he
persisted.
"I asked you If you really thought I
looked like a cook," she said, with a.
little laugh.
"And 1 said 'Yes.' " he cried con
tritely. "What a fool you mun have*
taken me for!" .
"Then you admit your mistake?** she
asked smilingly.
What Jimmie answered wu not to
the point and wholly unworthy of
recital. There are times when even a
confirmed bachelor may grow* sud
denly foolish, and through that dinner
Jimmie would have rivaled even a"
college lad making love to hia first
widew.
A more important conversation^
and one more worthy of record, was
held a few weeks later in the Gorhaiu
library.
"You see. I am at sea again on the.
servant question. The girl drank
everything in the house that was bot
tled, even the cooking sherry.' l
Why don't you go and 11y% at a
hotel?" she asked. "Now that you
have come into all that money through
the sale of your western property, you
do not need to keep bachelor hall â on
"ten dollars a week for all material,' *
she quoted.
"I've a better idea than that," he
declared seriously; "one my aunt ga
me. I think 111 hire a housekeeper. '
"What will you pay her?" she de
manded, her eyes twinkling at the
memory of Jimmies serious parody oit
bargaining.
"Love and affection and other* valu-'
able considerations, as the legal docu
ments say," he answered promptly.
"And as you* were an applicant for a
place you shall have first chance â will
you. dear~' He had dropped his ban
ter and his voice had become danger
ously tender.
"I think 111 have to," she answered
shyly. Then with a sudden flash m{
humor. "If only because you look so
forlorn when your rooms have been
servantless for a week."
"The blessings of Cupid be upon the
I mistake," Baid Jimmie softly. "I think
I 111 give that hall boy five dollars, be- ,
caHse I kicked him for making yoti
uncomfortable that morning." Which
was an eminently practical termin

'..'When 1 was a young girl I was a

He and the others laughed at me and
said:

rounded by smaller baskets holding
aloft the same gay blooms. These were
held to the ivory ceiling by broad
bands of gold gauze, which fell from
the pink and white branches in long
strands, swaying sensuously with the
air waves. Round about these blithe
harbingers of spring were eight great
silken balloons, pink, yellow and
blue, shedding a faint glow over the
merry throng below. And in each
corner were these same pale lights
gleaming. Green there was in pro
fusion, strands of huckleberry wind-
Ing about the pilars, while date palms
and glossjr magnolia leaves clustered
about their bases. The newest note
in the scheme was the rustic fence
and picturesque gateway which sep
arated the musicians from the guests,
and this was a mighty pretty conceit.
Supper was served M usual in the
marble and maple rooms. It was for
this delight that many of the guests
had come. As a lover of artistic ef
fects I have often wondered why the
Palace doesn't invest in a uniform lot
of dining chairs â it causes such a
commotion as to who will sit upon the
royal red satin ones, or upon the ple
beian hard seated chairs from the
kitchen. It looks somewhat like a
separation of the sheep from the
goats.

MAY CONFER MILLIONS
ON MINERS OF STATE
Great Results Expected Because of
Detritus Investigation.
President E. H. Benjamin of the Cal
ifornia Miners' Association thinks that
favorable consequences will flow from
the investigation that has been deter
mined upon by the Secetary of the In
terior, to be conducted in this State by
the United States Geological Survey,
of which exclusive Information was
published in The Call yesterday. It is
proposed to find out, briefly, whether
the detritus from torrential streams
may be deposited on waste lands in
such manner as to reclaim the lands
and, at the same time, remove from
torrential streams their burden of
detritus and rehabitate hydraulic min
ing.
The investigation has been brought
about solely through the efforts of the
California Miners' Association. At the
last annual convention of that asso
ciation in this city Professor Christy
ot the University of California advo
cated the work. The association at
once adopted the idea and memorial
ized President Roosevelt to have an in
vestigation made by the United Slates
Geological Survey. The detritus has
been a subject for burning discussion
throughout the State north of Te
hachapi for many years. Investigation
into the entire detritus matter is now
assured. Many questions may be
solved thereby.
Now that the Government of the
United States has come in to help the
State of California the action of the
California Miners' Association looms
up largely as a matter of general con
cern in which the entire State is in
terested.
Professor Christy, making his
memorable address to the California
Miners' Association in favor of a thor
ough investigation of conditions in the
watersheds of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers, said that the back
wardness of the portion of the State
that lies north of TeLachapi as com
pared with the region south of the
Tehachapi range was due to the fact
that California had killed the goose
that laid the golden egg* He referred
to hydraulic mining as the gold-egg
laying goose and showed that between
1848 and 1883, a period of thirty-five
years, the gold output of California
averaged $31,000,000 a year, or "leav
ing out the Sundays, the gold egg was
worth for every working day $100,000."
Attention was also directed by Pro
fessor Christy to some significant facts
relating to the present condition of
mining in California as compared to its
former extent. In part he said, accord
ing to the official minutes of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association:
LOSS OF MANY BULLIONS.
Last year hydraulic mlninp hart practically
ceased, dri.t mining, quartz mining and dredg
ing had increaÃed tnormou?ly ov what th^y
had been, ami yet the gold pi .Juct of the
State was only $17,000,000, about one-half of
what it formerly averaged. Of couree $100,000
a day was not all pnxiuced by hydraulic min
ing, but the great bulk of it was. This money
went to enrk-h the valley. In the *arly days
of the Argonaut Marysville and Sacramento
were the chief intellectual and business cen
ters of the State, and their existence and pros-
I'pr;ty were made possible by the hydraulic
m'ner. The farmer had a direct market for
his product?, he was paid in gold, and the
whole or.iniunity was prosperous.
Mr Bow c In his hook on hydraulic mining,
ertimates that in 1885 there was Â«100.000.0<i0
of capital invested in hydraulic mining; all
of this is now practically destroyed. The
energy with which this industry was prosecuted
by the men of those days is the admiration
and the model of the world. The reservoirs
built above the snow line; the ditch lines
hundreds of miles long, which were carried
over mountain tops and along the faces of
precipices, and maintained throuch summer's
heat and 'winter's snow; the pipe lines going
down a thousand feet into the valleys and up
again to ditch grades: the hydraulic monitor;
the whole paraphernalia of hydraulic mining,
show an Inventiveness, a fertility of resource
and an energy In the execution which has no
parallel In the world.
But all this has been swept aside. All
this has been made useless by the decisions
of the courts. At the present time there are
few things more pathetic than the position of
some of those old Argonauts who worked these
wonders. Worn and broken by lonely years
spent in the development of the State, they
sit beside their ruined cabins and gaze upon
blasted hopes. By violating the law, by turn
ing loose the hydraulic monitor In the night
time they might easily enrloh themselves, but,
with very few exceptions, they have loyally
respected and upheld the law that ruined
them.
The farmer, whose lands have been over
whelmed with sediment, has been ruined also.
And we have here one of the most pitiful
situations In the history of our State. Though
hydraulic mining has been destroyed the
farmer still finds himself deluged with debris
coming from the mountains, and.' according
to the newspapers, the slogan of the Antl-
Debris Society now Is: â 'All kinds of mining
look alike to me."' This deadlock between
these two fundamental Industries Is a public
calamity. It has come to have all the bitter
ness of a religious war. There have been
prosecutions and there have been persecutions,
and it Is a great misfortune to all that when
ever anything goes wrong along the rivers of
California hydraulic mining is blamed for it.
FOR HYDRAULIC MINING.
No concealment was made in conven
tion of the fact that the California
Miners' Association desires to rehabil
itate hydraulic mining if It can be done
with advantage to both the miner and
the farmer. Of course this would be
ideal if a great industry could be op
erated without Injury to any one and
with benefit to all. The coming Inves
tigation is calculated to determine that
very proposition and hence the great
and absorbing interest that will attach
to every step. The farming lands along
the courses of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers and the gold deposits of
the mountains that can only be worked
to advantage by the hydraulic process
are equally concerned. Professor
Christy said, in one part of his ad
dress, voicing the sentiment of miners:
The first and most vital measure is to re
move the coarser sediment from the torrential
streams before they enter the navigable
streams, by depositing this coarser sediment
on waste land. If this Is done on a proper
scale, and in a systematic manner, hydraulic
mining can go on Just as It used to, without
danger to the interests of any other Industry.
If it is not done, even if hydraulic mining Is
stopped forever, the building of levees will be
worse than .useless, for they will simply in
sure the conveyance of the natural sediment
Into tNÂ» bay of San Francisco, and if the
sediment Is removed, the river will clear it
self with a little aid from an inexpensive
levee system.
The suggestion concerning a memo
rial to President Roosevelt came also
from Professor Christy, as follows:
I would, therefore, suggest that this associa
tion, either directly or through its executive
committee, address a suitable memorial to the
President of the United States, requesting him,
through the Department of the Interior, to In
struct the director of the United States
Geological Survey to lncludÂ« in his investiga
tions of the storage of waters and the reclama
tion of waste lands, the foothill areas of the
Sacramento and Ban Joaquin rivers now af
fected by the deposits from the torrential
streams: to devise means whereby, first: The
waters may be stored for use and floods pre
vented, and, second: By which the sediment
now carried by these torrential streams may
be diverted and deposited on waste lands and
thus removed by natural means before th*
waters are discharged into the navigable wa
ters of the State; and, further: That the in
vestigation be begun at once and prosecuted
with all dispatch consistent with thorough
ness, so that the fundamental interests of agri
culture and mining may be carried on with
out injury to each other or to the navi
gable waters of the State.
HITCHCOCK'S OPINIOJfS.
The investigation will follow along 1
the lines Indicated herein. In a letter
that Secretary Hitchcock wrote to the
president of the California Miners' As
sociation Is the following:
It Is particularly important to strengthen
co-operation with the Stata of California and
the California Miners' Association can be of
material ojristance in keeping this fact before
tb* rubllc, namely, that the activities along
these lines will be largely proportional to thÂ«
facilities afforded by the State Itself.
The "activities" to which reference
is made in the foregoing are described
by Director Walcott of the Geological
Survey to consist of topographic map
ping to over a portion of the catch
ment basins of the Sacramento and
San Joaquin rivers; geological studies
and stream measurements; location
and survey of reservoir sites, and study
of forestry protection. Director Wal
cott writes also that "it Is significant
that the California Miners" Association
turns to the Geological Survey for ad
vice to help restore an important in
dustry."
The foundation has been laid in the
work of the past few years in Califor
nia for a full and satisfactory investi
gation such as the miners are eagerly
seeking.
Drinks Wood Alcohol.
Mrs. Emma Blake, widow of the
late Dr. Blake, drank a quantity of
wood alcohol in a house at 2710 Fil
bt rt street, where she was nursing,
last night and died at the Central
Emergency Hospital. It is not known
whether she drank the alcorrol with
suicidal intent or by accident. Mrs.
Blake formerly conducted a sani
tarium at Devteudero street and Golden
Gate avenue. She was 38 years old.
The body was taken to the Morgue.

â¢ \ : . BERKELEY. March 3. â The style
â¢â¢â¢: of stroke to be taught the men of the
varsity boating crew by the new
i coach from Harvard. E. M. Garnett,
â¢ :has not yet been decided upon by him.
â  Hje has spent the time since last Mon
' day in watching the work of candi
â¢ - dates for places on the crew and in
' giving general directions to the men
'. yho come out each day to row. Coach
â  Garnett . said last night:
The material we have here for a boat crew
is good, â¢ both as regards form and strength.
' The stroke â¢to be used will be decided later.
" It.. will bÂ» a stroke adapted to the physical

F*cr- htfavy men a hard catch and easy finish

The freshmen of the university
demonstrated that they have excellent"
track' ana* field men among them in
their meet last Wednesday with the
Berkeley High School team. The late
ness of the hour when the meeting be
pat, prevented the running off of most

â¢"'â¢The varsity baseball team has thus
far succeeded in winning only one
â gferrie from any of the seasoned clubs
against which it has played. The
Boone's Academy nine was defeated
by the varsity last Monday, but the
tetter was hardly rated in the same
' :'lasf=' with the university men. The
Clabrough-Golcher team defeated the
university Wednesday afternoon, the
eÂ£ore being 8 to. 2. It is the second
. defeat administered by the Clabrough
. fjo.lchers. The varsity players dis
played a lack of ability to hit the ball

"N.ewman and Jordan to do the box

CARDINAL KVXNER IS SPEEDY.
Burr Shows Fast Trial Over a Dis
tance of Two Mile*.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March
B.â Because of the death of Mrs. Stan
ford all athletic meets for the week
wÂ«?re called off and the men have done
but little practice work. This rest in
the early season will do the track men
tjo h.ann, as many of them are in such
good condition now there might have
been danger of overtraining before the
end-, of the season. Never before have
there been so rhany good performances
on the tinder path at this time of the
fieatcn as this year has brought out.
Miller's half mile in two minutes and
seconds; Davis' quarter in fifty
two: seconds; LanzLgan's pole vault of
n feet three inches, and above all
Burr's tyro rrriles in the fast time of
ten .minutes and twenty seconds, are
all remarkable feats of speed and
so early in the long weeks of
ing.
ThiF trial of. Burr in the two-mile
I that at last the Cardinal has a
.first -flaps man to run this heart break
ing distance. For many yeans "Dad"
Moulton has been trying to develop
jo. good long distance man, but with
out success. In this race last year
California rook all three places, but
Btirr, an unknown runner at that time,
hung with the bunch of Californians
-and finished close behind. All the
other Stanford entries fell out of the
race. With this performance in mind
the veteran trainer took Burr in hand
this year and the fast heat in the trial
â  on Monday shows "Dad" has picked
a winner. Except some Improvement
â  among the sprinters little else has been
done on the track.
The boat club has started to build a
fcoathouse at Redwood and in a short
time the crews will do most of their
training on the course there. It has
not yet been decided where the Inter
collegiate race will be held. The Stan
ford managers will recommend that
Redwood be selected. In the meantime
the rowing squad spends several hours
teach day working on Lagunita* Lake,
but little can be accomplished on this
circular course.
Must Await Governor's Action.
The Supreme Court handed down a
written opinion yesterday affirming
its oral decision published recently to
the effect that no new attorneys could
be admitted to practice until Gover
nor Pardee shall name the judges of
the District Courts of Appeal. The
question was brought up through the
petition of Samuel T. Mock that he
be admitted to the bar of California
on the strength of credentials from
the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.
PICKWICKS MEET
HORNETS' ELEVEN
First Tie for Union Cup
to Be Played Sun
day in This City.
The first tie for the California Asso
ciation Football Union Cud will be
played to-morrow on the ground at
Ninth and Bryant streets between the
Pickwick and Oakland Hornet elevens.
The ball will be kicked off at 2:30 p.
â¢m. This will be the only match of
association 'football played in this vi
cinity to-morrow.
The drawing for the remaining cup
matches follows : On Sunday, the 12th
inst., the Albion Rovers will play the
Eagle 6at Freeman's Park, Golden
Gate. It is likely the match between
the Pickwicks and Independents for
the championship of the California As
sociation Football League, which was
postponed from February 19, will be
played as a curtain-raiser to the cup
tie. On Sunday, the 19th inst., the
winners of the Pickwick-Hornet match
will play the Vampire eleven. On Sun
day, the 26th inst., the winners of the
Rover-Eagle match will meet the In
dependent team. The final tie for the
California Association Football Union
Cup will take place on Sunday, April 2.
The only match played last Sunday
for the league championship was be
tween the Oakland Hornets and the
Albion Rovers, and was won by the
Hornets with a score of 3 goals to 1.
The Hornets are growing stronger
every match and will be an important
element in the cup games. Last Sun
day's match was interfered with in a
peculiar and unique manner. The air
ship "'California Messenger" was pulled
to and fro over the football ground
several times, compelling the players
to stop the game. The crowd that was
attracted to Idora Park by the desire
to see the inventor of the airship make
an ascent swarmed across the touch
lines and could not be held back.
The standing of the clubs for the
championship of the league is shown
herewith:

every team will have taken part in ten
matches.
Either the Eagle or the Pickwick

Golden Gate Sues Ophir.
A suit for $600,000. the value of
ore alleged to have been wrongfully
extracted from its property on the
Comstock lode in Nevada, was begun
in the Superior Court yesterday by
the Golden Gate Milling and Mining
Company against the Ophir Silver
Mining Company and its directors.
The bulk of the complaint, filed by
Attorneys Baggett, Jones & Sheridan,
is devoted to a description of the
property involved and a statement of
the plaintiff's title, which dates from
1880. The ore is Â«aid to have been
taken from the Vermont Consolidated
claim between August 1, 1903, and
March 1, 1905.

CRICKETERS ARE
GETTING READY
â *. â
Annual Meetings Are Held
and Officers Chosen
for the Year.
The cricketers of California are be
ginning to make preparations for the
coming season. The Pacific and Ala
meda clubs held their annual meetings
and elections of officers on Monday
night and the San Francisco County
Club, winner of the championship of
IS>O4, held its annual meeting and a
dinner last night. The annual meeting
and election of officers of the California
Cricket Association will be held at a
downtown hotel on Monday evening at
8 o'clock. T
The annual meeting of the Alameda
Cricket Club was held at Croll's Hotel,
Alameda, the chair being occupied by
Vice President Henry Ward. The re
port of Assistant Secretary G. Harold
Ward showed that last season had been
a successful one, the eleven having
won 6, drawn 2 and lost 4 matches of
the twelve played for the champion
ship, and having scored 14 points, only
one less than the 15 points scored by
the San Francisco County Club, which
won the championship in 1903 and 1904.
Reference was made to the great loss
sustained by the club in the death of
its president, Edwand Brown, who was
its mainstay for a period of eleven
years.
The election resulted in the choice of
the following officers for 1905: Henry
Ward, president; Arthur M. Brown,
V. Carus Driffield and R. I. Mould, vice
presidents; G. Harold Ward, secret:iry
trcasurer; H. W. Brown, F. A. Sttfhl
and F. J. Croll, members of the execu
tive corfimittee; F. A. Stahl, W. E. R.
Rooker and W. H. McNaughton,
ground committee; S. M. Foster and F.
J. Croll, delegates to the California
Cricket Association. The captain will
be elected on the ground before the
opening of the first match of the
season.
At the annual meeting of the Pacific
Cricket Clun the following officers were
elected for the coming year: President,
Captain John Metcalfe: vice presidents,
Willism Balnaves and J. J. Theobald;
captain. E. H. M. Lannowe; vice cap
tain, E. H. Wilkes; secretary-treasurer,
W. Potherick; members of executive
committee, A. W. Wilding. Dr. O. N.
Taylor and C. P. Coles, with the offi
cers already named; members of the
selection committee, E. H. M. Lannowe,
E. H. Wilkes and H. D. Bowly; mem
bers of the ground committee, A. W.
Wilding and D. Jamieson; delegates to
the California Cricket Association, E.
H. M. Lannowe and Dr. O. N. Taylor.
Arthur E. Rendle, formerly president
of the Metroplitan District Cricket
League, last year forwarded to Lord
Knollys, private secretary of King Ed
ward VII, a petition from cricketers In
the United States and Canada that the
services of Dr. W. G. Grace to the na
tional game of cricket be recognized by
conferring a knighthood upon him.
Lord Knollys was requested to lay the
petition before the King in the man
ner he might think best. The King re
ferred the matter to the Prime Min
ister, in whose hands It rests at
present.

GREYHOUNDS HAVE
ROYAL BREEDING
Progeny of Palo Alto Is
Expected to Shine
on the Field.
The first of the progeny of Eugene
Geary's great greyhound Palo Alto
have been whelped and will be seen in
competition early next year. As the
sire won more trials than any grey
hound in the world, great things are
expected of his representatives.
George Sharman's Tamora has a lit
ter of six puppies, three of which are
dogs. Tamora is by the imported dog
Fetter Free, out of High Born Lady.
She has shown speed, cleverness and
stamina and is considered a fitting
mate for Palo Alto. Mr. Geary's Una
by Snapshot-Bart's Belle has a litter
of three puppies. 'This brings in the
famous Skyrocket blood, which has
been a factor in California coursing for
many years. AW the puppies are fine
looking and should do well on the field.
Bonnie Lass, the famous dam of
Palo Alto, Ireland. Bonnie Pasha, Erin
and other high class performers, was
destroyed some days since as an act
of mercy. Dr. Osier's theory was ap
plied to her when old age brought on
its attendant ills.
The Grand National championship
stakes which was so successful last
year will shortly be run again at Union
Park. This consists of a series of
match races between the greatest dogs

soon as strong hares can be relied
upon the conditions will be announced.
The next Interstate Coursing Club
event to be decided will be the Ladies'
Day Championship Stake. This will
be run In June. The entrance fee will
be $25.
The members of the San Francisco
Coursing Clnb will meet next Wednes
day night to arrange for a members'
stake to be run at Ingleside Coursing
Park. The last event of this kind was
a marked success.
Two stakes will be decided to-mor

RACKETS TO FLY
ON PARK CODURTS
Tennis Doubles to Be
Played by Juveniles
and Young Ladies.
An Interesting tournament will be
played to-day on the Golden Gate
Park tennis courts. The juveniles
and the young ladies will join forces
and will hold the first of a series of
handicap mixed doubles tournaments.
Thirteen of the cleverest young ladies
at the park and a like number of the
best players from the Junior Club will
be in the competition.
The most heavily handicapped team
is Miss Lulu Wegener, the strongest
of the lady players, and Harold Getz,
a first class player among the boys.
They will play from 15 3-6 behind
scratch. Miss Vera Crocker and M.
McLoughlin will "owe 15 1-6." Mc-
Loughlin is the club champion and a
clever young player. Miss Crocker is
hardly as clever as Miss Wegener, but
will give her partner good support.
Two three-time silver loving cups
have been donated for the event. A
tournament of this kind will be held
once every six months. Play will be
gin promptly at 9 o'clock this morn
ing. All matches will consist of two
sets out of three. The affair will be
managed by Mr. Marvin, founder of
the boys' club.
One of the Alameda County cham
pionships has been decided and the
other comes up for decision this af
ternoon. As was expected, the dou
bles went to the Baker brothers. They
were easily the best team in the tour
nament. Long and Janes made a
good showing against them in the fin
als, but the Bakers were too strong
for them and took three sets out of
foi
Clarence Foley caused a surprise by
winning the singles tournament. Fo
ley has always been a clever young
player, but rather indifferent. He was
at his best throughout the tournament
and played a steady game. His hard
est match was with Carl Gardener in
the semi-finals. The latter had beaten
George Janes in straight sets and
looked to have a good chance to meet
Baker. Foley upset calculations,
however, by taking Gardener Into
camp after three close sets. Gardener
won the flrst set easily, but after los
ing the second by a very small mar
gin seemed to lose heart and made
rather a poor showing in the third
set. Foley was as steady as a clock
and played an excellent game.
Fred Adams was the surprise of the
tournament. He has been com
ing to the front slowly but
steadily. He hardly looked to
have a chance to reach the finals, but
did so and made an excellent show
ing against Foley. He failed to get a
set. but the flrst two went to 8-6 and
Foley had to play his best to win.
A. Brabant is another player who
made a good showing in the tourna
ment. He is not a new man like Ad
ams, but has not been playing in this
vicinity long. He has done most of
his playing in Australia, where he
was considered one of the best play
ers. He started at the park in the
third class and is one of the best men
in the first class.
The challenge match which will be
played to-day should be an interesting
one. George Baker, the champion. Is
a strong favorite and his clubmates
figure he is almost sure to win. He
will find Foley no easy man to beat
The latter's chances do not look good
but still he undoubtedly has a chance
to win.
The handicap singles tournament
which was started at the park about
six weeks ago will be completed to
morrow. The semi-finals and finals
have yet to be played.
The continuous tournament which
has been on at the California Club for
several months is anything but a suc
cess. It was thought that when the
days grew longer the players would
meet oftener and take more interest
In the tournament. Few matches are
being played, however, and there
seems little or no interest in the af
fair. Unless there is a sudden rhanee
the tournament should be dropped
All of the players who were originally
in the second class, with the excep
tion of one. have gone up into the
first class. Paul Jones is the remain
ing player, and the only course open
to him is to go back a class or up a

Justice of the Peace Golden yester

ter's wife and child. Mrs. Shadburne .
was formerly Miss Marie* Presovich .
and is a stepdaughter of the plaintiff in

his claim was cut- down because the
evidence disclosed that he nad locked

prived him of the custody of his child

Prazak testified that Shadburne ha

â¢ After two and a. <jnarter rounds of

go in and settle the contest for keeps.
. Berger displayed beyond a doubt
.that he is Long's master by many
lengths. The ijest the teamster had
â¢was an erratic swing that landed on
Berper a couple of times and Jolted
.him severely. Long made no effort to
defend himself and telegraphed every
pun oh he aimed at the former Olym
pian, Consequently the going was
nice an 4 soft for Sam nearly all the
way through.
Long opened up the mill by rushing
at Berber and putting the left to the
stomach twice In rapid succession.
B*rjrer was cool and waited for the
teamster to comÂ© to him. Long tried
a right swing and Berger caught him
en the point with a short right as he
closed. This waÂ« repeated several
times during the round. Long varying
the monotony once or twice by reach
ing Berger's jaw and body with one
of his .swings,.
The secocd opened in furious style.
Long was anxious to come at Berger
and Sammy let him come, invariably
meeting him with one of those choppy
ones to the head when he came in.
Near the middle of the round Long had

hard enough to the jaw to start the
crowd pulling for him.
.' When the men came out of the mixup
Berger shot out a pretty right that
caught Long squarely on the jaw.
The leamster went down and barely
managed to get up before the fatal ten
had been tolled off. He was full of
. fight and came at Berger once more.

" .Btrger "thought he had won and near
ly every ono else thought likewise.
". Long's seconds, however, persisted and
. B'erger finally agreed to come back and
-again. -Long came in groggy, but
vent at Berger. Sammy landed sev
eral lefts and as Long staggered about
the ring the former Olympian shot out
a, stiff left-hander and rolled the team
ster over on' the carpet, where he lay,
a beaten gladiator. If things keep

have the mate to Britt's $30,000 flats.
The show was given under the au
spices of the Bay City Club, and a full
house turned out. Dick Sullivan out

Young Dempsey was awarded the
decision over Southside Jack O'Brien
in a mixuD that was full of fight.
â¢O'Brien received a little the worst of

and never had a chance.
After a long rest Johnny Schorr's
Olympian came out of retirement and
at" odds of 20 to 1 beat a big field in
the Futurity course sprint. Birken
ruth rode the Domino noise and had
him out in front all the way. At the
wire six horses were strung across the
track heads and necks apart, Olympian
gaining a neck decision over the good
thing, F. E. Shaw. Badly Used, a 40
to 1 shot, came on from the rear, Just
nipping Urbano for the show. Fort
Wayne, the favorite, ran iifth.
EBOXY AX ACROBAT.
Truly the transformation of Ebony
from a trailer to a utaKe horse was
complete, even to the minutest detail.
The black horse started in the seven
furiong selling affair and from 5 and
6 his odds were hammered down to 4.
Bell, as formerly, had the mount, and
soon after the start was knocked out
of the race. Nothing deterred, the
good thing waded through the bunch
and eventually won galloping from
Mildred Schultz, the pacemaker, in
1:26^. The favorite, Shellmount, lost
the show to Harry Beck by a neck.
Glenrlce, a 10 to 1 chance, with Bon
ner in the saddle, took the mile and
a furlong number, for which a cheap
collection of platers went to the post.
The colored rider kept the mare out in
front from start to finish, and in a
drive led J. V. Kirby over the line a
length. Bell, on the favorite Maxetta.

The three-year-old Squire Johnson
was played from 9 to 5 to 4 to 5, and
defeated Telephone and Handy Bill in
hollow fashion.

a highly polished acrobat, the stew

in the fourth race and will not be per

AUTOMOBILE CIATB GAINS
liAPIDI.Y IX MEMBERSHIP
Many Join Because of Interest in the
Betterment of the Public
Roads.
The membership of the Automobile
Club of California is increasing by
leaps and bounds. On January 17 there
were 225 members on the roll, while
on the Ist of this month the club had
350 members. By no means all of
j these are owners of automobiles, many
of them having joined the club from
sympathy with the work it is doing for
the betterment of the roads.
The recent annual dinner of the club
served the valuable purpose of bring
ing the Supervisors of San Francisco,
of Santa Clara and Santa Cruz coun
ties and other public officials into pleas
ant contact with the officers and lead
ing members of the Automobile Club.
j As a result of the meeting the chances
I of getting the mountain road from San
Jose to Santa Cruz opened to motor
ists have brightened greatly. The only
serious opponent to the arrangement is
one of the Santa Clara County Super
visors, who is acting according to the
I wishes of the people he represents. It
} is probable, however, that the offer of
{ the club to make some repairs on the
I part of the road will bring an amicable
j arrangement much nearer. The most
| energetic worker to this end has been
I C. C. Moore, one of the members of the
executive committee of the Automobile
Club. He has taken Supervisors out
in his motor car and has shown them
1 that the automobile is not the danger
ous machine it is often supposed to
j be and that the automobilist is a man
I and a brother who cherishes no mur
derous Instincts, but is an admirer of
pretty country roads and fine scenery.

j Racing Measure in the Senate.
SACRAMENTO, March 3. â A fight
will be started by Assemblyman Espey
to-morrow to secure some action on
the part of the Senate Committee on
j Public Morals on his anti-poolselling
bill, which has already passed the
lower house. \t \* asserted that an ef
fort is being made to kill the bill in
the Senate Committee. A spirited fight
is probable when the effort is made to
recall the bill from committee. Lukens
of Alame<i;i and Uahn of Los Angeles
will make the flght to recall the meas
ure. Leavitt of Alameda will lead the
fifht against such action.

MAGNATES WILL
TALK BUSINESS
Clark Griffith and "Tip"
O'Neill Meet President
Bert in Council To-Day
Two important figures In the world
of baseball, Clark Griffith, manager
of the famous New York Highlanders,
and Tip O'Neill, president of the West
ern League, will arrive in this city to
day for the purpose of conferring with
President Bert of the Pacific Coast
League in regard to certain drafting
privileges. The big Eastern magnates
are not yet satisfied with the situation
and hav# sent Griffith and O'Neill here
to look after the matter.
The class to which the Pacific Coast
League belongs is still in doubt. At
the recent meet of the baseball powers
it was placed in the AA class, with the
Eastern and American Association
layouts. The coast magnates are not
yet satisfied with the situation and
would like to see the drafting price
higher and also see thÂ«Â»ir league placed
in a class by itself or next to the major
bodies.
Griffith and O'Neill will probably
confer with President Bert to-day re
garding the matter and some change
or agreement may be reached on the
much disputed drafting question. Uncle
Henry Harris said last night he knew
nothing of the mission of the delegates
nor was he Invited to attend any con
ference.
While here Griffith will probably do
some missionary work in Los Angeles
and he may escort Chase and Newton
back with him. These men he drafted
some months ago, but Morley objected
and the matter is not entirely patched
up. Griffith will have a quiet talk with
the southern magnate and will try to
persuade him to part with his stars.

RALSTON BILL
IS IN DOUBT
Delegation of Sports From
This City Leaves Capital
Downhearted and Gloomy
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 3.â The lob
by that came from the bay to oppose
the anti-prize flght bill has faded
away and to-night there is little talk
about the measure, it is Â«ald Harry
Corbett and Eddie Graney, who led the
delegation of sports, counseled their re
turn to-day, as there were some in the
bunch whose presence would tend more
to the passage of such a measure than
to its defeat. The last ones on the
scene were James Edward Britt and
his father, James E. Britt Sr., who has
come into prominence through his pa
rental position. They Btayed over sim
ply to watch the grinding of the wheels
of legislation as interested citizens,
they said.
The favor in which the bill was held
yesterday by the San Francisco dele
gation seems to have disappeared to
day and opposition of a pronounced
order has taken its place. The San
Francisco Assemblymen are to-night
ready to beat the bilL
It is the Amerige bill that will be
voted on by the Assembly. It had been
read the third time and was ready for
final passage when the Ralston bill
was passed by the Senate and will be
substituted for the latter.
Amerige can call the bill up when
over he wishes to under a special rule
giving each member the right in turn
to call up one bill from any part of the
file each day. He seems to be in no
hurry, and has the advantage of being
able to muster the friends of the
measure on the day he is to call it.
Those who are Interested in beating it
are paying close attention to duty,
fearing Amerige will have it put on
final passage at a time when sonle of
them are absent. It is likely the bill
will be called up to-morrow afternoon
by its author and the final vote taken.

"I have enough votes now to carry
the bill," said Amerige to-night, "and
I am only counting on one from San
Francisco, though I should be pleased
to have all the gentlemen from the
bay vote for it.- There were three or
four votes half pledged to the meas
ure that are against it since the lobby
came up, but I have a clear majority
left. I think. the measure has gamed
some support through the coming of
the fight promoters, as well as losing
aome. There are at least forty-five
votes for it now."
The opposition expresses the same
confidence that the bill will be defeat
ed. All are waiting for the final test.

SCOTTISH BOWLERS READY
FOR SINGLES TOURNAMENT
Many Enter for the Affair and They
Are Paired Off In the
Draw bis.
The San Francisco Scottish Bowling
Club has planned a singles tournament
to commence April 1 and end August
19. The tournaments last year were
not as successful as in the past. Espe
cially was this so in the double, the
players preferring to meet in practice
games. In the singles event last year
every member in the club was drawn.
This undoubtedly caused many de
faults and much confusion.
In the tournament to be played this
year only the players were drawn who
signified their intention to play. Forty
of the club'<Â» cleverest players will be
in the competition and the winner will
have earned the title of champion.
The preliminary round, in which
there will be eight matches, will begin
April 1 and end April 22. The first
round, with sixteen matches, will end
June 17. There will be eight matches
in the second round, which will close
July 8. Three Saturdays will be al
lowed in which to complete the third
round, which will end July 39. The
semi-finals will be completed on Au
gust 12 and the final match is sched
uled for August 19.
Ample time will be given the play
ers in each round and if they have any
desire to compete there should be few
defaults. The winner of the tourna
ment will receive a handsome silver
cup and will be the club champion for
1905.
The singles tournament for the Law
son cup will also be played during the
summer. Thisevent islimited to players
70 years of age or over. At present
only five are eligible. They are Wil
liam Watson, Samuel Irving, Andrew
Forman, G. C. Patterson and A. Mc-
Donald. The tournament is waiting
upon J. M. Duncan, who will be 70
shortly. When the latter reaches the
three score and ten mark the tourna
ment will be started. These six players
are as strong as any in the club and
many half their age could* not begin to
beat them.
The drawing for the open singles
tournament resulted as follows:
Preliminary round (upper half) â James
Black vs. W. A. Cook; T. Lattlmer vs. R. Mc-
Bean; John Reid vs. W. J. Randall; Andrew
Forman and James Taylor.
Preliminary round flower half) â M. L.
Crowe vs. Charles Adams; O. C. Patterson vs.
A. McDonald: A. Craig vs. Joseph Oray; John
McLaren vs. R. Colquhoun; J. McLachlan vsÂ».

REPORT IS MADE
ON BEEF TRUST
President Hands Congress
Kesult of Corporation Com
mission's Investigation
PKOFITS KEASOXABLE
Market Prices Beviewed and
Percentage of Gain on Bus
iness Comparatively Small
WASHINGTON. March 3.âPresi
dent Roosevelt to-day transmitted to
Congress the report of the Commis
sioner of Corporations on the beef in
dustry submitted in compliance with
the resolution of the House of Rep
resentatives, adopted March 7, 1904.
The President's letter of transmittal
is as follows:
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a report from the Secre
tary of Commerce and Labor upon that portion
of the resolution of the House of Representa
tives adopted March 7, 1904, having to do with
the prices of cattle and dressed beef, the mar
gins between such prices and the organisa
tion, conduct and profits of the organizations
engaged In the beef-packing industry.
In view of the fact that the Department of
Commerce is now engaged upon other matters
involved in the resolution the Secretary of
Commerce and Labor cannot at this time ra
port thereon. THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
The report of the Commissioner of
Corporations is to the effect that six
packing companies. Armour & Co.,
Swift & Co., Morris & Co., the Na
tional Packing Company, the Schwar
schild & Sulzberger Company and
the Cudahy Packing Company,
slaughtered in the year 1903 about 4 5
per cent of the total indicated slaugh
ter in the United States; that the av
erage net profit in 1903 for three of
the companies was 99 cents per head;
that the year 1902, instead of being
one of exorbitant profits, was less
profitable than usual; that during the
month when prices of beef were the
highest some at least of the leading
packers were actually losing money on
every head slaughtered. The changes
in the margin between prices of cat
tle and beef are in themselves no In
dication whatever of the change In
profits, aays the report. Price condi
tions for the years 1902, 1903 and
1904 are reviewed and the conclusions
are stated that the six companies es
pecially discussed are apparently not
cvercapitalized; that the percentage of
profit on the gross volume of business
Is comparatively small and that dur
ing the years 1902, 1903 and 1904
Swift & Co.'s profits have not ex
ceeded 2 per cent of the total sales;
Cudahy & Co.'s are stated at 1.8 for
1904 and 2.3 for 1903.
With reference to private car lines
In the packing industry it is stated
that the profit is a very liberal one. a
net return of from 14 to 17 per cent be
ing indicated, but it is added that,
reckoned on the basis of dressed beef
transported, the profit would add but
little to the cost of beef to the con
sumer. The profit of one concern, the
Cudahy Packing Company, on its in
vestment in cars was as high as 22 per
cent in the year. Further, it is stated
that the principal packing concerns,
while they slaughtered but 45 per cent
of the cattle killed in 1903, they slaugh
tered nearly 98 per cent of the cattle
killed in eight leading Western packing
centers; that they control a very largo
percentage of the trade In beef, partic
ularly In the East and that they fur
nish New York about 75 per cent. Boa
ton more than 85 per cent, Philadelphia
about 60 per cent, Pittsburg more than
60 and Baltimore about 50 per cent.
The report, in conclusion, says that
the National Packing Company, men
tioned as one of the "big six," is a
merger of various packing plants, but
except for that concern there appears
to be no general lnterownership of
stock among the six principal compa
nies.
In order to make certain of thÂ» accu
racy of the results, the bureau adopted
a double method of ascertaining tha
profits. It first compiled, from the de
tailed records of packing companies,
exact figures of the quantities, costs
and sales of cattle and all products
derived from them and from these ele
ments computed the profits of all tha
packers separately and all together.
This computation was confined to the
Armour, Swift and Bchwancchlld St
Sulzberger companies. Then the fig
ures thus independently reached wera
compared directly with the bookkeep
ing profits shown by the financial
statements of the companies.
A man with all kinds of money usual
ly acquires a wife who develops a
mania for breaking up his collection.

yeit^rday said:
â  SJ\K"KS â A number of unfavorable features
developed to-day which unKeitled the cenfl
;.-dence of many pools and also the generality
i>t operators. The hÂ«avy foreign selllnp. with
thje - :iknÂ«s in the Southern Steel stocks, and
liquidation by commiKioti houses and the local
traders, caused rather general selling of the
â¢/hole list. It was necessary therefore for the
'toujl Interests to put in substantial supporting
orders to prevent the spread of general liqui
dation and hold the market from developing
important weakness. This support was most
noticeable in Union Pacific. St. Paul. South
Â«rn Pacific, Pennsylvania, Copper and the trao
iion list, as well a* the Ertes and Steels. We
would not be surprised to see a continuance of
irregularity and unsettled conditions until tnÂ«
stability >f the market becomes more reÂ«s
eurlnr. I .
COTTONâ The market was steady tf-aay.
â but it was mainly due to the absence of fur
. th<>r eggreesive selling t.reÂ»Â«nire. There wes
nothing particularly encouraging in the day's
run of new; to stimulate bullish activity, but
naturally th<re was no disposition on the part
.of the bear element, either here or at New
Orleans, to further attack the market. The
â¢toady absorption of May contract? held by
prominent interests and the very small stocks
<Â«f only 62.000 bales cf contract grade at this
port is sufficient menace to further extensive
â¢short selling by the generality of traders.

Xevr York Stock Market.
NEW YORJC March â A number of lncl-
G"ents occurred ' to-day which served to upset
speculative sentiment on the Stock Exchange
and renew apprehension over, the reliability of
the many reports regarding combinations and
merger* of t-xlsttng properties which have
bern made the ground for buying stocks for
â oce UroÂ«. The market was weak from the
cutset, owing it was said, to an unexpected
rwlume of eelÃn* for foreign account. The
vjitavorable news regarding the Russian posi
tion 'at the wat of war and some suggestive
rumors of a probable internal disturbance in
the empire, to take form on Sunday, were sup
paped to account for the weakness from for
'*ign sources. "The weakness- was again pro
nounwJ in the Pacific* and New York Cen
tral â¢ The market showed good recuperative
tore? from the first decline, and there were
occasional recoveries and special points of
jn.rer.frlh â Â«rrsS"~&Â« a~raMylr:Â£ point for the
reft of -the market. But sentiment was again
unsettled by the unostentatious appearance of
a quotation fcr a tingle 100 share lot of SlouÂ»-
Shelfield Steel sellm* at the price of 86. A
w-cend sale of the same amount at the same
Irtce followed.
The :act that 100 shares should be offered
â¢"down continuously for 22 points without find
ing a single buyer id *. disturbing effect.
Other stocks which have been associated with
tiie merger report are more actively traded
In. eepeclally Tennessee Coal and Iron, and its
feharp .break in the market had a disturbing
Â«J?Â»-ct on Bentlment generally. The admis
sion thet the proposed merger had been 1-de
i*rred" was the' only news to account for the
movement.
The forecast of the currency movement of
.the week indicated a small gain for this cen
.ter in ' balance on the regular export move-
Vhcnt with the interior. Sut>-Treasury opera
tions, however, have absorbed more than
$3,000,000, pointing tto a decline in the cash
item. The present large drain into the Sub
-Treasury is largely due to drafts by interior
national banks on their New Tori correspond
ents for payments to the Treasury Depart
n>'-r.t to make good the national bank 5 per
cent fund, which had become depleted by the
large current redemption of bank notes. This
â¢large redemption â *â Â«Â«- an incident in the heavy
flew of currency from the interior to New
York the New York banks offering the bank
note*' for redemption . as they were received.

to-day, and it -.-.â¢. that large prog
ress haÂ» been male in taking up the avail

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. March '3.â From, start -to finish

mation, business being confined to trades of
small ' proportions. .^Notwithstanding lower
prices at. Liverpool, the market here opened
quite steady; May. being a shade lower to Â»i@
Me higher at $MSH--.to $1 15%. July- was
'ii-Ue lower to a shade higher at J>H-?-i<Â§oOc.
Commission houses * showed a : tendency >to '
make moderate purchases, but offerings were
extremely light. A rumor that the May -deal
was still' in operation and: that the -price of
the May ontlon would soon sharply advance
appeared to be. the main factor In restricting
offerings. Prospects of an early .shipping
caused- some selling of the July delivery. in
consequence the tone of that option mi rela
tively weaker than 7 May. -At. 91'14%<'<May
reached the lowest point of the day. The
bottom price of July was 08^c. r The market
closed, about steady with May 'at '$115*4.

basis of a firm corn market. May opened un
changed to a shade ' lower at 47Ti<a>43c and l

the stimulus of the warm. Â«unr.y weather, and.
with stocks still comparatively light, the mar
ket i ruled firm. Retailers were buying more
on size than quality, the small sizes being
preferred, and they were relatively firmer than
the large sizes. One well-known â  brand of
extra fancy Navels from RedlandÂ» were, held -
at a small advance over the top quotation. Of

Â» Hospital had a disagreement with
.tie firm some time ago and in some
manner not explained he disappeared
without turning the precious stones
oVer to his employers. The firm heard
he" was in Cuba and Vaguer went thith
er in quest of him. From that place.
Hospital was shadowed to this city by
Vaguer, who arrived here on Thursday.

*\fio was reported to be all Hospital,

was escorted to police headquarters,
where he turned over the gems to
â  Vaguer. He was kept under guard for

was later released for the reason that
â¢ Vaguer made ho charge against 'him,
toting content to recover the stones.
When seen yesterday, both Vaguer
'and Hospital refused absolutely to dis

out, but rt must have been something
fabulous else Vaguer would never have
made such a long trip to recover them.

The Popular Advertising
Expert Forms a New
Alliance.
â vTlllard Everett has formed a connec
tion with the firm of George Batten Co..
Advertising Agents, 38 Park Row, New
York. This alliance means much to
newspapers and advertisersâ to adver
tisers, as it strengthens the hands of a
firm already strong and well established
- â that has grown steadily and strongly
from a very modest beginning in 1891 to
WII.T.ARD EVERETT.
a position in the very first rank of adver
tising firms, and especially In the high
character of the business conducted, as
well as for business methods and
straightforward dealings.
One of the best . known newspaper
managers said of Mr. Everett In a recent J
interview: "There is no man in the Unit
ed States that knowp the daily newspa
pers bftt^r than Willard Everett â or
knows what he wants and how t# get it
âcan make a closer deal, and yet who is
more popular with publishers and their
representatives, because, close, shrewd
an he is. he plays a fair game and is al
ways ready to give the other fellows a>
square deal."
In thip opinion newspaper men will
universally agree.
His success with the advertising cam
paigns conducted by him are too well
known to need mention here.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 4 ? 1905.
THIS MYSTERY
IS BAFFLING
Bod.v of Young Man Found
in Bay Causes a Wrong
Conclusion in Identity
The body of a well-dressed young
man was picked up in the bay yester
day afternoon near the Filbert-street
wharf by three employes of the Spring
Valley Water Works. When brought
to the Morgue a card i^3ued by the
firm of McMacken & Penso, private
detectives, was found in the vest
pocket. George McMacken, one of
the members of the firm, was called
to the Morgue last night and, although
unable to identify the body owing to
its decomposed condition, stated that
he believed it to be that of Harold El
lis, a private detective, who lived at
109 Jones street. In making this asser
tion McMacken said that Jje identified
some of his own writing on the card
and then explained h<>\v it came to be
placed there.
McMacken said tha ' on February 4
his firm had advertise-! in a local paper
for a collector. A ran giving the
name of Harold Ellis answered by let
ter the following day md Ellis was in
vited to call at the company's offices in
the CrosÃley building* When the ap
plicant called he gave his name and
McMacken presented â¢ him with the
same card which was found on the
dead man's body.
Late last evening McMacken called
at Ellis' home and was surprised to
learn that he was alive. Ellis himself
appeared at the Morgue soon after
ward, but was unabl'i to identify the
body. The Coroner will make a thor
ough investigation of the case and El
lis is puzzled to know why any person
should have used his name in applying
for a position.
WOUNDED JAPANESE MAKES
ANTE-MORTEM STATEMENT
H. Murata Says Killing of His Two
Companions by K. Koyama Was
Without Provocation.
K. Koyama, proprietor of a Japan
ese lodging-house at 110 Prospect
place, asserts that he acted in self
defense when he shot and killed Itario
Nahamura and T. Inonye and fatally
wounded H. Murata early yesterday
morning. His statement to the police
Is that the three men forced their way
into his bedroom and began to attack
him and his wife. One was armed
with a blackjack and the other with
a cleaver.
Murata made an ante-mortem state
ment at the Central Emergency Hos
pital yesterday to Assistant Bond and
Warrant Clerk T. J. Kennedy in pres
ence of the defendant and Detectives
Bell and Braig. He said that Koyama
was president of their society and as
he had sold the lodging-house they
went to his bedroom to talk with him
about money matters. The door was
partly open and when they entered
Koyama's wife closed and locked the
door. Koyama opened fire on them,
killing Nahamura and Inonye, and
wounding Murata.
Two charges of murder have been
booked against Koyama and there
may be a third. It is said that he is
of a quarrelsome disposition and
about two weeks ago was arrested for
disturbing the peace.
Forgot Her in His Will.
Mary A. Regan yesterday sued John
Felton and other heirs of John Fel
ton, deceased, to recover $1500, or a
third interest in property on Pacific
street, near Leavenworth. She says
she owned an equal interest with Fel
ton in the lot in 1896. He told her he
was going to sue to quiet title to the
property and if she would not appear
to defend her interest he would make
a will or other instrument giving her
a third interest in that property and
a like interest in another lot at Lynch
and Leavenworth streets. His will,
however, left all of his estate to his
heirs-at-law, of which she was not
one. A peculiarity in the case is that
the will of John Felton names his
brother, also John Felton, as execu
tor. It is not explained how the
brothers came to have the same name.

ARREST NOT SO LAUGHABLE
AS SHE FIRST IMAGINED.
Mrs. Jennie Frye Regards
Imprisonment as Joke.
JUDGE SAYS SHE'S GUILTY AS CHARGED
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Mrs. Jennie Frye apparently regard
ed her arrest and arraignment on the
charge of peace disturbance in the light
of e-n excellent Joke, for she alternate
ly giggled and guffawed while Patrick
Jones, saloonkeeper, was recounting his
complaint to Police Judge Fritz.
Of ample avoirdupois, she fairly jellied
with mirth when the accuser quoted
some of the epithets alleged to have
been addressed by her to him. When
she could control her rlsibles sufficient
ly to permit speech she chuckled,
"He's a liar," and then relapsed into
laughter. The court occasionally re
minded her that the case was not a
comedy, but the reminders failed, of
sobering effect. If they had been in
tended as cues for merriment she could
not have responded with greater hilar
ity. Finally when the conclusion of
Mr. Jones' recital allowed her to re
gain her equanimity she released her
sides, wiped her eyes and purged her
self of suspicion of contempt by de
claring that she could not have helped
laughing if death had confronted her
as a penalty, because never in all her
born dayi had she heard or even read
of a person who could juggle the truth
with greater deftness than had just
been displayed by Mr. Jones.
The burden of the saloonist's griev
ance consisted of Mrs. Frye's implaca
ble enmity to him and every one who
visited his place of business at Sixth
and Stevenson streets. She dwelt at
an opposite corner and for some unac
countable reason she neglected her
household duties to sit upon the "front
stoop" of her domicile and hurl oral
abuse at himself and his patrons. No,
her antagonism could not have been
aroused by the characl^r of his saloon
â unless she objected to the strict main
tenance of decorum in such establish
ments. He had acquired reputation for
the excellence of his steam beer and
the exclusion of femininity from his
barroom. Indeed it waÃ while enforc
ing the latter regulation by refusing
admittance to a semi-intoxicated wo
man that he received the verbal casti
gation from Mrs. Frye that provoked
him to hale her into court. Seated
upon the "stoop," as usual, she not
only advised the objectionable female
to resist expulsion, but also addressed
him by various appellations which
would not be admitted to public print.
Mrs. Frye's defensive statement was
not delivered with the fluency that
ordinarily marks the pleadings of lady
defendants, for as each of Mr. Jones'
specific accusations recurred to her
mind she experienced difficulty in re
pressing inclination to laugh. She
managed to inform the court, however.

Of Disfiguring Humors
Use CUTICURA
Every child born into the world
with an inherited tendency to tor- ;
turing, disfiguring humors of the
Skin and Scalp, becomes an object ;
of the I most tender solicitude, not
only because ', of ! its suffering, but '
because of ; the dreadful If ear that
the disfiguration is ,to be lifelong
and mar its future happiness and
prosperity. Hence it becomes the
duty of mothers of such afflicted
children to acquaint themselves
with the best, the purest, and most
effective treatment available, viz.: â 
the : CUTICURA Treatment, : con-
sisting of warm baths with CUTI- :
CURA Soap, and gentle anointings
with CUTICURA Ointment, the
great Skin Cure. Cures made in
childhood are speedy, permanent,
and economical. V, . ; v ';r ;â¢?;/"

that at the time of the alleged peace
disturbance she was seated upon the
"stoop," awaiting the return of her
husband and two sons from the Nel
son-Corbett prize-fight and that she
did not address one word, good, bad
or Indifferent, to Mr. Jones, nor did
she tender advice of any kind to the
woman he was thrusting from his por
tals.
"He's sore at me," she added, "be
cause I don't drink in his place. I
don't like steam beer anyway, and the
only liquor I drink is claret."
When the Judge pronounced Mrs.
Frye guilty as charged, she smilingly
declared that she was not surprised by
the pronouncement "Because," she ex
plained, "I knew Jones had a pull."
"I wag not aware that he belonged
to a tug-of-war team," was the court's
dryly-uttered rejoinder.

examination than he received from Mr.
Samuel.
When the sleuth entered the drud
gery, he avers, his demeanor for the
nonce was that of a person in pain.
"I'm sick," he said to Mr. Samuel; "is
the doctor in? " To which Mr. Samuel
is alleged to have responded with the
words. "He is here; what's the matter
with you?" Whereupon the pseudo in
valid described a variety of imaginary
ailments, to which Mr. Samuel devoted
close heed and then led the way to a
back room. There the detective wm
put through a course of Investigatory
sprouts that literally took his breath
away. His chest was tapped, his pulse
felt, hla tongue scatmed and his eye
balls were peered at, the examiner
meantime keeping up a muttered com
mentary on the symptoms he perceived
âor pretended to seeâ such as "Lm;
irregular juxtaposition of the vertebral
column to the northeast corner of thÂ«
southwest section of the main respir
atory valve," or "Urnâ mâ m, cirrhosis
of the appendix, causing neurotic af
fection of the thinkabellum." The de
tective was not certain that his quota
tions of the diagnosis were correct, but
they were as accurate as his limited
knowledge of physiological nomencla
ture and a memory freighted with
other things would permit. At the con
clusion of his antemortem Mr. Samuel
said, "I'm, well fix you all right," and
thereupon compounded and sold to tlte
detective two bottles of medicine, the
contents of one of which was to be
swallowed in doses and those of the
other to be applied externally. Then
the arrest was made.
Mr. Samuel expressed preference for
a trial by Jury and Judge Mogan ac
commodated him by naming a future
date for the setting of the case.
Harry Maxim's larcenous instinct
was fired by the facT"^that nobody
seemed to be devoting Â»ny attention
to a long rubber hose attached to a
water faucet at Commercial and Du
pont streets and he promptly shut off
the stream, unscrewed the pipe, coiled
it around his person and sauntered
northward. A moment later, however,
the hose was missed by its proper cus
todian, an employe of the telephone
company, who informed Special Officer
Cleary of its strange disappearance.
The shrewd sleuth immediately started
to follow the trail left by the drip
pings from the plunder and at Dupont
and Clay streets he overtook and ar
rested the thief, than whom a person
less likely to be suspected of pilfering
had .never appeared before Judge
Mogan. The expression of benevolence
conveyed by a dome-like forehead and
mild eyes set wide apart enhanced
by a full gray beard that rippled over
an ample chest. But his personal ap
pearance failed to offset the evidence
of hia guilt and a term in the County
Prison will be awarded him.
Dan McCarthy veteran in vagrancy,
was accused of that offense by a po
liceman who found him foraging In a
swill barrel aback of a restaurant.
"You're a liar," shouted Mr. Mc
: Carthy when the officer had clinched
| his complaint.
"H-i-s-h!" hissed Judge Conlan.
"Fie, Mr. McCarthy! Your language
