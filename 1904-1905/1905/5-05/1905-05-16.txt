Croker was referring to "Miss Toinette
Horton of Horton, N. V.. who asserted
she was to be married to Herbert Croker
in about two weeks.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 15.â Richard
Croker Jr. and J. Rogge . of ; New, York,
his traveling companion, taking the body
of Herbert V. Croker, who died on , a
Santa Fe train near Newton, Kans., Fri
day morning, left on a TVabash train
to-night for New York. They spent the
day here and Croker made a partial In
vestigation -of the circumstances \ sur
rounding his brother's death. He left
convinced that it was due to the.exces
sive use of tobacco and liquor and the
use of opium.
"It is all mighty hard," Croker said.
"I came to Kansas City intending to have
an autopsy performed: In fact, arranged
for one after my arrival. But a talk with
physicians convinced me It would be use
less. It was the old, old story of ex
cessive stimulants. I believe that his
heart simply gave way.
"The hardest thing to believe . Is that
Herbert was addicted to the use of opium.
We never heard of It, never dreamed of
it. Herbert bad no vicious habits of that
kind. He was an incessant smoker, but
never, to my knowledge, did he use
opium. There are a lot of circumstances
connected with his visit to. Kansas City
which to me are not clear. I have some
friends here who will keep looking up
these circumstances and I have asked
the Chief of Police to do the same.
"I wish you would deny for me that
story about Herbert marrying some one
\u25a0while at the Oklahoma ranch. I don't
remember what her name was. I never
heard of her; we never heard y of her.
The name is entirely foreign to our house

that the Government's orders to ob

instead of words."

The Government was endeavoring not
to embitter the situation, but it was
necessary for France to adopt a definite
attitude, otherwise popular excitement

Lillian. Lawrence plays the part of
Vivian to perfection. " John B. Maher and
John Davios are the pseudo *'papa 3" and
are as funny as can be imagined. John
CraJg and Mary Young are the loving
pair who get into such painful difficulties
as a result of the similarity: of the hus
band's name to that of his uncle. They
get all the humor possible out ot, their
part*;. Harry HHUard. Howard Scott,
Harry Van Meter, Herbert Fargeon and
Florence Gerald aid admirably in the
almost continuous provoking of laughter.
There can be no question but i.hat
"Vlvian'6 Papas" will have the most
cu^cessful kind of a run.
The production of "Tennessee's Part
ner" at the Alcazar the week of May 58
will mark the return to that excellent
stock company of a.- former San;. Fran
cisco favorite, Harry D. Byers. . Byers
cloeed his engagement with the Whfte
Whittlesey company, with which he was
playing the character roles, last Sunday
night in Oakland and was immediately
engaged ; for the Alcazar.
The fine work -of .Mr."! .Byers at^ the
Grand Opera-house two years ago int the
character roles r will be remembered by
"Vhian's Papas," which opened at the
Alcazar last night. Is the limit for fun.
The comedy is written by the author of
"Are You a Mason T' and is just as hu
morous. Vivian Is a divorced woman
with whom a rich New York lawyer
of uncertain age and a millionaire pork
packer of Chicago are madly in love.
They meet In her apartments, but she
manages to make each believe the other
is her ''papa" and both. are overcome at
the display of paternal affection. " â¢
The lawyer has a nephew with the
same Initials and when the wife of the
latter sees a bill for a sunburst for
Vivian purchased " by the attorney she
believes her husband Is faithless and this
further complicates matters. At the close
of the second act they " all meet, acci
dentally at Vivian's home and the riot
that ensues convulses the audience.
Everything comes out charmingly enough
at the end to satisfy the most emotional
lady in the house.

CentraL
A fine audience greeted Carusi and gave
her applause liberally. She was assisted
principally by talented amateurs, who
can sing better than they can act. Edgar
Stern was the troubador;. Waiter de Leon
was the king; Clinton Morse, F. L, Ar
gell and M. , J. Jeffries the three con
spirators; Basil Tetson figured as the high
sheriff and as Saladin; R. H. Merrill was
a herald; Helen* Dubois, "Princess Guine
vere"; Marietta Bos worth and Florence
Young, ladies in waitmg.
Of course a professional cast and pro
fessional chorus would have been more
effective, as the professional almost al
ways outclasses the amateur in freedom,
volume, stage presence. The cast that
was selected made a good appearance,
Miss Dv Boifl, Clinton . Morse, Basil Tet
son and Edgar Stern took the vocal
honors.' Carusi was ' given , a \u25a0 wreath .. of
laurel and a large floral array of offer
ings as she sat in .the director's box and
kept the company together. . Her direc
tion was energetic and decisive. . Under
her baton every subsequent performance
la certain to show Improvement. The
chorus is large and the orchestra is also
ample. The general judgment of auditors
was that the opening night was a success.
Then the Troubadour comes to the res
cue, enters the. palace of Saladin un
known, gives admission to King Rich
ard's soldiers, rescues Richard and re
ceives as his reward the hand of the
"Princess Guinevere," whose disguise is
thrown off to meet the emergency, when
the king says that she Is far away. .The
bag of gold that the three conspirators
have received as their share for treason
Is seized by King Rieharu, who is there
by once more affluent. Tbe curtain -goes
down for the last time with every one as
happy - as. could be made as a climax to
the story, Saladin excepted.
There are three acts- in the opera. The
first two are too long as they now stand.
Some way to shorten 7 by cutting would
hasten the movement. 1 . The performance
consumes the time, with brief Intermis
sion between acts, from 8:16 to 11:30 or
later. The last act is. quite short. It is
lesÂ« meritorious than the first two.
The King goes with his army.. to fight
the Saracens. Saladin, "the unutterably
awful," plots with the three conspirators
to deliver King Richard into his hands.
With the British soldiers, the daughter
of .the King, "Princess Guinevere," has
gone on the journey, disguised as a young
knight. The conspirators In fur
nishing Saladin an opportunity to t cap
ture King Richard.
I California.
Inez Cams! made her bow to a San
Francisco audience last evening at the
California Theater, both as composer of
an opera 'and also as" director. She is
aleo the maker of the book of the opera.
Â« which is entitled "Tbe Crusader and the
; Saracen.**
] Of the music of the opera It may be
j fairly said, without considering local pre
judice in favor of a local musician, that
\u25a0 It Is very cleverlj orchestrated for the
1 most part: that it has passages of much
! beauty; that it Js original in that it doe 3
j not remind the average auditor of other,
mnsie that he has heard: that it has at
j le^st. one more than satisfactory ensem
j hie, at the close of. the first "act, where
melody is abounding' and where the opera
Is at its best;, that, whilst the -melodies
are singularly- without- the vivacity that
is . ordinarily supposed to be . peculiarly
\u25a0 characteristic of comic 'opera, the. general
excellence of the .orchestral score and the
vocal parts carry, the Interest so . that
more rapid movements ..and greater va
riety of. tempo can be dispensed with,
if the acting moves briskly. - . f
The story., of â¢ the book to easily sum
marized. . Kjng Richard, "the. lion-heart
ed." is the "Crusader." j Is . bankrupt
scd In danger of total- Impoverishment to
meet Use demands of his * creditors. Far
from being the '."llon-hearted, 1 * he la cow
ardly and is ready to abandon the "King
business." A troubadour, "Blondel," who
is in love with King â¢ Richard's daughter,
appears on the scene and proposes to the
King, as a measure ' to recoup his for
tunes, that be shall Invade the land of
the Saracen and take possession of great
values in coin and jewels that the pagan
is reported by the troubadour to possess.
There are three conspirators against the
Kles and they figure very largely in the
development of the plot. " < - !<
"Toto" 'was shaved as ''clean tas a
greased pig ats a country j fair, "and his
taiJ was. tufted like a two-handled sword.
His teeth were as of ' ivory, and his riose /

And now to Ysaye. The violinist in
evitably suffered in the situation. His
"Airs Russes,** that ended his experi
ence and programme last night, -was
quite nervously handled in contrast
with the truly magnificent Bach that
opened it. It wetae impossible to im
agine anything of nobler plan than M.
YsayÂ«?*s reading of this Bach concerto.
It were more impossible to imagine a
tone of more miraculous sweetness.
Ysaye is the Sembrich of violinists
h*>re. Perhaps he is here most charac
teristically wonderful. It is the round
est, sweetest of violin voices, translu
cently pure, miraculously varied.
Bach in this violinist's hands is as safe
as Shakespeare In Miss Marlowe's. It fs
Bach pure, no obtrusion of the Ysaye
personality, an absolutely reverent and
an ineplr^d* reading. The magic of the
man drew the orchestra here into like
sympathy. In the Adagio there were mo
ments when one forgot that it was 'not a
metropolitan orchestra behind the violin
ist. Throughout, by the way, there was
a commendable absence of over loudness
in the orchestral setting. But one can
not hope to hear Bach more beautifully
played than was this, not even by Kreis
lerâand one cannot say more.
There was much of the same sheer,
regnant, majestic beauty In the render
ing of the Beethoven concerta. Majes
ty is the keynote of the Ysaye playing.
It Is big all round, tone, reading, tech
nique. It is rather a romantic Beeth
oven that M. Ysaye gives one. perhaps
a shade of a shade at times sentimen
tal. In the Larghetto one got this feel
sometimes. But by this time the limi
tations of the orchestra had imposwi
themselves and M. Ysaye played con
scious of them. One felt for the or
chestra, but one quite sympathized with
the violinist when he turned round to
hiss-s-s-s* a.t the horn that turned
sour and to shout "piano!" at them.
But doubtless thing* will go better to
night.
The WienawsM ballade and polonaise
with piano alone came most weleomely.
The hands were of the gladdest that ap
plauded the loveliest reading of the bal
lade that most of us had ever heard,
and a polonaise brilliantly spirited. The
audience, a good one for the time of
year, got up on the chairs to applaud,
and got the "Airs Russes" as encore.
To-night Ysaye plays as chief work
the SaJnt-Saens concerto in B minor, and
it Is to --be .'remembered that until he
comes againâ perhaps another seven
years henceâ there will be no chance to
hear these works again. -
BI*ANCHB PARTINGTON.
One felt truly last night that San Fran
cisco \u25a0was exactly what It \u25a0'has been so
frequently dubbed, "a big village.** Here
Is one of the royalties of art. one of .the
noblest geniuses that ever took bow In
hand, come with the rich Intent of giv
ing iÂ» Ms best. Almost aJI of the great
violin works are represented an Tsaye's
programmes. To give tbese an orches
tral setting is essential and to import an
orchestra an . Impossibility.
Accordingly a local orcaesya has been
gathered in from the few mnsTfrnnders
net swallowed up in lie maws of thÂ«
cafes and theaters. It Is not a repre
sentative orchestra, but Quite the best un
der tie" circumstances. It has. been well
rehearsed by Mr. Steindorff. | It Is anxi
ously ta earnest and notably conscien
tioas. In the orchestral numbers It
achieved fair results. In tne Bach con
certo some astonishing moments of deli
cacy and sympathy. Tet one's teeth were
more frequently on edge. One was trem
bling . for the intonation if one was not
praying for the beat. One was trying
to sifve the tone whÂ«o on* was - - not
frunirfTi'-ig' for mere of it.
M. de Befve con3s have done things.
could he da things, it would seem, and li
ds Befve Is the director of the Liege Phil
harmonic Orchestra. How good that is
one does not know. One suspects the
fabulous. Evidently the conductor is 111
ac<juainted â has not been "*up' against"
as we say here, the exigencies of a
Gfr&tch Western orchestra. His task w&s
not easy, and perhaps it is premature to
Judge r-irn. Bnt M. de Befve appears to
bave only a loose gTip upon his men, to
hold a timid and imauthoritative baton.
Be followed M. Ygaye with only Indif
ferent sympathy and seemed generally
afraid of tne situation. A person with
the courage and energy of a Polacco
Twig-h^ have done something; M. de Befve
may do something later, perhaps â¢ to
night and the rest of the week. The
point is that until we have an orchestra
fit to round out the art of an Ysaye, a
Kreisler, a Schumann-Heink, we ghÂ»Â» al

not ofâ the Ysaye Orchestra's possible
ties â or stick to the lesser violin reper
icire with the pianlstic setting, last
rigltt's concert set one a-thinking-
The first of ! the six Ysaye concerts of
the week took place last nigfct at the Al
hambra. A local orchestra onder an Im
ported conductor. M. Jnles As Befve, as
fisted. There wes a noble programme,
and in the circumstances given, not Tg
nobly. Butâ th# hnt was big. There
were a. few moments only, during the
concert whea onÂ« codd listen In abso
lute comfort. ~Sct can we biaxae any one
but ourselves. ~ ' \u25a0

pany at that time was the strongest on

\u25a0 UJ , i TO BREAK FROM JAIL
OMAHA, Neb.. May 15.â Disappointed in
her effort' to serve her summons on Sec
retary Loeb on hi 3 return from Colorado
with the President. Mao "Wood "to-day
turned ', her attention once more to Sen
ator Platt.- In a statement to the j press
she tells of the' Senator's wooing and
their break, when" she ordered him from
her room. The Senator, Miss Wood de
clares, had frequently called for. her with
his carriage and taken her driving, until
"another lady, friend of his became
awfully jealous."
"My , own friends feared she would do
something desperate 'and advised ma to
leave town," she says. "Several times,
to prevent scandal, I had to leave my
office when" I knew she was coming. Platt
himself pleaded .with me to keep out of
her way and usually warned me she was
coming. to see me." : . â¢.*.
: Referring to Platfs denials of the
authenticity of the letter published last
week., Miss Wood asks:
'"Why ; does he not sue me . for forgery
or have! me arrested .'on 'that charge 1 ? I
dare that crowd to get me into court on
any pretext whatever.. They will not get
a chance to take any more of my papers.
I ; am ready for them. ". Within reach of
my hand day and night is a derringer. %
Next person who - attempts to get \u25a0 my
papers will surely find trouble."

N"EW YORK. May 15. â Somewhat to
the astonishment of those present at
the monthly dinner to-night of the Phi
Delta Pel Club, an organization of law
yers, Justice Vernon M. Davis, of the
Supreme Court of the 'State of New
STork, who was the guest of honor, gave
his opinion as to the guilt of "Nan"
Patterson, while making an argument
In defense of Assistant District Attor
hey Band, â¢who had prosecuted the
woman at her three trials for the mur-
Cer of "Caesar" Young.
Justice Davis, who presided at the
first tyro trials of the former chorus
ttrl, said that she had lied from be
rlnnlcc to end, and It nas his opinion
Chat the majority of the community
now believes that Miss Patterson held
the pistol Â»t Trhich ' Youns vms shot;
Chat J. Morgan Smith ; bought the
weapon and grave it to her, charging
her at the same time Trlth the duty of
"scaring" Young.
During the Justice's remarks the re
sorters were asked to leave the room,
tut before they had reached. the door
they were called back by the speaker,
Who said that he left it to their dis
cretion as to just what parts of his
*peeeh were to be used.
*"VVe have heard a great deal in the
public press of late of severe criticism
rf Mr. Band and his conduct of the
trial," said the Justice. \u25a0 "You cannot
prosecute a criminal without telling
frhat you believe to be the truth. In
{he second trial before me the de
fendant went on the stand, and it was
suite obvious that she was telling
falsehoods from beginning, to end. The
rery air seemed charged with the fact
fhat she was lying. She was young. It
U-as natural that the public should
lympathize with her. People seemed to
know that she was not telling the
truth, and the gTeat public of New
Fork eald: 'Why should she not lie?
Â£et her lie. Let her get the benefit of
Â«er lies.' . \u25a0:-';\u25a0â¢-. \u25a0 ...

The husband of the woman, who has
been made Insane by "^privation "is the
owner of a moving van and works Inter

this kind, however, lias not been plenti

family has grown steadily worse. Ac
cording to the testimony of people who
have known them* since they came to
Oakland. Tinnln has several times
been furnished with employment, but
has seemed disinclined.* to engage in
steady work. j
Mrs. Tlnnln was removed on Sunday to
a private sanitarium v at Berkeley, gy'm
pathetic neighbors having arranged for
her care. Those who have volunteered to
care for the destitute, woman areJAu
truetus Johnson, Fred Stoer and William
Fenwick, superintendent of the Oakland
racetrack, and it was at the expense of
these men. that the woman was taken
to thk hossital. . -
Not realiitng the terrible significance.
of their mother's actions, the tittle ones
were laughing In childish glee at her
strange ravings and even when she was
taken from the house to a sanitarium at
Berkeley, the children, the oldest of whom
Is but 13 years of age, Aid not suspect that
the, one they loved had ? been taken from
them by a fate even worse than death.
/Upon investigation the Tinnin home
revealed the pitiful condition of the fam
ily, for there was not enough food In the
honsÂ« to furnish the nourishment of
which the mother stood so much '-4n need.
OAKLAND, May 15.â Wrecked in mind
and body by privation and worry. Mrs.
C. W. Tlnrdn, wife of an expressman of

a raving maniac, in her home, 2304 San
Pablo avenue. The unfortunate wotnmn,
reduced almost to a skeleton by lack of
food, was found by neighbors, who, on
entering the bouse, found Mrs. Tlnnin
struggling to escape from the grasp of
her five little children, who were holding
her In bed. that she might' not leave the
house unclothed.

determined that if nothing -else 'is accom
plished - during his '.administration --the
streets of the city shall be. put' in such
condition ,thatt^they"^can.' be pointed 'to
with pride. In = many - cases the streets
have been paved or macadaml2ed in sec

OAKLAND, May la.â A battle In the
â¢ Ity Council to-night for possession of
Â»lock and warehouse privileges at Frank
lin street between the Dimond Freight
and Express line and the rehabilitated
Piper- Aden-Ooodall Company of San
Francisco sent a bid of JT3 a month
rental for the dock np to MOO a montn,
that figure being- tendered by . the new
comers. Charges were made by Frank
G. Drtixy, secretary of ths Dimond com
pany, that the Piper people- -were not
s-lir.gr In good 'aith; that the heavy bid
was made in an attempt to drive them
out of business and to stifle a competition
in freight handling: between Oakland and
San Francisco,' which had been In ex
istence for nine years. Captain." I. K.
Hibberd, formerly of the Northern Com
mercial Company, denied the charge, flat
ly aseertlnff that his people were ready
to conduct a legitimate business as a
common carrier; that they desired to ob
tain the wharf facilities and were ready
to pay for them.
"When tbÂ« bid of the Dimond company
was opened and. read, ITS a month for. a
five years" lease, Fred M. Campbell, who
was with Captain Hibberd, threw a
bombshell by announcing aa -increase o*
19 pÂ«r cent over that figure. Drury raised
another 10 per cent and the bids ran up
w*rd oirlO pw cent raise* until the Di*
mend people stopped at $35? a month.
C*pta& Tilbberd nodded t<S " Campbell,
wfco called "J400." Then Drury asked to
be heard, and he made hia charges of
lack <jf good faith. ... . .. 1.
After Hibberd had replied. Councilman
Elliott said the matter was too important
to be decided at once. He moved that it
lay over until netft Monday night and
that representatives of the Merchants'
Exchange and in* Board of Trade -b* re
quested to take part in the discussion: It
was a question. hÂ« thought, of deciding
whether ther* was any dang&r .that a
competing freight service would be shut
out. The Dimond line has been operating
the steamers Mt. Eden and Dimond' for
nfnÂ£ years. .. They pairt J5O a month rental
until a year and a half ago. when the
charge was raised to $75. Hugh Dlmcnd,
the head of the company, said there wa?
S3S.QW invested in the business! The
Council voted to bear further discussion
in committee of the whole Monday nlgbt.
An ordinance wae introducÂ«^i tornigjit !
providing for dairy inspect Jon under <Jir .
rectton of the Board of Health and fixing
a license tax of $3 a quarter for dairies
selling :moT*. thin ten gallons of - mTTk
dally - end ;W cents a quarter tor dairies ",
selling lew thaix ten gallons .a day. The
ordinance provides for appointment of
inspectors, forbids the sale of adulterated
milk and provides penalties, for non-ob-;
servance. It was referred to the commTt
tee of the whole. Â»
The new bicycle ordinance was sent
back to committee for amendment to
permit cripples to use tricycles on tne ;
fidewalks without restrictions.
"There appears to be. in the minds of
some, a doubt >.as to -whether the
students -have a right or do not have
a right to vat* In Berkeley.: That,
however, is another matter, which will
bf- taken u)> next fall. For thirty-flve
years the student vote has been cast
without challenge. â¢ .
"The executive committee of the As
sociated Students at : its regular meet
ing 1 on May 2d demanded that the
JCOn-Partisan party committee of the
Second Ward. substantiate the charges
that had appeared in the public prints,
as rmanating from thatcommittee, in
volving: the words "fraud," "felony"
and "perjury," in connection with the
voting of students at the recent mu
nicipal election in' Berkeley. "
-"The " so-called Non-Partisan com
mittee, with one exception, has taken
to the woods; and those members of
the committee who talked the loudest
were among the first to reach the tall
timber. The man who is the single
eXcepU6n" "declares that he never, used
those word* and furthermore does not
believe,. that there, was any fraudulent
voting or any. perjury or any felony.;
"The Outcome of tHe demand' made
by the Association Students would, be
iaugrhable if it were not pitiable.; It is
a very serious matter: this represent
ing that a larffc body, of students, or
that any of them,- have been:guilty of
"fraud," of "perjury." or of "felony" in
connection with' their voting. The de
mand for proof was made in order that
it.znight.be determined whether the
charges be fact or fiemcnt. Therefore
the executive committee '- pronounces
these .charges to bÂ« flement.. - -1
BERKELEY. May 16. â After waiting:
what it considers a reasonable length"
of time for the Non-Partisan politicians
In the Fourth Ward to bring- proof to
support the charge that students were
guilty of fraudulent registration and
illegal voting:, in response to tliecom
mUtee'^requestfor such proof, a state
ment was issued to-day by the execu
tive committee, expressing- its opinion
of the entire affair, and of the Non-
Partlsan men in particular. - ; . .
Professor Edwards is understood to
have drafted the statement, which
reads as follows:.
.** The local police ' have . taken charge
of, the investigation that Is being con

The Martha Davis sailed from Uis port
on April 25 and arrived at Hilo May 9.
Bhe was a well-known â¢vessel in this
port.
Besides the captain che had a crew of
thirteen men. The burned vessel was
built in 1573 at East Boston, Mass., by
Smith & Townsend. She was S7l tons
gross and TBO tons net, 163:3 feet in length,
33:7 feet in breadth and 21 feet in
depth.
The origin of the fire is unknown here.
Bhe was in command of Captain C. H.
Malcolm, formerly in command of the
Willscott.
'ihe vessel was owned by Welch & Co.
and was valued at about $15,000. No in
surance was carried on her.
The wooden bark Martha Davis, was
destroyed by flre at aâ. o on Saturday
night. She is reported to be a total loss.
Her inward cargo, which she was dis
charging at the time, had nearly all been
landed on the dock. This cargo was of
the most inflammable character. It con
sisted of powder, coal oil, hay. hops,
lumber, lime, groceries, ~our, wheat, po
tatoes, canned goods, hardware, barley,
rice, tobacco and 7555 gallons of wine. It
was valued at $40,251.

Achievement and a Distinct Vic-
f : tory -for the Electro-Ghemic
Th* development of the ' Electro-Chemlo
treatment . in th* cure of Cancers and Tumors
Is the greatest, medical- achievement 'Of tola >
ago. |or any age. for that matter. Surgeons
were- often able to remove cancers and I tumors
successfully, the. patients living through tha
operation. . only to have a return of the dtseoss
in some other location after a few months*,
time. The germ of cancer cannot be cut away,
and it the germ remains In tha system tha dis-
ease of necessity Is surÂ« to return. Electro-
chemistry kills the germ, and If surgeons
would give their patients a course oÂ£ Electro-
chemistry , after their operations for the rÂ«- .
moval,of the cancer, or tumor mass,. thÂ«ra
would be no return of the disease. The spe-
cialists of the Electro-Chemic Institute 113
Grant aye.. arc -now giving many patients a \u25a0
course of Electro-Chemistry after surgical
treatments, and every patient operated upon
should have this Electro-Chemic course.- It \u25a0
should be remembered, however. â¢ that many of
these severe cases will be cured by Electro-
Chemistry without operation and it' Is also Im-
portant to remember - that the Electro-Chemic: '
treatment \u25a0Is absolutely painless, \u25a0 absolutely '
harmless and entirely \u25a0 without danger. . â¢ \u0084 â¢
The wonderful achievements .of Electro-
chemistry are not confined to th* curs of can-
can.: tumors, ulcers, old sores, abscesses, lup-
us, eczema and all blood and . skin disease*,
but It Is, successful when all other treatments
fall.. In consumption, catarrh, asthma, bron-

THE crying economic need of California for years has been
the snbdrvisicm cÂ£ the immerons large landed, estates. The
Sacramento Vaiiev especially, has suffered from these large
, estates, that tcctc held together "by the pride of possession- For a
long-time the tendency cÂ£ ; large holdings was to increase rather
than diminish, A small holder -would acquire land joining one ; of
these principaHdes aad wovHd go on improTing his place and rear
ing his family, to finally discorer that he was isolated, had no
neighbors and that there was no school for, his children. Then tie
wanted to sell and there was no buyer except the owner of the do
main which had isolated him, and his holding - was added to an
estate alreadj* too large for the good of the commonwealth.
In that way the rural population of the Sacramento Valley ac
tually decreased for several years. There. was a steady diminution
-in the number of country homes and families, and in the' number
of farms. While this was going on. in, the Sacramento* Valley- the
reverse was in progress in the San Joaquin; ' for," notwithstanding
the large holdings of the Kern County Land Company and of Mil
ler & Lux.. the small holdings in that Valley rapidly increased. This
â¢-was done by men of means ; buying up large tracts of land lat what
"might be called a wholesale price per acre and cutting it into small
holdings that sold readily at a retail price which, Avhile not high,
gave a handsome profit- This process has now "extended toi the
Sacramento Valley, with results which deserve to be studied y.be
.cause they disclose the value of California \ land: -Â«
The Cone ranch in Tehama County; an area of; 100,000 acres,
â¢has been taloen by a syndicate at a wholesale ' price and is 'be^ing
rapidly sold in small tracts at a minimum of $50 and a maximum
of $100 per acre. : These prices, while so reasonable >that^the -sales
are rapid, are yet a significant index of the value of ;"Galifornia\landl
These lands are about 150 miles from San Francisco, ; and are re
.^note' from, other large centers of^population l<:.\ : It' *isV known
nearness to concentrated populations . is . an < element of .value in * agri
cultural lands. If, â¢therefore/; these remote hands "readily bring .that
price, what is the conclusion as to lands of t *equal ; fertility nearer to
the large city ; populations? The great deduction from; it' is^tliat
the large estates are;. gradually: becomingvtoo valuable to 'be held
together, and theirsubdiyisibn will come by natural v processes.

THE problem
of the" serv-
This grave situation is treated by some as a problem of distri
bution. While this mass of idleness and want grows like a great
cancer in the flesh of cities, there is in the country an unsatisfied
demand for labor. But the stream of immigration that pours into
ports of the Atlantic seaboard stops where it lands. Recruited
originally from the ranks of povery, ignorance and squalor in the
countries which gladly emit it, this alien stream adds to the hard
problem that is upon us. It is proposed that the Government at
the public expense undertake the distribution of the immigrants that
are landing in ever increasing numbers. The proposition- is un
sound. Immigrants are landing at the rate of 20,cc0 a day, some
times. To distribute them will cost more per head than the price
01 their ocean passage. The most of them do not want to be dis
tributed. The power of the Government to ship them anywhere
against their will is more than doubtful. What do we want of
immigrants who do not follow the line of least resistance in dis
tributing themselves?
Nothing more plainly illustrates the difference between the
aliens we are receiving now and those of fifty and sixty years ago.
They distributed themselves. They had definite plans when they
came. They knew what they -wanted to do and sought of their
own motion the place where it could be best done. These that
come now seem lacking in that kind of foresight, and hence this
call upon the Government to make up their lack of that quality
at onr expense. It is idle to look about for power in the Govern
ment to distribute these people after they land. It has no such
power, any more than it has the power to distribute our native
population at wilL
The suggestion, however, indicates the gravity of the sitnation.
Is there any other country that is in the torment of listening to the
groans of 10.000.000 of permanent indigents. which at the same
time is receiving 1.000,000 a year of alien immigrants, most of them
refugees from permanent indigence in their own country? Public
and private charities are staggered by the task of feeding, clothing,
sheltering and caring for 10.000,000 of panpers. Hotv can snch a
burden be lifted?
Obviously there is only one way. Oa.se adding to the mass
of want and woe. Exclude European immigration just as rigidK
as Asiatic That we have iqjooaooo of people idle and pauperized
is evidence that the demand for labor and the supply are disjointed.
Under such circumstances to add to the supply "wrbile the demand
remains stationary is worse than felly. If philanthropy be involved
in the exclusion of European immigration it is 2 mistake to ask, in
ihe name of that virtne, for the admission of these people. It is not :
to their advantage to come. It does them no good, and it harms
our own people. The only "beneficiary is the ootmtrv from which
immigrants come. It is draining off its; population. It is. getting
ri iof the wctst ard TveakejFJ. It is eigualisnnj labor srrppjy wiih
the demand. It is securing conditions that reduce permanent in
digence to a minimum. It is transferring its hard conditions and
its problem of poverty to ns. and we wail about it, and impulsive
humanitarians go about referring the results to inherent flaws in
our system of government and to social conditions. *
As a matter of fact there is no siructnral weakness in onr Gov
ernment and none in our social conditions. The tremble is that
for nearK- twenty years we have submitted to be the dumping
ground of all Europe. It is known, proved by evidence, that, taking
advantage of our romantic folly, and of the snpineness of onr poli
ticians, other Governments have herded their paupers, insane, fee
ble-minded and incorrigible, ' and have grubstaked them as emi
grants to the United States. :
Xo country can stand as a scapegoat for the -whole, world. The
day when we invited people, to "come from every nation, come
from every way," because Uncle Sam was rich enongh to buy for
all a farm, has gone.. Roast pigs no longer run around -with knife
and fork stuck in their hams, asking to be eaten. We have passed
our romantic youth as a nation, and are not called -apon" to weep
over the sorrows of distant TmTlih'ms, and to offer them an asylum.
We need not yearn even to divide our liberty with cmr brother
from a distance, who does not know "what it means: If we have
grown old enough and big enough to have 10,000,000 of indigent
people in our city slums, we can best use our age and wisdom in
dealing with the awful problem they present to us.
â¢Let it be understood, too, that we cannot , solve that problem
and at the same time take in I,oooxoo a year of refugees from the
same problem in Tinrope.
yT is said that in the large cities of- the East there are 10,000,000
I of people in want. The number may be exaggerated, but the
â¢*\u25a0 fact remains that every year sees an appreciable increment to the
number of permanent indigents in this country. It is stated also
that a large majority of these permanent indigents are foreign im
migrants. When these land, they join the "colonies" of their coun
trymen already located in cities, and remain there, a fixed problem,
increasing the congestion of the slunis and adding every year
to the awful features of city life. The problem of their care is be
coming too large. Private benevolence and public charity cannot
undertake the maintenance of 16,000,000 of indigents. To do so
would break the treasury of an empire. It is a mass of ignorance
and want so immense that no administration of charity can do
much more than make it more sensible of its misery.

To the May number of the North Ameri
can Review Ilavelock Ellis contributes an
extremely interesting \u25a0\u25a0'â¢- article, " entitled
"The Tercentenary of 'Don Quixote,' " on
Cervantes ' and his ca reer. '\u0084 Mr. El Its ac
cords to "Don Quixote" the , supreme
place among works of fiction. Judged by
the standards, of the critics, he admits
that there may be : othersâ such as the
novels of . Flaubert, â¢'Tristram Shandy,"
"Robinson Crusoe." "Tom* Jones," etc.â
which are finer works of art, more; ex
quisite in style and of more perfect plan.
But they are not equally amusing,
equally profound, to the men of. all na-..
tlons and all ages and' all degrees of
mental capacity, as "Don Quixote" is.
Mr. Ellis says: , ; /_.-;:- " ;\u25a0' -.' .",' \u25a0
. " 'Don Quisotc' remains the one great
typical novel. It is a genuine invention;
for it combined. for the first time the old
chivalrous stories of heroic achievement
with the new picaresque stories of .vulgar,
adventure," creating in r the combination
something that was altogether new.; an
instrument that was capable of touching
life at every point. â¢ It leads us into an
atmosphere in which' the ideal, and the
real; are equally at home. It: blends;to
gether the greatest and the gayest things
In the world. - It penetrates to j the - har
mony that underlies the violent contrasts
of life, the only harmony which in our
moments of finest insight we feel -to be
possible, in the same manner and, . In
deed, at the same momentâ for 'Lear' ap
peared in the same year as 'Don Quixote'
âthat Shakespeare brought together in
the madman and the fool on the ; heath
In a concord of . divine humor. -.It \is j a
story book that a child may , enjoy, a
tragicomedy that only the: wisest can
fully understand. It has inspired many
of the masterpieces of literature; it has
entered into the lives of ' the people of
every civilized land; it has become a part
of our human civilization-" ,

The police doubt the injured man's'

The prevailing theory is that he at
tempted his life because of despond

a dance after 1 o'clock yesterday morn

gency Hospital. Dr. Tillman tried to
probe' for the bullet, but the patient
refused^! to allow the surgeon to, aid
him or -"make, a thorough examination.
His mother says it was an accident,
but when Tremaine 'was asked to ex
plain the shooting he involved himself
in many contradictory statements. A
love affair Is suspected.

The organization committee of the San
Francisco. Republican League .met at
general headquarters, 63Â« Market street,
last evening. George D. Clark, chair
man; D. A. Ryan, secretary; Richard J.
"Welch, David Rich, Johnc S.. Partridge,
John\ D. Daly, E. J. Bowes and John
Lackman attended the session. Many ac
cessions to the league membershipt were
reported. | :_ '_â¢' .*.;. . ; s
Considerable time was .devoted'- to.- the
discuEslon' of affairs regarding \ organi
zation of the forces in the Twenty-eighth
and Twenty-ninth Assembly districts. A
delegation ;of fifty citizens from- the
Twenty-eighth was listened to. \u25a0 Views
touching the political situation In the dis
trict were presented -by 'William Har
rington, B. I*. Conlan, Charles R. Frank
lin, Richard Grimes, Walter Larsen, Pe
ter Kelly, Harry Peterson, Dr. T. W.
Connolly, Charles McKay and Patrick
Sheehy. l*rom a long Hat of .available
Republicans the committee will select ten
or twelve men to act as the district or
ganization committee. The names of Ja
cob Levi Jr., George M. Plnney and
Colonel J. C. Kirkpatrick were submitted
by William Harrington and B. I*. Conlan.
Peter Kelly also made recommendations,
but It Is said â¢ that only two | precincts
were recognized In his list. Some -clever
work in the way of promoting ' harmony
may be required in order to bring into
one camp, the followers of -Harrington,
Conlan, Franklin and Kelly. -
The supporters of ex-Assemblyman
Franklin embrace many of Martin Kelly's
old-time followers. . The John.-C. Lynch
and Jere Burke elements of the district
are represented by Peter Kelly. .The
straight out Republicans generally line
up with Harrington.
The Twenty-ninth District â¢ was repre
sented last night by Leon Samuels, Rich
ard Cox, Jere Collins and others. It is
understood that Jack McNamara will
take the Ruef end of the fight in the
Twenty-ninth.
Representatives of other districts will
be heard to-night. Promoters of the
movement for better municipal I govern
ment appreciate the importance of dis
trict .work, hence ample time will, be
taken to consider the recommendations. It
is the league's idea that all the elements
of good citizenship should be represented
In the district organizations. v
The services of capable public-spirited
men are deslreo. It would \be an easy
matter 'to select ten men offhand | for
each district if. the. league promoters
were creating an organization for their
own special benefit, but "as the purpose
of the movement is to help the city to
better government, the fact is recognized
that the masses of the people in each
district must be consulted and their
wishes considered. ' A" large committee: in
eac_ district is provided so that all fac
tions may. have representation. . . r .
It is probable that Chairman George D.
Clark will be, able this evening, to -an
nounce, the. finance "committee of. forty
citizens. V ,' ,' ' .-_',
The employers to-day, operated I 2000
wagons, practically without injury, many
of the deliveries in the resident \u25a0* portion
of the "\u25a0 city being without police ; protec
tion. . It is asserted that the number of
wagons in service to-day will be increased
by 250 to-morrow: and ; that this ratio will
be continued until the i full number: of
wagons Is in service again. '. "
;'The Lumbermen's Association", to-night
passed a resolution ;pn the team
sters to define their position as to what
mlghtbe expected when the lumber firms
of the city called | upon them { to \u25a0: make
deliveries. The association declared that
it 7 was Â» in . favor : ; oort r making de
liveries, irrespective of the strike, and an
nounced that, drivers who refused to de
liver ; goods as I ordered would be > dis
charged." The lumber -concerns ' repre
sented at the meeting employ 1 1300 team
sters, and a . strike -of these would - mean
great embarrassment . to j the building op
erations in the city. . ; iv
CHICAGO, - May 15.â A' practical armis
tice in the teamsters': strike was declared
to-night, to last : until the "\u25a0 officers of , the
International . Brotherhood of Teamsters
meet here,' either on Wednesday 'or
Thursday of this week.
At a meeting: of ..the teamsters" joint
council, to-night to reconsider the action
of Saturday night, when jit was decided
to refuse the demand of ; the -Team Own
ers' Association that deliveries be j made
to houses where strikes exist, the mem
bers of the council reaffirmed their stand
and decided that: they, could i not \u25a0 accede
to the demands of the Team Owners' As

"Get the fog tout of your throats and
swallow the sunshine; get back to old Job
and say. 'We are the people.* and drive
pessimism out of your church life. â¢
"I recently knew of a colored Baptist
congregation. South, dispensing with the
service of their pastor and when asked
the cause the reply was, 'for good and
sufficient reason.' It was told later that
the reason was because the pastor didn't
preach "happyfying* sermons.
"That 1s rightâ preach 'happyfying'
sermons; don't be pessimistic." j
Mr. Norton,- when called upon, \u25a0â¢'â¢ was
greeted with tumultuous applause. S He
gave some idea, of the work of the future
and told of tho opening at 9 o'clock gun
day morning next of a new Sunday school
at Haight and Shrader streets, to which
all were invited.
"There has been enough said about capi
tal and labor and the eulogizing of so
ciety and the condemnation of the mil
lionaire. Such subjects from the pulpit
may fill the church once, but after that
it is empty. - .
"Don't be pessimistic; be optimistic; take
a big dose of optimism; stand on two
feet like men; live what you profess and
what you preach and the city will give
you a hearing and a welcome.
â¢ The Rev. Louis J. Sawyer, pastor of
Hamilton Square Baptist Church, presid
ed. The orchestra of the Third Church
discoursed the music and Mrs. Richard
Bayne rendered vocal selections.
The Rev. W. B. Hinson, D. D., in de
livering the Introductory address, said
many bright and witty things, as well as
offering most serious advice. He said in
part:
"The Baptist denomination should be
scecond to none of the denominations of
Christendom, but to glv* it such stand
ing you must take the Baptist denomina
tion seriously, especially since you hold a
heritage beyond description. Other . de
nominations will say that the difference
between them and the Baptist is the use
of the water in baptism, but it is not the
water between us. We do not stand mere
ly for water, but for individualism. ThÂ«
great thing which differentiates us from
all other denominations is that individual
ism and water has nothing to do with It.
"Baptists must be close to the common
people. It has been said that we haven't
many millionaires in our denomination.
Now, I don't think the abuse of million
aires wise. There has been much said
about Mr. Rockefeller, but those people
who so speak will live to get old and as
they grow older will become wiser. Bap
tists won't suffer ao much from the lack
of millionaires as by getting away from
the heart of the common people.
"Friends, we ought to > get where the
Lord is down among the people. I can
tell you I'd rather preach in a big livery
stable among the people than In a ca

Baptists of San Francisco to the num

Home indorsement, the public ex-
pression of San Francisco people,
should be evidence beyond dispute for
every San Francisco reader. Surely
the experience of friends and neigh-
bors, cheerfully given by them, will
carry more weight than the utterances
of strangers residing in far-away
places. Read the following:
James E. Brown, contracting paint-
er, of 17 Capp street, says: "A man
at my occupation requires a good,
&ound back. If that part of his anat-
omy is weak, lame or aching, every
move of the brush brings torture. Be-
sides, the ingredients used in my call-
ing act directly on the kidneys and
aggravate those organs if they arc
over excited. The first box of Doan's
Kidney Pills brought me such relief
that I bought several more and con-
tinued the treatment until the last at-
tack disappeared."
For sale by all dealers. Price so
cents. Foster-Milburn Co.. Buffalo,
N. V.. sole agents for the United
States.
Remember the name, Doan's, and
take no substitute.

BERKELEY, :May. 15.â The varsity,

of 5 to 0. : The California men were not
obliged to exert ; themselves at. any stage
of the game, and did not care to do so,
having been i out .of : training for five
weeks. The hot weather made hard and
fast work undesirable.
The Japanese ; showed ', they * are clever
fielders,*; but. weak hitters. : They. made a
number \u25a0of creditable and , some , brilliant
plays,' but they.: also i made * errors at : crit
ical moments ,when ! men were on bases.
Captain Causley ; hit ; for . a , home run in
the seventh inning, scoring two men, this
constituting the feature -of , the game.
Newman pitched for. the .varsity, and had
little difficulty in puzzling the brown men
fronv Japan.; He! gave the Japanese team
three hits and one of these was a scratch
of the : "Texas . league" variety. Bliss
caught for the varsity. 'Neither Heitmul

The game .began promptly at 2:30

power to fix rates.
' George B. Robbins. of Chicago, presi

The winner was Pasadena, a three-year

most tminterrlupted winter campaign in

to his alertness in taking advantage of a
wide stretch turn made by Voladay. Big

J. H. Jacobs, 702 Kearny- street, report-.

day evening a lady's- gold watch had
been stolen from his pockefr He was
unable to g|ve any clew to the identity
of .the thief. * * ... '
Pocket Picked of Watch.
The fire was started by some boys
who were amusing "themselves with
matches in a court at the rear. All the
property affected is owned by Schroth
& Co., and is fully Insured. A number
of women living in the lodging-houses
were badly frightened, but otherwise
no one suffered physical injury.
Little Mamie Lee rescued her two
dogÃ and a cat from her burning home
at Martha place yesterday afternoon,
and then fell unconscious In her search
for aged Mrs. Studen, who did the cook
ing for the family. Police Officer Con
nojj. found the girl stretched on the
floor amid the flame and smoke, and
carried her in his arms to the street,
where she was easily revived. Little
Miss Lee was apparently none the
worse for her adventure, although a
trifle excited over the danger in which
her pets had* been placed.
Gus Barberi, of 469 Geary street, was
the first to discover the fire. A 'few
minutes before 5 o'clock he happened
to go to the rear of the art 'store, in
which he Is employed, and saw a great
pile of lumber and rubbish burning
fiercely. He ran to the corner and
turned in the alarm. A second alarm
was given when the Fire Department
arrived, for the rear portions of, the
Lowell, Templor and Avon lodging
houses were then In a blaze. The build
ings were all of wood and burned
readily. The tire did not reach the in
terior of lany of the houses to cause
extensive damage, owing to the rapid
work of the hosemen. The Templor
and three tenement' houses in Martha
place suffered the most. .
At & meeting of the baptist Ministers'
Association yesterday Rev. W. C. Spen
cer read a ' paper on "Bishop Gore on
Gospel Miracles." . . . .
Rev. I. C. MeÂ«erre, D. - D., addressed
the Congregational Ministerial Union yes

A petition invttinsr - the .. International
Sunday School Convention, which will
meet in' Toronto' June .20 ; . t0 27, to meet
in- San Francisco in the y^ar 1908 was
adopted. I>r.;H.- H. Bell In submitting
the petition said that such a convention
in this city would be of the widest im
portance, not alone toward the religious
uplift but as Riving a i stimulus to Sun
day school, work. The" Southern .Pacific.
Santa Fe, Merchants' Association.". Board
of- Trade and other civic bodies were ' in
hearty, co-operation with the proposal to
invite- the convention \u25a0 here, said Dr. Bell.
"Xobody so situated evÂ»r did that but
Christ. Hence it has pleased God from
the beginning, to. raise up all true prophets
and reformers from am4ng their brethren
whom they w^re to teach and reform."
The Rev. .Mr. -Bevier.' announced that
John Knox â¢annivereary celebrations will
be observed next Sunday throughout the
world and. that In. San .Francisco there
will be -special services -In the Presby
terian churches. -'
"He will never himself go to their help,
take up ,thelr burdens, enter Into their
experiences, shares their sorrow, carry
their griefs; if he should try to do it he
would not know how.
"A man looking down from some higher
level of comfort, fulincse and power up
on the lower level where the humbler
masses struggle and suffer, .may feel a
languid, or even an acute sympathy, may
give wise counsel and good-natured char
ity, but he never can be their reformer,
much less their redeemer. . .- ';'..S
\u2666'The** great men. leaders and guides
of sreat and beneftclent movements, have
not been born in palaces, nor in mansions
of nobles, nor. to great estates. It may
be said of every one of them from MbseS,
who was born "In a slave hut in Egypt,
to Abraham Lincoln." born In a log cabin
in the wilderness, that it behooved him
to be made like unto his brethren.
"Under God, Knox was the reformation
in Scotland; the soul of it, the exponent
of It, the guide and leader of it.
"Knox was one of the beacon lights of
modern history. Judged by the results!
that have flowed and are yet flowing
from his life, he was one of the most
potential forces this world has seen in
4iÂ» yeans. For observe, it was not simply
the poor, little country of his birth that
he transformed. The consequences of
what he did there have a scope as wide
as the world and as lasting as time.
MUST BE OF POOR ESTATE.
"The biography of Luther is the story
of the reformation, of Germany. The life
ot \u25a0\u25a0 Calvin, fully studied, would disclose
to us the hidden forces of the best
civilization of the modern world. For
while LÂ»uther was an iconoclast, a caster
down of systems, Calvin was an archi
tect, a system builder.
"Not only had all the creeds and theo
logies of the reformed church their roots
In Geneva, but every free church, free
school, free commonwealth of the modern
world had Its initiative there. *â¢;Â«'
"Even so, the personal life of the great
apostle to the gentiles Is the best'ac
count of Christianity overcoming * the
world.
"If you study the personal history of
George Washington, from deepest root
to topmost twig, you will know the story
of our independence. An adequate life of
Lincoln would.be an adequate history of
the greatest internal convulsion known
to the modern world.
"It is those who believe themselves
wronged, oppressed, trampled upon in
boul, body or estate, who shake down
thrones and overthrow altars.
"The world as it is is. good to these
classes and they have no quarrel with
the existing order of things.
"The sentiment out of which such
movements arise, and the impulse which
gives them action and energy, are al
ways first of all in the minds and hearts
of the common people. The higher
classes, so called, the rich and ruling
classes never inaugurate reforms which
have for their end the uplifting of the
masses., the enlargement of human rights,
and the removal of abuses whether secu
lar or religious.
"When a sentiment or conviction In the
minds and hearts of the mass of the
common people becomes vital, widely dif
fused and strenuous It brings an agita
tion, fermentation and their natural lead
ers are thrown upward and forward, and
Â«o become under God the . guides of the
people.
â¢\u2666COMMON PEOPLE" RULE.
"All really great And beneficent move
ments in human history have their center
or focus in sreat men. Primarily, Al
mislity God is the creator alike of the
movements and the men. It is he who
furnishes ail efficient impulse, power and
guidance: also the fit instruments to bet
ter great or small. Â»Â»-Â«':,^i;
"It was nearly time for him to be
chloroformed, according to Dr. Osier, and
yet after this time he did & work which
transformed the Scottish nation and
which has cent Ite pulsing influences all
over the civilized world.
"When John Knox returned to/ his
native land folly equipped for thÂ«" great
mission to which he had been appointed
by the Lord he was then fifty-four years
old, and past the dead line, according to
current reckoning.
The four hundredth anniversary of the
birth of John Knox. through whose lead
ership Scotland was wrested from domin
ance of tha established church, waa ob
served- in Ban Francisco yesterday at a
meeting of representatives from Protest
ant denominations on both sides of the
bay. Those faithful to the memory of
the great religious exponent gathered at
the Presbyterian Mission Home at 920
Sacramento street, and incidentally were
treated to a highly Interesting address
by Rev. John W. IMnsmore. who spoke
the enlogy. Rev. H. N. Bevler, president
of the Presbyterian Ministers' Union, pre
sided over the gathering.
Dr. DinsmorCs address was as follows,

NEW YORK. May 15. â^There was come re
sumption of operations for the advance to-day
oa the Stock Exchange, but they gave the
appearance of being . almost altogether In pro
fessional hands. A sttrklnr feature of thÂ«
n.arket was its lapee Into dullness verging
on stagnation at the higher level of prices.
The renewal of operations on the losg side
of the market was based on the conviction
that forced liquidation of weak speculative
accounts bad been completed and that it
would be xrcrsalbl* to advsnea the level oft
price* without bringing out any unsupport*
able burden of offerings. Very general eon.
fidenca Is still felt in the soundness of the
b-jfinets and financial situation and In the
sufficient supplies In the money market for >
the seeds of the immediate future. There
are some sursestlons -of disapproval on the
part of important basking and money powers
of any active speculation at this time or any
suSden and violent movement of prices. - But
this- Old not make its*if evident to-day, in
active opposition to the advance. Some ob
Â»taclÂ«e were met during the early part of
tkÂ« day, but they wers resisted and ultimately
overcome. Tbe most notable of tbee* was the
eeUicg for London account, left over liquida
tion following the settlement making Itself
felt aeain In that market. Bnt tbls influence
proved less effective than tbe comprehensive
revival of a full line of merger and dividend
lncreae* rumors, which have served the pur
pose of advancing prices several times al
ready. - The bearing on the Northern Secu
rities adjustment was especially prominent
and there was added to them the new 'sug- i
gestlon of a proposed retirement of tha Bur
lington pnrefcase bonds by an issue of new
stock by the holding companies. Among: the
Industrials old rumors of combination wera.
revived by the news of a plan for Ow absorp- \
tion of thÂ« rubber roods company, the United

disclosed in tbe organization of the new
American Smelter Securities Company. It
was assumed In somÂ« quarters that a grow
ing ' Investment demand for bonds could be
detected, which was to be ascribed to tha

new Issues are etlll ljÂ» the hands of under

the penfl market finds explanation In theKe
fact's. Railroad officials reported most roads

upturn I had its inception at . Minneapolis, where |.
May wheat -showed 5 cents gain and July over

was . attributed to flood conditions In tho Red
River Valley.: Prospects \u25a0 of ' improved weather/
conditions started renewed selling of July J' As
a result- the price again sagged off.^: A feature,
of ; the .: trading- was- the incased: business in
