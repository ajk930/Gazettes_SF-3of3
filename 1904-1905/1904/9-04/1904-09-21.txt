tis of Illinois sprang to his feet and in
a short, incisive speech nominated E. S.
Conway of Chicago. 111. Hardly had
the applause subsided when Repre
sentative Case of Tennessee placed
in nomination J. Â¦ L. Nolan of Ten
nessee. During the applause sev
eral representatives sprang to their
feet to second the nominations and
name other candidates. Rapidly follow
ing each other in short seconding
speeches came Representatives- Brown
of Kansas and Leuders of Washington
on behalf of Conway, while Repre
sentatives Davis of Connecticut, Vin
cent of West Virginia and Page of New
Hampshire seconded the nomination of
Nolan. Following this came the nom
ination cf W. L. Kuykendall of Wyo
ming by Representative Hughes of,
Ohio. Scarcely had the applause died
away when Representative Randall of
Nebraska nominated G. S. Hoagland of
Nebraska. Following these nomina
tions came seconding speeches from
representatives of Arizona, Georgia, In
dian Territory, South Carolina, Mis
souri. New Mexico, Wisconsin, Texas
and Oklahoma. J
FIRST BALLOT.
After the four nominations had been
made the small slips of paper that were
to decide the election of the deputy
were distributed. The result of the vot
ing gave Conway SS votes, Nolan 59.
Kuykendall 3S and Hoagland 6.
This result necessitated the taking of
a second ballot, as the number neces
sary to elect an officer is set bv the
constitution at ninety-six votes. Upon
the announcement of the result of the
flrst ballot Kuykendall of Wyoming
withdrew from the race, followed by
Hoagland of Nebraska. This threw
forty : four votes upon the other two
candidates, and the balloting began.
After a few minutes of silence It was
announced that E. S. Conway of Illi
nois had received 102 votes, while his
opponent. J. L.. .Nolan, received 89.
Conway was declared elected deputy
grand sire amid rounds of applause.
OTHER OFFICERS ELECTED.
Xext came the election of the grand
secretary, and Representative Gaunt of
Kentucky nominated J. Frank Grant,
the present grand secretary. One ballot
was taken and he was re-elected, this
being the fourth time he has been se
lected for the office." Representative
Thomas of .Utah placed the present
grand treasurer, M. R. Muckle. for re
election to the post of grand treasurer.
On the first, ballot he was re-elected,
this being the fifth time he has served
the order, in that capacity.
On Saturday will take place the in-
stallation of the newly elected officers
with the exception of Grand Sire-elect
Robert E. TV'right, and then will come
the filling of the appointive offices.
These are assistant grand secretary,
grand j chaplain, grand marshal, grand
guardian and grand messenger.
. By this time 2 o'clock had arrived
and the representatives . were fatigued
with the excitement and suspense. After
appointing that thev selection of the
next meeting place of the session shall
be decided to-day, the session ad
journed until 9 o'clock this morning.
Â¦ The rood work - done by former grand pa
triarchs, the enthuslam that has .prevailed

A BANNER YEAR.
â¢Â¦â¢The f r fiftieth annual session, of the
Grand' ..Encampment of the Odd Fel-'
lows of California convened in " Odd.
Fellows'- - Hall yesterday morning.
Grand Patriarch W. H. Woodbridge^
presided at session, and Grand
Scribe H. Barnes occupied
the secretary's desk. 'The chief busi
ness of the morning was the reading
of reports of grand officers, the selec
tion' of-; a place of meeting : for next
year and* the conferring of the -grand
encampment . degree upon 102 candi
dates. This and the reading of the
reports evoked much enthusiasm from
the assembled delegates.
. By a unanimous vote San Diego was
chosen "as the next meeting-place.
Â¦At the afternoon sessions officers
were nominated for the ensuing year.
The .'only contest is for the office of,
grand junior warden. Grand Patriarch
Woodbridge will be elected grand
representative for a period of two
years; Stanley A. Smith of Downie
ville will succeed him as grand' pa
triarch; George Jesson of Watson
ville will succeed Smith as grand high
priest; C. H. Burden, of Sonora will
be the next grand senior warden; Wil
liam H. Barnes will retain the office of
grand secretary, and C. E. Benedict

Osthoff of San Francisco. H. F. G.
Wulff of Sacramento, Fred E. Pierce
of Los Angeles. Captain Chappell of
Vallejo. F. E. Colley of San Jose and
y. L. Turoin of San Francisco.
The report of Grand Scribe William
H. Barnes shows some interesting fig
ures. The year 1903 was prosperous,
but the twelve months ending June 30.
1904. break the record. The grand
scribe says:
The golden Jubilee anniversary of th* Grand
Encampment of California is held under most
auspicious surroundings and circumstances:
1901 Is a re4 letter year on th* Pacific Coast
for fraternity for many reasons, and espe
cially is It a marked event for American
Odd Fellowship from the fact that the
Sovereign Grand Lodge is in session In this
city at this time .and that the membership
of the Golden State have the pleasure of meet
ing and greeting the veterans and eminent men
from all parts of the national jurisdiction â
those who have devoted their lives, talsnts
acd energies to the onward progress of the
mightiest fraternity the world has ever
knownâ the Independent OrCer of Odd Fellows
And while they come to this - land of the
Pacific, we of "this Grand ' Encampment, for
ourselves and our subordinate bodies', not only
welcome them, but we present the banner
year of Increase and show a loyal
and patriotic hc5t of those -who dwell in tents
and extend hospitality to the stranger.
The patriarchal branch " of the order Is be
coming known in California. Our sessions at
different .' points in the Jurisdiction and the
events that -have 'been made attractive at those
sessions have resulted in applications for mexn
bershfp and rood work.

GROWTH OF ORDER.
The report also includes a list of
visitations made by the grand pa
triarch, and brief messages from the
district deputies, all of which are
very encouraging-. The work of the
district deputies is praised, the grand
patriarch saying that he feels the or
der owes them a debt of gratitude, as
good deputies result in good districts.
Those who accept the position and do
but little for the order are few and
far between.

body during the encampment at
which the election is made.
ThÂ» Grand Lodge, however, adopted

the installation of the newly elected

order and he has its warmest sympa

COVWAY WINS FIGHT.
ThÂ«> f.ght that was waged for the
offic of deputy grand sire, which was
vacated by Mr. Wright, resulted in a
victory for E. S. Conway of Illinois.
J<".hn J- Nolan of Tennessee. W. L-
Kuykendall of Wyoming and G. S.
Hoagland of Nebraska, his most for
midable opponents, made hard fights
-iÂ»i th* tAjcp. but Kuykendali--an4-
Huapland finally admitted defeat and
withdrew. Conway was elected on the
record ballot.
J. Frank Grant was re-elected
prand secretary and M. Richards
Muckle was re-elected grand treas
urer. This completed the list of elec
tive officers, though several appointive
offices must be filled. It was an
nounced that this will be done next
Saturday.
The Grand Encampment of Califor
nia also held an important meeting
yesterday. Nominations for officers
for the coming term were made by thÂ«
encampment. The encampment will
hold another ineeting to-morrow at
Odd FeJlows* Ha!l and the names *â¢Â¦?
lert^d yesterday will be balloted upon.
Whil* the Odd Fellows were busy
with th^rir a flairs of business yesterday
the Rebekahs were enjoying them
selves at Mechanics' Pavilion. A mu-
Fical programme was rendered in the
annex, and in the main hall a prom
enade concert was held. Both affairs
proved most attractive and were well
patronized. Last night the Rebekahs
g-ave a concert and exhibition drill at
Mechanics' Pavilion. It was largely at
tended and proved a most enjoyable
event.
RECEPTION AT PALACE.
A reception tendered Past Grand Sire
Goodwin and Mrs. Goodwin in the
Marble and Maj-le rooms of the Palace
Hotel laet evening was a striking af
fair. Patriarchs Militant in full dress,
â¢with their wives and daughters, and
Odd Fellows in evening dress crowded
the handsome suite to pay their re
epecis to the man that has just relin
quished the leadership of the order.
Other distinguished Odd Fellows were
guests at the function, which was the
most formal affair given since the
opening of the encampment."
To-day will be jriven over to business,
pleasure and display. An excursion
around the bar on the steamer Berke
ley promises to draw a large number
of pleasure seekers, though the cvn
petitlve drills at Mechanics' Pavilion
and the conferring: of the decoration
of chivalry will be the most largely at
tended features.
Great throngs of strangers are gath
ering in the city to witness the
parade Friday morning. Market street
was crowded yesterday afternoon and
evening by visitors that have come to
enjoy the remaining days of the en
campment. Appreciation of the wel
come extended them is everywhere ex
pressed.
PRESS ASSOCIATION" >fEETS.
Editors of Odd Fellow Journals Hold
Annual Session at Native Sons'
Hall.
WhJle the Odd Fellows are holding
forth at Native Sons' Hall on Mason
street the members of the Interna
tional Press Association of the Odd
Fellows are in convention to nominate
and Â«lect their officers for the next
year. The first meeting of the asso
ciation was held last night, when
many members met at the hall to
transact the business of the organiza
tion.
President C. H. Lyman of Columbus
Ohio, occupied the chair during last
right's session. The other ofllcers
present were Vice President A. B
Parker of Watertown. X. Y.. and Sec
retary J- W. White of Jacksonville I
Fla. Mr. White is also treasurer of '
the organization.
. The association, which numbers
over sixty editors of Odd Fellow
Journals throughout the country, holds
annual meetings at the places where
the sessions of the Sovereign Grand
Lodpe are held.
The business transacted last night
was routine and consisted of hearing
the minutes of last rear's meeting at
Baltimore and answering communica
tions. The place of next year's meet
ing has not yet been designated bj*
the Sovereign Grand Lodge. The of
ficers will be elected at later meetings
this week. â¢
At 9 o'clock yesterday morning the
second day's session was called to or
der with all the representatives in their
places. The first business of the meet
ing was the hearing of the reports
from the jurisdiction?. This was done
by calling the roll of the States and
the Provinces of Canada. As each
name was called the representatives
made his report to the session. Al
though this took some time, nothing of
especial interest was developed in the
hearings.
As the end of the list of jurisdictions
approached, excitement began to per
vade the ha!l. The long awaited time
for the election of the presiding ofn
cers of the order for the next two
years was approaching. Very soon
after each jurisdiction had made its re
port the representatives would gather
In Fmall groups and discuss, the
chances -of their particular candidate.
At a few minutes past 10 the last of the
jurisdictions was reported on, and the
business of electing the high officers
was reached.
The name of the candidate to suc
ceed Grand Sire John B. Goodwin
prominently before the session during
itsÂ» sojourn in this city has been that
of Deputy Grand Sire Robert E.
Wright of Allentov.n, Pa. There was
practically no opponent with him in
the race for the leadership. The ques
tion of his succession to the post of
grand sire hinged on the validity of
electing an officer who was not present
at the session.
ELECTION BEGINS.
After much debate on the question
it was decided to proceed with the
election in the regular form, as if the
officer were present, and upon the flrst
ballot Robert E. Wright was elected
grand sire of the organization. The
ceremony of installation must be per
formed within the week of the session
by order of the constitution, therefore
the session sent a telegram to Past
Grand Sire T. C. Campbell of. London.
Ontario, telling him to proceed to Al
lentown and install the newly elected
grand sire. Until this Is done .Grand
Sire John B.- Goodwin will remain* at
the head of the organization and, will
direct the session throughout the week.
The election , of Grand Sire-elect
Robert E. Wright is unique, as it is
the first time In the history of the
organization that the 'office has, been
filled during the absence of the candi
date.
The excitement over the election of
the leader was merely a preliminary
warming up compared with- the fight
for the office of deputy/grand sire. Im
mediately after the rap of the gavel an

Mrs. Caroline A- Hoxett of Gilroy
read an original poem dedicated to the
Rebekahs. and in the meanwhile the
officers of the day were busy preparing
the guests for the surprise of the even
ingâthe- drill of the San Francisco
Drill Corps, consisting of twenty-five
uniformed ladies. The officers of the
day were Mrs. Flora Bergman. Mrs.
Mary E. Donoho. Mrs. E. M. Cyrus and
Mrs. Bessie D. Moore.
Captain Allie Parker certainly had
reason to be proud of her trim looking
squad of cadets. The corps entered
upon the main floor in column of three,
and after passing once around the
building formed company front at the
grand stand, where they executed the
manual of arms, or swords, for the edi
fication and amusement of Past Grand
Sire Goodwin and his attendants. The
ladies of the corps were dressed In
short blue dresses trimmed with white
braid. Their cadet caps were of white
and their high-top shoes were laced
with white laces. The effect was very
P Everf movement was executed with
precision, and the breaking of the com
pany from column of threes into col
umn of sixes and back again to column
of threes was particularly well done.
"Right by files" and "by the right and
left flank" into company front brought
forth great applause, but the prettiest
movements were those of the fancy
drill, when the corps showed what it
could do in forming crosses, wheeling
about their right guide and executing
reversing circles.
The drill corps held the attention of
the audience for more than half an
hour. To-night the Washington and
Sacramento cantons will give exhibition
drills, and judgment may be passed on
DRILL BY REBEKAHS.
Past Grand Sire Gardner was Intro
duced after Mrs. Gardner had finished
her address and he played the gallant
very successfully with the ladies.
Some wholesome words of advice with
a little well-handled flattery won many
a feminine nod of approval for the
portly gentleman from Atlanta. Past
Grand Sire Goodwin spoke of the co
operation of the women of Odd Fellow
ism, their untiring efforts to assist in
promulgating the sentiment that has
made Odd Fellowship a permanency
among fraternal societies.
Fifty-three years of co-operation
have won a distinctive place in the or
der for the women members, the Re
bekahs. Purity of purpose and ef
fective legislation have been the out
come of the assistance of the hand that
rocks the cradle and rules the world.
The speaker referred to California
and praised San Francisco and the
State for their generosity. He spoke
of the splendid reception accorded
members of the Sovereign Grand Lodge
by the people of the city and said that
he had heard that San Francisco never
did anything half-way, and now ha
was convinced of the absolute truth of
the statement.
Mrs. Gardner spoke of the beneficiary
system inaugurated by the order, of
the protection afforded the widows anci
orphans and the maintenance of th*
home of the order at Gilroy.
Twenty- five thousand sisters were
enrolled on the lodge books and in ten
years this number will have been in
creased two fold. It has been demon
strated in late years that the Rebekahs
have been growing at a much greater
ratio than in the early periods of their
existence.
Sure enough, it was warm and stifling
in the galleries. Several ladies grew
weak from the effects of the oppressive
atmosphere. and there was more than
one who had to leave the building. But
there is nothing that succeeds like suc
cess, and faint-hearted men and light
headed women did not militate in the
least against the one result to be de
sired, viz.. a splendid record for the
women of Odd Fellowship.
The evening'*! entertainment was
opened. .WU1Â» a musical selection by thÂ»Â»
orcnestrir. aftc*r which President W. \*.
Watson. P. G. M.. and past grand rep
resentative, called the Rebekahs to or
der with a few appropriate remarks
about women as a factor in promoting
just such big events as were transpir
ing. President Watson introduced
State President Mrs. Gardner, who then
addressed the audience and told them
something of the success of the Order
of Rebekahs. their mission in life and
the good that they have accomplished,
individually and collectively.
GROWTH OF ORDER.
Mschanics'. Pavilion was crowded tÂ»
its utmost capacity last night during
the reception tendered by the officers
of Rebekah day. So great did the audi
ence become that at 9 o'clock the police
were obliged to issue orders that no
more persons be allowed in the gal
leries. At that hour there were at least
7000 persons in the galleries and 5000
more on the main floor.
Past Grand Sire Goodwin, who ar
rived early and watched the rapidly
growing crowds with intense interest,
remarked that â¢'California always doe3
things on a large scale, and this at
tendance proves it." Mrs. Dora Gard
ner. State president of the Rebekah
Assembly, was more than satisfied with
the result of the efforts of the ladies of
the order to make Rebekah day a grand
success. Mrs. Gardner said that she
knew that there would be a large at
tendance, but she did not expect to
have "this big building crowded to suf
focation."
Robert E. Wright cf AJlentown, Ps

Order of Odd Fe!!ovrs yesterday. His
election settled a Question that has
caused much discussion throughout
the order and the Sovereign Grand

more raridly with its work.
Many of the oncers of the grand

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 20. â Rus
sia's position on the question of con
traband of war will be officially pro
mulgated in the form of decisions of
the Admiralty Court In the cases of
the Calchas, Arabia and Allentown,
when they come up on appeal. Pro
fessor de Maurtens, president of the
commission which decided what
should constitute contraband, accord-
Ing to Russian views, will appear on
behalf of the Government, thus prac
tically insuring the acceptance of the
principle formulated by the commis
sion. As he will be in possession of
the American and British notes, the
contentions of those Governments will
be practically settled before the court.
Russia's proposition has been au
thoritatively stated to the press as fol

"Russia does not desire to interfere
with the United States' legitimate
commerce with Japan, but she has the
right to and must protect herself, as
far as possible, against shipments
which may aid the enemy in prosecut
ing the war."

all, the great claim, the undying- claim, that

rests upon the fact that all of you, from the
major general to the private, did your full

formed thÂ« Union army from 18C1 to 1SC5,
and who, during those year*, rendered not
only to our people, but to all mankind, the

VALLEJO, Sept. 20. â The big. black
converted Russian cruiser Lena, con
tinues to be the most interesting object
at the navy yard. Her crew is being
given liberty in squads of twenty-flve.
They stroll quietly about the streets of
Vallejo. The officers seem more con
cerned, and while a number of them
have visited Vallejo they look upon
the disarmament of their ship as a
piece of hard luck. American ord
nance officers and a force of men have
removed all the small guns from the
Lena and sent the breech blocks of her
big guns ashore. By 3 p. m. to-mor
row the sixty tons of ammunition now
in the magazine of the Russian ship
will be safely stored ashore. In the
meantime great care is being taken
that the Lena is not .njured by out
side parties.
This afternoon Admiral McCalla,
commandant of the navy yard, heard
that one of the Lena's crew was seri
ously ill. He sent the yard ambulance
to the ship and had the sufferer con
veyed to the navy yard hospital, at the
same time informing the Russian cap
tain that his officers and men can ex
pect as good treatment as the accom
modations and facilities of the navy
yard will afford.

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 20.â In the
hills that skirt the eastern boundary
of the city the county authorities for
months have maintained a leper camp,
in which there were half a dozen per
sons attlicted with tbis hideous disease.
They lived In tents and from time to
time were visited by physicians from
the County Hospital, under whose
charge they were. To-night when a
visit was made to the camp it was
found to be deserted. All of the lepers
had disappeared. The hospital authori
ties organized a party, to search for the
missing patients, but later the futility
of such a search was realized and the
party returned.
It was learned that Mrs. L. Cham
berlain, once a beautiful woman and a
leader among her unfortunate com
panions had caused the flight- She was
taken from her husband several months
ago and placed in the camp, and there
he saw her at times. He finally decided
to take her and live with her despite
her leprosy," and told his friends he
would nurse her as carefully as she
could be cared for In the camp. She
consented to go with him, and after
her departure the other unfortunates
refused to stay.

The trouble arose over the action of
the non-conforming members of a so

CHICAGO, Sept. 20.â The sentiment

ports from State jx>lls which have been
going on throughout the country for
a. month. This announcement was made
to-day by the managers at the national
Kepublican headquarters.
The reports also show that the minds
of voters are already made up to an
tiausual degree. Chairman Roy O. West
cf the State committee ascribed this
fact not only to the lack of live issues
in the campaign, but also to the fact
that the labor unions and similar or
Â£2iniz&tioris and free rural mail delivery
biive done much to educate the people
In the last four years.

"That's an old" story. What you
want now is news. But why shouM
I tell my plars."
The combination of lines now under
Hawl^y's domination would mean a
through system of railroads from To
ledo, lake and trui k line points to thÂ«
Pacific Coast with branch lines in the
Middle West and in Colorado territory.
Hawley to-day would not admit at
first that he controlled the Chicago and
Alton, nor that he might send out
requests for proxies for the annual
meeting in October.
But when reminded that he said six
months ago that he controlled the line
and also that the Kuhn-Loeb & Co.
request for deposits of stock was only
a "bluff to get control, while the
Kuhn-^TiOeb Harriman party had lost"
he said:
It now becomes public that Hawley
went into the directorate of the West
ern Pacific wiih thÂ» Idea of building a
new transcontinental system to Include
the Toledo, St. Louis and "Western, and
Chicaso and Alton roads, and the so
called Hawley lin^s in the Central

This Is the final survey. Two prelim

other south to Reno, have been made
from Fish Springs. Which of these two

NEW YORK. Sept. 20â Another trans

The undertaking involves the so-called
Hawley lines in the Middle States, in

Louis and Western roads, extending
into Eastern trunk line territory, ami
the Western Pacific, now being built
from the Salt I>ake gateway to the Pa
cific Coast. Such a deal, if carried out.
would mean a combination with Iine3
from the Great Lakes to the Pacific
Ocean. The scheme has been formed !n
detail, and all that remains to be done
is to put it into effect.
Hawley said to-day It would be un
wise to tell details of his plan. He
said his control of the Chicago and
Alton was too old a fact to be dis
cussed. He admitted he still dominat
ed the Clover Leaf and said the Chi
cago interests in that line would have
nothing to say as to its disposition. He
made many more pertinent state

RENO, Sept. 20.â Ten engineers of the

This is the first open move made by the

gin active work on its transcontinental
line, and the much mooted question of
a route through the Sierra -Mountain*
has at last been decided. It will be
through the Beckwith Pass.
The engineers are following along the
line of the Nevada, California and Ore

September 14 and was directed against
redoubt No. 8, which protects the wa

about two miles beyond the line of per

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 21.â The
sensational announcement that Gen
eral Kuroki has crossed the Hun River
unopposed and that the whole Japan
ese army is advancing upon Mukden is
overshadowed bv anxiety for Port Ar
thur. Moreover, the announcement rel
ative to Kuroki does not receive com
plete credence here, as being in direct
contradiction of official news issued by
the general staff. General Kuropatkin
ennounced only two days ago that
there was not a single Japanese east
of Bentsiaputee. How, it is asked,
could General Kuroki, with 100,000 men.
slip past General Rennenkampfit's Cos
sacks and cross the Hun River near
the Fustian coal mines, thirty miles
east of Mukden? Fushan is situated on
the road from Bentsiaputze, where
General Kuroki crossed the Taitse
lliver. This road is carefullv watched
by General Kuropat kin's outposts be
tween Mukden and Sinsintin. A strons
guard has been placed at the Fushun
mines, which General Kuropatkin will
not give up without a struggle, as the
loss cf the mines would involve the

view Great Britain's pledget to Rus

and she disclaimed any purpose to
meddle with the internal or political

I marked that the Congressman had
j just laid the foundation for greater ef
fort as the champion of the working
man. He declared that delegates of
the Union Labor party would be false
and recreant if they failed to recog
nize the merits and services of Mr.
LJvernash.
In closing he proposed Mr. Liver
nash as the nominee of the conven
ticn. The nomination was seconded
by several delegates. A motion that
nominations close prevailed without
dissent. The secretary was thereupon
directed to cast the ballot for Liver
nnsh. Delegates Eagan and Ryan
were appointed to notify Mr. , Liver
nash of the convention's action and to
ej-cort him to the platform. It was re
ported to the chairman that the nomi
nee was not present- As the delegates
did not clamor for his presence the in
cident of his absence engaged no fur
ther notice. After authorizing the
chairman to appoint the usual com
mittees the convention adjourned to
the call of the chair. The fact was
regarded as somewhat significant that
the convention did not. adjourn- sine

the effect that Livernash intended to

room and back to the Maple room,
where the reception took place.
For more than an hour the long line
moved slowly, each member in turn of
ferine congratulations to the grand sire
and his wife. After paying their re
spects the company scattered about the
parlors. New Â« friendship were made
and the ties of o?d ones more strongly

The hour set for the reception was 10
o'clock, but it was after 10:30 before
the line began to form. When the long
procession started to wend its way
through the corridors and" brilliantly
lifrhted rooms it presented a pretty pic

purple plumes and gold braid, walked
side by side with ladies in elegant even

had done their duty well walked with
youths just climbing the ladder of the
order. AH were happy and a spirit of
good fellowship was predominant.

Cook left his shop at 12:15 o'clock, as
was his habit. During his short ab
sence the place was thoroughly ran
sacked. The thief got away with a
quantity of watches, watch cases, rings
and brooches. A suspicious character
was seen loitering in front of the place
by a Greek fruit dealer near Cook's
store. The man walked away and the
fruit seller paid him no further atten
tion. The street was crowded, and a
man seen unlocking and entering the
jewelry store would not have been no
ticed. >
The thief failed to get a number of
diamonds which Cook usually had in
the showcase. Yesterday these jewels
were left in the safe, as Cook had help
ers cleaning hi3 store in the morning.
Cook suspects a former clerk of his,
Benjamin Martin. Martin left him some
weeks ago. Cook declares that Martin
robbed him of X3G0. There is now a war
rant out for Martin, and Detective E3
Gibson, detailed on the case, is anxious
to find him.
The jewelry store of F. L. Cook. 1712
Market street, was robbed yesterday
noon of stock valued at J3500. No one
saw the burglar, who unlocked the
front door of the establishment with a
skeleton key whi!e Cook was at his din
ner. The police were notified when
Cook returned at 1 o'clock. Detectives
were immediately detailed oa the case,
but no clew was found.

"Hotaling has been in the city for
several days, ostensibly to see the
World's Fair, but it is hinted that Miss
Bates is the real attraction for him.
Since his arrival here he has been a
regular attendant at the Imperial
Theater, where Miss Bates is playing,
and last evening, with a party of
friends, occupied a box. Miss Bates,
as soon as the play was over, left the
theater for her mother's home on Tin
dell Boulevard, where Hotaling is a
guest.
"Miss Bates is a native of California,
and for some time the report has been
current on the cc-ast that she is to be
come the wife of the wealthy bachelor.
who has known Miss Bates for several
years and for whom he expresses the
highest admiration, and it is generally
understood among Hotaling's friends
in San Francisco that the marriage
will take place upon the expiration of
Miss Bates' contract with Belasco."
"Notwithstanding the reticence of
Miss Bates and Mr. Hc-taling. the re
port is given general credence by the
attaches of the Imperial Theater, as
well as members of her own company.
"Further than that Hotaling declined
to discuss the subject. Miss Bates,
Â¦when seen, refused to say anything,
but the statement was made by mem
bers of her company that even if the
report of the engagement were true.
Miss Bates could not do otherwise than
deny it. because of her contract with
David Belasco.
"Richard M. Hotaling. wealthy club
man and bachelor of San Francisco,
Â¦who is said to be engaged to marry
Miss Blanche Bates, now playing at the
Imperial Theater, refused last evening
to affirm or deny the report.
" 'I know the San Francisco papers
have been gossiping about it for
some time.' said he. 'but. so far as I
am concerned, I must refer you to Miss
Bates.'

In opening the meeting President

principal of the Polytechnic High
School. Mr. Fisher recalled the fail
ure of the city to vote bonds for parks
at Adams Point a few years ago.
Professor W. E. Gibson spoke on
"Greater Oakland, a City Reaching
from Alameda to San Leandro," and
G. W. Langorj claim that the bond
scheme would benefit all sections of
the city. _
Edwin Stearns, secretary of the Board
of Trade, said:
I am for the bonds. So far as the Central

prominent citizens to-night at the as-
BOciatlon headquarters, 425 Fifteenth
street, on the subject of the proposed
bond issue. P. H. Pinkerton, president
of the association, was chairman.
Strong ' speeches, advocating every
item of the project, were made. Stress
was laid upon the importance of the
bond scheme as affecting the status of
Oakland as one of the progressive
communities of the Pacific Coast. Note
was made of the benefits which would
be derived from the expenditure of
52,490,000 among the people of the city.
The park urojects were given special
attention.

In his opening remarks Knowland re
ferred to the necessity, of immediate
registration and complimented the
South Berkeley Club upon its efforts
to get every man In line. Continuing
he said:
The campaign will open formally for us on
October 1. It seems to me that the burden
then will be principally with the Democrats.
They have not found one good reason yet why
there should be a change of power. â¢ That Is
very discouraging. Indeed â for the Democrats.
But U's hard to find vulnerable spots in the
armor of a party that has ruled as splendidly
and faithfully aa the Republican party, fulfilled
all Its promises and given the country what
It needs more than anything elseâ prosperity.
If the Democrats could promise us prosperity
and convince the people that they would keep
the promise, they might win. But they cannot
do this.
In closing, Knowland pleaded for the
re-election of State Senator J. R. Lu
kens and Assemblyman Waste.
The De Koven Club and Frank Argall
assisted with songs, while pipes and
tobacco helped to make the gruests of
the club feel at home.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 20.â In spite ot

weeks of the fiscal year ending June
80, there was a decrease in immigra
tion in 1904 of 44,176 over the previous
year.
Commissioner General of Immigra
tion Sargent points out that while
there has been a decrease in immi
grants from other countries, those
coming from England arose from 26,219
in 1903 to 38,626 in 1904. This is regard-,
ed as showing the trend of a better
element of immigrants coming "to this
country-
The total of all Immigrants for last
year was 812.870. against 857,046 for 1903.
The country sending the greatest
number of Immigrants was Italy, for
both years. That country. Including
Sicily and" Sardinia, contributed 230.622
in 1903 and 193,296 in 1904, a decrease
this year of 37,326.
Austria-Hungary followed ! Italy
closely with 206,011 for 1903 and 177.156
for 1904.

OAKLAND, Sept. 20. â A citizens*
corr.nittee, composed of M. J. Keller,
Theodore Gier, D. C. Brown and D.
F. Oliver, requested the Board of
Kducation last night to make changes
in th^ call for competitive plans for
new school buildings. Oliver, as
spokesman, declared that there was
no intention to cast the slightest
doubt aiÂ»on the integrity of the board,
but he thought some errors had crept
into the call that had debarred many
architects from submitting plans.
He advocated the selection of a com
mittee of architects to advise with the
board in the selection of plans. Oli
ver also favored a stipulation that
Fueces5ful architects should be as
sured that they would be appointed to
superintend the work.
Objection was raised because the
board had made an allowance of only
one premium for accepted plans. This
point. Director Hardy asserted, could
not be maintained, as the law re
stricted the amount which could be
appropriated.
Touching the alleged boycott of the
competition by the American Institute
of Architects, Director George Ran
dolph said he believed the board
would have no trouble in getting
plans.
President Wilcox said the board
would stand on whnt It had done.

BERKELEY OPENS
PARTY CAMPAIGN
A bond rally was held at Idora Park
to-night under the auspices of the cam
paign committee of the Progress Fed
eration. A. V. Feight, a member of
the campaign committee, acted as
chairman. Among the speakers were
F. A. Stearns, John A. Brltton, Dr. E.
H. Woolsey and H. C. Capwell. All
spoke strongly in favor of the bonds.
The land contained within these park
grounds boundaries is much more desirable for
development for park purposes than would be
tn* elevated portions of the Sather tract, which
are not included. It takes In Indian gulch,
with thousands of flourishing trees (some of
which are of great age), and on either aid*
extends along, the hills to a height sufficient
to givÂ« a view for many miles; the valley
lend Is remarkably rleh, aa It contains the sur
face washings for years from the hillsides;
the present volume of flowing water can be
developed, without doubt, to an extent suffi
cient for all of the requirements of thÂ» park;
the valley Is wide enough to permit the con
struction of winding, shady roadways and
paths, on which f20,000 has already been ex
pended: It is so sheltered that wonderful re
sults may be attained In the growing of tropi
cal plants and shrubs; tha tract Is so near the
city as to be easily accessible and In every
respect it Is an ideal site for Oakland's main
park. As for the price â a little more than
$1000 an acre â the land Is worth every cent
of that sum. not for residence sites, or for
vegetable gardening, or for orchards, or for
herding sheep or cattle upon, or for general
agricultural uses, or for the erection thereon
of stores or factories, but for the exact, precise
and specific purpose for which the enterprising,
loyal ambitious, far-seeing citizenship of Oak
land design buying it, to-wit for the creation
of pleasure grounds which will. In the com
ing yÂ«ars, b* one of the most highly prized
of their possessions, and that of generations
yet to come.
The opponents of the bonds are also endeavor-
Ing to make such capital out of the fact that
the Realty Syndicate reserves the right to
build and oi>erate a railroad line across the
extreme eastern end of the tract. It Is well
known that one of the enterprises contemplat
ed for years by this remarkably enterprising
body of Oakland men is the extension of their
Â«lcctrlc car system to San Jose, passing along
the northern boundary of Oakland. The fa
mous Forest Park, at St. Louis. Is traversed
by steam railway lines and It affords a pleas
ing entrance Into that city from thÂ« west. An
electric car line crossing Oakland's proposed
park and reaching down to Santa Clara Coun
ty 1 Â¦ chief city, would be. not an Injury, but
a material advantage to the park.
It has been suggested that a grand basket
picnic be arranged for next Saturday after
noon at Central Park In order that thÂ« peo
ple may Â«e what a choice location has been
selecfd for a park by the City Council.
Certain It Is. that If this Is to be done many
votes for the bond proposition will bÂ« gained
thereby. It should be remembered that this is
the only large park site possible of acqulre
niTt by Oakland for a park with trees and
a water -apply, without going a long distance
Into the country. ,
The Progress Federation has issued
a statement in regard to the proposed
bonds for parks and improvements, as
follows:
The statement is made by the opponents of
the bond proposition that the choice building
sites of the Sather tract are outside the
boundaries of the proposed Central Park. That
statement la correct, but Is In no wise an
argument against the purchase of the park
site. It is not building locations that aro
o>s!red for pleasure grounds, but variety of
landscape, vistas of woodland, fertile soil for
the growing of plants and shrubs, lawns and
flowers, and a flowing stream.
The Progress Federation has ar
ranged to allow all people of Oakland
to visit the proposed park site. All
who wish will be supplied with tick
ets at the Board of Trade rooms, 510
Twelfth street, and transportation will
be furnished from the end of the
Fourth-avenue car line to the park
and back.
The charges that have been made
that the site offered to the city aa
Central Park Is not what it Is repre
sented to be are to be Investigated by
a committee constituted of the busi
ness representatives of' the city, which
will make a report on recent bond
Questions.
There was a general meeting at the
Board of Trade rooms this morning of
representatives of all professions and
lines of business in Oakland. The
meeting was called ; to order by- Judge
John Yule, an attorney by profession,
and M. J. Keller was elected chair
man. Upon the motion of BL B. Bel
den it was decided to ask the follow
ing organizations in Oakland to each
appoint a committee of three to in
spect the proposed park site and make
an official report upon its value and
availability before the bond election
on Tuesday next: The Progress Fed
eration, the Board of Trade, the Mer
chants' Exchange, the Real Estate
Dealers' Association, the bankers, the
landscape gardeners, the trades unions
and the representatives of the local
and San Francisco papers.

- Mrs. Bertha Williams,' 23 years old,
became a thief to-night to save herself,
and infant from starvation. With her
husband in the County Hospital, the
destitute and desperate young mother
stole a $5 gold piece from Fred Hen
sel's residence at 867 Campbeir street.
Charged with the theft, the young wo
man at first denied it. Her accusers
called the police and Mrg. Williams,:
with her nursing baby, was sent to the
City Prison. Sobbing and broken
hearted, the frail little mother unbur
dened herself to Captain, of Police W.:
J. Petersen. To him she readily con
fessed her guilt and restored the stolen
gold piece, which she had hidden in a
shoe. :
"For days I walked the streets with
my babv, looking for work," said Mrs.;
Williams, "but I could not find a place;
where 1 I could take my baby, and 1,
will not part with my child. I was
worn out, exhausted and didn't know
which way to turn. I knew the Hen
sels and had worked in the house. The
purse was hidden under a mattress and
I knew It was there. My baby must
eat and I was desperate. There were
three five-dollar gold pieces in the
purse and I took one of them, hiding it
in my shoe.
"No. I don't want to go to Jail, but
perhaps it might be Just as well. I
would get something to eat there, any
way."
So strongly did the story appeal to
Captain Petersen that he arranged
with Police Judge Mortimer Smith for
the young woman's release on her own
recognizance. She lives at 1420 Elev
enth street.

The case went to pieces through the
failure or Mrs. Annie Larsen, residing
at 103 S Fifty-eighth street, to appear
as a witness for the prosecution. She
had been subpenaed to testify concern
ing some of Mrs. Mein's belongings
that had been left at the Larsen resi
dence by Grace McNaughton, who had
bcÂ«n a guest there after she left the
Mcin home. Mrs. Larsen's absence
was explained by a physician's certifi
cate of illness. Whether her evidence
would hold the girl was uncertain.
The District Attorney said a tech
nical case had been made out, but In
view of the possibly long delay in Mrs.
Israeli's Appearance he did not feel
that the case could profitably be
taken before a Jury-
Miss McNaughton, it was an
nounced, would be taken in charge by
her relatives and would, to all Intents,
be placed on probation. The dismissal
of the case. District Attorney Allen de
clared, did not preclude the possibility
of further prosecution if that course
should later be considered necessary-
Chief of Police Hodgkins testified
this morning that at no time did Miss
McNaughton make any statement to
him that might be construed as a con
fession of guilt.
Grace McNaughton. charged wlÂ£h the
theft of finery from MrtL Thomaa
Hcin. by whom she was employed as
a maid, was Â«et free to-day on motion
of District Attorney J. J. Allen- In
dismissing the case t Justice James G.
Quinn said it seemed evident that Mrs.
Mein had relented In the prosecution.
The fact that at best a doubtful case
on technical ground had been made
out against the girl contributed to the
action that was taken.

In defiance of the warning published
by the ' Students' Affairs Committee,
last night, the sophomores mixed arms,
legs and heads with the freshmen to
day in a fight for possession of ballot
boxes at the University of California,
Out of the melee came some wrecked
polling places, some broken furniture,
a few bumped heads and any number
of water-soaked students. The fight
was so hot that one youth fainted from
over-exertion and had to bÂ« carried off
the field by his comrades and treated
by a physician.
The "rough-house" started soon after
the poljs for the freshmen election
were opened this morning. Immedi
ately sophomores sprang up from all
around and charged the ballot-boxes In
North HalL A big crowd of freshmen
was on hand, ready for Just such an
emergency, so that there was no hesi
tancy in beginning the row. In the
preliminary skirmishes the freshmen
were successful, a circumstance that
so angered the "sophs" that they
brought up reinforcements, in the hope
of finally overwhelming their enemies.
The "freshles" were prepared for this,
too, and they called on enough reserves
to helpUhem hold the fort.
As the day wore on the fight grew
hotter. Fire buckets and hose from
the corridors of North Hall were
brought into play by the "sophs" and
the freshmen were soused. But the
election went on in spite of water and
broken furniture. Bevan Jones, a
freshman, fell in a faint during one of
the scrimmages and did not revive for
an hour. A sophomore, who tried to
cut the hose, was arrested by Police
man Killon, but the crowd wrested thÂ«
prisoner away from him. When the'
polls closed the freshmen spirited the
ballots away and counted them without
further molestation.
For violating the order of the faculty
committee a number of students are
likely to be dismissed. The order
reads: "Any forcible interference with
the peace of any student, the destruc
tion of property or any disturbance
within or afound any of the buildings
or halls during recitation hours is sub
ject to punishment."
The freshmen elected the following
officers: President, Charles R. Brecjc:
first vice president, Francis "White: sec
ond vice president. Miss Fredrica M.
Judy; secretary, Miss Sturgess; treas
urer, Howard Gaines; sergeant-at-"
arms, Oscar Kittenbach.
The contract between the county of
Alameda and the Ransome Construc
tion Company for the building of the
scenic boulevard between this city and
Haywards was signed this afternoon
by John Mitchell, chairman of the
Board of Supervisors, and the presi
dent and secretary of the company.
Thus the last obstacle to the road be
coming a reality was removed. Work
is to be begun Immediately.
Accompanying the contract is a bond
of $25,000 for the faithful performance
of the work given by the Ransome
Company, with the Title Trust and
Guaranty Company as surety. The con
tract was let for $300,000, and is for a
road twelve miles long arid 100 feet
wide. The drive follows the contour of
the hills at an elevation of about 200
feet, and gives a splendid view of the
country.

turned Into a ditch. Several flat cars
were. splintered. .
Engineer "Willard Jumped from bis

Fireman Jack Madden was pinioned
beneath the engine. For two hours the
crew worked like demons clearing the
debris to extricate him. He was in
constant danger of being scalded by
escaping steam or burned to death, as
,the oil from the engine was in a pool
beneath him. His escape with only a
broken ankle was marvelous.

CALIFORN'IANS AT THE FAIR.
Mrs. Lizzie Maclay, daughter of
Lydia Wickersham, stated her inabil
ity to remember certain details re-Â»
lating to the disposition of her moth
er's estate and Frank Wickersham's
sale of his expectancy to his brother
and sisters. She had heard of the
proposition made by which Frank was
to receive $250 a month from the es
tate and $60,000 for his son when the
latter attained his majority. .The
proposition was rejected by the
other?.
J. E. Brandon of Petaluma testified
that Frank Wickersham was of sound
mind when he sold his expectancy.
Judge Thomas J. Geary, one of the
attorneys for the defense, denied a
conversation imputed to him by At
torney Francis J. Heney, in which
Geary was alleged to have said that
he suggested that Lydia C. Wicker
sham would have to make a will in
order to force Frank Wickersham to
compromise his claim against his
father's estate. Judge Geary also de
nied saying that he prepared the data
for such a will and srave it to Pro
fessor Llppet to draw up for Mrs.
Wickersham's signature. He also de
nied many other statements attributed
to him by Heney. Attorney Heney
expects to controvert Judge Geary's
testimony by going on the stand him
self.
Three witnesses were on the stand
yesterday in Judge Seawell's court in
the trial of the Wickersham will con
test, and the hearing will go on this
afternoon. Attorney Campbell an
nounced that he expected to complete
the case for the estate to-day. The
witnesses for the contestant, Mrs. Cora
Wickersham, the widow of Frank
Wickersham. will probably be heard
to-morrow. Mrs. Cora Wickersham
was in court again, and Mrs. Fred
Wickersham was present at the af
ternoon session.
Judge Geary Denies Hency's State
ments â Mrs. Maclay on the Stand.

LAWYERS AT ODDS IX"
WICKERSILAM CONTEST
By the judgment the trust is ter
minated and James de la Montanya is
declared the owner of the property he
inherited from his father. In his dep
osition, opened in court yesterday, De
la Montanya recited his unhappy mar
ried life and said that his wife had
threatened to sue for divorce and to
cloud the title to his property. To
prevent the latter and to secure the
income to himself and children, he
had made a trust agreement that the
property was to be held for him
pending his wife's litigation. She sued
for divorce on September 12, 1900.
On the same day he signed the trust
deed and that evening departed for
France. He declared that he did not
then know that the document did not
express his intention that the trust
should terminate when his wife's liti
gation was ended. The family and
trustees opposed his suit to set the
trust aside. A suit brought in Janu
ary of last year to compel De la Mon
tanya to pay $250 a month for the
support of his children was dismissed
yesterday and the incident is closed.
The long drawn litigation over the
valuable property which James de la
Montanya placed in a trust at the
time his wife sued him for divorce
four years- ago ended yesterday in
Judge Hebbard's court by the entry
of a judgment in favor of De la Mon
tanya in the suit against his mother,
sister, two children and the trustee,
William Madden. Behind the judg
ment was a compromise effected by
Dorn, Savage & Dorn, attorneys for
the defendants. By the settlement De
la Montanya deeds absolutely to his
two children, Lorraine and Jacques,
business property in Alameda valued
at $40,000 or more and producing an
income of $250 a month.

JURY IMPAXELED IN* THE

Epidemic at Almshouse.
An epidemic of sickness at thÂ»
Almshouse has aroused suspicion aa
to the drinking water there. Tha
Health Board yesterday ordered a
sample for anaylsis. The Illness that
has seized many of the city's ward3 is
not serious, but the number of pati
ents is Increasing so rapidly that
those in charge of the Institution are
confronted with a difficult problem-
Lloyd Childs, who purchased the
$140 worth of fruit that the State
ccmmlssion invested in to "piece out,"
says the task he was chosen to car
ry out was one of the strangest of his
career. The idea of buying fruit in a
distant State for the use of Califor
nia at an exposition outside that State,,
was such a strange experience to him
that he almost overlooked some bar
gains when he went down to the big
market on Third street, near the river.
The buying of this fruit is perhaps one
of the strangest things that has hap
pened in the exposition history of the
Golden State. Childs declares .that he
bought only California goods, but some
of his fellow commissioners in the
counties' displays are suspicious that
there were some Missouri peaches and
Kansas pears In the lot, and if this is
found to be true he will be tried by
the county organization for treason.
The fact that California bought fruit
for her State day in the St. Louis mar
ket was kindly overlooked by the press
of the exposition city. It was a good
thing that the fact that the greatest
fruit raising State in the Union had not
enough to supply her own wants was
not made prominent, for it would have
created an impressjpn that California's
fruit was mostly in' the jars. at the fair.
Somebody is to blame for" the oppor
tunity California has lost to again im
press upon the world the marvelous
scope of her fruit industry. The com
mission says it could not afford to
spend the monev needed to make a
proper fruit showing. It seems as if
there should be some way by which
the coffers of the great commonwealth
of California could be made to yield up
$2000 for such an important cause. The
commission also blames the growers
for not contributing fruit. It seems as
if the necessary quantity could have
been obtained if proper efforts had
been made to get it. If the growers
were reluctant to contribute fruit there
is some reason for it other than lack
of liberality. With all the fruit pro
duced in California it doesn't look rea
sonable that enough couldn't have been
obtained to give 'the State a creditable
representation at the exposition. Maybe
some of the growers could explain why
there Is such an apathy In the matter
of donating fruit for exhibit purposes.
The actual supply of California de
ciduous fruit, aside from apples. In the
Palace of Horticulture on Admission
day consisted of a few plates of pears,
plums and peaohes and six plates of
grapes, the latter from Los Angeles
County. Some of this fruit was not
above the average.
CALL, BUREAU, PRESS BUILD
ING, WORLD'S FAIR, Sept. 20.â For
$2000 or less California could have
made a distribution of fruit at the St.
Louis exposition that would have been
not only the talk of the fair, but of
the globe and would have done the
fruit industry in California thousands
of dollars' worth of good in an adver
tising way. In place of this there was,
as already reported m The Call, a
rather meager distribution of fruits
that didn't create much of a ripple of
excitement on the fair grounds, nor
cause the Eastern and foreign visitors
to feel convinced that California or
chards were cornucopias pouring: out
luscious wealth in unlimited quanti
ties.
To sum the whole situation up,
the fruit showing made on Admission
day will hardly sell any orchard land
in California or advance the consump
tion or prices of dried orchard pro
ducts.

into that imposssible resortâ the Coun
ty. Mrs. Galvin is still possessed of the
remnants of a large inheritance. She
has been arrested six times in the last
month for drunkenness.
"That makes the third time this week
that you promised to hit the highway,"
retorted Judge Mogan. "And In spite of
your promises I see you again. You
have tarried too long, Mrs. Galvin. You
might as well order your luggage
checked to the County. That will be
your bungalow. I'll tell you how long

"Of course, we planned for the funeral
right away. But a Chinaman came to
me and said he had twenty-seven
cousins who were starving to death. I
let him have Gwendolyn at a sacrifice.
"She was old, I do not deny, but dis
eased? Never! We fed her on sterilized
grass, antiseptic oats and put camphor
balls in her boudoir. But I plead guilty.
The meat, especially in chop suey form,
was certainly unpalatable. I'm ready
for mine. Alas, poor Gwendolyn."
"Yours is a $25 fine," said Judge Mo
gan. "You should have burled Gwendo
lyn."
" 'The ax,' I cried to my little son. He
brought me the weapon. I raised it on
high. Gwendolyn smiled faintly, kicked
me in the eolar plexus and kicked the
bucket.
The original cow that furnished
cream and limburger for Noah took
up most of Judge Mogan's time yes
terday. The cow is dead. Her hoofs
are in the glue factory, her bones in
the boneyard and her venerable re
mains have been converted into chop
suey, chow yuch and other heathen
dishes. Slant-eyed aliens are perhaps
at this moment gorging themselves on
the original cow's remains.
Frank Knowls of Colma, last owner
of the historic animal, pleaded guilty
to the charge of selling unpalatable
meat. With bowed head and tears
playing leapfrog down his physiog
nomy, he murmured: "Guilty!"
'"Though the cow was old," he main
tained, "she was not diseased."
He continued sadly thus: "We called
her Gwendolyn out in Colma. The
town can hardly realize that she is no
more. She was an heirloom of my
family for years. When my father
died I let my brothers take what they
would, but kept my father's cow.
"Well, the rheumatics caught her

The cases of J. C. Kenmouth and
Rudelph Quallo, charged with making
Joe King look like 30 cents in a poker
game, were dismissed by Judge
Cabaniss.
King, one of the owners of the New
Western Hotel and a former Super
visor, used to think he was a wizard
when the cards and chips slide along
the green table. Several months ago
a drummer sold to Joe several packs
of cards. On the backs of the paste
boards were cleverly concealed marks.
S About a week ago Kenmouth and
Quallo got into a poker game with
King. The hotel man parted with
several thousand dollars before he dis
covered that the cards were marked.
Then he wanted about a ton of revenge
delivered at the front door. But Judge
Cabaniss maintained that the prosecu
tion, could not show any connection
between the drummer and the poker
players.

the policeman was in the house Mrs.

By reason of lone school residence
in a densely populated part of the
city Mr. Faulkner has grown to know
the people who dwell there, their
hopes and disappointments, their I

how to reach the heart of him who is '

down or who thinks the world's down
on him. the â¢ # cop" and his father con
nituting his hereditary foes.
And this is the reason that Richard
D. Faulkner is to-day principal of
that little school of habitual truants,
forty-eight of them, who had been
â¢"fired" from every other school in the
city and turned into the streets for :
graduation into the ranks of "toughs," )
then thugs. ]
These lads are now in school, amen
able to the laws therein and they ac
tually attend school voluntarily each
day, aye, and did so even when the
â¢Jrcus was in town. too.
Among other intensely interesting
things, Mr. Faulkner said in his ad
dress:
It is not eossible to succeed with every !

'Â¦rj-nate or disorderly, or every one who U Ir- [
regular in attcnaance that may be sent to the '
Parental School, unless provision ig mads for
tiio detention and maintenance of some of them.
Dot the law provides for this. I know that
th* California Club Is anxious to see provis
ion made tor a detention pchool. but not more
t-o than the board and superintendent. I am
sure that you vill bear with them until they j
Â«'Â»a provide the same in accordance with law.
In fact, if you will read the law carefully
>xu will see that they are doing: all that can
b-> dune until they have furnished the Board
Â¦ f Supervisors with an estimate of the cost J
of purchafing a suitable site and erecting a
f-uitable buiMir.s, together with an estimate
for the equipping ofâ the same. In fact, tyt
fore this is done the Board of Education is
?uprv-sed to have furnished the Board of Su- j
pervisors with "all necessary and required in- ;
lormation and rtatiFtks" to prove the neces
rHy fcr the establishment of a parental
nhool and to have obtained their permission
for the establishment of the same, since the
Parental jiebool is supported by Epecial tax,
with the exception of the salary of teachers
and the exoense for supplies, such as ink.
pens, pap^r and chalk. As the board is at
present goins to practically no expense for the
r'arental School except salaries and supplies,
it mbebt be eaid that they are but making
ITeparation for the furnishing of the Board of
Supervisor* with "all necessary information
and statistics" to prove the necessity for the
< stabllshment of a parental school.
If the fan FranciÂ«co Parental School fail*
it will be because the Board of Education and
Superintendent have selected the wrong man
for principal cf it, because they have put no
constraints cr restraints upon me in the or

THE . SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY. SEPTEMBER 21, 1904.
This development comes- with start
ling significance in view of the doubts
expressed as to Kratz's death. When
the case was called in Judge Dunne's
court yesterday Assistant District At
torney "Whiting said he had requested
Captain Martin and Sheriff Curtis to
make a thorough investigation in re
gard to the alleged drowning of the
defendant at Long Beach.
Attorney Frank J. Murphy, who rep
resents the defendant, had no further
news to offer. From his knowledge of
the defendant he could not believe oth
erwise than that he had lost his life
while bathing in the surf at Long
Beach.
The Judge had doubts. The real rea
son why he would not permit the de
fendant's brother "William, who was
convicted and sentenced to serve five
years in San Quentln, to be at large
A sensational phase of the case of A.
A. Kratz, charged with felony embez
zlement and who It is asserted was
drowned at Long Beach last Thursday,
developed yesterday. Kratz was held to
answer by Police Judge Fritz on June
11, 1903, and his bond was fixed at
$5000. He was apparently released on
that day, as he was not taken 'to the
County Jail, and the supposition is that
Judge Fritz accepted his bond. The
bond could not be found yesterday.
It was not in the County Clerk's
office, and Deputy County Clerk Doran
said he had never seen it. Clerk
Duffle of Judge Fritz's court also -said
he had never seen It. Judge Fritz is
on his vacation, but it seems unlikely
that he would retain the" bond in his
possession for such a long period. The
question that is puzzling the District
Attorney's office is, where Is the bond?

SEATTLE, Sept. 20. â Jay Hughes
pitched a remarkable game to-day
against Portland. For six innings not
a man reached second base or placed
the ball safely. After a break for
three hits in the seventh Hughes gave
Portland only one more hit. Save for
that hit not a man reached first base.
He struck out eight men and got two
hits himself. Frisk did some spectac
ular batting. Four hits, including
two three-baggers and a home run,
gave him four scores. He was at bat
only four times, so his average was
perfect.
Portland is not in good condition,
having three men in the hospital.
Speidel, a young man who has been
playing short for a local amateur
team, filled in and put up a good
game. Score:

NATIONAL LEAGUE.
AMERICAN LEAGUE.
Waterbury received some shabby
rapport from his brother Angels at
times, but it was due to his own bad
stunts that the tide of victory ebbed
against him. He did not seem to
have much in the way of curves,
speed or control, and in the tight
places he flew all to pieces. He was
unable to pull himself together in
time to stop the avalanche of runs
that invariably came in during the*.e
periods.
Bjchanan. the first man to face
Waterbury in the third, dumped the
ball out to right field for a poppy sort
of three-bagger. Ganley new to To
man. After that Waterbury's nerve
forsook him and he walked Dunleavy
and Schlafley. Kruger"s drive to cen
ter was good for two runs, and Chase's
miscue of Moskiman's drive let in an
other. Graham could not do any
thing, but Devereaux sent two more
in with a smashing double. Stark
scored the red kid with a bingle to
renter.
That was the tale of the strife. No
one seemed to care what the score
was after that. The Angels managed
to wallor* Buchanan for three runs,
but they never had a chance to
overcome the big lead the Com
muters assumed durinpr the mixup in
the decisive third round. The score:

After that Wheeler steadied down
and held the champions safe. "With
thirteen hits the Seals made but one
run, on two-baggers by Van Buren and
Hildebrand. Men were on bases in every
inning, but could not get around, as
Thomas was effective at critical times.
In the ninth the visitors made three
hits, but fast fielding kept them from
scoring. Lynch made a splendid one
hand catch. Casey and Anderson also
had a busy day. Score:

Boll's Monet won the Bay Shore Sell
ing Stakes to-day from a fast field of
first-class selling platers. Monet had
to do his best to win, defeating H. B.
Duryea's Armenia by a neck, while
Ascension and Dick Bernard were close
up. Monet's position at the post was
No. 10 on the extreme outside. When
the horses had run about a furlong,
King Pepper nearly fell. He dropped
back many lengths and after the race
both his rider and Crimmins, who rode
Old England, went into the stewards'
stand and claimed a foul against Gan
ncm, the rider of Monet. After ob
taining all the evidence that was posr
sible the stewards dismissed the claim,
it not being proved to their satisfaction
that Gannon was to blame. Ascensio-n
was weakly ridden by W. Davis, in ad
dition to being in a pocket all around
the last turn. Summary:

CHICAGO, Sept. 20. â Some interest
ing contests were run to-day at Har
lem. Despite the bad weather, a fair
sized crowd was out. The track was
in bad condition, being deep mud all
over. In winning the Cicero stakes at
one milt, the feature of the opening
day card, W. T. Brinkworth's Stroller
proved he is a superior mudder. He
never left the result in doubt, leading
from wire to wire. He won by a
length over Spencerian, which finished
gamely after closing a big gap. Fon
soluca was third.
John E. Owens was nearly pounded
off the boards in the jumping race
over the short course. He won as he
pleased* after a chapter of accidents,
all of which were in his favor, as he
made no mistakes and was at home in
the soft going. * Summary:

I ;. the Western Fuel Company for the
: . . â¢ of transferring coal to vessels

From a trim little bark, spreading
her white canvas 10 the sea winds, to
. to^l hulk tied up at a wharf bunker
;.- the history of the vessel. .Nine years
iigo 5he was towed into this port from
Guaynias, dismasted and two-thirds
\Â»- recked. She was then the bark
. :; -hooter- and her fight with a ter
rible storm off the Mexican coast dur-
Inz .â¢^pt^iTiber. 1S95. was heroic. Cap
':^::x Watt, her master, had his wife
i-r.i three small children aboard the
l:.rk that was struggling for life in the
tr-fp of the tempest. When the masts
v-ere blown out of the vessel and she
v~s Â¦ helpless hulk, reeling over the
Etonn-ewept waves, Captain Watt
threw overboard a sealed bottle con
â¢ ..r.;r.?r a brief account of their plight
r;d the location of the drifting wreck.
The message was found and a Mexican
-..ar vessel sent to their relief towed
:he Sharpshooter into Guaynias. She
v as brought to this port by the
Spreckels tug Fearless â a long tow of
ovtr 1S00 miles.
The martless halk. repaired and re
r.tted, returned to commerce as the
i arker.tine Madeline, owned by several
v.ater front merchants, but she was
i.ot a success. Her awful fight with
the storm of the Mexican coast ap
; crently disabled her for all time and
j-h* finally fioated into Oakland Creek
and lost her standing as a sailer. Her
:ane was again changed and she be
(Â»rr.e the Ruth. Months of idleness
followed, however, and then the West
ern Fuel Company, her latest owners,
took the masts out of her, leaving the
headspars, and dropped her to the
isr.oMe status of a coal hulk.

The babies and baskets are doubtless
necessary, as the world is at present
arranged. But certainly the trailing
dresses are neither necessary nor suit
able to the occasion.
Poverty does not seem a reasonable
excuse for unsuitable dressing. It may
be necessary to dress plainly, but it is
not necessary to dress foolishly.

TENNESSEE'S former Governor.
Robert L. Taylor, Journalist and
lecturer and noted throughout the
South for his eloquence, added an
other chapter to his romantic career
the other day at Bristol, when he was
married for the third time. At the
home of the parents of the bride in
Chilhowie. Va., Miss Mamie St. John,
one of the prettiest and most talented
young women of Virginia and a social
favorite, became the bride of the former
Governor.
It was a small and informal wedding.
Among the relatives present were Mr.
Taylor's three daughters and two sons,
his brothers,* Alfred A. Taylor, who
was once his opponent in the race for
Governor, and Hugh Taylor.
The bride is a distant relative of her
husband. Her father, Noah C. St. John,
is a lawyer of ability. She is 28 years of
age and was graduated from Virginia
Institute. â¢ Bristol, Tenn.. where she
demonstrated superior intellectual pow
ers and aptness in literary pursuits.
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor will reside in
Bristol, the former Governor having
recently sold his palatial residence In
Knoxville in order, as he expressed it,
to get back to the mountains and the
beautiful valley where he was born.
Taylor recently became president of
the Bristol Courier Publishing Com
pany, and aside from his lecture tours
will take a hand In the editorial work.
T'HE announcement of Robert Treat Paine .that he will support
Roosevelt is indicative of the feeling of independent Democrats.
Mr. Paino has been twice the Democratic candidate for Gov
ernor of Massachusetts and finds it now necessary for the first
time in his political career to assert his independence of party.
. By the abbreviated text of his announcement it appears that
he resents the Southern abuse of the President on account of the
Booker Washington incident. As is well known, President Wash
ington had called at the White House. to advise the appointment of
an eminent Alabama Democrat to the position of District Judge of
the United States. The President, about to go to lunch, invited
President Washington to talk the matter over at lunch. The Demo
crat was appointed and his service has given satisfaction to evcrv
body. This has been tortured into the President's indorsement of
social equality between the races, and he has been lampooned and
insulted throughout the South. It is significant that the case was
put in shape for the South by certain trust organs in New York.
But, entirely, aside from President Washington's errand at the
White House, there is an element in the affair that should arrest
the attention of all thoughtful Americans. It has touched Robert
Treat Paine. Booker Washington is the most eminent man of his
time, judged by the hard duty he has set for himself. His race in
this country numbers 10,000,600 people. Since emancipation it has
been led to dream the impossible in the direction of political action.
It has festered in the vices of ignorance, idleness and politics. Booker
Washington advises that it let politics alone. He. tells it that social
equality is as impossible as it is undesirable. He teaches it that its
first duty is the acquirement of the useful arts, to the end that it may
have the self-respect that comes with the capacity for self-support.
Acting upon this thesis at Tuskegee he is teaching negroes how
to live honestly, uprightly and virtuously. He is educating them
in the handicrafts and industries. He is striving with the might of
a strong man and philosopher for their moral and industrial progress.
Suppose every negro in the United States were a follower of Booken
Washington, inspired by his high spirit, living his iclean life, and
acting upon his earnest and improving purpose, would there be
crime and lynchings?
A man is to be judged by his master motive. Tolstoi has had
the sympathy of the world for his efforts in" behalf of the vodka
soaked mujiks of Russia. Bttt his methods demonstrate that he has
attempted this by impossible means. Washington is greater than
Tolstoi, for he goes on a harder task, by possible means, and the
record of his accomplishment entitles him to the respect of every
American who knows that 10,000,000 ignorant and besotted ne
groes arc an increasing menace to this republic. It will not for
ward the work of Washington to treat his color as the badge of
outlawry and spurn and scorn him. These things impress Mr.
Treat, and he is not alone.
DEMOCRATS FOR ROOSEVELT.
The Rev. George W. Brownback,
pastor of the Pilgrim Congregational
Church at Reading, Pa., who adver
tised for a wife, 'received 2000 appli
cants for his hand, and then married
an attractive Paterson, N. J., girl, re
ferred In a recent sermon to the large
number of divorces granted in this
country and then spoke on "the model
husband." His text was Colossians
3, 19: "Husbands, love your wives, and
be not bitter against them." He said
in part:
"The model husband Is one who
thinks more of. his wife than he does
of himself or anv one in the world
"The successful business man keeps
close watch on contracts to see that
they are fulfilled. Husbands, how long
is it since you have looked at your
marriage contract?
"Many a man, without' appreciation
of the beautiful flower he has taken
unto himself, becomes careless and
negligent. A model husband is a man
of good memory. He remembers the
introduction that set his heart flutter-
Ing. He remembers the walks to
gether before marriage. Therefore he
does not get half a square ahead and
then bawl out: 'Susan Jane, for
heaven's sake, why don't you hurry
up? 1
"My model husband doesn't wait un
til his wife dies to give flowers. A
single rose, perfumed with love in life,
is worth more than a dozen wreaths
on the casket lid.
"When you go home put your arms
around your wife and tell her how
sweet and beautiful she is. It may
be stretching the truth, but God will
forgive you and your wife will be
happy.
"Remember how blind you were to
her faults before marriage. If you
have discovered them since, keep your
eyes tightly closed.
"A model husband . always remem
bers he is the husband of one wife.
When you think less of your wife and
more of another the breakers' of hell
are before you."
FOR THIRD TIME FORMER
GOVERNOR TAKES A WIFE
MODEL HUSBAND
IMMEDIATELY after the recent primary election in this city
charges of fraud were made by the various partisans in that
event. It is, unfortunately, too true, that such charges impinge
upon partisanship to an extent that makes the general public in
different to them. It is also unfortunately true that a large body
of business and professional men are neglectful of their civic duty.
It is through politics that government, municipal, state and national,
receives its officiary, and derives the personnel through whic"h its
authority is exerted.
Of this process the primary election is the source. It is the
fountain head of all. Those who snub the primary polls have no
call to cavil at the final result. Civic reformers have swept the
political horizon vainly for an indication that the class which has
the most at stake in the character of government are alive to their
duty and are aware of the opportunity they have for the right guid
ance of final results.
! In many cities there have been spasmodic efforts at reform, but
these have usually been excited by preventable abuses that would
not exist at all if the citizens who protest against their existence
had been mindful of their duty in the primary political processes.
It was this condition that moved the late Senator Ingalls to declare
that "political purity is an iridescent, dream." It was an expression
of hopelessness and, if true, boded ill for the republic.
No popular government can usefully endure in which the people
are indifferent to the purity of politics. No matter what partisans
sax*, there is no partisanship in impure politics. Both great par
lies have been shamed by it, and their higher aims and declarations
of principle have been nullified by the filth of the gutter, spattered
upon their declarations of principle. Only eternal vigilance of the
best men in all parties can preserve the ballot-box from pollution and
American politics from tarnish.
To San Francisco belongs the honor of the first practical at
tempt to compel purity in the primary processes of politics. That
powerful organization, the Merchants' Association, is the agent and
instrument of this movement. That association had its genesis in
a determination to make the city physically cleaner than it was. To
it we owe the vast improvement in the condition of our streets,
the better condition of the sewers, the triumph of the bonds for parks
and other needed and desirable municipal improvements. It has
inaugurated the system of safety stations at crowded and dangerous
points in the operation of our street cars, and has in all things
promoted the decency and welfare of the city.
It was- eminently proper that this non-partisan organization
should move forward from promoting the physical cleanliness of the
city to secure its moral purgation, by paying attention to the primary
processes of politics. It has promoted the prosecution of persons
charged with fraud in the recent primary election, and can be relied
upon to push every case to a revelation of all the facts by reliable
testimony.
It is indifferent to us. as it is to all decent citizens, which party
or what individuals profited by the frauds. If there were frauds and
violations of the purity of elections law, let the guilty be punished.
The gratifying fact is that the law is vindicated and its enforcement
attempted by the Merchants' Association, as evidence of the purpose
of that body to stand guard over the ballot-box hereafter.
Mr. Fairfax Wheelan, the member of the association who has
taken upon himself the burden of this necessary action, deserves the
applause and support of all good citizens. He has undertaken a dif
ficult and perhaps dangerous task. Everything that promises to in
timidate him will be put in motion by the class which makes the
ballot merchandise and the ballot-box a refuge of fraud; His fellow
citizens will understand this and will give him the backing and
support of every element of decency in the city.
Whether he succeed or fail in the finality the people have con
fidence in him and believe that his evidence and his allegations are
the conclusions of his conscience and manifestations of his" high sense
of civic duty. The Merchants* Association has always stood for
much that is best in our municipal life and conditions. It now
stands for all that is best, by supplementing its efforts for physical
betterment by a determination that moral and political betterment
shall be added thereto.

ANSWERS
A trim and tidy girl, although she
may look commonplace, always wins
the admiration of her sex. She is always
a picture of youthful freshness and
she invariably wears something white
at her throat. Her taste in dress is al
ways beyond criticism and she Is con
splcously careful in the matter of her
shoes. Sentimentalists may find lit
tle that is interesting about her and
call her ordinary, but they forget that
the commonplace frequently means
contentment and happiness; where her
more highly strung sister would be the
bare theory she is the actual practice.
For her trimness and . tidiness of
habit pervade her mind as well, and
not being notably pretty she finds it
incumbent upon her to take an intelli
gent interest In mere man and his
poor affairs. The trim and tidy girl
has lovely eyes, for the unhealthy
problem novel is quite a closed book
tD her. The ideas she has are all well
defined and simple and through their
very simplicity they, are easily attain
able. She does not start life with a
false yearning, but with a steady, clear
mind, and is always . the welcome
friend.

A St. Louis woman's cleverness fair
ly took a Jefferson guard off his feet
the other day, and gave a hearty
laugh to a dozen witnesses of the
comedy. She was a picture-loving
mother, and had toiled up Art Hill
with her cooing babe in a small push
cart. She gave a sigh of relief as she
mounted the last stairs leading to her
goal, and as she mopped the persplra*
tion from her face explained to the
baby what a glorious time they were
going to have looking at the beautiful
pictures. 'Twas evident that the wom
an and the baby were on the best of
terms and out to enjoy things to
gether, says a St. Louis exchange.
As she was about to enter, a pleas
ant-faced Jefferson guard, with an ex
pression that said plainly that he
didn't relish the task, said courteously,
but firmly, "I am very sorry, madam,
but we have orders to admit no per
ambulators inside the building."
For a moment the tired mother was
dazed by her disappointment. She
looked hopelessly in at the door, up
at the sympathetic guard, and down at
the cooing babe. Suddenly her face
brightened, as by an inspiration. She
seized the handle with a firm grip,
slipped it over her arm, like the han
dle of a basket. There was a click,
and presto, change! Miss Baby was
seated in a wicker swing, suspended
from the mother's arm, kicking and
cooing as happily as ever. To the
questioning glance of the mother the
courteous guard said, as well as he
could for laughter, "That mode of
transportation is not mentioned In my
orders, madam." and in triumDh the
mother and baby entered amid the
cheers of the onlookers.
CLEVER WOMAN
It is easy to tell the toiler
How best he can carry his pack;
But no one can rate a burden's weight
Until it has been on his back.
The up-curled mouth of pleasure
Can preach of sorrow's worth; >
Bur^ive it a slip, and a wryer lip
Was never made on earth.
It is easy to sit in the sunshine
And talk to the man in the shade;
It is easy to float in a well-trimmed boat
And point out the places to wade.
It la easy to sit In your carriage
And counsel the man on foot;
But get down and walk and you'll change
your talk
As you feel the peg in your boot.

Aside from the butchers and bakers
who enter the block to sell their wares
a man never is seen. The politicians
in the town are anxious for the wed
ding bells to ring on Bergenline ave
nue, as there are only two votes in,
the block, when, according to their
reckoning, there should be at least
twenty-one. Election time is draw
ing near, and as the town is solidly
Democratic, the leaders wish as many
votes as possible to swell the majority
of the county.
"A lone bachelor would have a hard
time of it in our block," said Mrs.
William Senteff. "There would bo
many hair pulling matches to see who
would get him. It would be a game
of 'I saw him first.* In all seriousness,
I do not know how It ever happened
that we all came to live so near each
other. It appears peculiar to see al!
of us on Sundays, with our mourning
gowns and veils. There is not a bit
of color on any of the dresses seen in
the block.
"I really do not know why we
should not get together and advertise
for husbands. .We would make loving
wives and we would not have to de
pend on our husbands' fortunes,
either. With two exceptions we each
own our own house and have snug
sums in the bank. The block is a
great field for good, kind and loving
bachelors, who have no objection to
widows."
Deep mourning is the prevailing
color of the gowns worn by women on
Bergenllne avenue, between Hudson
and Herman avenues, Guttenburg, X.
j. Within that block, which has only
twenty-three houses, there are nine
teen widows, two widowers and two
other families. The street is known
as "Widows' Row."
Up to two months ago there werÂ«
only twelve widows there. Then four
husbands died, three within one week,
and the next week three more died.
The deaths were in houses adjoining
and at one time there was crape on
three doors.
With one or two exceptions the wid
ows are wealthy and own the houses
they live in. For social purposes the
women each evening assemble at the
residence of one; on Sunday they at
tend worship in the several churches
In the town, each robed in mourning
garb. When they leave for church thÂ«
block is deserted. The names of the
widows in the row follow:

charged toward the girl, who was on

and galloped her horse to the nearest

took careful aim, shut both eyes and
pulled the trigger. When the smoke
cleared away the girl were surprised
and delighted to find that the deer was

Schussler Says Land Is Dear.
Hermann Schussler, chief engineer
of the Spring Valley "Water Works,
resumed his dissertation yesterday be
fore United States Commissioner Hea
cock upon reservoirs for the storage
of potable water for municipal pur
poses. The witness read from the tes
timony of C. E. Grunsky in the Drink
house case in 1892, when the water
company attempted to condemn four
teen and a half acres of land for the
purposes of the Main Crystal Springs
dam, SCO feet above tide water. From
Mr. Grun^ky's testimony the witness
deduced the fact that land for reser-
voir purposes in that region was worth
$1230 per acre. He said also that
the value of such land would increase
in proportion as the expense of im
pounding the water grew smaller.
Mr. will continue this
afternoon.

\ OYSTER BAY, L. I., Sept. 20. â A
man who is regarded by the secret ser
vice officials and by the authorities of
Oyster Bay as a dangerous 'crank was
apprehended here to-iday. He is J. E.
Reeves, a medium-sized, roughly . at
tired man, about 40 years of age. He
was making his way to SagamoreHill
when he was arrested. He told Of
ficer Tyree, who apprehended him,
that hd wanted to see the President on
important business. Believing from
the man's manner that he was insane,
Offiver Tyree took him before Justice
Franklin for examination. To the Jus
tice Reeves said that six years ago* he
died in a Jersey City hospital and
went to heaven in an automobile.
While there he received an Important
message for President Roosevelt,
which he was directed to deliver per
sonally. He refused to say what the
nature of the message was, as he de
clared he could communicate it to no
body but the President He declared
to the Justice, however, that he^had :
written a book on his experiences , in
heaven, which he desired, to have
published, as he was satisfied millions
could be made out of it. The'Presi
dent, he said, undoubtedly would rjoin
with him in securing the publication
of the work and that was one reason
v/hy he wished to have a talk with
him. ' >
Reeves,, who talked as if he had en
joyed some educational advantages,
said he was a resident of Baltimore.
He had in his pockets $2 in cash and
some unimportant papers, but no
weapons. -
Justice Franklin, after his examina
tion, being convinced that the man
was insane and very likely dangerous,
deputized one of the secret service
men to take him to Mineola, where a
formal inquiry Into his mental condi
tion will be held.

CHICAGO,. Sept. 20.â Active covering by
shorts as the result of n cold wave In the
Northwest caused a net advance of l%c In the
price of both wheat and corn here to-day.
Reports of general irost last night through
out the Dakotas and Western Minnesota gave
a strong start to the wheat market, there be
ing a lively demand alike from shorts and
commission houses. Thfl December option
opened with a gain of I to l',Â» to l!iÂ©l%e, at
$1 IZMttl 0H%: May was up "ifivs to Hi&l%c.
at $1 10% to $1 11U- Fat-torn that contributed
considerable strength were the comparatively
mnall receipts in the Northwest and the ex
ceeding low grade of the fresh arrival?. Tho
market was affected also by a bulge. In corn
prices and by the firm tone of foreign grain
markets. On the resulting advance there was
considerable selling by pit tracers, causing a
Ioeo of much of the Initial gain. December de
clining to $1 09#i. Meantime May sold off to
$1 10%. The reaction, however, was- only tÂ«m
porary, with bullish reports coming; from the
Northwest and the market at Minneapolis
showing a big advance, prices here started up
ward again. A smaller 'Increase .'than expected
In the world's visible supply was a factor that
stimulated buying late in the session. The
high point of the day was reached at $1 Cl>%
Tor December. May sold up to $1 ll^igl 12.
The market closed ftrongr. with December at
$1 mm and May at $1 U>iÂ©l 11%.
Predictions that the cold wave In the North
west would swoop down upon the corn fields
of Iowa and Nebraska to-night gave shorts
a fright at the opening -of the corn market.
Traders had not yet entirely recovered from
the bullish statements of the two well-known
crop Experts made yesterday, and ihis fresh
source of anxiety caused ii wild scramble for
offerings. December 'closed with a pain of
l^at 61M&51Hs,c. A dispatch from New York
crediting James Jl Hill with a statement that
the total j-leld of corn will not exceed two
billion bushela gave tho market additional sup
port durinz the latter part of the day.
Oat3 held tirm. December closed Vie higher
at 32%c.
Provisions were stronz and active. - Contin
ued light hog receipts and stronger grain mar
kets were the principal Influences. At the
close January pork was up 57^c, .lard was up

Njno York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. 20.â An expert crop
etfrnate of 1.900.0w,000 bushels of corn which
I was given to the public yesterday caused a
j momentary Jtimp in the corn market, which
Â»'as more than loft before the day was over,
while the corresponding decline in Stocks was
partly retrieved. But that estimate was re
inforced to-day by the expressed credence of
President Hill of the Great Northern Railway
and was thus given renewed influence on
stocks. The consequence was a decline in
prices, which affected not only the common
carriers, t>ut the stock carriers, the grangers,
the Pacifies, the coalers, trunk lines, and. In
fact, every department of the railroad list.
The scare over the corn crop probably had a
large share also in the weakness In the indus
trial l:.Â«t, although there were special causes
alÂ«n at work in that department. The esti
mates of the crop, based on conditions past,
were given added force by the weather reports
snowing dangerously low temperatures In the
Northwest and forecasts of frosts for to-mor
rcw over a wide area In the West and North-
T.-est. The weekly crop bulletin of the Weather
Bureau was somewhat ambiguous and obscure
in its expression, but offered little to cheer
thÂ« apprehensive over either the corn or cot
ton crop. The determined optimism with
which a large speculative element has ac
cepted every suggestion of crop damage for
seme time past was thuÂ« rather severely tried.
The fall in prices which resulted for the first
time from gelling also disclosed the existence
of stop loss orders placed below the market
by holders anxious to limit their losses.
Another source of uneasiness seemed to be
the announced cut in steel billets and other
steel pioducts, which was announced here alter
the stock market closed yesterday, although
thlK action had been clearly foreseen and fore
toIJ" for many days past. In fact, some of
tUe recent strength of the steel stocks has been
b&j>ed on- the advantages expected to follow
this cut in attracting belated orders and fix
ing the stability of the market. Evidence of
Intended competition with United States Steel
la tome finished lines was also an influence on
that group. Amalgamated Copper offered some
temporary resistance to the 'decline, due to
an advance In grades of copper, but ulti
mately yielded. A more effective â¢ resistance
wan offered by Union Pacific, which was 1 '-i-c
over last nlsbt. It was argued that Union
Pacific's com territory was comparatively safe
from frost damage and thl? statement may also
have been intended as a reassurance to wme
current rumor* regarding the health of the
head of the system. It could not be learned
that there was any actual calling of loans
on the Stock Exchange, but the tone of the
money market plainly continues to harden and
the prospect of retrenched credits? was un
doubtedly a factor in the liquidation of stock
holdings. Declines were fairly uniform at be
tween 1 and 2 points, but wide declines in a
few high-grade Investment stock* were a feat
ure. Such closely held stocks 'are easy to bid
tip for effect in a bull market and the aban
donment of protection for the high level Is
likely to be significant of the speculative mood
of those who advanced the price previously
for effect. Missouri Pacific's poor showing
of net earning! for July cost It an extreme
decline of 2^4. Union Pacific was turned
a~alr.st the bear* until they began to cover to
take profits In the final dealings and some
brisk rallies resulted, but the close was fever
ish and unsettled.
Bonds were weak. Total sales, par value,
$1,905,000. . United States bonds were un
cbansred on call.

Da Silva for many years was con
nected with the Chinese Bureau at this
port as an interpreter. He was dis
missed last year'because he fell In love
with one of the stenographers and
neglected his duties. He and Lee Toy
arrived from China on the Doric a few
weeks ago. with 207 Chinese acrobats
and twelve Chinese women for the ex
position at St. Louis. . Four, of the
â¢women confessed that they and their
companions were slaves and were being
brought to the United States by Da
Silva and Lee Toy for immoral pur
poses. The four were not permitted to
land, but the eight other women were
allowed to proceed to St. Louis, not
withstanding the statement of the four.
The Indictment of Lee Toy and Da
Silva was procured at the . request of
the Department of Justice, and the ar
rests were made by United States se
cret service men. '
â¢ United States Marshal Shine says
that every raid but -one that he had
been instructed to make upon China
town in searching for women who had
been illegally landed had been "tipped
off" in advance by some person in the
Chinese Bureau.
Assistant United States District At
torney Ben L. McKinley received a tel
egram from St. Louis yesterday an
nouncing that H. L. Eca da Silva had
been arrested in that city upon the in

Chinese women for immoral purposes.
The telegram added that Da Silva
would be taken to San Francisco with
out delay for trial. Da Silva's confed
erate. Lee Toy, was released yesterday
afternoon on bonds of $5000, given by a
security company. September. 26 has
been set as the date of Lee Toy's ar
raignment. Â«

Another fraud order was issued yes

persons and firms in this State to
whom has been denied the use of the

Crossed live wires yesterday after
noon caused a fierce fire in the base
ment of the Academy of Sciences build
ing, Market street, near Fourth, that
endangered the lives of three women
and filled the entire building with
stifling smoke. The cellars were thick
with the choking, blinding smoke when
the fire engines arrived. Down into this
inferno the firemen went. After an
hour's hard fighting the flames were
under control and the smoke began to
clear away.
Just before the flre started three
young women were at work in the mil
linery store of the Muller-Byrne Com
pany. Their names are Reglna Skelley.
Nellie Denahan and Mrs. Josie Lang
horne. While they were absorbed in
their work a cloud of smoke burst
through a ventilator, filling the room.
Blinded and choking, the three women
clasped hands and groped their way to
the door in the dark. When the first
cloud of smoke came from the cellars
the electric lights in the building splut
tered and went out.
The flre started in the basement used
by the Muller-Byrne Company as a
storeroom. Several thousand dollars
worth of millinery goods placed there
were totally destroyed. Smoke and
water played havoc with the entire
stock of the company, valued at $20,000.
It was insured for about $15,000.
The cellar adjoining the millinery
company's storeroom contained several
cases of cutlery owned by C. H. Phil
pott & Co. Their loss, which is slight,
is covered by insurance. The Academy
of Sciences lost several casts and speci
mens, and Daniel Eisner, a furrier,
about $500 worth of furs. The Academy
of Sciences lecture-room was badly
damaged. :;_'
The thick black smoke penetrated
every room in the building. It gushed
up through the floors and spurted
through ventilators. Those who saw
the firemen descend into the cellars
thought that they were rushing to their
deaths. The Emergency Hospital sent
an ambulance, in charge of Chief Stew
ard Charles Buchw. to the scene, as
many cases of suffocation were expect
ed. But only one fireman was hurt,
Joseph Dolan of Truck 3.
The Academy of Sciences building
stands between the Flood building and
the Emporium. Fortunately the fire did
not spread to either of these buildings.
