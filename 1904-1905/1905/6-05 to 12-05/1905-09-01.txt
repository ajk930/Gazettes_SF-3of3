News of Concessions to Russia.' ;
Special OlÂ«pntcb to The Call. '
TOKIO, Sept. 1 Fearlnsr a tre
xnrndoua internal upheaval, the (Jovern
u>ent bam not vet dared to penult netva
concerning the peace terms to go before
the people. Sot since the war was be
icun faun such a rl*rld censorship been
In force. Xot nn Inkling; of the con
cexkitons made to HuskJo U:iÂ« yet reached
the public.
The nature of the reception that will
be accorded the definite news will de
pend entirely upon the terms." It is
generally fcareu that extensive conces
sions have been made by Japa<. It has
been expected by the public and hoped
tLnt there would be a rupture at Ports
â¢ mouth, in view of what was te'rmtd
Russia's obduracy in refusing the pay
ment of indemnity. v,:^*
The Jiji says this morning: "An
agreement arrived at without a rup
ture can only mean that great conces
sions have been made by our pleni
potentiaries. A peace concluded upon
such terms can never satisfy the na
tion."-
The Mai Xichi says: "We are disap
pointed.' We only hoped that there
would be a suspension of the peace
conference. It is impossible under the
circumstances to conclude an honorable
peace. The ,i ruits of our arms have
been lost by weak diplomacy. Japan,
victorious in the field, has been" de
feated In the conference chamber."
The Nichi Nichi says: "We feel sur
prised and wonder how peace could
have been concluded when everything
indicated the impossibility of making
Russia accept the vital demands of our
terms. In the absence of official con
firmation of the terms it is impossible
to form a final opinion, but the indica
tions are that nothing will Insure peace
\u25a0with terms that are honorable."
The minor papers are generally angry
and say that a peace obtained upon the
terms reported is a humiliating one.
The attitude of the Japanese Govern
ment indicates that there is no imme
diate intention to issue a formal state
ment relating to the result of the con
ference.. It is possible that Japan's en
voys to Portsmouth will publish a
statement at the termination of their
labors. The Foreign Office Intimates
that there will be no publication here"
until a signed copy of the treaty
reaches the Emperor and its approval
Is gazetted, which will probably be a
month hence, or until Baron Kumora
" appears -before the Diet and makes a.
report on the peace conference and its
results. The date for the assembling
of the Diet has not yet been determined.
Premier Katsura and Marquis Ito are
the recipients of numerous protests and
memorials against the versions of set
tlement of the war as given by. the j
newspapers. Ws .â¢ \u25a0 ' .

revision, and recalls the attempt to an
sanalnate Okuma, KByinc: >. < ; \u25a0
â¢The people never remained qnlet

It further declares that the nation
\u25a0will be humiliated unless the people act
stiongly against the Portsmouth set
tlement! It asks:
"Why -should the victor be concilia
tory and the vanquished arrogant?"
It declares that the people's quick
action alone will prevent national dis
grace after a series of brilliant victories
on land and sea.
"Otherwise," it Bays, "our brothers
who have been killed in 'the field have
died an inglorious death."
DE WITTE INCLINED TO BOAST.

ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 31.â Mr. de Witte.

"You ccc what one gains by standing firm.

that it eventually carried conviction.
"When the Japanese presented their written

at th'm and spoke of something else. On
leaving tlie room I Intentionally forgot the

! MOSCOW, Aug. 31.â The Rusakoi' Slovo,
haWngr. the largest circulation in Mbscow, to
day publishes a two-column eulogy of President
Roosevelt and the part he bas played during
the last three months, saying- in : conclusion: â¢
"To the memories of the. Russian and Jap
anese peoples the personality of President
Koosevelt If cro-g-ned with the halo of peace

FAR-REACHING TREATY.
Aueln-Jnpanrsp Compact a I'eace-and-
Wnr I'at.rnerslilp.
LONDON, Aug. 31.â The report that an
Anglo-Japanese treaty was signed August 12
by Foreign Secretary Lansdowne and Minister
Hayashi is confirmed. While secrecy is main
tained for the present "regarding the exact
terrcs. it may be said that the document is
of far-reaching Importance. It affords, mutual
guarantees for the protection of British and
Japanese interests, even If the two contracting
pow era are only threatened by a single hos
tile power, and assures the maintenance of
the status quo in the Far East. The new
treaty will bÂ« found to be a powerful factor
in Insuring the peace of the world â at any
rate so far as the Far East is concerned.
The important modification, binding either
power to go to the assistance of the other If
attacked by one instead, as in the old treaty,
of two powers, causes inquietude in some
quarters, where It is thought to add enorm
ously to Great Britain's responsibility, but on
the whole complete satisfaction .is expressed
as to the scope of the new treaty as far
as It is at present known.
The Daily Telegraph, representing the views
of â¢ the Government and well reflecting the
opinions of a majority of the newspapers, in
an editorial says:
"The new Anglo-Japanese treaty will guar
antee the terms of the Portsmouth treaty. It
will check any insane idea of Russian re
venge, wHI render Impossible any anti-
Japanete coalition and effectually terminate
tho scramble for China."
It is supposed that the new treaty, estab
lishes an unqualified; defensive alliance be
tween Great Britain and Japan and it is be
lieved not unlikely that India is Included in
the sphere of territory over which the treaty
aims for the preservation of tbe status quo.
Should this prove the case,- its vaule to Great
Britain will be enhanced.
RUSSIAN PRESS DISGRUNTLED.
Would Welcome an Opportunity tor a
Reopen! nÂ«r of the 'War.
ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 31.â Judging from
the press comment; to-day, on peace,' it would
appear that, .â¢ while pleased with . tho prospect
of the- cessation 'of bloodshed from the Far
East. 'a large portion of me, public Is -enable
to reconcile Itself ta the loss of territory how
ever inslgnincant. The national' pride ' seems
to be offended by the cession of part of. the isl
and of Saghallen."
Yesterday the people spoke of "to-day's
shame," meaning peace.
Many of the utterances show evidences of . re
gret that the army had not been given another
chance to try the fortune of war, though no
one questions or underrates the humanity of
the course followed -, by President Roosevelt,
the plenipotentiaries and Emperor Nicholas
The tone of many of the utterances con
cerning peace Induces one to believe that a
further sacrifice of human lives would not be
unacceptable if the national self respect could
be regained thereby. One word of disapproval
of the terms from Tokio, suggesting that Japan
did not desire to be bound by them might
result in a flare-up here In defense, of war
and the national honor.
Embittered by what they declare to be a
dishonorable . peace. : the extreme patriots do
not always refrain from criticizing President
Roosevelt and the Ameritan people, who, they
declare, have offended husslan sentiment by
underrating tha Russian preparations, strength
and ability to cope with the Japanese.
The people, almost, without exception, wel
come peace and express the hope that the
shackles which kept American enterprise out
of Russia -will' be removed. Preferences for
American enterprises in xtussla as against
German is expressed.
Tne Russ says: "All we could have expect
ed was avoidance of diplomatic defeat. This
seems to have been accomplished."
The Novoe Vremya says: "Japan is dissatis
fied with the peace.- So are we. President
Rooeevelt 'was in favor of Russia " ceding the
island of Saghallen and paying an Indemnity.
This does not please, us. This peace is only
one phase in our relations with Japan, which
are only beginning. .We shall rest, and then,
doubtless. ' go ; on. As men - who have tx pent
eighteen months together, we now shake each
other by the -hand and lay 'Au revoir.'- Eng
llfh and American' capitalists should rejoice
over the peace.".
The Slovo says that peace . should have been
concluded before the battle of the Sea of Ja
pan, adding: '"Then we 4 wpuld not -have lost
any territory. The; present . agreement ; with
Japan may result In relations which - will re
ward us and heal the wounds inflicted on
Ruffian patriotism by the war." "
The Nasha Shlsu' remarks: "We ; must'ac
knowledge that the peace terms are most dis
advantageous. We cannot rejoice over them.
We have loÂ«t too much."
The.Sviet says :\u25a0 "General Llnevitch's army
Is not destroyed. - The present treaty puts ott;
but does , not exclude warâ only a bucket ; of
cold water has been poured over.it out of the
fountain of humanity, with which . President
Roosevelt Is. now Irrigating all the: world." - '
Tbe Bourse Gazette cays:- "The \u25a0 \u25a0war.'has
forced Russia \u25a0to open her eyes to : her. rotten
political , foundations â¢ and to tier Ignorance of
the disorder in tbe army, , and, in fact; in .all
branches of the national administration." .
The St. Petersburg \u25a0 Gazette remarks: ."'We
have been overcome, not by Japan, but by our
difboneety and happy-go-luoiiness. , The dread
ful lescons of this war win not be \u25a0 fruitless
and will. force as toward oetter forms of life.

The platform presented by the committee on resolutions, Alfred Roncovieri chairman, and adopted
zviihout a murmur by the delegates^ was indorsed as a good thing by the nominee for Afayor, although he con-
Jessed that he had net read it. The document is a voluminous, rambling and incoherent defense of the Schmiiz

that all wcrk be done by the day. Following is the document:

matters which ' all genuine?! i nc>w , merchants
can answer/ readily dcmonst.te that the cer-
tlflcate is held fraudulently by a mere coolie
who ls landing in violation of law.
FRAUDULENT IMMIGRATION.
Until thiÂ« method of investigation was
adopted the law was constantly violated by
fraudulent certificates, but upon a proper in
vestigation at the port of entry such frauds
were mostly detected and thÂ« law enforced.
We call attention to the law which in express
words makes such certificates only- "prima
facie" evidence.
This means that the certificate shall not bs
conclusive and that It may be shown at the
port of entry by Investigation to be trauddleot
As enormous numbers of certificates have
been presented and detected as fraudulently
held, we declare that any refusal or neglect
by the Inspection officers \u25a0to make such in
vestigation, or the acceptance of such cer
tificates as conclusive evidence, is in effect a
refusal to entorce the law as. is plainly writ
ten and as heretofore effectively enforced.
The law cannnot be enforced by orders for
greater care in issuing certificates to mer
chants in China â because if th;re can be no
proper investigation and inquiry at the port
of entry it is Impossible ever to prove any
certificate fraudulent. This law provides .or
its enforcement in the United States, and not
In China, and to leave its enforcement to
action In China ls<in effect to nullify the law.
We bflieve that the President of the United
States has not been fully informed as to the
devices for fraudulently evading this law, and
we charge that powerful capitalistic interests
and mercantile and commercial powers, which
are attempting to crush out organized labor
and to lower wages, arc engaged in a national
conspiracy to flood the United States with
cheap labor â and to that end are seeking by
every device to break down the Chinese ex
clusion Iswb and to delugs our epuntry with
coolie labor. Thfse capitalistic powers have
combined and confederated to break down the
Chinese exclusion law by a nsw treaty witn
China, and as a means to that end have pro
moted and magnified a pretended boycott of
American goods by the Chinese, which boycott
to the extend that It has any real basis in
China ls secretly fomented by agents of Japan,
which seeks to dominate and control the trade
of China.
OPPOSED TO CHINESE.
The American enemies of labor are seeking
to cause the nation to believe that the real
sentiment of the people of tin Pacific Coast has
changed against Chinese immigration and that
opposition to such immigration ls not as strong
as formerly.
The Citizens' Alliance is one of the active
elt-;n:-nts In California engaged in this con
spiracy against labor and with its confederates
It aims in tbe coming election to defeat Kugene
E. Schmitz for Mayor, not only because in
his candidacy he represents the wageworker,
but also that it may thereby claim to the
governmental authorities at Washington and
elsewhere throughout our country that the rep
resentative of labor In the chief city of Cali
fornia, standing upon a platform demanding
strict enforcement of the Chinese exclusion
law, was defeated, and deducing therefrom as
a natural sequence that the people of Cali
fornia, and esjÂ»eclaUy of San Francisco, are not
In accord with the policies of the Chinese ex
clusion acts. " â¢ \u25a0
For these reasons this question is an issue
of immense importance in the present cam
paign. It Is true that Mayor Schmltz has
not the enforcement of â¢ that law under his
control, yet It is also true that the law ls
not to be enforced, but is to be broken down
unless the people of the chief city of California
are decisively and plainly outspoken In their
sentiments at the ballot-box this time.
Mayor Schmitz Is the representative of the
Bentimer.t of San Francisco In favor of Chinese
exclusion. 'At a recent banquet given in this
city by thope who will nominate the opponent
of Mayor Sehmltzâ to Secretary Taftâ who had
procured the recent order against strict en
forcement of the exclusion law. It was ad
visedly and purposely arranged that a false
impression should go forth to the country that
California acquiesced In the -views of Secre
tary Taftâ hostile to the exclusion law.
TAFT AND MAYOR SCHMITZ.
To that end It was arranged that no speaker
should be present who would challenge the
utterances of Secretary Taft, and to that end
and for that purpefe those .who will, nom
inate the opponent of Mayor Schmltz designed
ly omitted to Invite Mayor Schmitz to be
present. alt'uniÃh ho had- been .present as
Mayor and as a speaker at all fl;^ public ban
quets tendered to President RSsÂ»te?v*lt uiÂ»cn
his visit to San Francisco, and had maintained
his position as the Chief Executive of the
city and as a speaker wiÂ»h dignity and con
summate ability. Mayor Schmltz was ex
cluded because it was well kitann that he
would take Issue publicly against any proposed
weakening of the exclusion laws, thereby
voicing the sentiments of the masses in Cali
fornia. The fame people who desired and ar
ranged to send forth a false impression of
the sentiment of California et that banquet
would everywhere proclaim to the country that
the defeat of Mayor Schmltz is an evidence
that California sentiment in favor of Chinese
exclusion has changed. -There same people,
largely of the commercial classes, who seek
to break down the exclusion laws, so as to
fill the land with cheap Chinese labor, set up
the claim that trÂ» ask questions of a Chinese
emigrant presenting a certificate, in order to
find out If it Is fraudulently h.M. i.Â« ,an "in
sult" and an "annoyance" not to be permitted.
These are the same people who are - ever
active In the strict enforcement of . the tariff
laws of tbe country and the exclusion of for
eign Roods neeklng ' unlawful entry. To this
end. In the enforcement of the tariff laws at
e\try custom-house, the trunks and parcels
of all passengers are opened by inspectors of
customs, and even- their soiled garments ex
posed, inepeclfd and made public, and at
many. If not all. custom-houses matrons are
provided, before whom ladies must disrobe
and be personally searched for, contraband
goods. This the merchants and manufacturers
demand and obtain Government to do' with
rmor.' as against all foreigners, and even as
aM<lnÂ»>t our own citizens. In order to uphold
protection by tariff, and yet when labor asks
for etrict enforcement of .laws lo exclude
coolie labor, and proper questions are asked
tJ detect fraud, these fame, merchants and
manufacturers denounce such effective enforce
ment-of law as an "Insult" and annoyance
"and harsh enforcement" of the laws to pro
tect labor. â¢ \u25a0
H.VKI^ ON YELLOW PERIL.
I'pon this Issue aÂ« here squart-ly presented
and now pressed upon the people of San
Francisco, we ask that the vote of every. citi
zen who would stem the tide of the advancing
yollow horde be given to Mayor Schmitz,
whoee defeat would be taken as a change; by
our people > upon the Chinese exclusion'ques
tion, wphlle his election will cause discom
fort to every conspirator, seeking by false- im
pi ' kf'.i ms to mislead the lawmakers, and the
administration at WaVblnjton.

REGARDING BOND ISSUE.
The city hits sold over $460,000 worth of
bonds recently authorized, Including $250,000
secured 'from the sale of bonds' for this pur
pose, almost all of which lies idle and unused
in the City Treasury, and upon which the tax
payers of this city art now paying some $161,
oCIo per annum interest
The delay end the refusal of the . dominant
majority of the Borad of Supervisors, because
of their political differences with the Mayor,
and their desire to Injure him In the eyes ot
the people of this. city. Is costing the citizens
of San Francisco, not only over Jlttl.OOO per
year In interest on unused bond moneys (over
$13,000 pÂ«x month), but Is even more costly
In ths failure to supply the much needed utili
ties and improvements for which j the bonds
were authorized. â¢ .
We denounce the political unfairness of said
majority of the Board of Supervisors In re
fusing to authorize the use of these moneys;
for the purpose for which they, were voted,
and also their hypocrisy and that of their po
litical associates- and. abettors in, seeking to
make 1% appear for- the purpose" of discrediting
the municipal administration that the bonds
of San Francisco cannot be sold, when ' as - a
matter of fact more have already been dls
rÂ«osed of than can bo advantageously and eco
nomically used at the present time. :
We hesitate to charge, although It may well
be nuspected, that the attempt to discredit the
name and fame of San Francisco may be due
i.ot only to 'politics" but also to a desire
on the part of the controlling financial inter
ests to deter prospective foreign investors from
purchasing and to secure for themselves ex
clusively the valuable and safe " bonds Issued
by the city of San Francisco, its only Indebted
res'*, and secured by the credit* and by the
name of the moat progressive, most substan
tial and richest cltv of the West. ; - - -;
AÂ« the security behind ? these - bonds Is bo
ample and safe, and as the city ;\u25a0 could not
avoid Its obligation even if It were possible,
that the moneys remitting from their sale
should be absolutely diverted from their origi
nal purpose by the Board of Supervisors, and
they alone have control of the expenditure
thereof, it is difficult to understand, even If It
were true, why capitalists who ; are seeking
Rood investments and are paying premiums
therefor should hesitate to buy the bonds
San Francisco, or. why the combination of poli
ticians and financiers who are seeking to gtvo
forth this false Impression should seek to have
this charred to the discredit of, the adminis
tration of Mayor Schmltz. especially when It
is remembered that one of the 'strongest" op
ponents of Mayor Schmitz,' . a . former . Mayor
himself, and president of one of our Important
savings Institutions, has not hesitated to invest
largf-ly in tuch bonds, thus disproving the very
arguments advanced In this connection by him
self and his zealous partisans and newspaper

that have been made upon me and upon

affected my -'- fellow-citizens : and ' my
friends, who, like yourself, have fol
lowed closely/rmy;; public -career ; and
have convinced themselves; not only of

also of my integrity and honesty of ac
tion. Notwithstanding tne purchased
and subsidized libels of the' several

to disintegrate the labor movement of

QUESTIOX OP PRIXCIPI.E.
-As I stand here to-night 1 feel -that
I have a. greater task before me than
ever before. Not that I believe that I
shall have more votes to. overcome, but
because I realize that. in the election to
be held on November 7 it will not be
so much a question of men 7 as a ques
tion of great- principle; a question
whether the labor organizations of the
city shall continue to -grow "and pros
per, and with them the entire com
munity;, whether the conditions of San
Francisco are to continue prosperous
and peaceful ; whether the : friendly re
lations that exist at the, present time
between the employer, and employe are
to. continue;, whether the officials of the
Citizens' Alliance shall control the dif
ferent offices of the- city ;government
and thereby, be. placed behind those of
ficials in a position powerfully * lnr
trenched with a view to -' disrupting
existing conditions. It is a question
whether the officials of "that alliance
can by the corrupt use of men and
money, by the blackmailing assistance
of a prostituted journalism* so Influence
the public mind that the great principle,
of the equality of all men before tfie"
law, the great Issue of equal rights to
all, whether employer or employe, can
be so obscured as to cause men most
affected to vote against their own in
terests. . ' \u25a0
SAYS MOTIVES ARE PUKE.
; It is further a question .whether. an
honest man, honestly endeavoring' to
do his whole duty, to 'the people without
fear or favor, can be driven out of pub
lic life by the foul and false defamation
purchased at so much a line; of
rupt newspaper proprietors. whose past
reeks with Indecency; . t whose' present' Is
illustrative , of everji immoral and coni
merclalvlce of thSiday" and whose Isole
divinity is the sign; of the dollar, .or
whether, supported only t by the f confi-
annum can be effected and the money thu*
saved devoted to permanent improvements.
IN FAVOR OF ARBITRATION.
We favor arbitration of all, industrial uln
putrs. so far as the same may be Just and prac
ticable.
â¢ We favor the peaceful settlement of. all dif
ferences between employer* >an<i employe." .'
We approve the civil srvlce system of public
appointments as provided In our charter. The
Police and Fire departments shall be adminis
tered and conducted strictly In accordance with
the law,- insuring the same, protect lon, to all. ,
Believing that : the 1 poll tax system now In
existence unjustly discriminates against the
poor man. inasmuch' ae he pays a larger |.-Â«:r
eentage in proportion to his. means and incomo
than his wealthy neighbor,' -we favor tho abol!-,
tlon of this unequal tax.
.. We. favor absolute home, rule for the city

nominees and our party to work to that end. v
The Intrrfertnce by the Legislature with the'
Internal affairs of Ban: rranclsco, , notwith
standing the charter. Is existing our city much
money and Ifi encroaching upon her rights of
self-government.. .;
,We favor a constitutional amendment, . which
shall make it Impossible^ for State - boards of
equalization arbitrarily, to raise the assessment
of this city, already overassessed, especially
as regards Its. smaller property holders.
'We also favor eui-h changes In the laws as
will place . the water front of San Francisco
under the control of the municipal government,',
so that, the. 'administration of the water front
may be conducted more with a view to the
commercial, advancement 'and prosperity of the
city than as an asylum 'for the political refu

Greater amounts of business pass through

existed prior to this administration?
You ,all, remember .I the teamsters*

tion of . their common interest. You all
remember how in that strike the police
were forced to act as teamsters: you all
remember how the rights of the wage
worker were disregarded In the interests
of the ' Employers', Association .and all
those who .were trying 'to grind the wage
earner down to the lowest vjevel. During
the ; past four years, naturally, we have
had some disputes, and â¢ we have had
some strikes. â¢ . .
I do not wish to mention the first
carmen's strike or the strikes which pre
ceded the past two years of my adminis
tration, but I may be permitted to men
tion here one which at the 'present tine
no newspaper alludes to, namely, the
contemplated strike of the carmen a year
ago last May.
â¢ SWS lIE STOPPED STRIKE.
Had that strike taken place San Fran
cisco would have been put back at least
ten years. But it didn't take place, and
why? Because/realizing that the car
men had confidence in me. I was able
to postpone action for three days, until
I could^ get into communication with the
United Railroads, and after three days
of deliberation with the offlctala of that
companyâ notwithstanding that these
very same newspapers which are attack
ing me did everything to Incite the men
to strike, making statements that I was
holding no conference, and that I was
fooling themâ an agreement was drawn
up Â«that was unanimously accepted ,by
both sides, of the controversy, and with
such satisfaction that' last May it was
signed for two years longer Instead of
for one.
'And so, gentlemen of the convention,
I have gone along In my official life
not trvlng like the officers of the Citi
zens' Alliance to stir up strife and dis
content, as they did a short time ago
TTith the printers." but trying to bring
about a, better feeling and a better
understanding between the wage
earner and his employer. And my ef
forts, as results here show, have been
successful. Should these things not be
taken Into serious consideration?
Should they not have some weight
with the people whose property, pros
perity and , well-being are involved?
Believing that the prosperity and ad
vancement of the city of San Francisco
â my native city â depend upon the
prosperous and . peaceful condition of
the wage .earner and upon the har
monious feeling which, exists between
the workingmen and those who employ
them. I certainly believe they should.
ADVICE TO CONVENTION.
I hope, gentlemen of the convention,
that you will: exercise great care to
1Â»11 the different offices: that you will
select men who -have the confidence not
only of the wage earners but thÂ© entira
population of San â¢ Francisco. If you
do that I â¢' am -convinced .that your en
tire ticket will bei successful i at -tha
coming election. ... â¢ .> .- \u25a0 .
Let me ' call- -' your attention to an
other point. I find upon investigation
that there are from 25,000 to 30,000
wage earners on the rolls of labor
unions alone who have not registared,
I ask you one and all when you return
to the different sections of the city
which you represent that you will do
all in your power to get those who
have not registered to go immediately
to the" City Hall so that on November
7 they can record their votes in favor
of the nominees of the Union Labor
party ticket.
I thank you again from the bottom
of my heart for this nomination, which
I have taken as an earnest of your
confidence In me. and it shall be my
sincere endeavor In ' the future, as tt
has been in the- past, to show by my
acts rather than by my words that I
do appreciate that confidence placed in
me. that I do In some small measure
deserve it. And let me again express
the assurance that when the votes are
counted on next election it will be
heralded forth again to trie entire world
that the Citizens' Alliance and Herbert
GeorKe. its representative, with all Its
capital .and the subsidized press behind
It. have been defeated by the wage
earners of San Francisco.- who. standing
shoulder to shoulder, march to the polls
and cast their votes as one man In the
Interests of the principles which
stand- for the interests â¢of peace and
prosperity in this beautiful city of

SICK AND DYING
FAR FROM HOME
Nicholas Luning, Who
Eloped With Oakland Girl,
Said to Be 111 in Seattle
FRIENDS CARE FOR HIM
Father of Young Wife De
clares He Knows Nothing'
of Son-in-Law's Sickness
Special Diepatch to Tbe Call
SEATTLE, Aug. 31. â An outcast from
home Nicholas T. Luning, son of a San
Francisco millionaire HÂ«" In a little
boarding-housa room In the middle
stages of consumption. To-day he broke
flown in the office of John Davis & Co..
where he has been working and his em
ployers sent him to his rooms. Strang
ers did for the boy to-day what his fath
er has refused because he married pret
ty Ethel Haas of Oakland against his
parent's will.
For the last year young Luning has
been working as bookkeeper at a desk In
the Davis office. The change from a
boy of leisure to a worker has told on
his constitution, never too strong,- and
he is now in a serious condition. A
physician is in attendance and says he
probably will never be able to work
again.
It Is Ju6t a year since Luning defied
his father and eloped with Miss Haas,
who is the stepdaughter of an Oakland
attorney. He came to Seattle with his
young wife, but the pampered son was
unfitted to combat with the world. He
was some months ago given a Job by the
manager of the John Davis Real Estate
Company tacking up signs on vacant
property. He soon earned promotion to
bookkeeper and has earned a bare liv
ing for himself and wife without com :
plaining.
The couple are without means, but
are being well cared for and the best
medical attention is being furnished.
OAKLAND. Aug. 31. â When informed
to-night that Nicholas Luning Jr. was
at the point of death in Seattle, Attorney
Fred L. Button, the stepfather of Sirs.
Nicholas Lunins Jr., expressed great sur
prise. He said he had received a let
ter from Mrs. Luning two days ago,
telling him of attending several . social
events they had attended, but making no
mention of any illness of her husband. A
postscript in Luning's handwriting also
failed to -make any mention of sickness.
Attorney Button said to-night that
eince the couple had been in tbe north
Luning's health had not been of the
best, but that he had suffered no illness
cf such a nature as to keep him from
attending regularly to business.
The elopement and secret marriage of
the young couple caused a sensation In
local society, and this was not abated
when Oscar Luning. the millionaire
father *>f the groom, declared that as
his son had married against his wishes,
he would never forgive, nor acknowledge
him as a son. Later, however, the dif
ficulty was smoothed over.
Nicholas Luning and Miss Ethel Haas
were married in Sacramento on June S,
ir<o4, and the first intimation of the se
cret wedding came when the respective
parents of the bride and groom received
telegrams announcing the marriage.

GENERAL SUMNER
'FILES HIS KEPORT
Calls Attention to the Many
Desertions From the
Pacific Division.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 31.â 1n his an
nual report for the last fiscal year,
Major General S. Sumner. command-
Ing the Pacific division, makes the fol
lowing recommendations, in case It
shall be deemed advisable to retain the
post school for enlisted men other than
non-commissioned officers, upon the ex
istiirEc common school basis:
First, that It be precisely determined at once
whether tbe Idea 1b to conserve as a primary
object the scholastic Interests of the less or
better educated man and the school, system bo
definitely planned accordingly. ."
Second, whether attendance shall be volun
tary or not, and that the principle that shall
determine attendance shall be precisely settled
that this source of doubt be removed.
General Sumner states that the sta
tistics show that there were In the De
partment of California and the Depart
ment of the Columbia 933 and 595 de
sertions respectively, or about 14 M per
cent of the average enlisted strength
in the Department of California and
14 per cent in the Department of th>e
Columbia.
The causes assigned were generally
as indeterminable as In past years;
when the cause of each desertion was
made a matter of special Investiga
tion.
In regard to the absence of. officers
Trom their command General Sumner
says that retired officers should be as
signed to duty In schools and with
militia as a measure of relief to the
active list. . ; "'

STAR IS FOUND
Talented Woman Astrono

tory Is Discoverer of Novae
RAPIDLY;; FADING AWAY
Photographs Taken Recently

Disappearing ; From Sky
Special Dispatch to Thn Call.
Cambridge; Mass., Aug. 31:â Mrs. w.
P. Fleming, a italented: astronomer; at
Harvard Observatory; -while : examining
negatives recently, 'taken, discovered ; a
new star of the transient variety/known
to astronomers as': the; Novae. .Since 1572,
when the first^of such'stars , was discov
ered by Tycho" Brahe.'only fourteen have
been, discovered, ' eight o< which "..'. were
found by Mrs. Fleming." *â¢ Mrs.'. Fleming,
who is pursulng_her researches under -the
terms of the Henry Draper [ memorial ? .to
Harvard, was to-day, examining photo
graphs and spectra, taken inlthe region
of the constellation Aquila oh August 18
of this year, when* she discovered - five
bright and broad lines In the spectrum;
Euch as are peculiar to the ' Novae.
She immediately referred ; to . photo
graphs of the region taken both before
and after that date and found that. a pho
tograph of the region taken on August
10 showed the stars of .the tenth magni
tude with no indication of the Novae.
The negative of August 18 -showed a star
of the magnitude of 6:05 which would be
just visible to the naked eye. The nega
tive of August 21 shows the star to
be one magnitude fainter and the nega
tive of August 26 shows a star of the
tenth magnitude. Other negatives show
ed a rapid fading out of existence of the
star. On' August 15 a' plate . was exposed
at the observatory at; Arequlpa, Peru,
with the Bruce telescope for four hours
and It showed stars of the sixteenth mag
nitude, but revealed no s object that can
with certainty be Identified with the No
vae. . '
As Mrs. Fleming In 1899 . discovered a
Novae in the, constellation of Aquila, the
star discovered to-day will be, named
Novae Aquilae 2d. Recent discoveries
of Novae were those of Dt. Anderson ' of
Scotland In 1901 and of Professor Turner
In 1903.
The Novae have all been discovered in
the Milky Way -
The exact position of the new star is
(1900) ' right ascension, 15 hours 5&9 min
utes: declination, 4 hours 34 minutes.
It precedes the bright star Lambda Apl
lae west 4 minutes, north 28 minutes.
The negatives were taken with an eleven
inch telescope.

ducts from Missouri Riverv points to
| California terminals , was for about one
year after January l, 1890, a-differ
ential of 9 cents against corn products.
Then for about one and. a half 'years
it '.was 9 cents in favor of corn products.
The rates were the samp' between July,
1892, and March, 1895,. when a-differen
tial of , 5 cents against corn products
was established. In December, : 1837,
the differential was increased :to 10
"cents and in July, 1802, it was made2o
cents. During March, ; 1904, the dif
fential was fixed at 17% cents and in
October of that year it . was reduced to
10 cents and has since remained at that
figure. BÂ£Â£BgSÂ§

OAKLAND THUG ADORNS FIANCEE
James Crowhurst Places Uppn Einger of
Miss Quigley Mrs. Bauton' s Diamond. !
OAKLAND, Aug. 31.â When Miss Vir
ginia Quigley. pretty Alameda girl,, who
was engaged to James Crowhurst~the
leader of the gang of young thugs, now
in jail awaiting trial for the murder of
Thomas \V. Cook, promised to become
the wife of the youthful thug she did
not dream that the handsome diamond
ring he placed upon, her linger^ as-, a
token of their engagement was part of
the .spoils* of a .daring daylight bur
glary, committed less" than three hours
before, but such was the fact. The
ring, had been stolen from the house of
N\ J. ." Bauton at 1190 East Twenty-firfJt
i street, and was the "property. of his
i -wife,' Mrs. Llzzetta Bauton,' "who had
*left.the diamond ring jn;hei\je\vel. box
while the : family was absent for: .the
day. - . v v \u25a0'-, '" \u25a0'. I-*"" '\u25a0 '' <~ \u25a0â¢'..
\u25a0' The Bauton residence, is next door to
that of the Crowhurst. family, who re-;
side at 1192 East Twenty-first street.
When Ba.utoii and h.s wife returned in
the evening from attending an Admis
sion day celebration they found that
the house had " been entered through
the kitchen door. Mrs. Bau ton's ring,
which had been left in a jewel box in
her room, was gone.
Although they knew that James
Crowhurst had a bad reputation in the
neighborhood, Bauton and his wife
never suspected him of being the man
who had committed the daring crime,
and not until she read the story of the
gift of a diamond ring to Miss Quigley
by Crowhurst, which was published ex
clusively in The Call on August 6, -did
Mrs. Bauton. realize the identity of the
burglar. m As soon as she had read the
account "of Crowhurst's gift td Miss
Quigley.she went to Alanxeda and asked
the latter for a description of. the ring,
and by a peculiar mark which, the girl
hadÂ» noticed on It Mrs. "Bauton knew
that the ring was the same which had
been- stolen from her home.
She was too late, however, to recover
the diamond, for Miss Quigley had'al
ready returned the ring to Crowhurst
and the latter had disposed of it at- a
pawnshop. Mrs. Bauton then reported
the matter to Sheriff Barnet and she
said to-day that when the latter taxed
Crowhurst with the crime he confessed
that 'he had entered the Bauton hpuse
and said he had sold the ring to a
pawnbroker in San Franclpco for '$l&j
Mrs. Bauton went to the pawnbroker -in
question, only to find that the ring had
already^ been. sold. The pawnbroker
said that he would do. his best to lo
cate the ring, and. as Mrs. Bauton did
not .wish to cause any trouble for the
broker, whom she believes innopent;'of
any guilt in the purcase. she has- not
taken any action against him to recover
the value of the jewel. _ * .

he did not disclose | them, preferring

PARDEE'S PROTEST
MEETS APPROVAL
Plan of Judging Exhibits
at Portland . Fair Is
Not Satisf actory^

Pardee's earnest protest to the Lewis and
Clark fair authorities as ; commissioner
from California, voices the unanimous po
sition taken â¢\u25a0 by i all \u25a0\u25a0 State commissioners
that -the plan of judging exhibits decided
upon : by. ; the - fair lis not satisfactory. In
fact orders have been given by the com
missioners = to the various exhibitors- in
the state buildings not to follow instruc
tions . from 3 the fair authorities to send
three samples of each entry for award to
the administration building, these to be
acted upon by the judges. Commission
ers [ who have attended other world's fairs
say,' the m.ethod proposed is open to criti
cism on so' many grounds and has proved
in the past, so unsatisfactory that it" Is
not fair to. expect exhibitors to submit to
lt'at this time. At Omahaand Buffalo
the" sample method : was tried and great
dissatisfaction resulted.; At" St/ Louis the
judges j viewed the exhibits' where* 'they
w-ere Installed on the grounds) there were
no 'star chamber 'sessions and ' legitimate
complaints were few. v'â ' /7 * " "
fit Is' alleged' that when' samples are sent
away from "exhibits," to be passed upoiiby
judges in ' private; "many of the samples
disappear' entirely and' are 1 not' jjj passed
upon aa to' their, merits* Then aeain.Tit

COULD AWARDS
BIG CONTRACT
Salt Lake Construction Com
pany Will Build Nearly
All of Western Pacific
COAST FIRM TO ASSIST
Colorado Fuel and Iron Com
pany Will Supply Bulk
of Material for New Line
Although the local representatives of the
Western Pacific Railroad stiir persist in
their- reticence regarding the :â¢' award of
contracts for the construction of the new
road, it v/as learned yesterday ' that" an
award for the greater portion of the work
has already been made to the Utah Con
struction Company oC. Salt Lake < City,
which built a part of the Clark road; The
award, which covers the most difficult
portions of the -proposed road, was: set
tled upon two weeks ago in New York,'
but secrecy was maintained 'until the re
turn | from abroad of George ' Gould sev
eral days ago. Briefly,' the Utah company
Is to construct the entire road,, with the
exception of a section of about 150 miles
between Deese, Nevada, and .the: Nevad
a State line. In. other words the com
pany is to -build from Salt Lake City to
the Utah State, line, a . distance of 110
miles, Deese to Orovllle, about 610 miles,
and from Oroville to Niles, 72 miles. "AVhy
no award for the work on the section be
tween Deese and the Utah .State line has
not been made'is a matter that no one
here will explain. . â¢ ,
DIFFICULTIES TO OVERCOME.
The mest difficult part of the road to
construct will be between Nlles and Oro
ville, especially that part of it lying be
tween Niles and Tesla, designated on the
engineer's profiles as division No. 1,
where at least four tunnels are to be
built, one of them in Niles Canyon, about
4000 feet long. In the second division, be
tween Stockton and Oroville, swamps and
timber forests will . be trestled and ', cut
away. The mountainous territory of the
road lies in*, the 'third division. In the
FeatheV River Canyon, where eight or ten
tunnels will be built.' From Deese to the
Utah State line, the heaviest work will be
concrete and masonry. It was stated last
night on good authority that the work on
.the division between Oroville and : Niles
will be sublet to the Pacific Construction
Company, composed of Portland and local
people and several prominent stockholders
in the Utah' Construction Company.' It is
expected that the contract for the work
between Deese and the Utah . State line
will be awarded during the coming week.
KOAD WELL FI.YANCED.
It Is estimated that it will take sev
eral month"? to start the, "work ot" con
struction, for it wijl need that much time
for the contractors to sublet the. grading
work arid lay, out their camps, and ar
range for the proper care of their men.
Three years will probably not witness the
completion of the entire road between
Salt Lake City and Oakland, but by that
time it is most likely that portions of
the road, particularly the, -eastern ard
western ends, will . t>e finished for sev
eral hundred miles and the company will
be operating trains for revenue. In mod
ern railroad ' building- It is the practice
to begin operating sections of the - road
before it is wholly completed, , so that, a
part of the expense of construction- may
be earned before the cntire.,route is. open
for regular traffic. This course was pur
sued in the building of; tlie Salt Lake
.road and netted the Harriman-Clark syn
.dicate a handsome revenue before a ser
vice" f f om Salt Lake to Los Angeles was
inaugurated.
The 'recent statement of George Gould
that the sale of the $50,000,000 bonds -of
the Western Pacific had furnished; the
promoters of the road more than suffic

CHICAGO'S PUBLIC OWNERSHIP.
MAYOR DUNNE.'Â£' municipal ownership, programme for the
street railways -o.f. Chicago seems to' be suffering from a
case* of suspended animation. Shortly . after ; his , election
'â¢Public Policy," a publication- tha^ gives the .most reliable analysis
of ail public questions, said, ''Chicago will not have municipal own
ership and operation of street railways,, now, or ever. That seems
to have been said out of a profound knowledge of the situation.-
Municipal ownership of public utilities is -not- -a new policy m
Chicago. That city has long been the owner and purveyor of the
(water supply. About, the time -of Mr. Dalrymple's visit, to" offer
to the Mayor advice as to the street raijways, air actuary made a
report on the city management . of the water supply, showing that
,75 per cent of the water pumped is wasted, and yields no return,
to the city. Now comes the Chicago Tribune, saying:
'There is a water famine * in- Pullman, West Pullman, Kensing.
ion and Roseland. ' Four or five" thousand families are about as
badly oft for water as if they lived in the desert of Sahara. They
are accustomed to 'droughty periods, when the water. does not run
above the first floor. This year it runs from" no faucets. Beqause
of the lack of water the owners of- factories in the dry, districts are
being notified that their, insurance policies will be canceled unless,
they take steps to protect themselves by sinking wells, or in some
other way. Suffering citizens visit' the City Hall and beg for water.
They are" obliged to pay' their water rates- in' advance- and they do
not "think it fair that they should not be given what they pay for.
When the patron of the nickel in the slot. telephone cannot get his
. connection he gets his nickel back. Not a nickel does the city pay
in' the waysof rebate or refund when it. has failed to live tip .to its
contract :'to a 'customer with -water: The thirsty and un
washed citizens of -the Thirty-third Ward are told to have patience
and that there is a good time jcoming.r- They are informed that some
day there Avill be water enough in their part of the city to submerge
j t _L wÃenw Ren they are crurtibled to dust. To-day, when they are alive,
â¢hot. thirsty and need water, they cannot ha" ye it: "
"The "first complaints came from the Thirty-third: Ward over
four years ago. They have.. been renewed annually and the- same
answer ha? always come from the City Hall: 'We can do nothing
for you no\\> but wait 'a few, years.' If a private corporation owned
- the water works .there would be a general popular outcry. The
incompetency and the indifference to the public welfare of that -tyran
nical corporation' and- 'bloated monopoly' would be denounced by
everybody. 'There would be a demand for municipalownership of
the water Works, that all the people might have all the water they
wanted, at extremely low rates. We have- municipal ownership and
operation of the .water works, .and yet thousands of families .have
no water.. It is the incompetency of a .municipal and not a private
corporation that puts them in such a 'plight/ The incompetency is
the more glaring because the water department has long known that
75 per cent of the water pumped is -wasted, fit has failed -to stop
the wastage so there might be water for the waterless. Ask the busi
ness men and housekeepers, of Pullman and Kensington, who are
familiar with the municipal operation of water work's, what their
"opinion js. of the municipal operation of street car lines, gas plants-,
etc., arid they will â¢ give it plainly. .. When they think of the dry
faucets and ineffective water- mains they have no longings for an

â¢* h It would seem that Mayor Dunne should 'first demonstrate "the
.capacity^of municipal operation to make the water supply efficient
and sufficient before .branching out into street" railways. The oper
ation of water works is simplicity' itself compared with the complex
business of street railroading. In the ownership and operation of
water works the municipality is set over few things, and if these
cannot bejlone. well, why try to take over many things, all to be
done badly? V-
There, is rro fad like' a political fad. Public ownership is a po-.
litical fad. tÃyt By using it Mayor Dunne was elected Mayor. He seems
not to be a practicaj man or he would drop the discussion of munici
pal street railways 4nd see "that Chicago water is made first pure arid
then plentiful. . â¢' \u25a0 .
The conditions revealed by the Tribune are those which we
said would attract the attention of Mr. Dalrymple, as differing
widely from conditions in Glasgow. He seems to have had the
skill and' patience to investigate them, and they controlled his con T
elusions. It is the opinion of Charles Francis Adams that munici
pal ownership arid control, putcunder expert examination and audit",
will, in all American cities of great -population, show the infirmities
that are found oppressive by thousands of waterless people in
Chicago. . ' * \u25a0 * . . ; ' '
A CHINESE PARLIAMENT.
WISE TSI' AN, the Empress Dowager and actual ruler of
China, is indeed in the new' woman classi'She has perfected
'arrangements for- parliamentary "government in her empire.
She allows. twelve years for preparation. During that time Chinese
students are. to be sent to the United States,. England, France aad
other nations that have representative government. These ' are to
be educated 'after the Occidental system and are to be especially
trained in civics: Their number is to be large enough to provide
a force of trained parliamentarians, who will become the first lead
ers in Chinese representative government. â¢ ;
This is a 'movement that, should have the greatest encourage
ment and support in; this country. Our State Department. may! well
undertake the work V3f inviting these student's, here' in large num
bers, and of placing them advantageously in our ; universities. . We
have seen in Wu Ting "Fang, King Owyang " and cther v university
Chin esec educated in this country. and England. the excellent intel
lectual capacity and power of assimilation of that interesting race.
The young men trained in our schools and colleges, ! returning to
take up the duty of installing representative institutions \ in; that old
empire, will remember their training and make the United States
their model and example. -. .. â¢
This move of Tsi An follows other changes she- has made
which place her in the list of the great! rulers, of the world. She
ended the exclusiveness of the ruling Manchus, compelled them to
â¢ take Chinese 'wives, and to send.'their sons! abroad for education.
Before .that; they scorned' intermarriage with the Chinese, and did
not permit their "sons to go abroad at all. Tsi An next, by "a decree,
ppt an end to the ensmalling of the feet of Chinese wonien. Mrs.
Wu, wife of the former Chinese Minister to \Vashingtoh| took: ad^

it is all the more to. her credit that at hef~age : she put! "these '\u25a0\u25a0as'ide;

THE, SAN: FRANGISGO CALL, FRIDAYo SEPTEMBER 1, 1905.
DRINK CURDLED
MILK AND HAVE
A LONG LIFE
T is the opinion of Professor Metchni
koff, â¢ an eminent < Russian scientist,
that the middle age of man should be
about ; eighty ; years - instead ;of forty,
and that; his allotted span of â¢ life," instead
of being -three score and ten circles of
the seasons should be seven score. Pro
fessor : Mctchnikoff ': has not only ' pro
pounded lengthening of - lif e"as > the
ory; but has suggested a method whereby
he believes it may be accomplished. ,This
way is to drink a certain :kind of curdled
milk. . He himself \u25a0: do<?s . it. ;. .
Professor Metchnikoff's . theory is set
down in the current number of X^Olure's
Magazine. It is that age," or physical evi
dence of it, is disease,' : a _ result of the
ravages of certain forms of : bacteria. The
secret . of ; prolonged life, therefore, . has
been to find beneficent germs > to combat
and^overcome these : of murderous \u25a0 ten
dency. The glory of Professor Metchni
koff is to have^ discovered the" purpose of
\u25a0 the white corpuscles- in 'the -blood.; .': The
red distribute oxygen,, as was \u25a0'-:. believed
long ago;" the white,* it seems,: are "the
army, of defense of the body politic." : f j
Under normal conditions "they inter
vene for the protection of .the : organism
in the case alike of ; a" razor ; BcratchVor 0 a
stroke of apoplexy." "If," to* quote from
the . McClure article, "you have run a
pin into your ' thumb or received ' a bayo
net thrusfat Port Arthur, precisely the
f same thing takes place/ .A myriad of
these tiny first aid cells ' f roni ' surround
ing; blood vessels and sympathetic lym
phatic glands come hurrying to the res
cue. They begin to clean up whatever
wreck there has been ; made, in.the.skin
and , muscular tis-sue.' Tlaey eagerly ab
sorb into themselves or cluster, oppbsingly'
about all foreign matter that has: been
introduced into tne wound. Then they
proceed to plie themselves tier, upon;. tier
around it- like bo many little hand bags
about a broken bastion. -Later they
gradually join .together and solidify into
the layer of new skin which Vappears.
".Finally Professor "Metchriikoff'S' later
researches have shown that .there is every
evidence that it is possible so to j avail
ourselves of our knowledge* of the strug
gle between microbes', and phagocytes as
to be able â¢to arm the body : for a great
length of time against old age itself, for
age is only a disease.".
Coming to the question of a remedy
the article sets forth that the microbe
which causes milk to turn sour is ' most
efficient. . ; .
"Most famous among Europeans for
longevity," to quote again, "are the Bul
garian mountaineers. They, are also rioted
for their custom of consuming great
quantities of sour milk.
"The. germ of the ferment which is
used to curdle milk in Bulgaria differs
from the ordinary microbe of sour milk
only in so much as it is larger. and: more
powerful. The 'Yagburt" or 'Kefflr, 1
w^iich has of ? late been prepared under
conditions of scientiflc purity, has been
placed on sale in Paris." .

A tidy, old .woman, Vwhosei short, black skirt showed, several inches of

for safe keeping, she had tucked 1 into her stocking.

TOM LAWSON'S DOUBLE OF OKLAHOMA
Cleverly Deceives the Editor of a New- York
Financial: vJourrial. , â¢ . s
OKLAHOMA has never produced a
Thomas W.- Lawson,' but one of ,
V its citizens bears such resem-j
blance in manner arid appearance to j
the author of Frenzrbd Finance that
men Avho know Lawson often speak j
of this .similarity to his Oklahoma j
counterpart. M.-L. Turner, president of j
the National. Bank, "says the j
Oklahoma City correspondent of the (
Kansas City Star. â¢ Oklahomans who j
know Turner and have seen only pic- |
tures of Lawson declare that the re- j
semblance is striking. Like Lawson, |
Turner is a, financier, and a man :ot
ceaseless activity. In his waking
hours no one ever saw Turner in re- I
pose. 'His energy is tremendous. His
mind and body , are always, at "work, |
and men of less, strenuous tempera- |
ment grow fatigued in , following his
ceaseless conversation and'r quick, agile i
movements. He "seems' always under
high pressure, too high for \u25a0 an aver
age nervous system. , Turner, \u25a0 however,
conserves his energy by: sleeping from
nine to eleven hours outof! the twen
ty four,. r and |smoking only -light ' five
cent cigars. His cigars ; are j the ) abom
ination of friends who,; prefer; strong
er tobacco. He stuffs their pockets
with them and pleads the : virtues of
mild: tobacco. He is a 'steady Â° smoker."

IN EXFLANATION.
"Speaking of the intelligence of dumb
creatures," observed the long-haired
man, "my Uncle George has a- hen that
never lays an egg on Sunday at .any sea
son of the year."
. This statement aroused his hearers at
once. "You don't expect us to believe
that?" said the man with the pointed
beard. " .
"It's the solemn truth," rejoiced thÂ«
other. "I can testify to it from my own
personal; knowledge, and can prove It by
every member of my Uncle's â¢family."
"It doesn't ; seem absolutely " impossible
to me," ' said another man. "Some ani
mals can 5 count. This has been proved in
â¢the case ; of ' oxen that are used in cer
tain foreign, countries.as the motive pow
"er . for primitive : mills or irrigation ma
chinery. They are driven a' hundred times â¢
round a circular track, and then, allowed
to " rest. ~Af ter a . few months the oxen
will -stop at the .hundredth revolution or
their own accord. . The only possible ex
planation of this: is" that the animals can
count a hundred. But how can a hen,
even . though she may learn to count
seven easily enough, "grasp the Idea that
it was- wrong to lay an egg on Sunday?
That is the only- feature of the case that
I can't understand. What Is your ex
planation of it?"
"Well," replied the long-haired man,
as he made for the door, '-'the only reason
.lean offer why the old hen never lays
any >gg on Sunday is that ahe never lays
an egg on any other day of the week, and

to the Justices' Court.
Benjamin Morales of 34 Broadway
pleaded as h|s reason for falling to
feed and clothie his careworn-looking
wife that she was a "masher."
."\u25a0'Taih't so," Mrs. Morales .retorted.
"You're â¢ so jealous that every time I
look at a maiij on" the street you Imag
ine J'm flirting with him." "
Judge Mogan hinted to* Mr. Morales

Leroy Vaughan argued him
self out of Judge Mogan's court. He was
abed early Wednesday evening in an
apartment hoise on Pacific street when
Patrolman J. Lycett arrested him as a
vagrant. ; . .
"Dls yah oSfK&b mus" sholj* be crazy,
Jedge." pleaded Mr. Vaughan, with in
tfnse earnestness of delivery. "En <le
fus' place," 'e; pinches me while Ise.'en
baid. â¢ Now. . ief , Ise eh vag, Ah wudn't
hey no baid t;eh sleep in, wud I? Ah'd
be a-?noozln'iÂ«n a box-cah er walkln'
de street. wui3n'Â£ I?"
"I have seen him walk the street all
night In company, with a colored
woman," the policeman put in. â¢
."Be keehfuT wot ye say 'bout dan
lady," said â¢ Mr. . Vaughan -warningly.
"Ah'd hey yo- teh know dat she's
'gaged teh me en 'casionally comes
from Oakland teh see: me.' She doan
come en de djaytlme 'kase she wuks all
day, en w'en she comes obah en de
evenln' we walks en talks es lovahs
will till she j sometimes niisses de las'
boat. Den we walks en talks till de
fus' boat de' nex' day teks 'er back
'cross de bay. Folks oughtah . *be
mighty keeMul how dey scusses de
goin's en comin's of a 'gaged lady."
Mr. Vaughan gazed reprovingly at
his. accuser /until . the latter declared
that he (Mr. Vaughan) had.no visible
means of sustenance. -
"Dats anuddah ve'y rash statement,"
was the prompt response. â¢ "Ef v yo'd
'qulab you'd find out dat ah. shines
shoes at 1405 Poke street."
"But you'rfe always loafing- at . nlg-ht
on Pacific street," ventured the offi jer.
"No, sah; not- loaflnV â¢ Yo' may:'ca
sionally see me on de street, but de
objec' ob mail visits to datrpaht ob
town is to rehea'se fo' a minstrel show
which I'se g^wine on de road wif Jes'as
soon as wese ready to pe'fo'm, en pub
lic./ Sam King kin \u25a0 tell jou 1 all 'bout
dat, fo' he's backin'de- show."
Thus did Mr. Vaughan plausibly meet
every additional accusation tending to
prove him a vagrant, . and finally the
Judge told him. to depart.
Denis McCarthy, arrested by j Patrol
man George Graham, for begging, on
Van Ness avenue, thanked Judge Frlta
for giving ,him,three ; months. '?;"\u25a0.;
. "I'm glad; you socked it to â¢. me,
Judge," he said, "for if you hadn't! l'm
sure that pop .would, die of dyspepsy."
Robert "Woodside ..was; removing his
household - effects V from a cottage in
the .100 block of -Howard; street when
ho missed some articles which he had
placed upon the sidewalk; and then ; he
accused Mrs. Bertha Gordon, keeper; of

' When the Si washes bring home victory
they hayÂ« to play some baseball. That
was ehown yesterday afternoon, for the
tame was *nÂ«f theirs till the.' fifteenth
lunlngj when Max Muller's single' to the
right carden' brought Roach home with,
the tally, that ; netted Seattle, tho first vic
tory In eight 'games. Both teams played
h\g league ball and the game was' simply
one sensation on i^p of another.
Big Skel Hoach opened up the fifteenth
with a scratchy one out to right that got
away from Spencer and went for 'two
bags. Walters was -there with the big
sacrifice, and Muller, who was signed for
a few days to take the place of invalid
Hart, came throuch with a drive past
second, breaking* up the game.
So, good was the play on both sides
that only one little error marred tlie
otherwise^ perfect work. This was made
by Blar.k'enship â¢ iri * the ninth "when he
threw the ball away at secend in an
attempt^ to t CÃtch Jimmy Whalen stealing.
Russ Hall had 'fourteen chances and
most of them were hard". He got away
with everv'one, while LÂ»ittl6 "â¢ Kane and
lrwln were Mgbt behind* him in the star
work <Jf â¢ eating up fast ones. .
Jimmy Whalen was the shutout kid till
the sixth inning, when "he became bad
.and^, the Slwashes managed to sneak two
runs over on him. He passed Muller and
hit Kane. The' next' two men fell by
the. wayside, but Ruiikle, bit off a Texas
Leaguer to short center., after two strikes
and three balls had been fcalied on him.
This let Muller and Kane come through
with the only runs the Slwashes conld
negotiate till the fatal fifteenth."
The Seals landed for their first ' one In
the fifth. Wilson ', bit off a double and
arrived when Jlohler repeated this stunt.
.In the sixth, it became a deadlock. â¢ Ir
win Shoved one thro-gh the infleld and
Nealcn advanced him on an out. Goch
nauer laid up against a s slow one and.sent
it out to de^i) center, while Irwin raced
safely 'home. Â«
Thtn the battle comrornced* In .earnest.
Both teams began to play baseball "and
never # overlooked .ariy 'hard or easy
chances. Jt was nip and tuc,k and : flre
away for* a fair-ye-well all along the
line. Time and time again the game
eeexned lost to one side or the other*
tut a gx<>at piece of nelding.or an equally
clevej l bit of work on the .part of the
pitchers invariably kept the run away
from the pan. rVi.
The game was surely 'caved by Hall
end Kane for the Slwashes 'in the"
twelfth. Waldron had dispatched a twp
cushioner out to the flagpole. Mohler
Bent a torrid one at Kane, but the little
third baseman was there and ate It up"
in a twinkling. All the fans "swore the
game was settled when Hildebran'd lined
one that was true blue and labeled "safe"
at Hall. The Siwash leader took care
of this one and Hildebrand was also re
tired, though the play at the first bag
was dose. *
The Siwashea then had their : chance
a.nd It seemed they would break it up
In the fourteenth when Frary "beat out
a ecratchy one to first and Houtz fof
lowed with a bunt that no one 'got. The
tans began to* tremble, but Jimmy the
"Whale twirled himself out of- the bad
looking hole and the game went on for
another round. The score:
SEATTLE.

BURNS STOPS BARRY IN TWENTIETH
BRITT SURPRISES
SPECTATORS WITH
HIS RUGGEDNESS
Caljfornian Shows He Is Faster and
Stronger Than -Ever Before.
Boxers .Will Probably Come to an Agree
. â¢ ment Regarding Jeffries' Fee^
Out on the .edgre of the Paclflo "at
Sheehan's villa, where James E. Britt
Is being conditioned for his 'exchange
at. gloves with- Battling Nelson- on Sep
tember 9, It Is beginning to dawn on
'visitors to training headquarters that
.he looks like a 100 to SO chance.
The California boy Is probably bet
*ter and stronger, than ever before rlur.
lng his boxing.- career. Kot even the
telegraphed' report that Jim Jeffries,
.selected to referee the big match, had
raised* his scale of prices .caused
Jimmy a moment's concern. That cer
-tainly demonstrates "that his nervovfs
system Is in no immediate need of ren
ovation. " . Possibly Manager- Willis
Britt, who could, give- Russell Sage a
polnt c or two when It comes -to figuring
a honse, may have done some "stall
walking," but not James Edward. "â¢*-*
JEFF CAN- NAME HIS FEE.
j While the' referee question Is being j
j discussed there will be no kick from j
j the "Britt camp over' any union .fee. Jeff
jmay. stipulate* according -to Willis
! Britt.,, Why -should there be? : - DidrTt
the, latter hold out for three days .and
nights,- turning, a deaf -ear to, all names
proposed but that of the Â£oons n Angeles
boilermaker? ..This gfves Jeffries arf
ace. ln the bole and unless his modesty
obtains the better of him the retired
champion isapt to hike that Jsooante.
Howqver/, with the prospect of a $75,000
house 'in sight," the Brttts ace â¢willing"
'to stand, a raise . and 'Nelson rio-dpubt
', will gracefully acquiesce. . '. â¢
' Jf the crowds Journeying to the
beach where Britt is training continue
to 'swell the gymnasium ' will either
have to be enlarged or the price of afl-'
mission during business hours in
creased.-. â¢ Yesterday the diminutive,
structure was * packed almost to the
point of suffocation, a liberal sprink
ling of the fafr> sex evincing keen
interest -In Jimmy's movements. The
regular routine was the order of the
day. /..'â¢Â«./
. BRITT'S. VARIED WORK. . .
James I Edward.* accompanied by
"Tiv v Kreling; returned, from' a horse
back" ride about 2:30 o'clock and al
most r immediately, stripped for -work.
Jimmy warmed up by skipping, . the
rope about 500Â° times. â¢ Then he' and
Frank Rafael w^nt three rounds, with
c love. taps* barred. It was fa.st and
pretty work, Britt. turning loose his re
serve batteries dnd showing to marked-]
advantage. Then Willis Britt put on
.the. mitts for twp rounds, being care-,
ful not to* expose his bake shop, an-"
necessarily. Willis worked- his left
cleverly, but is* no match for Jimmy.
Johnny", Frayne, an > amatey r, followed,
Britt keeping the youngster busy side
stepping, ducking and covering up for
three rounds under "half steam 'all
stages.' Concluding with'two rounds of
wrestling and lugging against such- a
sturdy athlete as "Tlv" Kreling. Britt
displayed no 'sign of fatigue.. Princi
pal, and trainers next". indulged in the
customary plunge in- the sea.
I Supervisor -Oscar Hocks. Harry Cor
bett,. Joe Steven's and Stanley" Fay were
among the bn-Jb-okers. yesterday..
NELSOX IS STILL STRENUOUS.
Keeps Up ' Ilia Severe Work on the
|* . ' -.* Road nnd In the Gymnnalum.
Battling Nelson did not cut .out the
heavy work yesterday as he had. pro
grammed. Instead. he waded in and '
sweltered around the gymnasium just
as'though all'he b,ad In th"c world de
pended oil his afternoon's work.' Long
before the hour of 3 arrived a full
houso assembled at Milieu's' and when
the Dane began to work out there was
no standing room In the gym.
Nelson looks about at weight now.
but his manager says he weighis 137
pounds. Nolanr adds that Bat. will:keep
up the rough going' for several days

yet before he, lays off. Many of the
wise ones do not like the looks of the
Dane" at. the-present -moment, but Nolan
says he is in .better form and â¢ better
spirits than -he ever was In his life, so
he intends to keep him pegging- away
at the same old grind for a while yet.
â¢ The Dane is learning the game of
handball and he likes the Irish pastime.
He started his afternoon's work with a
hot contest with George Braun Â» and
Bob Lundle. Bat-wan not there with
the grace his opponents possessed, but
he could drive 'em in once in a while
and he is developing a left hand swipe
that will make Mike Eagan's look like
a toothpick when he has it good and
ready. V - \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0â¢' \u25a0 \u25a0 -\u25a0â¢. \u25a0'. '--\u25a0 '.\u25a0: . '
After the handball . match - the Dane,
went .to the big sandbag and -pulled
and tugged at that for fifteen minutes.
He then waded in and took a fall out
of the 'punching bag until his trainer
I gave him the office to wrestle a bit
I with Braun.
Bat then donned the big mitts and
went to Bob Lundie for three rounds..
These- periods were warm ones and full
\u25a0of action. Lundie 'did not experience a
great deal of difficulty in swinging 'era
"in -on the jaw and body of the Dane,
but that did not prevent the . latter
from, being there* with a comeback. He
boxes JusV as he tights* wading . in
every second of - the .time and' keeping
his right and left going without a
â¢let-up.
The Dane was up -bright" and early
In the morning for' his ten-mile; run
along the highways. He came back for
luncheon and then slept l for a while!.
â¢ Manager -Nolan is having - a ring
constructed out. in the open air and it
will be ready, possibly this afternoon.
It will be' padded and fitted up In the
regulation style so that the Dane may
get used "to the kind of a ring he is
to use on the day of the battle.'

Manager Jim -offroth, the man who
made Colma famous, completed hi 3 ar
rangements yesterday for transporting
the spectators to the Colma arena on
Admission day. "
He expects 15,000 people to Journey to
San Mated County on that day.'but all
will not witness the figrht. Of this
great crpwd he expects 9000 will travel
by electric car, 3000. in the special
trains, 2000 in prfvate equipages j and
1000 In automobiles. .
Manager Chapman of the \u25a0' electric
road will have 110 cars In service, run
ning on a one-minute headway. These
cars will sbe kept on the spur track
near the^ arena and will start back
immediately after the fight They will
, then run on a twenty-second headway.
Spe'clal trains wilf leave Third and
Townsend' streets at 12 and 1 o'clock,
and they will be ready .to start for the
city immediately after the fight. With
these facilities it Is expected the crowd
will be handled without confusion. Tho
electric cars will run for. the first time
on the Mission roait cut-off.
A place alongside the arena will be ar
ranged for the parking of automobiles.
Accommodations, will also be made for
i teams.
| The advance orders for seats is un

on sale Saturday, but already nearly
three-fourths of them have been disposed

.The location of each seat, ls designated

but the steam. was gone and all. the .world
looked like a tunnel, to, him.-f' Thus ended
a bout that, was as 'fame as a parlor, fete
for lifteen rounds, and Burns, though
emerging from the . contest a winner by
the knockout route, will never be allowed
to boast of his triumph to any. one. who
had fo suffer while it was being
pulled off. : . v \u25a0 \u25a0' .
Burns he is a big. clever fellow
who might have a punch if he. was 'pos
sessed of the heart to wade in and bring
it over once in= a while. He is | not that
kind "of a fighter. He^ prefers to fiddle
around and keep the public in agony tin
he has a dead one on' his hands. Then,
when he is sure his opponent is not
capable of raising his â¢ mitts, he will go
in .and do the best he can. â¢
Barry has fought many tlmea. in and
around this city and his fight last night
was about the same as ne; usually, puts
up, though he was a little more genteel
in ; his movements '; and, did not; bustle
around the ring with the fantastic actions
that usually, mark his" work. Me never
had a look in last nigh-t, for the reason
that he was not fast enough to get to
Burns. The latter was too much of a
gentleman to knock "Barry out sooner, bo
the mill had to take its course.
FIGHTERS SLOW TO START.
There was not a bit of fighting in the
battle till the fifteenth round, when Burns
commenced to Jab his right and left to
the jaw so hard that Barry's head began
togo back. They clinched, and, as they
were coming out of ; it. Burns whipped
in his left and Barry wobbled on his
wheels. The Canadian-saw his chance
and over to the jaw he brought the hay
maker. Barry flip-flapped to the carpet
and closed his lamps. It looked llke cur- :
tains, but on the stroke of nine the
Hibernian took a new lease of life, .rose
to his feet and was allowed â¢to stall
around by the considerate opponent, who
imagined he might still be possessed of
some kind of a wallop; . .
After that round Barry was a bit
stronger,, but the fans could see the mill
could have only one finish. "Some thought
Burns might possibly summon up enough
courage to wade in andget his man with
out any more ceremony,, but the wise
sports could see nothing but ' a decision
as the finish and. therefore.' when the
knockout did arrive it surprised them.
. From the fifteenth round^oni Burns ran
around the ring ; and jabbed his right to
Barry's jaw, making al getaway before
the; Irishman could- make up, his' mind
what to . do next. Barry was groggy, sev
eral times, though he managed to come in
in that awkward style, of -his and land a
punch now. and then that was a warning
for Burns that he must not; be too rash.
BURXS BEGINS -TO RUSH.
When the men came up for 'the last
round. Burns began to ' rush and Barry
looked out of one eye and made the crowd
think that-he was still there. But he was
not, for he could not even stop that left
of -Burns' that was bobbing, up and hltr
ting him on the sore nose like a Jumping
Jack. Suddenly Barry began , to weaken
and Burns waded, ln a little stronger. He
brought over the right a couple of times
and when he saw Barry 1 could not raise
his hands he clouted him another right
swing to the jaw and the bout was at an
end. '
The real fight of the night was the one
between Fred j Landers and Joe Angeli.
There was more. fighting in half a, round
of that mixup than in the entire twenty
spasms of the main event. The mill was
declared a draw, though Angeli was com
ing fast at the end and might have been
given the shade; though ,it would have
been "a close one. ;' . \u25a0 -.-
', Landers started by whipping his right
and left to the stomach with 'such rapid
ity that Angeli could not. get out of the
way. It looited like good night for Joe in
the second and third rounds \u25a0 when \u25a0 Fred
was at best. .His left: was. going alb
the i time and he played chiefly for the
body. ; The fourth brought ;';: about a
change, for "Angeli. began to get his bear-
Ings along with his second wind and from
that .time on he waded in , arid < the pair
went to it like a couple of wolves. . .
ANGELI GROWS STRONGER.
They exchanged wallop after wallop and
fought 'ln and out of clinches in a man
ner = that maifle . the fans s yell i with glee!
Angeli v was . getting better, all \ the T time,
while; Landers .weakened a \u25a0 bit. "In the
eighth, ; they .swapped so ..""many^ wallops
that It seemed, both would, drop . from
sheer.. exhaustion.- It was ; any iono's -fight
for the haymaker, but neitherlhad 'lt.'s'o
it went the i distance and^ the draw deci
sion was fairly "well received," though a
verdict In Angell's favor ; might \u25a0 have
pleased the , gallery a bit ;moro.
The Montana â¢ Kid' and' Mauro Hen-era
fought ,a \u25a0 .\u25a0 ten-round .[draw Â»; as ." a : ; curtain
raiser.' -It was slow, and the crowd heaved
a sigh of relief when. the 'bell ; sounded-
The fights ;"drew; out: one of t the.. smallest
houses of the season,. and. but^ for the gal
lery the sports might have-imagined: they
were attending, a^ temperance; revival. ;

petitioners that Â£he Hafbor .Commls- !
jiion realized the necessity ; for the
dredging and .would be glad to do the ;
work, but its jurisdiction did not ex- :
tt-nd that far. All of *he south side â¢
of the channel to. Seventh Street bÂ«- !
longs to the Southern Pacific and j
most of the, other side is in the pos
session of private owners. . Â« *
Â» President Spear, for the* board, said
that if the private, owners , would pay
their 6harÂ« of the expense* the e State

\cr#st and the State dredgers do
the ,work. The matter will be taken
up by those interested aiid at the same
time an effort will be - made to Tiave
the city do something with the offend
ing sewer, the flow from jrhich eats
tlie paint from ships* bottoms and
taints the air with malodorous vapors.

Man Who Borrowed Mrs. Ty
son's Money Not Guilty
' â¢of Larceny.
The District Court of Appeal yesterday
decided that; William Proctor . was' not
guilty of-iarceny when ho persuaded aged
Emeline^Tysdn; to marry him, then in
duced \ her: to lend him $10S in cash on a
ttctitious bill . of : sale of an automobile.'
The court held that as" Mrs. Tyson gave
the money .willingly ;\u25a0; the act ; complained
of was not committed; and. therefore, the
decision of f the lower tribunal was wrong.
The -case of vThe ! People of the State
of .California vs. .Proctor presents; an in
teresting array of 'facts. Proctor met
Emelinc Tys9n at- the Niles station In
1904. and the | next day he called at her
home. Spectacle selling was : his alleged
mission, but in a few minutes , after . his
arrival he was " protesting his love.
Though .many: years his seniorâ she was
76â Mrs.. Tyson did not question the gen
uineness of- the affection, and she yielded
herself : to. his -pleading. ' \u25a0 >
Two minutes after this pretty love
scene- Proctor . was borrowing money, of
his fiancee.' '. Of course, she would lend
hrm a little,, was his appeal, he had an
automobile and.' a : bank account. The
money was forthcoming, JIOS, the loved
one- took a bill of sale on the automobile
for security, and Proctor" bade her a ten
der \u25a0.farewell. "Walt until to-morrow,",
he; called gayly as he swung out into the
roadway.
\u25a0But on the morrow he. did. not come,
nor the. natft 'day, nor the next. The
authorities were notified and Proctor was
captured..* Â«
On the first two trials the courts held
that his offense was larceny, but the Su
preme 1 Court yesterday reversed those
decisions. -Proctor will go .free.

"WRIGHT BECOMES CHAMPION ?
AFTER TRVIXG FOR YEARS
'Defeats | Holconibe .Ward on tb,e Cn
- slno- Tennis Courts at
/. * Aewswrt. i'.f- .'
NEWPORT, R. 1.. Aug. 31.â After
many years the . aspirations of Beala,
G. Wright of. Boston for the national
tennis championship were crowned
with success. in his , defeat of Holcombe
Ward of Orange, N."j.. the title holfler,
on the Casino courts to-day in straight
sets. Scores ' were 6-1, .6-2. 11-0.
Wright's superiority, "which for two
sets was almost masterful and for a
greater part of the third" was well
marked, was the feature of the con
test. Both men' played a strong, re
sourceful and well-planned game, but"
Wright was able to cafry off his
strokes, while.it was not until almost
tHe eleventh hour, the tenth game of
the third set, that Ward managed to
gauge the height of the net or the
boundary of the court. With Wright
within two points of the match, Ward
began to get the balls* somewhere out
of Wright's re;ich and "within a short
time the set had become a deuce af
fair. For ten. games the crowd, which
numbered more than 1000" and included
hundreds 'of followers of the game
throughout the country, saw some of
the best tennis ever played on a Ca
sino court.
\u25a0 Both jnen covered the court in a
marvelous manner. Seemingly Impos
sible balls were reached and not only
returned over the net, but wece placed
in a way that allowed tho player "to
get back into position.. Both men ran
in on; their services and both carried
off their service games.* As it , w # as
Ward's- first service" he was always
getting the vantage game, only to lose
It when Wright won his own service
and brought the : set back to deuce.
Once Ward was within a stroke of tho
set. At the last after eighteen games
had. been played, Wright found a weak
spot' in Ward's defense and won the
vantage game. The next game, which
was the last, was easily \u25a0' f or " the Bos
ton man, as "Ward drove out of bounds
and the r championship, wertt to Wright.
Armor Creditors' Affairs.
The creditors of Armer Brothers will
probably 'receive about 25 cents on the
dollar^ if the views of the committee
of creditors is correct. Mr. McCarthy,'
chairman of .the creditors' 1 committee,
made . this- estimate of the amount of
realization .yesterday. "The books of
the defunct : concern V have been' 'ex
perted and the general-situation has
been'discussed:'at several meetings of
the creditors. -The experting of the
books .did. not^ materially change ' the
showing her"etofore" made -elative \u25a0 to
the assets and , secured and unsecured
liabilities." Several .more meetings may
be , held before a final statement' can
be made of the basis of settlement to
be aÃrecil UDon. .

* Buffered jseverely to-day " from â¢â¢heavy selling,
\u25a0which came from all quarters, inducing Lon
don. " Much of the selling probably was in
duced fey lears of a coming money stringency,
c this feeling being based upon the low level of
New' York bank reserve*. Veteran- observera
of recent conditions were of the opinion, how
ever, thai .other .and more imx>octant causes
-wÂ«re responsible for 'the market slump. Chief
trr.cr.g thetÂ»e U thÂ« fact that London is much
disappointed ,at the manner of .itÂ» reception
here and ha,s unloaded the greater part of -her
recent purchases at a .loss. The heaviest sell
ing to-day came from houses which most often
-sx-t for Boston ancl New England^ thus reviv
ing the report that raids were belag engineered
iy the so-csiled bucket shops of that section.
Afded to ih:s, all ir.e big commission houses
â of the Middle W^st continued to â¢array them
\u25a0 " selves on 'tie bear dde. The declines weak
ened the position of <ceveral pools whose opera
r tions were aamlttedtlj" over-extended. They
* served eisÂ»* to weed out many ether weak ac
counts for the rise. Th<s market opened with
a heavy tone, and the . early movements were
I *â¢ without eiKnificance. -The more prdhounced
reactionary tendency came at noon, when
heavy selllrg caused breaks -ranging from 2
points In Southern .Pacific to more than 4 In
Chicago fcad Northwestern. â¢ The pressure
against, Reading and AtoaJgam&ted Copper was
J especially strong, . much of the selling- at this
time being in theie stocks.. The Gou!d group
also was heavy, and Union Pacific made a de
cline of 2*6Â» Part of the gossip heard in con
Â» nection with the decline of this stock was that
& Tjbcl recently organized he* jouad it advls

tendency to : , rally* ln the later Sesllnga under
the lead of i.tch!son. which wu one of the-few

with inClcataons of. a <julet accumulating In
1 moderate " volume, but in- the final trading
IL pricr-s broke I again., causing a weak closing.
IB Lonson'B sales were not so large as on yes
jf terday. Thaft center's bearish attitude was
V I*xtly ascribed to the publication 'of the* Bank
iof England's Hreekly Itatement. which phowed'
a heavy decrease <yi. reserve and ' a greater de
ore4re of renewal deposits. The announcement
