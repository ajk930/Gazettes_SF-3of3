lan Revolution.
Aotion Taken During Absence
of the President of the
Corporation.
NEW YORK. Oct. 17. â General Fran
cis V. Gree:.e. former president of the
Katlonal Asphalt Company, was exam
ined to-day before United States Com
missioner Gilchrlet as a" witness in be
half of the Venezuelan Government in
the action instituted by the latter
against the New York and Bermudez
Company to recover about $11,000,000
because of the latter organization's al
leged assistance of the Matos revolu
tion in ISOI.
General Greene Â«a s asked but one
question, hi* reply being ti the effect
that the defendant company did ma
terially- aid the revolutionist)!.
The question, as put to General
Greene by Lawyer Rufus B. Cowing
Jr., representing' the Venezuelan Go\-
â¢rnment, was as follows:
"State whether, when you returned
from Europe in 1901, you knew John.
M. Mack. "A very D. Andrews and Ar
thur Azwell. or any of them as repre-*
â¢entatives of the National Asphalt
Company or any of the allied com
pajvics .Tvcrc. in -catuimmicatioji -with*
H. A. Matos or "were aiding: him with
money or in any other manner.
".Mr only knonleusf," replied Gen
eral Greene, "of thiÂ« matter cornea
from what Tiaat told me by Messrs.
Black, Andrews and Sewell. When I re
turned from Europe in October, 1901, I
via* surprised to learn from them that
during- my absence they had decided to
â¢upport Matoi in bis contest with Cas
tro.
"I told them that I thought they had
ni9.de a great mistake, because what
they had don* was not acting in good
faith with the State Department in
Washington, which up to tha,t time,
and largely on representations made
by me to Secretary Hay, had supported
the Bprmudez Company to suoh an ex
tent as to enable it to continue in pos
session of its rroprrty. I told them
\u2666 hat in view Â»f what |hey liad done
during my absrncf it would be im
possible for me to makÂ«Â» any further
claims at the Stat*> I >*-partn]eiit in
Washington in connection with . the
Bemrades <'..i:ip a ;iy. and. in fact. I
nrver did after that go to the Sta.te
Department in behalf of the asphalt
company.
"Whilp I was president of the Xa
tionii Asphalt Company Mr. Mack and
his Friends controlled a large major
ity of the Stock and h<? was also .vice
president of the- compafrijr and rlnto&Ily
}n contrnj. The company parsed Into
Hi*" hands of a r^-eiver about two
months lat<u and at that time I had
practically no v<ik<> in its management.

months if/tr. aril for < onsiderably
niopp than tnreÂ«Â» years I hay*> had no

of any kind whatever."
The hearing was adjourned until to

LONDOX, Oct. 17. -Emperor William's
decision to dispatch a special mission
to Teheran for the purpose of bringing
about closer political and commercial re
lations between Germany and Persia has
excited a' great deal of dissatisfaction
and anger in England, the move being

Hitherto Southern Persia has been re

German trade with Persia through Ger

confessions were followed by the apprt
hension ai Denver in May of Rumsby and
Biggie. In the house where the pair was
caught many thousands of pelts prepared
for shipment to various bounty-paying
districts were seized. Many of these
skins, it was learned, had come from
New York and South America. It is
averred that Warner wa? the center of
shipping operations. A number of Utah
county officials were also arreytsd, the
charge being tha: they had permitted
many hundreds of besus pelts to be ac
cepted and in. many other ca^s had
neglected to mutilate the delivered pelts
so that they could not be offered for
bounties a .Â«econd time. The evidence is
that the skins "were made to work over
time fur months. It was charged that
there had been clever manipulation of
tkfns !n thai bounties in large amounts
for wolf and mountain lion pelts were
paid on what were really coyote hides.
CASHED JIA.VV WARRANTS.
T'pon the issuance of the county war
rauts for payment the swindlers would
cash them at the banks. After the ex
posure the Sfate refused to accept these
disi-ountod warrants. The result was a
heavy loss to the banks. After Rumsby
and Rlgjrle were arrested the hunt for
coin supposed to have been sent to San
Francisco was begun. Rlggle's wife was
found there with Mrs. "Rumsby. her
daughter. The Utah Commercial, and
Savings Bank retained Attorney Charles
J. Pence of San Krancisco to protect its
interests. Under Sheriff J. C Sharp of
this city went to San Francisco in June
and spent two weeks trying to trace the
coin. It Tvas believed the women knew
where the money was concealed. Attacn
tuents were levied or garnishments were
filed at the Bank of California, tne
Crocker- Wool worth National Bank and
the Union Trust Comoany. Then Sheriff
Emery followed to San Francisco. But
no coin was found. In the Trust Com
pany's safe deposit box rented by Mrs.
Higgle a lot of letters were uncovered,
but these had nn significance at the time.
It wa-s not until the time of trial ap
proached that the prisoners revealed to
the disappointed officers who had re
turr.ed erp.pty-handed the importance of
thf>K? satr.e documents.
Meantime a suit against Mrs.. Higgle.

Sen Francisco by the bank was rest

ing thÂ» men, h*M conferences with the
officials on the subject of the letters. It
yes at last decided to go to San Fran
cisco with a direction to Mrs. Higgle
to deliver the documents. Early this
month Booth and under Sheriff Sharp
arrived there. They found Mrs. Riggle,
and the trio, with attorney Pence, went
to the vault and the correspondence was
turned over to the men from Utah.
These documents are !n the hands of
District Attorney Christensen. They will
be used in the prosecution of Wagner,
and will be placed at the service of the

the exposure, which has been so closely
followed by the developments of the
past few weeks and the implicating of
the prominent New York furrier. . : -
The question at point concerning-
Wagner is Just how far his alleged
dealings with Rumsby and his con
federates can be proved for purposes of
criminal prosecution. The charge is
that he shipped wild animal 1 skins in
large quantities from New York to
Western points as designated by his
correspondents and that he was. well
paid for the pelts. The Salt Lake of
ncials are very reticent concerning the
contents of the letters. They fear to

The ramifications of the jobbery were
stupendous. With New York as a cen

"Occasionally I corresponded with Mr.

NEW YORK, Oct. 17. â The Second
annual convention of the International
Advertising Association met In the As
tor Gallery of the Waldorf-Astoria
Hbtel this morning. The meeting was
called 1 " to ordef >by the president,
Charles Arthur Carlisle, of the Stude
baker Manufacturing Company. South
Bend f ;ind.-.. , \u25a0 -
-The morning, session was devoted to
routine-business, such as 'hearing- the
annual report of officers and commit
tees. /, The following directors were
elected' fbr -the ensuing year: A.* sIX
.White; of Swift & Co.; J. M. Campbell
of Proctor \u25a0& Gamble: H. GassbrooK of

the Bradford Star;.iienjamln B. Hamp
ton,"::bf the Hampton Advertising Com
pany;' E. J. Bliss of the Regal Shoe
Company, and J. L. Cassidy of Egg-O
see'Company. .' ' â¢ : .
At the afternoon session addresses
were made by O. K. Blackman, repre
senting ithe Frank Presbrey Advertis
ing Company of New York; Benjamin
B. Hampton, president of the Hampton
Advertising Company, Now York, and
John LÂ«f Mahln, president of, the... Ma
hin- Advertising Company of Chicago.
Blackman,," in his address on "Who
Creates Advertising," said that adver
tising in the "first instance Is created
by the great public itself In its de
mand, for new luxuries and more ad
vanced: methods of living.- He con
tinued:; ' L -
To show. that neither the publishers nor thÂ«
advertising agents are necessarily vital to the
creation of advertising one has only, to look
.back to the .dawn of the advertising: ? Idea.
On -the wal.i of Pompeii an Inscription was
uncovered recently which, when translated,
read as follows; "Once one of my hams la
set before a customer he licks even the sauce
pan In which it is cooked."" . '- -'
That is not very bad advertising: and I' think
it would challenge the admiration or almost
any graduate to-day. Even political advertis
ing was known at the same early period as it
isron record that- sixteen hundred : posters de
voted to election purposes were also found In
the recent /earch of "the ruins of; Pompeii.
These postern were exceedingly brief," being in
effect' as follows: "Make Publius- Furlus
Senator. I beg of you, for he's a good -man."
Coming down a little later to -.the com
mencement of newspaper publicity, we find in
the Pubilc Advertiser of Tuesday.' June 22,
1667, the following -notice: "In Bishopsgate
street, in Queen's Head 'alley, at a French
man's house, is an excellent West India drink
called chocolate, to bÂ« sold, where- you may
have it ready at any ttme at re&sonabla
rates." â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0 '
In these modern times is It not fair to' Bay
that the consuming public, with Us readiness
to try some new thing, is primarily the creatot
of advertising? May we not say the manu
facturer who meets this need with a new pro
duction or an improvement on an old method
is next In line to receive credit, for the reason
that he makes advertising commercially poe> I
slble. â¢ \u25a0 =
Then comes the publisher of newspapers or
periodicals, together with the owners of bill
board and car ppace, for they â¢ provide the
channel through which the manufacturer matter
known* his offering to the waiting public.
Finally the advertising agent Is certainly en
titled to credit.
Hampton's subject was, "Who Are
the Patrons of the Advertisers?"" He
said that it would seem that the ques
tion can be answered almost Instantly
by saying "Everybody." He added: .
More ilkely that Is the literal truth for those
classes, or types, that are not moved directly :
by advertising undoubtedly are Indirectly in
fluenced by those whom advertising has af
fected. The resultÃ achieved by some of thÂ«
mall order advertisers whose products appeal
to the humblest wage earners, and by the pat
ent medicine advertisers, whose wares are man
ufactured primarily for those who cannot af
ford a physician's services, ; suggest that, the.
limit in the ecale of Incomes has been reached
on that end,, while the. : experience of th<Â» mak
ers of high priced motor-cars is a
illustration that millionaires on the cth<\ end
of the scale are influenced by advertising.
"Who ' Pays for the Advertising?"
was the subject of Mahin's address,
and he replied:
The people who buy advertised articles ' pay
for the advertising. You who sell space did
not expect me to make the admission. . The
people pay for the advertising just as the pur
chasers of a "-cent postage stamp pays for
the fast mall train. Th<? department store is
born and fed on advertising. â¢ :

and from present Indications there will
be no new county seat or bond Issue
unless there is a change in> the senti
ment of the people of the southern end
of the county.
The Supervisors have adopted a resolu
tion announcing their Intention to call
an election for the issuance of bonds to
the txtent of $300,000 to construct a new
courthouse, Jail and county hospital. The
people of Vallejo favored the project, fbr
It was planned- to give this city the
county hospital. It was thought, asvthe
appropriation for the bonds was liberal,
that at least )?5,000 would be allowed for
the hospital to be built in this city, but
when it was learned that only $10,000 was
to be given this city, the people here
became aroused and stated that they had
to be treated better or there would bo
na bonds. "As Vallejo boasts of over half
of the votes in the county, it looks dub
ious for tht bonds.
The Board of Supervisors has accepted
the invitation of the Sulsun Board of
Trade ' to visit at the expense of that
commercial body the new courthouses at
Redwood City. Auburn and Martinez, and
has set the 26th lnst. as the day for
starting on the Junket.
"Without the consent of Vallejo the
bonds can never be issued and . Vallejo
has simply folded Its arms and said to
the Supervisors, "It Is up to you!"

VALLEJO, Oct. 17.â The attempt of the-
Southern Pacific Company to purchase
forty acres of tule land adjoining Beniciu,
on the east and the presence of surveyors
In the employ of the company around
that town have aroused a great deal of
Interest among the citizens not only of
Benicia, but of all of the surrounding bay
towns. It is believed the railroad com
peny la planning to construct the much,
discussed pier bridge across the Car
quinez straits. Lines of survey have been
run at two places through Benlcla. but
the one which seems to be fa
vored and with which the surveyors are
taking the most trouble is that passing
through the hills west of Benicia and
over the grounds of the Dominican fath
ers. This line would provide for a bridge
about two miles. In length which would
reach a grade on the outskirts of Benicia
and passing over Port Costa would find
its western end at Crockett.

The most significant demonstration of the campaign for common honesty iii affairs of municipal government took place at Teut^^^^
labor south of ffirket street, John S. Partridge addressed a vast audience of workingmen and won the applause of the multitude by his fearless and masterly denunciation of graftand -grafters. Other fusion

FUSION'S CANDIDATE
MAKES MANLY SPEECH
Declares Himself Satisfied the
People Are Honest.
Announces His Freedom From
Entangling Alliances.
"We're cot the grafters on the run," <
declared John S. Partridge to the over
flow iiiK meeting of the citizens of the \u25a0
Thirtieth District last night at Teu- j
tonla Hall, and Uhe cheers- of the crowd j
folly attested Its belief that the fusion j
candidate spoke the truth. '
"I've vowed to inahp them come out
In the open and tiiiU: my flght, and i
I've done it," continued San Francisco's |
next Major, "For over four hours j
Abraham Ruef, the petty owner and '
controller of Mayor Schmitz, defended j
himself against the charges of graft :
and corruption in the great case of (be J
city of >au Francisco vs. Abraham j
Huef, and (the morning after the meet- j
lnjr he awoke the most disappointed j
man of San Francisco, with the real- i
ixatlon that he had made a mis-step
and as sure as there Is a God above ,
he will be defeated on November 7. !
"I have addressed three crowded meet
ings to-night, all In the radius of twelve
blocks. , Every meeting has been jammed
to the doors, and with Ruef in the lime
light weakly denying his culpability, I
j tell you we will win, and we will carry
this city by 13,000 majority on the day of
election." The Immense audience of the
largest political meeting ever held In the
hall rose to its feet and cheered, howled
and yelled as the figures predicting the
immensity of Ruef and Schmitz's defeat
came from the lips of the candidates.
Men threw hats in the air, and the cheers
on the floor and in the galleries swelled
louder and louder until even the band
was submerged in the volume of noise.
The true significance of the outburst
may well be comprehended when It is
known that the men in the hall are the
bone and elnew of the Thirtieth District
upon which Rutf was counting to roll up
a great vote for Schmitz. Fifteen hun
dred voters, over one-fifth of the district
polling strength, were present in the hall,
and cheered the Fusion speakers from
start to finish. The fight in the district
will still be a hot one and fiercely fought,
but from the meeting last night, the pre
dictions of the Fusion candidate will be
' upheld by the Thirtieth District.
â¢ The immense gathering was called to
order by Thomas W. Hickey, the idol of
the Thirtieth. Hickey gave the reasons
for the joining of all honest citizens in
the flght against the grafters, and with
his own people to hear was received with
enthusiasm and accorded an ovation. In
successive order. Chairman Hickey intro
duced C. A. Sweigert. Dr. A. A. d'An-.
cona and Oscar Hocks, who were warm
ly greeted and their speeches well re
ceived.
A. M. Johnson, the next speaker, spent
fifteen minutes in flaying the administra
tion and telling the oft-repeated tales
that are common talk about the corridors
of the City Hail, regarding the grafts
and methods of graft In vogue. He, like
the other speakers, triumphantly referred
to the woeful defense of Abe Ruef
against, the charges placed against him.
PARTRIDGE IS CHEERED.
Johnson was interrupted by the en
trance at this moment cf John S. Par
tridge. As the candidate ascended the
stair, the deep-toned voice of George El
der announced "Partridge," and the name
was the signal of a pandemonium that
lasted until the Fusion standard bearer
x was seated on the stage.
At the conclusion of Johnson's speech
Henry U. Brandensteln, the plucky can
didate for District Attorney, was pre
sented. In Introducing him, Hickey said
that every grafter, crook and blackleg
was working tooth and nail for the de
feat of Brandenstein for their very lib
erty. Brandensteln said in part:

the principles of common decency and Integrity
in office. It stands for that, no more and no
less. The ticket itself is compelled to fight on
no other Issue than that of purity and decency
in office and in politics, and also I may add in
the private life of its champions.
When Schmitz first ran for Mayor, who had
heard of Abraham Ruef except as a petty Po
lice Court lawyer and cheap politician? Above
all. whoever knew or heard of Ruef as the de
fender and upholder of la^orT Whoever heard
or him at any time as anything but the self
seeking promoter of his own interests?
And yet he profesee* to be the friend and
guide of labor. He poses as being concerned
for mighty labor's welfare in the event of tho
almost Improbable defeat or John S. Partridge,
and says he is worried and frightened because
of that possibility.
Abraham Ruef doesn't want office. Oh. no!,
What does he want? That you can demon
strate for yourselves by walking any street of
the city. Is there a man in the city who has
planned to do t something in his business that
has need of the consent of a public commission
that has not had to 'pay his little fee to the
grafters? If you know Â«ie men well enough
they will tell you. They would admit paying
the grafters the money and submitting and re
eubmitting to the tribute.
Any man putting up a building, any great
public corporation, any satoon man needing a
license will tell you the story if he dates.
Ruef boasts proudly of the fact that no new li
censes have been issued by. the Police Commis
sion, but 'he fails to add tnat the licensee of
the ealoonmen are renewed every three months
and -that any tale of tribute by one of them
would result In dosing tne place.
But why discuss Ruef at all? He Is the one
that seeks the notoriety and Indecency that fol
lows political misdoing. Ruef alone rejoices -in
the degrading fight because it. dignifies him and
makes him appear as somebody in the eyes of
the community. When one engages in argu
ment with such cattle one must neceesarily
degrade himself to their level. We must .de
scend to his level to repudiate his lies.
Abraham Ruef at the Alhambra last night
Epewed out He after lie because he hoped that
some of the lies would stick. He attacked me
personally, my private Hie, which, thank God.
is dean and pure, saying I ran a suite of rooms
downtown . and went, as surety on a brothel
keeper's lease.
Ruef lays awake nights trying- to find a
flaw In the character of John S. Partridge, and
the bast be could do. or rather the worst, was
a measly little lie about the candidate's living
in Alameda, where his sister resides and whom
he sometimes visits. Then Gallagher, the ap
pctntee of Ruef-Sphmitz, gets up in the pres
ence of bla colleagues on me Board of Super
visors and denounces the Democratic members
as grafters because they -voted for $1 gas. H<Â»
knew he lied, and also knew he was acting as
Judas, and that his conduct was miserable,
contemptible and inconsistent. That Is why
we have to meet the creatures on their own
level when they grovel in filth.
RVAX MAKES GOOD TALK.
Daniel A. Ryan, the next speaker, laid
aside his dignity somewhat and urged the
auditors to cast aside partyism as did' he
and Mr. Hickey and not be found want
ing when the cry of decency was heard.
He compared Ruef to a venomous snake
that has wound itself about the head,
heart and hands of the present Mayor.
He pointedly asked his hearers if they
Intended to line up with dlvekeepers,
brothel owners and criminals in the com
ing flght. or with a man whose reputation
is spotless.
Hickey in introducing Partridge, an
nounced that the meeting was the largest
political gathering ever held in the hall
and showed that the men who hurled
epithets from the galleries at the Repub
lican convention did not come from the
Thirtieth district.
Mr. Partridge when introduced spoke
as -.follows:
When I started in on this campaign I said
I was going to make the enemy take my own
kind of a flght. and I have done it. I started
in to drive Mr. Ruef out into the open and
last evening he stood in the light for four
solid hours. He has raaJc the issue I wanted:
the case Is now before ; the court and the title
of It is the People vs. Abe Ruef.
The battle Is *b 'good as won and we'll
carry this city by 15,000 majority. Their own
men who- were claimine a victory for out
enemies a week ago, now adroit reluctantly
that "it Is a hard flght." This has been
brought about simply by the fact that all
false Issues have been swept aside and noth-

Ruefs meeting at Alhambra Theater
Monday night has had the effect which
the supporters pf Partridge expected and
hoped It would have. The effect Is seri
ous alarm in the ranks . of wage-earners
who have been endeavoring to convince
their fellow-workers that Mayor Schmitz
was not Ruefs chattel . and that ' the
curly boss had no right or privilege to
command the Mayor. ,
Ruef not only defended " the Mayor
against accusation of graft, but Identified
himself with the Mayor's candidacy- In
such fashion that the / dullest listener
could not escape the conclusion that the
partnership of Ruef and his Mayor was
so close. that each stood for the- other

Boss Ruef are demandiifg that the Mayor
shall give the , wage-earners,. some defi
nite assurance that Ruef must be kept
in \u25a0 the background from, this- time until
November 7. â¢' " ' - -. * â¢ : \u25a0 .
Reports come to fusion headquarters
that workingmen who were openly for
Schmitz a few days ago have now re
solved to break away ' on account of
Ruefs mastery of the Mayor. The re
markable letters which Schmitz, shortly,
after his first election, wrote to Rnef
and Parry ; are recalled -''by the cleveV"
politicians in the labor camp. Wage
earners, and particularly -those of . old
time Democratic association, have' all
along distrusted Ruef ... and noted with
Intense disgust that nine-tenths of the
official patronage of the Schmitz admin
istration went to Ruefs chosen followers.
The spectacle of Ruef posing as "the
spokesman of the Mayor and as the
power behind the municipal administra
tion excited anger and resentment in the
Union Labor camp. '
The candidacy of Partridge grows
brighter every day." The popular uprising
which the syndicate writers said would
be required to overthrow Ruef, seems
near at hand. At headquarters of ; the
Fusion forces there is complete confi
dence of victory. Wise politicians, how
ever, caution the candidates to beware
of over-confidence. When one carefully
studies the city registration by Assembly
districts and considers in that investi
gation the vote cast for Mayor in 1903,
and the vote recently polled at the
primary election, the reasons for predict
ing the success of Partridge are obvious.
One of . the most auspicious signs of
victory was the great meeting last night
In the cause of common honesty at Teu
tonia Hall, Thirtieth Assembly District
This district is the stronghold of. labor
south of Market street and. there the
vast audience, of wage earners cheered
John S. Partridge, the" next Mayor of
San Francisco. The demonstration sig
nified to the spectators that Ruefs power
to mislead the workingmen had vanished.
The "deadest . political duck" in Califor
nia to-day is A. Ruef,' but it can be' said
for him that he had the' enterprise to
publicly arrange for his own obsequies.
ing left but the olain fight between the grafters
and the honest men. They tried to make men
believe that there was an Issue between labor
and capital, but that is played out. for th*
people are now satisfied that I am not undei
the domination of the Citizens' Alliance or any
other person or; organization. - > -
So -there's nothing left but graft. It -Is
the old. Â«old flght between decency and cor
ruption, and the grafters ] know that decency
never lost a battle yet. . That's the reason
they are so desperate; that's the reason thej
are talking Â«about . a "hard flght." They ar*
in a complete and absolute panic. They havt
lost their heads and are fighting blindly. It
they had any \u25a0 sanity left do > you think their
boss would have .done 'the very \u25a0 thing.' that
we were trying to get him to do, and makÂ»
himself the issue of the campaign? If they
were not badly frightened jdo you | think I they
would be tearing down our banners and stone

Superior Judge,- limply- because they werÂ»
tainted with his . taint. I j believe he realized
It more strongly still when he lost v the pri
maries. And I arr confident that he' lost all
hope when fusion became an accomplished fact.
So now there's nothing left for us to \u25a0\u25a0 do
but keep.it up. Graft uncovered Is graft de

IN THE CAMPAIGN
Mayof^Schmitz Stands for Administration
. "This campaign has narrowed down to .
a fight for vindication for me ' and f my.}
administration," declared Mayor Schmitz |
at Richmond Hall.VThlrty-ninth District,
last night. "The people of this city must
say on , the seventh jof November whether
or not they approve 'of my conduct m of
fice and the official actions of those whom

Army of Italian Bandits
Has Superb Organization
and Is Under Leadership
of Twelve Head Men
Special DScpatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Oct. 17.â Unless more ef
fective measures are taken, it is admitted
by the police that they are powerless to
defeat the army of 5000 Camorristi who
infest Now York. Their demands are in
creasing at an alarming rate.
The grocery store of Giambalvo Bros.
at 13 Stanton street, next door to the
butcher shop where the victim of the
"barrel murder" of three years ago was
killed, was wrecked to-day. A short time
ago seventeen letters received by prospec
tive victims, in whicM money was de
manded under penalty of death or the
destruction of property, were turned over
to the police. So systematized has the
campaign of brigandage become, accord
ing to Sergeant Petroslno, that members
of the band are employes In many of
the little Italian banks scattered through
the East Side to watch the deposits of
small merchants. There, it Is believed,
the victims are chosen.
"Only the national Government can save
this situation for us." declared Sergeant
Petroslno to-day. "As the law stands
at present we are helpless against these
desperadoes. They know the penal code
from end to end. How clever they are
In covering their tracks was shown by
the manner in which all of them managed
to escape conviction in the "barrel mur
der" case. Suspicion and circumstantial
evidence are not enough In this country
to do more than make them cautious.
But of my own knowledge I could lay
my hands In a day on a thousand of them
who are ready to cut a throat or fclow
up a building- at any time that it wllÂ»
serve their ends.
"It is the duty of the Government to
keep these blackmailers and murderers
out of New York, either by a treaty with
Italy which will permit of a complete
Investigation of the character and anteceÂ«
dents of all immigrants, or by barring
out, if necessary, all Sicilians and Cala
brlans, from whom the Caraorra in this
country are recruited. There are not
less than 30.000 members of the Cumorra
in this country, working under twelve
leaders stationed in the principal cities."
In extent of damage to property the
latest outrage by the Camorra is the
worst that has been perpetrated. The
entire front of Giambalvo Bros." store is
blown in. and all windows in the adjoin
ing houses and buildings across the street
were broken. Had the explosion occurred
during the day or evening it could hardly
have failed to kill or malm many per
sons. Three arrests were made, but two
of the men were released when It was
learned that they had been employed to
guard the place of a banker who had
been threatened, while the third is still
in custody on suspicion.

NEW YORK, Oct. 17:â The ideas of
Miss Marie Cahill with regard to the
mental, mpral and material welfare. of
the chorus girl are not confined by any
means to her much-heralded ukase 11
against tights and decollete corsages
in her forthcoming musical production,
which is being tried in the West. She
has grand, gloomy and peculiar theories

and off tiie stage. M.ms Cahill hafj pre-;
pared au ironciad rule to regulate the
cunuuet of her young women, while
they are on the road and after the show
comes to Broadway.
Briefly these consists of the censor
ship ol notes and the banishment of
"Johnnies" from the stage door. The
Johnny who sends a note to the stage
door, expecting an answer at once,
won't get it. The chorus girl won't
get the note until the show is in the
next town. This is' simple^ but effec
tive. Members of. the company are re
quired not to have friends, relatives or
acquaintances meet them at the stage
door in cabs or automobiles.' Street
cars are good enough for any girl. All
vehicles loitering at' the stage entrance
will be moved on. . . , -
Finally if any young woman in Miss
Cahill's company wishes; to | eat lobster
or anything at all, either for dinner or

death this afternoon. A culvert on the

a dee? and treacherous chasm.
Burns reached the scene of the con

succeded in flagging the train on the very
brink of the chasm. Had the engine pro

train would have been dragged over the
precipice Into the foaming waters of the
stream.
The bridge was completely out of sight
of the engineer, being situated round a
curve, and had it not been for the action
of the track-walker, an awful calamity
would have occurred. The train was a
little behind schedule time and was run
ning at a high rate of speed. Traffic was
resumed over the road late this evening,
a temporary bridge having been con

Great Halite* for Partridge.
Before arriving at the great meeting
In the Thirtieth John S. Partridge , ad
dressed two other meetings in .districts
south of Market i street, the Thirty-fifth
and the Thirty-sixth. '\u25a0; In both of these
âone at the Mission Opera Hall and the
other at Harmony Hallâ the fusion can
didate and fiis colleagues on the ticket
were greeted by rousing cheers. \
The first hall visited by the candidate
was in the Thirty-fifth District, Mission
Opera Hall, and Mr. Partridge's entrance
was the signal for -an uproarious out
burst. The meeting was called to. order
by; William A.. Kelly of the fusion cam
paign commit toe.: v ; , V
; Kelly gave the audience the reasons
why, the Democrats and Republicans have
Joined. forces to remove from office men
.who have taken advantage of the people.
Hardly had Mr. Kelly ; begun when
Partridge . entered the hall and was
cheered until he reached the platform.
After he had taken his seat T. Cary Van
Fleet j was presented by Chairman Kelly.
-Van Fleet arraigned the forces of graft
working i openly in the City ,, Hall. He
deplored \ the cry "of class against class
raised by the opposition and charged that
Schmitz had giyen over the reins. of local
government to the : habitues of the Ten
derloin. He said that Abe RueC who
probably owned ' more real . estate -'than
was represented by the entire audience,
had walked into the limelight and an
nounced 'that he 1 was practically the ad
ministration. V .:
â¢ Van. Fleet aroused much laughter,
describing the , Board , of ; Public . Works
as the "board ! th.at works -the, pvTblic."
At this juncture a man at the rear of the
hall attempted > the only ; disturbance of
the evening and ! was summarily ejected.
Van Fleet closed .with a warm eulogy qt
John S. Partridge. '

fined his speech to a discussion of Mr.

\Vi Bourke Cockran. member of Congress from New York, returned from the Philippines yes

Arrives From
Manila
Opposes Retention
of Philippine
Islands
Thinks Intentions of
Roosevelt Are
Good.
W. Bourka Cockran arrived on tnÂ«
Japanese liner America Maru from the
Orient yesterday in his tour around the
world. It is the first time the New
York Congressman has visited the Pacitic
Coast. He started from his home" city
en May lo tor England, and proceeded
thence via the Suez canal to India. He
reached Manila on August 6 and . re
mained there twenty-five days, during
which time he looked into the situation
fully.
This investigation was entirely tor his
own personal knowledge, the noted Con
gressman explains. He -wished to ascer
tain, he says, whether his pronounced
\iews on the Philippine question werÂ«
*cli founded.
His views were not changed by his
visit and inspection. He has always been
opposed to the retention of the Philip
pines. But a duty is now Incumbent on
the United States, Cockran declared, and
he will do all h^ can to benefit the isl
ands. He asserted that the President
and Secretary Taft had the best inten
tions possible for :he welfare of the
Philippines, and he would help in carry
ing out these intentions, he said.
Immediately on his arrivaJ here Con
gressman Cockran was taken to the St.
. brands. He at or.cc called for copies or
'â¢he daily papers of the last weeks-i ssue.
In speaking of his trJp he said:

OPINION' UNCHANGED.
My opinions regarding the PhilSpjtlnes are
Unchanged. I wect 10 the iÃlanils to ascer

thoroughly into matters. I hayÂ« &:Â«eys been
opposed to the acquisition and retention of
the Philippine* and my visit there tn no way

Roosevelt and Mr. Taft have determined upon
a policy looking to retention and aa that
poliejr will undoubtedTy prevail I will 4o all

ihsi the plunderers, however, will come cut
on top. notwithstanding the efforts of the
President and Mr. Taft. The administration
wii; do everytnine it can for tbÂ« benefit of
the islanders, but I think the plunderers will
still get the best of it. It is the Intention
to rcrder the people of the islands the best

ADVERTISEMEyrS.
A Serious
MistaKe.
It is a serious thing to neglect
your heart.
The moment you detect any
weakness or irregularity, such
as short breath after exercise,
palpitation, fluttering, weak or
hungry spells, pain in breast,
side or shoulder, or uneasiness
when lying on left side, you
should take Dr. Miles' Heart
Cure; it rarely ever fails to
relieve all these symptoms.
If not promptly restored^
chronic heart disease soon de-
velops, and then it only remains
for some sudden strain to com-
pletely exhaust the heart.
Thousands of hopeless cases
have been cured, and if you do
not try it, it will be the great-
est mistake of your life.
"When I begun taking: Dr. Miles*
Remedies I was in a. very bad condi-
tion. I had Â»toms.ch trouble, with
**vere distress after eatlaÂ«r. My heart
hurt ne, and I had shortness of
breath, palpitation. My pulsÂ« was
Irregular, and my fees, ankles and
hands were swollen. Every month
at regular periods I hsvi severe pain.
I wrote Dr. Miles' Medical Co.. and
they advised me to take Dr. Miles'
Restorative Nervine and Heart Cure.
I soon noticed an improvement, and I
cntlnu^d the medicine until I was
completely curexL I feel like a- dif-
ferent person. In fact I have. not felt
so wen for 20 years."

GAXAL' TERMINALS
TO BE FORTIFIED
America Claims the Right
to Erect Adequate
Works.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 17. â Fortifica
tion of the terminals of the Panama
canal is one of Abe subjects to be con
sidered by Secretary Taft when he
makes his visit to the Isthmus, and for
this purpose -he will be accompanied
by members of the first committee of
the fortifications board.
Fortification of the canal was, for
bidden by the .first-. Hay-Pauncefote
treaty, but this treaty was so amended
by thÂ» Senate that" Great Britain re
jected it. The canal treaty which waa
finally adopted and Is now In force and
which superseded the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty has no mention of fortifications,
but docs allow the United States to. use
such military force as may be neces
sary to police and protect the canal.
As nothing is said regarding fortifica
tions this Government' assumes the
right to erect such works- as will ade
quately protect' the canal.

REMOVED FROM
CIVIL SERVICE
Positions Under the Cabinet
Officers \u0084Taken From the
List by the President
I WASHINGTON. Oct. IT. â An amend
ment to the civil "service rules, sweep
ing and comprehensive in its charac
ter, was authorized , to-day \by the
President. Hereafter a Cabinet officer
will have the power to remove, sum
marily and without hearing any civil
service employe in his department who,
to the personal knowledge of the head
*of the : department, has been guilty of
misconduct or who is inefficient in the
performance jof . his duties. By the
terms of. the amendmeent the Cabinet
officer must have personal knowledge
of ,the misconduct or inefficiency, of the
employe whom he proposes to . dis
charge. With this personal knowledge
the power of. the head of the depart
ment Is absolute. . , /
The amendment is one of the most
Important and' far-reaching made to
the civil -service rules in "many 'years.
It confers upon Cabinet- officers; prac
tically unlimited power, as "(to the per
sonnel of . their departments. The
amendment Is made to rule" XIL sec
tion i', .which' provides" that the ap
pointing officers in the executive civil
service shall report in detail , to the
Civil Service . Commission all changes
in their departments as soon as made
and the reasons for I making them.
Heretofore in every case of the re
moval of a civil service employe
charges had to be filed against the per
son whom it was proposed to remove
and - the employe was given time in
which to meet the charges with" such
defense as - he'' might have to make.
Under the authorized amendment such
a proceeding will not be necessary. A
head of a* department: may discharge
an employe for. misconduct or ineffi
ciency with the simple statement to
the Civil Service Commission that the
misconduct or inefficiency. Is a subject
of his personal observation. The dis
charged employe-will have no recourse.
While members of .the Cabinet fre
quently have discussed such an amend
ment to the civil service rules; as wai
authorized to-day, - the /subject was
brought- directly to. the attention of
President Roosevelt .recently* by the
misconduct, of- a -chauffeur of one of
ithe Government automobiles. -. The
driver of ' the automobile piloted his
machine directly. In the way of the
President's carriages and ,\ seemed . to
take, delight- In", cutting him out of . the
road. When the President learned who
the chauffeur was he" said he ought to
be discharged as. lncapable: of operat
ing, .the machine. The; subject was
pressed by members of the Cabinet and
the decision was reached to ."make thÂ«
amendment.: to the ; civil .service .rules
in order; that misconduct of a Govern
ment employe: might be made tha
cause for. Instant, dismissal. ...

M'CURDY
DEFIES THE
COMMITTEE
President of the Mutual
Life Insurance Company
Eef uses to Answer Ques
tions Put by Legislators
SPECTATOBS JEER
AT THE WITNESS
Testimony Brings Out Fact
That a Literary Bureau
; Was Employed to Boom
the Selling of Policies
NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â The testimony
in the Insurance investigation, which
was resumed to-day after a week's ad
journment of. the legislative , committee,
was moat, exciting and only repeated
threats by Senator Armstrong, chairman
of the, committee, to clear the room pre
vented violent demonstrations of disap
probation of the witness, who was Rich
ard A. McCurdy, president of the Mutual
Life Insurance Company. There were
Jeers at several periods of the \u25a0 day's tes
timony that temporarily interrupted the
proceedings. These came when Hughes,
counsel for the committee, asked ques
tions that McCurdy was reluctant to
answer or evaded.
In McCurdy's testimony to-day a fea
ture entirely new was disclosed and ; this
was that the Mutual Company
a literary bureau to send out to the press
of the country news matter that was of
benefit to the company. This information
was elicited during the probing of the
legal expense account. It came out when
a voucher for the payment of $2500 to
Joseph Howard Jr., in 1904, was produced.
Another voucher for the same amount,
paid in May, 1905, was marked "repayable
on demand" and "for professional ser
vices."
McCurdy had vised the vouchers. He
explained that Howard was a newspaper
correspondent and that his services con
sisted in syndicating news etories.
Pressed further, McCurdy said:
* "Mr. Howard was a correspondent for
the Boston Globe and several other pa
pers."
â¢ McCurdy said he paid Howard about
$2500 a year and that the voucher for
May, 1905, was "really a loan or an ad
vance."
REFUSES TO AJVSYVER QUESTION'S.
During the earlier session of the day
an attempt was made to obtain from Mc-
Curdy the reason for reducing the divi
dends on policies as the business in
creased and the assets piled up. This
questioning was prompted by the large
number of letters from policy holders by
the .committee. One policy for $3000, in
1876. dew a dividend of $55.76, but had
been gradually cut until in 1904 it re
ceived only $3. -\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 .. â¢
To all questions the witness said he
â¢was not fortified- with the Information
sought; that these- were not essential
matters and- : when ' pressed he \u25a0 refused
to discuss the question. He would prof
fer a witnessâ his actuary, whose busi
ness it was to know these thingsâ but as
for himself, he would not discuss the
question. â¢ - â¢
McCurdy's demeanor was so defiant
that the spectators bent forward to
catch every wdrd and \u25a0 stood on tip-toe,
expecting every moment to hear him
directed by counsel to answer the ques
tion. His proffer, of another witness was
all that prevented steps being taken to
ward his indictment:
When McCurdy would not offer the*
information himself, Hughes started on
another line of inquiry.. Later in the
day Chairman Armstrong explained
that since the information desired by
the committee could, be obtained by.
another course, it was agreebale to the
committee to let McCurdy place him
self in the position he did. Had he,
however, been directed to answer, and,
knowing the 'information desired, then
refused, Armstrong v said, steps would
have been taken to indict him for a
misdemeanor.
SCORES THE COMMITTEMEJT.
McCurdy also during the efforts to
induce him to answer the questions as
to the reduction of dividends launched
forth Into a protest as to the manner In
which the Investigation was being con
ducted." He .said the committee was
going beyond the scope intended when
It was appointed by the Legislature,
and that the investigation had assumed
the proportions of an Inquisition. He
was asked by Senator. Armstrong how
ne would conduct the investigation and
was told if h_e had any better method
the committee would be glad to know
of It. McCurdy said his answers were
published- in a distorted form, that ap
peared like an attempt to ruin him.
After takingrup, the questions of the
reduction of dividends, Hughes read a
long, list of policy, numbers that had
been paid and the dividends received by
the policy-holders. .'Asked what he had
to say to these, McCurdy said:
"Figures don't He, but liars can
figure."
: He hastily explained that he meant
that facetiously and that' he would be
very glad to verify the figures.
The legal expenses were again re
curred to and a- number of vouchers
were read. It was brought out that
"William Barnes Sr. of Albany had ap
peared before committee In Albany
last winter and had received $1000 from
the New York Life and the i same
amount from the Mutual. Later It was
brought out in a letter to McCurdy
from William Barnes Jr. ; that G. AI
arnes Sr. was under an annual re
tainer to the Mutual Life."
SUIT SETTLED OUT OF COURT.
A voucher in- 1902 for $10,000, payable
to T.'H- -Bowles, was explained by Mc-
Curdy as part payment in settlement of
I a suit Bowles : had brought against 'the

ALUMNI HOLD
A CELEBRATION
The alumni of St. Ignatius College had
last night of toe several devoted to the
celebration of the golden Jubilee of that
famous Catholic Institution of learning
as their own. -The exercises were held in
the college hall on Van Ness avenue,
which was packed to the doors. Several
eloquent speeches were delivered and they
all breathed love and praise for the alma
mater and for the system of education
pursued by her.
Judge. Jeremiah F. Sullivan was chair
man. The splendid college orchestra
rendered the musio, which had the swing
of a grand opera .symposium. Denis
O'Sulli van. an honored alumnus, sang.
â¢ The- Rev. M. P. Dowllng, S. J.,'presi
dent of Crelghton College of . Omaha, de
livered an address ; which carried all the
graces of oratory, his- sonorous voice
falling musically upon his hearers. He
said that under the Jesuit system of edu-.
cation the i heart . and the mind were
trained In harmony. .He compared edu
cation: and the enlightening of the human
mind to the creation, when the world was
brought . out of chaos and the darkness
separated .from the". light. . Wherever a
graduate . of St. Ignatius went, he said,
he could be proud of his training and his
religion. .
. John F. Brooke spoke interestingly of
'the old and new college. The fifty, years
of St. Ignatius history had been fifty
years of glory, he' said, and he expressed
a prophecy of her eternal greatness. The
mention of the names of .^veil-known in
structors of the* faculty brought pro
longed : cheers. '
Stanislaus A. Riley, speaking on "The
College of , the Future," drew a picture
of ; St. Ignatius' ; coming greatness when
departments of law, medicine and the
arts should be added; v beneficent laws
had removed the burden of taxation from
her ''and .''she numbered her students by
the thousands. r
Dr. James F. Smith", whose subject was
"Catholic College - Men and the Profes
sions," compared the elective system .of
college education and the '"more general
Christian^ education given by the Jesuits.
He said \u25a0 the " former was ; likely ; to pro
duce a narrowness of mind, while. the lat
ter fitted the graduate for the ' broadest
work.;â'"' '. -} - \u25a0\u25a0.â¢- \u25a0':\u25a0 \u25a0'. * : --. .
, Eustace Cullinan spoke forcibly on "The ,
College and the Citizen," Edward ' F.
Q'Day- read an original-; poem, "Alma
Mater": ; Arthur Weiss' rendered a.â¢violon
cello solo', and" the Elks'* quartet sang.

BOYCOTTING
WAS WAGED
Vice Consul Arnold Writes
Very Interesting^ Letter
to President Wheeler hi
Regard to Chinese Trade
Â«
GAYS EMPIRE WAS
SINGULARLY UNITED
Intense Feeling Was Abated
as Result of Assurances
From America of Milder
Exclusion Requirements
BERKELEY, Oct. 17.â Important and
Taluabie light is thrown upon the ques
tion of the boycott by Chinese of
American goods in a letter from
Julian Arnold. Vice Consul at
Shanghai, received by President
Benjamin Itie Wheeler of the State Un
lvcr.sity. Arnold graduated from the uni
versity in I>.i2. He was a protege of
Professor John Fryer, tiie head of the
dtpartment of Oriental languages at the
university, and partly through Professor
Fryer's influence was made a Govern
ment official in China, stationed at
Shanghai. His opportunities for observ
ing ' the workings of the now celebrated
boycott, in which American trade was
â¢eriously affected, were of the best, and
be has embodied a description of the boy
â¢cott that constitutes, in the opinion of
the university authorities, a valuable
contribution on the subject. The letter
Is as follows:
Dear President Wheeier: Knowing that you
are interested in affairs in China and feeling
that I am In a uecuii&rly favorable position
to keep io touch with changing conditions, I
take this opportunity to write a few Ifnes
cerctrning the "boycott."
Three months ajo all threats of a boycott
en the part of the Chinese were regarded as
unworthy of serious consideration. The Chl-
Be?=e had never before 6hown any disposition
to fa:: In line and kee;> ttep. so a united
China was almost beyond the comprehension
of even the oldest forfign residents. In ordet
to make a boycott effrctiv* united a<Mion it
necessary. V.'ho wou'.d have btlieved that It
were possible for the Chinese merchants, stu
dents. Rentry and common populace to lay
â¢tide personal interests and with one accord
jcin a common cause? When on the 20th
day of Juiy. the day set for the boycott ti
go into effect. te>Kram= poured into Shanghai
from all over China, etating that the outports
had fallen into line, then it began to look as
though a united CJiina were a reality.
MOVEMENT WIDESPREAD.
The native press, the student organizations
and the guilds were the prtrae factors in bring
ing about unity of action. Public meetings,
attended by women ac well as by men, ad
<JreÂ«*ed by merchants, students and gentry,
placards posted everywhere, reciting the harsh
and cruel tre&tnitct dealt out to Chinese in :
America <Â£nd grossly exaggerated), appealing
to the people to retaliate by refusing to tradt
in American f-.-V.s and likening those who d&
trade in such goods to do^s. pigs and turtles;
newspapers publishing letters from all over the
empire, as mU as from Chinese in America,
alto issuing lists of goods, trade marks and
firms to be boycotted, and themselves refusing
to carry American advertisements; also giv
ing full accounts of all public meetings,
pamphlets, circulars and ftudent publications
cent broadcast all over China, reciting the
necessity for a united retaliation; resolutions
passed by local chambers of commerce, regu
lating- Â»sji and means of effecting the boy
cott and pledee* signed by business house,
havinp dealings with American firms renounc
ii:fr all sffh connections : these were the Sn
etruments hlch rendered the boycott a reality.
The American business houses are unanimous
in their declaration that business was at an
â¢ bkolute standetin frcm the -'"'th of July until
w ith'ji two v. r eks ago. when the atmosphere

market incident to the t)Ofcott " (ten million
dollars' worth of American cotton goods wtre
in warehouses no: allowed to be touched en
accpunt of the boycott, while thirty millions
more were- contracted for future delivery);
these, then, were the .factor* which made tor
the breaking of the boycott. â¢;'..''-
I firmly believe that no single one of these
factors in itself could heve been "flffctive. The
boycott bad got Â«>ntire!y beyond the control of
the respcr.s'ible classes, those who had financial
interests at stake, ir.to the hands of the stu
dent class, end frÂ»r a long time Jt locked ac

Goverr.Tr.cr.t would have to be resorted to.

The most important e>rrÂ»â¬nt in the 'utura
growth and progress of China Is the student
class. China has always recognized the effl

fees. Under the 'new law tt makes mÂ« reg
istrar of deaths, births ana mtrrlaees, and It
ha-- not the yower to do it. I appointed a
deputy to do this work, which he does at
eights end I shall see to It that he gets pay
lor what he does or I shall not aek him to
do !t. The law provides that this work shall
be paid for, but ihe District Attorney decides
that I am not entitled to pay. for tne reason
that It would increase my salary. This I deny
for I would not set a cent of it and it would
sin.j.>iy go for the payment of a new officer
created by th* last Legislature.
What action the State officers will take
in regard to the matter remains to be
seen. County Recorder Grim, howeve*-,
says that he is determined that he will
not have It done free of charge for the
county, and makes the further point that
the office of Registrar is a new Â«fflce
created by the last Legislature, and while
he is named for the position he cannot
be made to accept it.
STUDENTS NOT TO
BE "BAWLED OUT"
President Wheeler Prevents
Proposed Plan to Shame
Delinquent Folk.
BERKELEY, Oct. 17.â President Wheel
er does not look with favor upon the idea
of students being "bawled out." as goes
the college phrase, when they have failed,
for any reason, to .pay their assessment
of $5 for the Blue and Gold annual which
the junior class publishes each year.
Manager A. C. Hastings, who handles
the finances of the Blue and Gold, recent
ly Issued a notice, which the college pa
pers printed, informing all concerned that
failure to promptly pay the $5 assessment
would result in the printing of the names
of delinquents on the campus billboards
and elsewhere.
President Wheeler took cognizance of
the matter, sent for Manager Hastings
and gently but firmly informed him that
the proposed "bawling out" of delin
quents would not be permitted. Hastings
assured the president that an over-zeal
ous assistant was responsible for the
faux pas and the incident closed. CvV

positions. American influence in the educa
tional work In China Is paramount. Not many
months -go at an educational conference in
Shanghai it was stated by one who knew that
!>O per cent of the educational work carried
on by foreigners in China is done by Ameri
cans. Naturally the Chinese look to Aderica
as the. fountain of learning, and for many
years America received the largest quota of
her students goln? abroad. - .
What docs this mean? It simply means
that when these American educated Chinese
youth* return to China and are appointed to
oHicial positions, their attitude toward prob-
Urn* having to do with America will be, in
a creat measure. Influenced by the impres
sions which they had received abroad. Would
it not be wise on the part of America If,
for no other reason than purely commercial
reasons, to offer special Inducements to these
prorpectlve rulers of Cblna?
When they arrive in San Francisco or Se
attle, they should be met at the dock by a
committee specially appointed to receive them.
They should then be Introduced by the com
mittee to a bit of America's hospitality. Every
facility should be placfd in their hands where
with to choos* the best that America may
have to offer In the way of educational ad
vantages.
Such treatment as this would result In the
moet effective kind of. missionary work. The
students would then return to China thorough
ly Impressed by the excellent advantage ac
corded them while In America and I dare
say. It would have much to do with the atti
tude they might In the future assume when
dealing with Americans either In an official
or In a commercial capacity.
I believe it in the Intention of the Govern
ment when making a new exclusion treaty to
provide that passports when properly stamped
ty a Chinese official and vlÂ«d by an Ameri
can consular official are to be priroa' facie
evidence of right to entry. This will do much
toward eliminating many of the objectionable
features obtaining in the present system. There
is no reason why this cannot be done, even
though It may necessitate appointing a special
commissioner to fee attached to the consulate
at Â«on\f Important port In China, aa Shanghai.
I have no doubt that the American people are
now sufficiently awakened to the necessities of
this problem to Insure a wise solution of all

HIDES HIS WOUND
TO AVOID SCOLDING
Boy Shot yonv on Sunday Suffers Two
LJcxyo 111 A-Jicral Fain.
BULLET PIERCES ONE OF HIS FEET
OAKI.AND. Ofit. 17. â Fearing punish
ment because he had gone out hunting
on- Sunday agrainst the commands of
his motherl Oliver Harris/ the 13-year
old son of Mrs. L F. Harris of 263
Tenth street, for two dayH bore the pain
of a bullet hole through his foot rather
than confess to his mother that he had
been disobedient. \u0084
It was only when the pain became so
great that ho could nor. place his foot
on the ground thut ho told of his In
jury, :md then he said that he, had
stepped on a nail. When the wound
was dressed at. the Receiving- Hospital,
however, the boy confessed to the sur
geons that the holu in his foot had been
made by a bullet last Sunday. \u25a0 \u25a0\u0084 *
On that day early in the morning
Oliver asked his mother If he could jro
hunting: with George Guild, who Jives
with his parents at Eleventh and Web
ster streets, but was told that he could
not go on Sunday. Disregarding his
mother's command, -.he slipped from the
house and went out to the Berkeley
hills .with young Guild and another boy.
About 11 o'clock the trio sjit down to"
rest, laying their only firearm, a 22
caliber rifle, on a fence. J
Harris *>aw. a bird in the brush/and
in his hurry to get the gun knocked It
from the fence, and as it struck the
ground the- weapon was discharged, the
bullet piercing the boy's left foot and.
inflicting a painful wound. Oliver
walked nearly five miles to the neareat
car line, and on arriving home said
nothing about the accident, and it was
not until 8 o'clock last night that his
mother noticed that he was limping and
asked him the cause. The rest of thÂ«s
story Is best told In the boy's own
words: \u25a0
"When I wrp first shot the hole In my
foot did not hurt at all. and it stopped,
bleedinsr In a few minutes: so I thought
I would not' tell my mother, because I
thought she would whip me for going
hunting alter ?he told me not to. I
didn't say anything about being hurt
until last night, and then I told my
mother that I had stepped on a nail.
"Mamma took me to the hospital, and
after thÂ£ doctor looked at the place
where the bullet hit me he said the hole
was not made by a nail, and then I tolil
them how It happened."
The wound ip the boy's foot was bad
ly infected from the long neglect, and
the hospital surgeons fear that blood
poisoning may pet in. They say, how
ever, that unless this happens there Is
no danger.
tey to Identify
andrews' paramoue
Police Try to Fathom Secret
of the .Newspaper
Picture.
BERKELEY, Oct. 17.â Attempts of the
police to establish the Identification of a
newspaper picture of Julian Ward as the
female companion of Milton Andrews
were continued to-day, when Mrs. A. M.
Roberts, who owns the house occupied
by Andrews and the -woman at 2214 Ells
worth street, was asked to Â«ay whether
the picture of Julian Ward . resembles
the woman who accompanied -Andrews to
Berkeley. .';\u25a0;. >
Mrs. Roberts was not able to positively
identify the picture, saying, as did Wil
liam Ellis and S. B. Kentfleld yesterday,
that the picture resembled the Andrews
woman \ slightly, but could hardly be re
garded as a likeness.
Marshal Vollmer has hot at any time
believed that the Julian Ward certainly
is the woman who 1b with Andrews, but
has worked upon this particular clew,
as upon others, with the intention of
overlooking no source of information
that might serve to identify Andrews'
"wife."
Mrs. Roberts informed the police to
day that the woman who was with An
drews ' was slightly stoop shouldered,
walked with toes turned in, wore her
clothes with but little grace, and was a
thorough slave of Andrews, cooking and
washing constantly for him.
Marshal Vollmer informed the hospital
people who are caring for Ellis that he
will make no attempt to detain Ellis
when the latter has recovered sufficiently
to" be moved. Vollmer beliej/es Ellis to
be nothing more than one of ' Andrews',
victims, stating positively his conviction
that Ellis was a dupe and not an accom
plice of Andrews, in the latter^ murder*
ous, thieving- plans.

BRINGING TIES
FOR NEW ROAD
Western Pacific Is Rush
ing Preparations for Work
of Constructing Line
OAKLAND, Oct. 17.â While the di
rectors of the Western Padflo Railroad
have not yet made public the rout* of
the road from the city limits of Oak
land to Nlles, the ' preparations for
starting the work of construction are
being rushed and ties are being dis
charged at the wharves of Boole's ship
yards at the foot of Adeline street.
The company has no wharf on' its
water front property, but the ties are
being discharged at ithe Boole wharves
and are rapidly . being transferred to
the adjoining property of the company.
Already the company has secured
rights of way to Niles, but the exact
route between that town and Oakland
has not yet been decided upon and
great interest has been aroused among
the residents of this section of the
county. Persistent rumors that the
company has purchased " the Derby
tract; extending from Park street to
Fruitvale avenue and from Division
street to East Fourteenth street, are
denied by B. M. Derby, president of
the Derby Estate Company, who sa4d
to-day:
We own seventy acres Just outside the city
limits, but we have never been approached
by any authorized agent of the railroad com
pany. No deal for the property has been
made, but the company's engineers - have run
lines in all directions through the property.
Lines have been run even through the land on
which my home stands. We know as little
about the company's plans as any one else.
J. T. Williams, engineer of the West
ern Pacific for this division, has estab
lished headquarters in the Abrahamson
building at Thirteenth and Washing
ton streets, and he has half a dozen
assistants at work on ( the plans and
grades. These engineers are continu
ing to make surveys In .all directions
between ' Nlles and the city limits of
Oakland. , .

OALAND. Oct. 17. â During the summer the
studio is deserted and â¢ Its . occupant revels in
nature's loveliness, in sunny mountain glades.

away for several months is Miss De Neale
Morgan. She spent the summer at Carmel-by

things" were assembled- this year, and has
brought back a large j number of canvases.
Miss Morgan is a great favorite in Oakland,
and the exhibit she la planning to give soon
is of much interest. Her â¢ sketches will be
exhibited under the auspices 'of the Palette.

lic for one week, beginning November 13.
Mrs. M. Fancber Pettis is also recently re
turned from * San Jose and vlelnlty, not only
with a number of new pictures, but covered
with glory. Mrs. Pettis Is particularly happy
In depleting the great -redwoods so dear to
those familiar with their beauty, and the suc

City recently was a nattering tribute to her
skill. :
On December 4, S and 6, five ' clever Cali

PEACE TKEATY IS
; PROFESSOR'S SUBJECT
Bernard Moses Discusses Pos
sible Effects of | japan's \u25a0
War With Russia.
BERKELEY, Oct. 17.â Professor Ber
nard Moses, former Philippine Commis
sioner, now a distinguished member of
the university faciulty, addressed the col
lege of commerce last night upon the
subject of the Russo-Japanese treaty.
His conclusions were expressed as fol
lows:
The treaty Is especially Important in that It
opens up a new phase of Oriental politics. -The
question now is, 'NVhat will result when Japan
learns her own strsAth? Conquest breeds fur
ther conquest. :. Japan now has a wonderful op
portunity for conquest. â¢
Whether, we consider the relations between
the different races in India,. Java, the Philip
pines, or the Southern States, there is every
where essentially the same problems present
ed; and when > the greater freedom of inter
course Is established between the United States
and the Japanese another; phase of the same
problem will be brought to the attention of the
inhabitants of European ; descent in America.
Thus.- while a3 a result of the war the "white
peril" no longer looms for. the Chinese or the
Japanese on their horizon, the peoples of the
West are brought face to race as never before
with the far-reaching and undetermined issues
involved in the closer relations of Europeans
and Asiatics.

representations made by various pub
lic bodies interested in the matter and
to citizens who had sites they desired

places was made by the commission. :
The result of the commission's meet-
Ing was a decision" to put the" matter

ORDERS RELEASE
OF MRS. MILLER
Woman Accused of Perjury
by Her Brother -in - Law
Given Freedom in Sauaslito
SPITE WORK IS ALLEGED
District Attorney Boyd Says
There Is Absolutely No
Foundation for Complaint
" Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUSALJTO. Oct. 17.â Mrs. Ella F.
Miller, who was arrested in San Fran
ciaco yesterday upon a complaint sworn
to by her ' brother-in-law, Henry F. A.
Miller, before Judge Pryor several days
ago, charging her with perjury, and re
leased last night by the police depart
ment upon a cash ball of $250 being de
posited by her friends, appeared before
Judge Pryor for arraignment to-day.
Judge Pryor, who would not have issued
the warrant j had he known that Judge
Magee of San Rafael Township had re^
fused one on the advice of District At
torney Boyd, . felt grieved over the mat
ter and told Mrs. MMler that the case
was continued indefinitely. He ordered
the : cash . bail returned to her and per
mitted her. to go on her own recogni
zance. District Attorney Boyd said this
evening:
The advisability of having Mrs. Miller ar
rested for perjury was discussed in my office
g( me time ago and I was urged to hare a
warrant issued. There Is nothing whatever
upon which to lay thÂ« foundation for a crim
inal complaint and I flatly refused to sanction
the issuance of a warrant. Judge Magee re
fused to do so and Miller awaltjd the return
of Judge Pryor from the East to have him
issue one. I- bellev* it is \u25a0 a piece- of spite
work and I shall move for a dismissal ct tne
complaint. . . "\u25a0\u25a0
Judge Pryor said this afternoon:
If I had known that this man Miller lived
In Kentflelfl^and had applied to Judge Magee
for a warrant and been refused, I also would
have refuse* him one. If I had known
what I know about the case now, the war
rant would not have been Issued. I was under
the Impression . that Miller was a resident of
this town otherwise I would have learnÂ«d his
reasons for not applying to the Justice of his
township.

WITH DOCTORING MILK
Eugene Lent, attorney, Jiad
George W. Smart proprietor
of the New York dairy, ar
rested yesterday on a -charge of
using formaldehyde in milk sold
by him for use of the complain
ant's children. Lent's* two lit
tle girls, aged two and four
years, were nearly killed from
drinking the milk, he says. Pri
vate chemists found ihe danger
ous preservative in it.
Attorney Eugene Lent
Causes Arrest of
George Smart.
Says His Babies Were
Nearly Killed by Im
pure Fluid.
A_ practical step toward damming the
flt*Ml of impure milk that householders
complain is being poured into the homes
of the city was taken yesterday by Eu
gene L*:u, attorney, Crocker building,
when he swore to a complaint for the
enest of a prominent dairyman on the
charge of supplying him with adulterated
milk at his homo. 1050 Eddy street.
George %V. Smart, who conducts the New
YÂ«,-rk dairy on San Jose avenue, is the
dealer complained of.
It is alleged ihat milk left at the L/ent
residence for the consumption of the at
ttrneys two little girls contained for
maldehyde. The children were made so
ill that they were confined to 'their beds
for several days. One of them only got
up yesterday. She was so badly affected
that she threw up blood in retching and
her life was almost despaired of at one
time.
Smart was notified of the warrant
against him and he appeared voluntarily
before Police Judge Cabaniss and was
released on 520 cash bail. He said he
knew nothing of the formaldehyde being
In the milk sold by him. His case will
be called this morning.
Attorney Lent says he notified Dr.
Ward of the Health Board of. the dis
covery of the doctored milk on October
12 and that as no action was taken
against Smart by Ward, he swore out
the v.-arrant. Lent's story Is as follow;s:
Myself, wife and two little srirls. Ruth,
aired 2, and Frances, 4, returned on the first
of the month Iron: Saa Mateo, where we had
been for five months. The little girls were
fat and in th* pink of health. We had bc-en
home but a few days when both the children
begin to fall in health and complain of lack
of ap;>etite. They grew wor*e and took to
retchJT-K violently. Kuth vomiting- up blood.
They were unable to retain anything on their
stomachs.
TAKES MILK TO CHEMISTS.
tVe called in Dr Hoffman, who said thÂ«
little ones were suffering from acute gastritis.
They took to their beds and for two or three
days were unable to take anything in the
shape of food at all. The doctor went over
the diet they had been used to and said that
he found nothing that looked as if it would
injure tfcem. unless it was the milk.
We are receiving each morning from Smart
& quart of milk in a bottle especially for the
children. On the morning of the 11th I took
the bctt!e of milk that had been left that
day, and, without opening It, turned it over
to Thoma* Price & Son, the chemists. The
next day they submitted a report that the
fluid was normal !n all respects excepting
that it contained formaldehyde.
I at once telephoned to Dr. Ward, notifying
him of this fact, and he said something about
the inspectors being very active in investigat
ing the city'Â« milk supply. Then I waited
for him to do something, but no action was
taken. I resolved then to swear out the war
rant against Smart myself.
At the health office the records show*
that the last notification Smart received
from the department was on October 7,
which notice stated that his milk had
been found "one point off," according to
the inspection of Dr. William H. Hassler,
chief sanitary Inspector, on the night Of
September 26. It was announced at the
health office that Smart's milk bore an
excellent reputation in the department.
SMART NOT NOTIFIED.
Health Officer Ragan was questioned
as to why nothing had been said to Smart
after the notification to Ward that
Smart's milk had been found by chemists
outside the department to contain for
maldehyde In such quantity as to al
most cause the death of two babies. He
replied that the matter had been turned
over to Sanitary Inspector Hassler with
Instructions to make a report. That re
port had not been turned in. however.
Dr. Ragan said also that he notified
George Ruparich, his stenographer, yes
terday to write a letter to Smart, in
structing him to come to the health of
fice and explain about the formaldehyde.
Ruparlch said he had not heard the order
given and therefore the letter had not
been written.
The arrest of Smart was made under
a law passed by the last Legislature,
making it a misdemeanor, punishable
by fine of not less than $10 nor more than
1230 or by Imprisonment for not less than
ten nor more than 100 days, to put for
maldehyde or other preservatives men
tioned into milk used for human con
sumption. Formaldehyde is used to pre
vent milk turning sour. When taken into
the human stomach it arrests digestion
and brings on gastritis.

Evidence in Young Case
TELLS OF INSPECTIONS
Says He Never Served in the
En gine-Koom ot Ship Until
Ordered to the Bennington
Special Dispatch" to The Call.
- VALLKJO, Oct. 17.-â The mostVinter 7
esting day of the court-martial of Cora
jnander Lucien Young of ; the Benning
ton was to-day's: session, which wit
nessed the appearance of; Ensign
Charles T. Wade of- the ill-fated 'war
ship on the witness stand.' Although
Wade has been sick almost unto death
since the terrible explosion, he apr
peared well and strong while on the
stand. He refused to answer, many
questions, as they might .be used
against him in his court-martial, which
is to follow that of his commanding
officer.' Â« \u25a0-'
In answer to a quentlon by .ludae
Advocate West, Wade tttuted he had bud
no enslneerlng experience aboard . ship
previous) lv bring asalened to thc'Beh
uliiK<on on Octqber 'Â£2,'- 11)0-1, and that
be was in ooimnund of the engine-room
of the ship from that date until July 21.
Wade testified that the boilers of the
Bennington had -been tested /at the
Bremerton navy- yard about* a . year
ago and that lateivboiler A was tested
at Magdalena Bay with a pressure up
to 200 pounds.- Wade stated ,that on
the morning of the explosion the boilers
were filled with water from a lighter
â¢and that he had given orders to the
chief machinist to start the \u25a0 hydro
kimeters on boilers A and B when the
water showed in the gauge glasses. He
said that he ordered the i fires, started
slowly in order' to raise 125, pounds of
steam by 1 p. m. that day. The hydro
kimeters were started about 7 a. m. and
were supposed to be in good condition.
Wade said he knew of no reason why
steam should forri quicker in boiler B
than A, unless" the 'fires were stronger.
The steam gauge had been turned at
9:50 a. m. and at that hour there was
about 120 pounds of steam. . Water
tender Hunt was relieved from watch
about 9a. m. by De Curtoni.
Wade stated that he had made ad
verse reports on the boilers in the log
of the ship previous to the explosionâ
first, the boilers were fair, then good
and lastly poor.
A soiled sheet of paper from the log
book, dated July "21, was handed to
Wade and he identified it as .one found
by him in the ship on the day follow
ing the explosion. Its contents were
not stated, but it was admitted as evi
dence. Regarding Sunday inspection,
Wade remembered not more than five,
his station on Sunday being with the
deck division and he did not go below
except by order of .. the executive of
ficer. Wade qualified this statement by
saying that shortly after Young joined
the Bennington he had accompanied his
commanding officer on an inspection of
/the engineering department.., ,
The day after the explosion Wade
visited the engine-room with Fred
erickson. They found the main and.
auxiliary stops of boiler B I closed.
Frederlckson found that the main stop
of boiler B would not open and at
tempted toknock It off with a wrench,
but could not do so. Asked if he were
aware of. the regulation which de
mands' that the stops ; and cocks be
moved orice a week; when not under
steam, Wade; answered only after a
long wrangle , between "; the counsels
that he was, but that Young had never
called his attention to this rule. The
rule had been carriedout. .
At the morning Bession Lieutenant
Commander Bartlett completed his testi
mony and appeared In an entirely dif
ferent mood than on the day previous.
HeTsald that he was willing to answer
the questions to which there had been
objection on the day previous. There
was little discussion over this admis
sion and the defense smiled confidently
and said that as the ( board desired no
further expert testimony from Bartlett
that they would not, inferring that they
believed that .Bartlett had been dis
credited as an expert. .
After Bar lie tt had completed his tes
timony, Judge, Advocate AVest arose and
announced tAat, vtithout suggestion
from any one,' he bad sent a telegram
to the Navy Department requesting that
on the conclusion of Bartlett's - testi
mony be 'be retained :as an assist
ant counsel . for. the prosecution.^ The
department had. wired Its assent. Thus
xfmn briery explained : -what had been
heralded as an, attempt of the Navy De
partment to convict Young by furnish
ing additional talent \u25a0 for the prosecu
tlon.\/. \u0084\ -.- ;.\u25a0:_. V \u25a0.;'-' _- \u25a0'\u25a0 :] : :'T'-4^:^

CHICAGO WOMEN
SOLD ABROAD
CHICAGO, Oct. 17.â Traffic Â»in ' young
women purchased in Chicago for prac
tical sale in all parts of the Empire of
China has been discovered by local Fed
eral and police authorities, , but i thus far
no law' has been found prohibiting the
exporting of American women to foreign
countries. THe police are In possession
of\he names of two women, one In Chi
cago and another . in Shanghai,' China,
who' are thought to be leaders in the
practice. ,
The plan used in the operation of the
alleged rine was. it is believed, to, first
hire unsuspecting women, tempting, them
with lurid stories of wealth in the Orient.
A position of maid or high servant In
wealthy Chinese families Is said to have
been -the bait offered. -Tp bind the con
tract the j applicant for position was told
that her traveling and living expenses
would be paid and all the clothing neces
sary furnished. - \u25a0 ..
When the women reached, China- they
were immediately placed under guard and
sent to the purchasers; who had previous
ly paid from" $500 to $1000 for each. Many,
are - supposed ' to be held In â¢ palaces of
wealthy Chinese under heavy guards.

PIRATES LOOT
SCOW SCHOONER
Bay pirates robbed the scow schooner
Aetna last night as she lay anchored near
\u25a0 the Arctic Oil Works. After beating
Captain John Daly on the head with a
club and covering Fred Johnson with a
revolver, they robbed the craft of its
provisions and also found $2 50 in their
search.
There were eight; men in the band and
they pulled up in the schooner in c. row
boat. Four of them : boarded the Aetna
and when Captain Daly came out to see
who the visitors were one of the pirates
felled him with a club. A man who wore
a mask covered JohnSon with a re
volver and threatened to kill him if be
made an outcry. -
Two of the gang, armed with pick axes,
led the search of the schooner for loot.
Chests were torn open and every article
: of any value was packed into sack 3 and
taken away. \u25a0
After satisfying themselves that they
had despoiled the craft of all its loot the
four joined their companions in the row
boat and disappeared "â¢ in the dark. The
two sailors were warned to make no out
cry, and fearing - the . threats of tha
thieves, obeyed the warning.
The robbery occurred about 8:30 In the
evening, and about -an hour . later Daly
reported it to the Potrero police station.
A squad of policemen- under command
of Sergeant McGovern were sent out to
run down the pirates. - Neither Daly nor
Johnson could give satisfactory descrip
tions of the men, as -it was too dark to
scrutinize them. \u25a0 \u25a0 ' _ . .'" *\u25a0

A LAWLESS CITY.
HAS any one torn or defaced, a Schmitz banner? No. Has
any one displaced a Schmitz sign, or even one of those pic
tures of the Mayor which adorn the saloons of the city, and
give a delirium tremens effect to the place? No. The lawful free
dom of, campaign banners, signs, tokens, streamers and pictures is
respected by the decent people who oppose the Mayor in his cam
paign for the re-election of Mr. Ruef. Has any one stoned and
hooted the brass bands which play' the Mayors own musical com
positions at his meetings? No.
The provocation is^great, but even the Mayor's compositions
arc pumped into the public ear by the trombone, and it is not re
sented. The band that plays at the music stand in Golden Gate
Park, for a consideration, and for all the people, advertises the
Mayor and promotes his cause on its printed programme, and, al
though the public concert is supposed to be a musical entertain
ment, the band plays the Mayor's compositions, his opponents do
not even cast a ripe cat at it.
On the other hand, the Mayor's supporters have torn down and
defaced the Partridge banners and signs. In doing this they are
not merely indecent. They violate the law. They have done it in
broad daylight, and the police have calmly looked on with no effort
to do their duty. The union bands playing at the Partridge meet
ings have been hooted, stoned and had mud and muck thrown at
them, and the police have not interfered. Mr. Ruef, for whose re
election the Mayor is making a whirlwind campaign, spoke from 8
o'clock until past the hour when graveyards sit up and yawn, on
Monday, at the Alhambra Theater, and in the course of his longi
tudinal" effort said it was: "No wonder that the Partridge banners
had been torn down by true American citizens, who are the sup
porters of Schmitz."
All these things teach and exhort. It is true Americanism, ac
cording to the Mayor and Ruef, to stone brass bands and tear down
the banners of the opposition to the Mayor. It is true Americanism,
according to Mr. Ruef, to deny to another the rights you claim for
yourself. It is true Americanism, as Mr. Ruef sees it, to make the
streets of San Francisco unsafe for*everybody except the supporters
of the Mayor. No doubt "Mr. Ruef thinks it also true Americanism
to stuff ballot boxes and pollute the franchise in the interest of the
Mayor's party and politics, and the three stuff ers who are wearing
stripes in San Quentin are martyrs to true Americanism.^
In view of these vandalistic outrages the citizens of San Fran
cisco know what to expect if Mr. Ruef is re-elected to his position of
boss of the city. The ripping of banners and stoning of brass bands
is something more than a violation of campaign amenities. It is a
startling symptom of the deep-seated diseases of disorder with
which the city has been infected by Schmitz and Ruef. It is a part
of the general recklessness and rottenness that has been propagated
by the city administration. It is a system that strengthens the arm
of every thug and thief. It is a school of crime, as much as that
of Fagin, who began by teaching the "faking of wipes" and ended
in the high school of burglary and murder.
It is done by the Mayor just as much as if he put his own hand
to the work. The spirit of the Mayor's campaign is shown in word
and deed to be lawless. At his party meeting on Monday night at
Bear Hall, in the Fortieth. District, the Mayor's chairman in his in
troductory speech said: "The law is made by the rich to oppress
the poor. Wait till the Union Labor party gets into power." That
anarchistic expression is not rebuked by. the Mayor: It is in line
with his own policy and acts. He is under oath to enforce the char
ter and ordinances. The charter was adopted by the vote of the
people, of the whole people, not by "the rich." But the spirit of the
Mayor and his supporters revolts against the law which he is sworn
to support and enforce.
It all means that if Mr. Ruef is re-elected and the Mayor is his
marionette, their will and wish will take the place of the law. That
is the situation now. Does any one suppose that the police refuse
to enforce order and protect the equal rights of all citizens of their
own motion? They are inspired to snub their duty by the admin
istration, which can fix stars and unfix them.
THE COUNT CONDEMNS US.
COUNT MOLYNSKI of Welhynion has condemned most of
the American people. He is a Russian Count, and after a
tour of the West, including San Francisco, declares that our
Western "people are impossible. They are not at all cultured and
do not know what politeness means. The servants, car conductors
and others of that class are insolent." " i
This is too bad. We have of course been in training on purpose
to please this stemwinder Count, and we have failed miserably, for
he finds us "impossible." The impolite car conductors, without
apologizing, no doubt demanded his ticket and punched it just like
a plebeian ticket and gave it back unfolded and mussed up. But
his wrath is not poured on them alone. We are all impossible, and
.without culture. The contrast with Russia is of course painful. In
that country all of the people are "possible." They, are all cultured.
One may travel from Vladivostok to St. Petersburg in the midst of
a general culture in which all of the people share;
They are almost classical. The Government sees to it that they
are learned and polite. They are deep in all of the philosophies,' the
arts and sciences. They just revel and wallow in belles-lettres, and
think and talk in the terms of scholarship and high attainment. All
of this is due to the White Czar, who goes about on foot among his
scholarly and polite people, discussing science and letters with them
and always as safe as if he were resting on his imperial pillow. He
is able on account of the high culture of his subjects ,to omit all pre
cautions for his personal safety.
The scholars who "compose his empire love to indulge in aca
demic discussion with him, and he may often be seen sitting on the
cracker barrel at the corner grocery whittling a stick and discussing
the precession of the equinoxes with the clerk. >
Yes, Russia is ideal in the generality of culture and the polite
ness of the people. That is why she always prevails in every un
dertaking. She has just given Japan a sound thrashing in the war,
because of the high learning and intelligence of the people, -and has
taught theother nations that if they wish to be great in peace and
victorious in war they must begin by making their people "possible"
and cultured and polite.

A. J. WATERHOUSE
<Aa Eastern dispatch announces that a cer
tain well-known woman is- attempting to en
ter the "Smart Set" and' has "bepmlwr
campaign -by joining a fashionable . church.")
ITOOK my Bible from the shelf and
scanned it quite, a while. ' : j
For I sought for' some suggestion of
the latest church style;
I lodged to know how r should have re
- ligion's garment planned, ".\u25a0".//
So I could cut a social; dash / and with
"the angels' stand; ' %ss&.
I humbly trusted I should find Borne in
formation there, "
To tell me, when I* go to church,' the
"latest styles" to wear. \
/ But this, "fashionable church," ' '
It left me in the lurch; /. -/.-
The Bible had no etiquette to point me to
/ my. perch, . , -
And I'm filled with dreadful fear,
As I sadly wander here.
Lest the style cf clothes I'm wearing my
unlaundered soul shall smirch;
For the book the world is needing .and
has , never found as yet
Is "A Handbook of Religion and a Guide
to Etiquette."
There is a psalmâ it does not run: "The
heavens do declare
The glory 'of our so'v' reign God and teU
you what to wear."
There are the sweet Beatitudes â I find no
where in mine:
"Blessed is he who's up on styles; the
church will help' him shine,"
I read the first shall be the last, but
nowhere do I see ;.
A statement that a fashion-plate shall
prove bright heaven's key;
And this church that's run in style,
It has puzzled me a while.
You see, I thought the church was meant
to help the poor and vile, /
But now, of course, I know ,
That it really isn't so : - .
Unless you wear salvation in a manner
to beguile.
I wish I had the Bible of the "fashionable
church,"
For mine, I note, is out of date, and
leaves me in the lurch.
In this old book that I have here I read
the story how / v-,V'; -S
One had not where to lay his headâ a
tramp we'd call him nowâ
I read of how, o'er ways of grief, he
walked to find his own, /.:;'
While scribes their church of fashion
sought and left him quite alone.
The pathos of that life divine the roll
ing years have toldâ
Vagrant and wand'rer if . you please, but
still man's guide of old.
The Man of Sorrows ne'er
Built a church of fashion here;
He'd a whip for money-changers and for
hypocrites a sneer, Â»
And the "Smart Set" of his day
Held him quite a space away; .
Or, at least, within my Bible thus the
story dsth appear;
And, to state the matter frankly, I am
owner of a thought
That a fashionable setting won't Improve
the code he taught.
A RECORD UNNECESSARY.
"But do you keep no record of the deed 3
and the utterances of the men and wo
men who are known on earth as 'knock
ers'?" the visitor inquired.
"No; I find it unnecessary," the Re
cording Angel responded.
"But you keep a record of thelives of
all other human beings?':' .-;â¢,.
"Well, generally speaking, yes."
"How. then, do you know -when a man
has been a chronic 'knocker'?" .
"Easy enough.. In fact,' it's a cinch. 1
merely open the gate a little way, and
say to the latest-arrived,- 'You; may look
in." He looks in jj and j immediately says,
â¢Well, it may be all- right enough for
anybody who is not up to date," but if
you would raise the pavement on the
right side of; the. street - there r it would
be an improvement,* or, 'If you would*
damâ excuse the expressionâ the river of
life in that" place it would add to the
looks of things,' or something of that
sort. I have him dead to rights then,
and I merely say: 'A vaunt! You will
find a snug, warm berth prepared for you
in the cellar.' Then heavaunts." -\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0
"I see," said the visitor. "It must be
a great deal easier than keeping a long,
monotonous record of kicks.'! '

WAY TO WIN FRIENDSHIP
ANGELA MORGAN
((â¢% T THAT is the secret of making
\A/ friends?" From tlme'to time
- }i \u25a0 Â» this question has been put
,tome' by various readers who 'declared
they felt keenly the need of friendship,
but w;ere seemingly incapable of at
tracting a warm/ genuine regard.
/ One woman confesses she has all her
life found it hard to "go out to people."
While longing for the sweetness, the
stimulus, the nourishment of a deep
human attachment, she has generally
, repelled, instead of attracting the thing
she craved. She; has had friendsâ the
sort of friends -that are created by the
"conventionalities of life. But she has
never been able to grasp the secret of j
how to win a vital affection. Ej She does
not come ; close to the hearts of the
people. She finds herself standing afar
off at the very time she would be near.
' And she has been misunderstood so
long that now she does not ; - careâ so
she statesâ though her letter belies her
words. She - finds herself held in the
grip of. a fixed reserve, and ; takes
a hard, curious pleasure;- in reflecting
how completely/she deceives those who
claim to know her.; . ,i * '\u25a0: ,-\u25a0'â¢
"No one guesses the ; depth of -my
heart. No matter how : . great ,the, cry
within me for sympathy, - for love, no
one hears it. I am a cold woman to
\u25a0all that meet me." .
Perhaps I could not better express
what I believe to be the secret of mak
ing friends than by emphasizing the
statement of this^womani who fails to
make them: "I have all-my life found
it hard to go out to; people." -.
Here lies the whole' matter in a nut
shell. Never to go "'forth /to J others
means never to get in motion the forces
that collate friendship. It means never
to throw out the tendrils that draw
human affection:.
i All your life you may yearn for the
joys that come through vital associa
tion with a kindred mind; for the
boul warmth and-spiritual beauty that
live in true friendship; but you will; go
on hoping In vain, unless :you permit
the sun within yoQ to shine upon those
you meet. A
Perhaps all of us at some time in life
are aware of this tendency to | shrink
into ourselves even while we are want
ing to go forth to those V- we meet.
There Is something in us that fears : to
awaken the very regard -it craves., - . ,
We are fearful of revealing ourselves
and of permitting our friend to reveal
himself to:us. ; ->^^'Â£:Â£Â«/;// -X. \u0084
How rarely do we, in meeting, the
eyes of othersâ even of our dear .ones
âreally give ourselves : in the glance!

others, that we express ; what we truly
I feel! Whether we mean to lbe so 6r
not, we are guilty .of . miserliness of

.This tendency, if not discouraged, grows
upon us until we build walls about | our
selves, and are prisoners: behind; bars, of
our own making: And : we' can only peer
helplessly through these bars upon -the
faces of those we would intimately meet.
Why is 'it we are afraid- to let a full
ray of our soul chine upon another? -Why
do we, at the very time we would come

We hurry from his presence, as though
we feared he would commit himself or

And yet we wonder sometimes, many of
us, why it is we do not attract the glow
ing regard we so earnestly seek. And
after a time we resign ourselves, trying
to, silence our soul while we move on in
the common conventional path filled with
the friendships that have no spark.
But we do care, very much, 'all the
while.. We know, in the depths of us.
that no life is complete until it is touched
by the gold of real friendship. W,e know
our own lives would take on a heavenly

The second convention of the Pacific
District Luther League was held yepter-.
<2ay and last evening at the First English
Evangelical Lutheran Church. Geary
etreet, near Gcugh. the Rev. J. C. Pedeix
sen of Salinas presiding.
During a discussion on "Lutheran Lit
erature" the Rev. O. H. Gruver, paetor
of the First English Lutheran Church.
Oakland, speaking of the lack of Infor
mation regarding the position and history
Â£i the Lutheran church referred to an
%-ticle which appeared, in one of the Oak
land papers en Monday, evidently, he
paid, from an Episcopalian regarding the
exclusion of the Unitarian church from
the Federation of C.hurches In the East.
The reverend gentleman stated that the
vTiter had said in effect that If they ex
cluded all those who were not called
'â¢evangelical" It would necessitate not
enly the exclusion of the Unitarian de
nomination from the federation but also
the Roman Catholic. Lutheran and Epis
copalian denominations Which were also
in principle "non-evangelical."
The Rev. Mr. Gruver in an animated
explanation of the position of his denom
lr.fation said that the Lutheran church
â¢was the oldest evangelical church, and
that part of its incorporate name includes
the word "evangelical." He strongly ob
jected to the writer's classifying the Lu
theran c-urch as "un-evangelical," hold
irg at the same time that the Lutherans
were the first to "fight for the pure evan
gelical truth."
The Luther League was founded in this
city last March. It hap gained in great
number since its establishment ten years
ego in the East and has a membership
ci 200,000 young Lutherans. The object
cf the organization is the preservation
<f all the young people in the denomina
ton, and to engage them in active Chris
tian work.
One of the first acts at the morning
session was to rename the organization
the "Central California District Luther
League."
H was also resolvfd to lay before the
J^xt convention the desirability of hold
'^9v the convention annually instead of
t' mi-annually.
Among the speakers were the Rev.
FhlUp JLndreen. M. A.. Rev. O. H. Gru
ver, Rev. E. Meyer, J. A. Bohn, and the
Rev. E. H. Hadlock, Ph. D.
The league voted to enter upon mis
eior,ary work and Its first charge will be
In the Indian field, where a native boyi
will be educated at the expense of the
organization.. There was a rally in the
evening, at which the Rev. Mr. Meyer
cpoke on "The Church and the League:
What the One Expects of the Other," and
Mr. Andreen's address was devoted to

VISIT EMPRESS WITH
MISS ROOSEVELT.
Miss Marjorie and Miss Anna Ide, daughters of Henry Clay Ide; of Â«
the Philippine Commission, arrived here yesterday and tell of accom
panying Miss Alice Roonevelt to Pek|ng> where they \u25a0were the sruests
for one day of the Dowager Empress. They found the old lady a de
lightful hostess and say that the visit to her palace was like living
through an Arabian Night's dream. They explain how Minister .
Rockhlll offended General Corbin and Admiral Train by failing, to
return certain rails and by other violations of the niceties of polite /'
society. They /ay that Governor General Wright is very popular In â¢
the Philippines. "
Commissioner Ides Daughters Arrive
From Orient on America Maru.
DAUGHTERS OP PHILIPPINE COMMISSIONER HENRY C. IDE, WHO ARRIVED I
FROM THE ORIENT YESTERUAi ON THE AMERICA MARU. THEY GIVE
A GLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THEIR VISIT TO CHINESE COURT.
Miss Anna L. and Miss Marjorie Ide,
daughters of Henry Clay Ide of the
Philippine Commission, arrived yester
day on the Japanese liner America
.Maru. They accompanied Miss Alice
Roosevelt and members of the Taft
party to Peking and are still bubbling
over with enthusiasm engendered by
their visit to the ancient capital, where
that wonderful old woman, the Empress
of China, was, for a whole day, their
hostess.
On the occasion of that visit the Em
press laid aside the reserve behind
which for years she has ruled with
absolute power her millions of subjects.
Her palace, so long a place of mystery,
was thrown wide open to her American
guests, and th*e old woman, who has
been depicted as the essence of every
thing unlovely, proved a most delight
ful hostess. Before the guests de
parted each was presented with a
souvenir of the visit. Each of the girls
received a beautiful pearl and the men
were not forgotten.
Miss Marjorie Ide said yesterday that
her visit to the Empress was like liv
ing through a chapter of "The Arabian
Nights." and when the pearls were
handed around like streetcar transfers
she could have screamed with delight,
not because the g\tt was a pearl of
great price, but because,of the Oriental
abandon with which the precious gems
were distributed.
"And there was a funny old lantern
in one of the halls that I certainly
would have rubbed if I could have
reached It."
"VTu Ting Fang, former Minister from
China to Washington, acted as Inter
preter for the Empress. Wu, in the
presence of bis royal mistress, was a
very modest individual and Invariably
placed his face on the floor before ad
dressing her.
EMPRESS IS MAGXETIC.
"The Empress has a very magnetic
personality." said Miss Marjorie Ide,
"and one of the most interesting faces
I ever saw. Except for a look of
cruelty, which comes and goes like the
shadow from a shaking limb, she had
almost a motherly look. She was very
kind to us and greatly Interested In
everything we said and did. The Em
peror was there, but does not seem .to
count. He did not seem to know what
to do and the old lady pulled, him
around by his wide sleeves and jerked
him' most ungently into whatever posi
tion she thought he ought to stand. He
submitted like a lamb."
The visit to Peking, however, was not
Arabian Nights for everybody. Miss
Roosevelt had the time of her life. The
Ide girls ditto. General Corbin and Ad
miral Train enjoyed themselves. The
other members of the TafÂ£ party were
delighted with the experience.
For United States Minister Rockhill,
however,' the American invasion was an
unhappy visitation, which may involve
him In laborlo.os correspondence with
the powers In Washington.
Minister Rockhill has been so busy
all his life acquiring the knowledge and
experience, the - possession of which led
to his selection by President Roosevelt
for the execution of \ a mission of ex
traordinary delicacy, that he has failed
to familiarize himself with some of the
essential requirements of high society.
1 General ' Corbin Is a veteran of wide
dra-wingr-room experience. In Washing
ton and in the army he Is knownas a
stickler for the* niceties of life. Ad
mirar Train also knows what's what In
the social line. -.
THE SAN FRANGISGO CALL, WEDNESDAY. OCTOBER; 18 r IHO^.
General Corbin has made bitter com
plaint to Washington about the scant
courtesy shown the party by Minister
Rockhill.
TRAIN ALSO TO COMPLAIN.
The Misses Ide say, that Admiral
Train will also, they believe, make simi
lar complaint. The trouble, as they
tell it, would, probably lead to Rock
hill's acquittal if the case were laid
before the people of a democratic re
public, but if Rockhill Is judged by
the Corbin and Train standards the
unfortunate offender will probably be
subjected to several real hard slaps. '
The Misses Ide say that Minister
Rockhill failed to return several. calls,
some of them social, some' official.
Therein, they say, lies the sum and sub
stance of his offending. According Jo
dispatches from Washington, Minister
Rockhill will not be recalled, as the af
fairs of the embassy, other. than social,
are being administered wisely; and well.
The Misses Ide have made their home
in Manila since 1900, when their father
was appointed a member of . the Taft
Commission. Every year thayliave left
the Philippines for a few months and
their visit now is for their annual
change from the tropical climate.
Of the probability of Governor
Wright's removal, Commissioner Ides
daughters say. they know nothing.
"Governor Wright Is the : loveliest
man in the world and nobody In the
Phillpines wants to see him go away.
He is going to take a vacation soon
and visit Washington. Further than
that we do not know, but we hope he
will continue to be Governor."
The Misses Ide are staying at the
Knickerbocker and will remain in this
qlty for several weeks. \u25a0

Mother of Unlucky Eulie
0 ? Toole Sees Her Daughter
Close to Violent Death
.While her terrified mother watched
from a ; wlndcw, 8-year-old Eulie
O'Toole, allowed to go out alone, nar
rowly escaped death beneath the wheels
of a trolley car Monday. .'The child was
crossing Sixteenth street, near Valencia.,
while the mother watched with anxious
eyes from a window in their home, 3070
Sixteenth street. .
The little one ran behind a dirt cart
directly in front of a southbound Fill
more-street car. She saw the heavy
vehicle swooping down upon her and
stood as one dazed. Motorman John
Greigs saw the* child and reversed his
lever just in time.
The child was caught in the. fender
and lay -there stunned and helpless,
while the car rolled on for several
yards. The mother, watching, at the
window, gave a shriek of agony and
fainted. She thought her little one had
been caught beneath the heavy car and
crushed.
Little Eulie was suffering from the
shock when she was taken from the
fender, but otherwise appeared unin
jured:, 'The fender worked perfectly.
Credit is also due the motorman for his
promptness in stopping the car.
When seen yesterday Mrs. O'Toole
was still terribly unstrung because of
her baby's narrow escape and she will
probably give the child proper atten
tion hereafter and keep It off the street
unless some adult is with it.
Though the child was apparently un
hurt whÂ«n she was taken off the fender,
she complained of internal pains yes
terday. She Is now under the care of a
physician.

SULLIVAN GETS
THE DECISION
Tommy Burns Is Outpointed
by the Twin in a Twenty
ftound Gk) at Los Angeles
BOTH MEN FIGHT FAST
Boston Man Has the Speed
and Whips In Many Tell
ing Punches to Stomach
LOS ANGELBS, ".. Oct. 17. â After
twenty rounds, of clever fighting, In
which the winner clearly outpointed,
outgeneraled and outfought his oppo
nent almost 'from the commencement
to the finish, "Twin" Sullivan was
awarded the decision over Tommy
Burns here to-night. The decision of
Refere Eyton manifestly met the ap
proval of the crowd. The largest gath
ering that has yet assembled in the
new pavilion of the Pacific Coast Ath^
letic Club witnessed the fight.
The betting odds were elightly in
favor of Sullivan at 10 to 9. Sullivan'Â«
blows were more effective after the
first few rounds and they soon told oh
Burns. By the end of the eighth round
the latter's nose was bleeding, one eye
was closed and he â¢ was considerably
worried from the vigorous punishment
he had received on the body.
Burns fought for Sullivan's head al
most entirely, but his blows failed to
land with effect. Sullivan exhibited
cleverness in ducking and side-stepping
and in covering up from the attacks of
his opponent and was obviously the su
perior boxer of the two. His blows
aimed at Burns' body were always well
calculated and rarely failed to reach
their mark.
Before the fight was half over Burns
was showing the effects of the body
punishment he was receiving and the
continual hammering took away nearly
all the steam he exhibited at the start.
Neither man, however, was badly used
up at the end of the fight. Sullivan
showing but a few slight evidences of
the encounter.
In the preliminary Warren Zubrick
knocked out Rube Jeffries In the second
round.

Walter Settle Narrowly Es
capes Injury in Attempt
to Save Team.
Walter Settle, driver for F. A. Rob
ertson, 20 Rincon place, came near los
ing his life in an effort to sav-i his
team from going into the excavation
at the corner of Geary and S'cckton
streets a little after 1 o'clock yester
day afternoon. One of the hordes was
probably hurt Internally anJ may Â»iie,:
w while the wagon was broken to kin
dling wood.
The Incline leading frori .the.exca-!
vation is so steep thaS. It fs ->ecessary
to help the teams up by Â«ne&ns of a'
cable and steam power. Settle had.
loaded his wagon and ' started up .the
Incline. When, nearing the top thtr
chain fastening gave way and the full
Tveig'-u "ot the load was throwi upon
the horses, which, being" unable to
hold it, began to back '.sow:i the in
cline in a zigzag way. The driver;.
realizing 1 t!ie danger of both himself
and his team, tried to cramp the wagon
and prevent an accident. H> was un
successful, however. a.nd the team and
driver went over into - the excavation;
about (twenty-five feet below. - , '
'The driver stayed with the team, and
as the. wag&n went down he was.'
thrown to one side into the deep sand
and escaped Injury. One of the horses;
was badly hurt and it was thought for.
a while that it would have to be sho^t,
but after nearly two hours , it Began to
' recover an*! toward evening the own
er succeeded in getting it home. The
wagon was patched up and taken to
the shop for repairs. .' ..'.
This is the second accident of this
kind that has happened in the same
place and in the same way within two
days. Monday afternoon Frank Jef
fries was driving out with a load,
when the cable gave way and the team
'was thrown off the grade. The acci
dent happened near the bottom and the
team did not have far to fall or a seri
ous accident have beeni the re
sult. Jeffries saw his danger and
jumped, thus saving ..himself ..without
an attempt to save his team. X

RAIDS UPON LOCKERS
AT TENNIS COURTS
Detective Departnient Baffled
for Months jyy Bold
Thief.
. For several months a petty, thief has
been plying his or her vocation in the
dressing-rooms at the park tennis courts.'
The culprit has thus far proved ! too
clever for the detectives, detailed at
various times to put an end to the
thievery. . Lockers â¢ have . been broken
open repeatedly and so >*; bold has \u25a0 the'
pilferer become, as a result of long im
munity from arrest, that of -late ; several
raids have taken place within a single
week. \u0084 : \u25a0\u25a0â'>â¢
Not long. ago. the. Detective Department
believed, that it had landed ,the thief in
the person of Lee C. Folse, an eccentric
character who haunted the tennis courts.
There ; was |no evidence implicating Folse
in the park thefts, but while he was un
der surveillance he '.was detected in an
attempt to break into a . Japanese store
in the down-town district.. Following 1 his
arraignment in the Police Court Folse
was turned over, .to the Insanity Com
missioners, who decided that he was a
fit subject, for? the \u25a0 .Ukiah asylum.
Since â¢ Foise's , arrest there have been
three daylight burglaries ' at'Â« the ' tennis
court dressins-rooms. The last : two of
these .would indicate that * the thief is
some young woman . with' a fondness for
finery or a parent whose daughters are
equipped with wearing , apparel at the
expense of (the, young. ladles ,who play
tennis. Mies Golda ' Myer, one of \u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0 the
cleverest players of the Ladles' Annex
of the Golden Gate Club,, was the victim
on both occasions, the thief depriving her
first of jeweled hatpins, several yards
of ribbon ; and , other articles,, and later
returning for; her shoes â¢ and hosiery. -] A
purse lying 1 . In plain view was untouched,
as .was the/wearing: apparel of another
young lady using the locker, k Seemingly
Miss Myer Is unfortunate in that, her rai
ment supplies, a proper fift or the \u25a0 young
woman' whorls' profiting \u25a0;\u25a0 by -the .; raids
upon' the; lockers. "*

CARDINAL FLAG
WAVES ON HIGH
Stanford Plays Webf ooters
With More Success Than
the Bine and Gold Team;
Â£ONTEST IS EXCITING
Visitors' Fumbles Greatly
Assist Lanagan's Outfit
; in Securing Its Scores
PARK WINSLO W
The LTniversity of Oregon football eleven
went Uown to defeat before Stanford var
sity at Palo Alto yesterday to the tune
of 10 to 4. Two inexcusable fumbles on
the part of the visitors, were largely re
sponsible "for the cardinal victory. The
contest was full of ginger- and abounded
in sensational plays. Stanford made a
touchdown , and a goal in the first half
and both teams kicked a field goal ,in
the second period of play. . The chief
point of Interest about the game was that
it was expected to furnish a line of; the
comparative strength of the- California
and Stanford elevens. It provided rather
an opportunity for a comparison of weak
nesses.
The home team kicked off and on the
second subsequent play Friesscfli of Ore
gon dropped the ball. : Stanford got the
pigskin on the thirty-yard mark
easily worked it through on guard and
tackle plays to a toucadown. After
Chalmers had carried the ball over Fen
ton finished a good job by kicking the
goal.
After the kick-off the cardinal got the,
ball to Oregon's twenty-flve-yard line by'
bucking when possible and interchanging
kicks when necessary. A fake by Stan
ford netted .ten yards' loss immediately
and subsequent loss of the ball. .For the
remainder of the half neither goal was
in any particular danger. When the time
allotted for recuperation had elapsed
Stanford went to work in earnest to in
crease the size 'of the score. After'fre
quent j exchanges of punts the cardinal
found itself stopped in the middle of the
field and was forced to kick again.
KRIESSELL. FUMBLES.
Fenton lifted the ball to Oregon's ten
yard Mine where Friessell muffed In the
most approved grammar school style. A
Stanford man fell on the pigskin and the
cardinal made ready for another touch
down^ Line plays brought the last streak
of whitewash eight yards nearer, out
there the lads from over the northern
border made a stand. Fenton was finally
called upon to deliver a field goal, .and
he made as nice a drop kick between
the posts as one could. read about.
When Oregon: got . the ball after' the
kick-off new life was put into the game.
Stanford grew weaker than ever at right
guard and both tackles. Line plays by
the visitors were all ground gainers and
when . Latourette went thirty yards
around Stanford's ' left -â¢' end 'the rooters
on the bleachers looked , glum. '\u25a0
Friessell pushed \ opportunity :. along a
little by cutting around Stanford's right
end for, another twenty yards. 7 The car
dinal made a stand 'which forced Oregon
to have recourse to u a place kick. ' Moullen
Bent the ball through the right aperture
and the day's' scoring was at an end.
. The children of Ralnland made a jflerce
fight to secure "a touchdown during the
few \u25a0 remaining- minutes - of play, but
failed. When the referee signaled that
the game ' was all over Stanford was
showing more class again.
The cardinal \ had a better > team and
should have had a score of two touch
downs to nothing on form.' A large crowd
of Stanford adherents was In, attendance
and cheered the victors lustily. The air
was Just chilly enough to be bracing for
the players. -Had the visitors been In
better condition and possessed stronger
shoestrings the progress \u25a0 of the contest
would have been measurably accelerated.
THINKS CARDINAL STRONGER.
The Webf ooters played a tie game with
California last Thursday. The blue and
gold lost as a result of careless playing.
The line, held better against Oregon than
did Stanford's yesterday. The cardinal
backs did better on. the whole than Cali
fornia's. The Oregon I coach says , he
thinks the cardinal ;is. a ; trifle stronger
than California. Stanford Is weak ap
parently In guards "and tackles with the
exception . of ..' v eteran \ - Thompson.- : :;. - Ths
right side of the. line is noticeably in
effective on defense.;
Offensively the rival teams- are about
on a. par/with Stanford having a shade
the better of it. ' Elliott and Jordan of the
State University are better. "than ' the
cardinal ends. . Defensively both elevens
show weaknesses ..which the coaches will
have a hard job to obviate in;the : morith
before the big game. It is expected that
Stott wlll;be back atVauarter ;wlthlnr a
week or two, : In i spite?. of his -injuries.
He is unquestionably the best man in the
position in the two squads. Each institu
tion should /put up ;a sign reading,

Smiling Schmidt, who has for three sea
/eons been a star on the Oakland slab arid
a : favorite , with- the fans wherever he
twirled, Vas <\u25a0 forced to^suffer a double
i humiliation at Oakland yesterday. After
getting bumped by trie Siwashes In the
eighth : inning, Schmidt was? lnformed by
President Clay Hobacker of the Oakland
club that he was released. The Oakland
magnate handed thig ' out before the
whole crowd and every one agreed that
Schmidt was treated shamefully.
It was sure hard luck, for the Oakland
slabster pitched beautif ull ball till the
Siwashes just fell in right during- the
eighth and sent a delegation of three
through in Jig time. Any pitcher is liable
to come in for his bumps when he- goe3
up against^a flock of sluggers like the
Siwashes and . surely. Schmidt's perform
ance yesterday did: not warrant the ac
tion which Hobacher took^
Oakland .'- was - leading . two . to one when
.Vickers started, off for Seattle with, a
drive to center. Two more hits from the
bats of Bennett and Kane made it a full
house. Along came old Ike Walters with
a resounding wallop between center and
right that kept right. on skimming over
the grass and brought everybody home.
That put the seal of defeat on the Oak
land contingent and made the Siwashes
kings for the day. .\u25a0 . "
When Oakland scored twice in the sixth,
it looked as though that would be about
all. Kruger started ; off with a triple
against the right field fence and Dun
leavy poked one nearly to the same spot.
Walters let the sphere- get away from
him and Kruger arrived and Dunleavy
went as far as third. Moskiman tore oft
a single, putting Dunleavy through.; -
When Schmidt began to get pounded in
the eighth round, Hobacker, who was
seated close behind the player's bench,
in loud tones informed all nearby fans
that he was about to release , Schmidt.
When the game was over, the magnate,
in unsteady tones informed the pitcher
it was good night for him.' He used some
strong ' language and Mrs.' Schmidt, who
was standing: nÂ£ar, was severely shock
ed. Schmidt politely informed Hobacker
he would have to apologize and. he did
bo quickly.
The Oakland players are all very sore
at the action of Hobacker. If Schmidt
goes, it will 'be - for the club. ,It
was rumored yesterday that the directors
of the club would not sustain Hobacker's
action, so the smiling slab artist may

REACHES PORT
Liner That Aided in Defeat
of Russian Fleet Ar
rives From the Orient
OTHER VESSELS COMING
Toyo Risen Kaisha Ships,
withdrawn During War,
on Their Old Euii Again
The Japanese liner America Maru, Cap
t*io Philip Going, after an absence from
this port of nearly two years. ' arrived
yesterday from the Orient looking none
the worse for her active participation in
the battle cf the Sea of Japan and other
exciting events of Japau"s naval cam
paign against Russia. The Toyo Kisen
Kaisha is asrain doing business at the old
etand and the America Maru Is the lirst
of the three sister ships which were with
drawn from the San l'rancisco-Oriental
run. when the Mikado undertook to whip
the Russian bear, to return to the paths
ol peace. The other vessels will be in
commission shortly.
She brought 22 cabin passengers and
about 2000 tons cf freight. She left 1000
tens of cargo at Honolulu.
Among the passengefs were Lieuten
ants S. W. Brewster and IL C. Egan of
the United States Marine Corps, return
lr-g from service on the Asiatic station
li. L.. Blake. R. P. Metz. F. S. Roney and
C. B. Miner are all in the employ of the
Holland Submarine Company. They have
been in Japan for more than a year put
ting together submarine boat* for the
Japanese Government.
C B. Miner, who was chief engineer
of the Holland party, says that Japan is
now as wtll equipped with submarines as
any other power. He says that the late
v.ar has b*en a big thing for the Holland
Company, bat he would not pay what
part, if any. the submarines played in
the naval campaign.
"From the nature of our business." he
eitid, "you will understand that it would
be impossible for me to give out any
details of our work in Japan and for in
formation as to what has been done with
the boats we put together I must refer
you to the Japanese Government."
At Honolulu the America .Maru was
given a rcyal reception. From here to
the Orient theso boats were always pop
ular with port officials as well as with
the traveling public, and the America's
reception here, though less picturesque,
was quite as v.arm as at the island port.
William H. Avery. who represents the
company here and to whom much of the
line's popularity :s due. boarded the
America as soon as she passed quaran
tine and was delighted to find the pas
etngers falling ever one another to teli
him how well they had been treated dur
ing the voyage.
The work of changing the America back
from a warship to a passenger liner took
longer than had been expected and in
order to st-art on schedule time she was
put into commission in a good deal of
a hurry.
EL B. Thomas, who was steward on the
ilontara, ..which was captured by the
Japanese, 'was engaged as ohit-f steward
end according to the passengers he proved
a wonder, lie -so tickled their palates
that by the time the liner reached this
port the steward was the most imjx>rt
arjt individual on board the ship.
Captain Going, who formerly command
ed the Nippon Maru, served through the
â¢war as master in the Japanese army
transport service. He commanded the
hospital steemer Rosalia Maru, used to
convey wounded from Dalny to Japan.
I^ater he was master of the Manchu
Mam in which he carried, altogether,
ttbout 8000 Japanese soldiers to Man
churia. In recognition for his services
Captain Going was decorated with the
Sixth Order cf the Sacred Treasure.
C. Lacy Goodrich is the America's pur
err. Goodrich was famous before the
America Maru was built, although he
looks no older to-day than he fiid years
ego, when he was the Coptic's purser.
Goodrich looks about old enough to vote,
but there are few memories than can
go back to the time when be was not a
purser. Dr. N. P. Crooks, formerly of
the Nippcn Maru, joined the liner at
Honolulu a* surgeon. Ernest Bent is
chief officer. The chief engineer and oth
er officers are Japanese. \u25a0-'(
The America Maru served through the
*rar as an auxiliary cruiser. She carried
two I^-o^ntlmeter guns, four one pound
frs an.l two 47-millimeter guns.
She was through the battle of the Sea
$T Japan and when the surviving ships
of the Russian fleet fled, the America
2daru. being one of the' swiftest of the
euxiliaries. was sent in search of the run
aways. . * "i .-=
It was the America Maru which sight
ed and signaled the approach of the Rus
sian fleet.
She made one of the fastest runs from
Honolulu she has over made and came
irto port several before she was expect
ed.

IIOWEN IS INDICTED FOR
M UH DICK OK STEPHEN'SOiV
Grand Jury MukrM Sure That Accusrd
Homicide Will pc Held Until He
" . ;- ; IÂ» Tried for Crime.
Chillion Bowen, who shot and killed
W. A. Stephenson of Nevada. about two
mdntlis "ago. was indicted for murder
by the Grand Jury yesterday. Bowen
came to this city with Mrs. Stephenson,
who was infatuated with him. The hus
band followed and caught the guilty
pair in a Larkin-strcet lodging-house.
Stephenson burst open the door of
the room where the guilty pair were
hiding. As the' injured husband came
into the room Bowen fired, killing- him
almost instantly. '
Bowen's attorney has presented a mo
tion to set aside the commitment of
the "accused by a Police Court Judge.
Tho Indictment was found in order to

CARNEGIE TALKS
FOR WAR'S END
Woiild Have France, England
and America Combine to
Maintain Peace "of World
SPEAKS IN SCOTLAND
He Delivers Address When
Installed as Lord Kector
at St. Andrews University
ST. ANDREWS. Scotland, Oct. 17.â
Never before have so many distinguished
Americans directly participated in cere
monies connected with the inauguration
of the rector of a British university as
took part . in to-day's functions at St.
Andrews when Andrew Carnegie was in
stalled as Lord Rector for a second
term. "WhitelaV Reid, the American Em
bassador at London; Charlemagne Tower,
American Embassador at Berlin; Bishop
Henry C. Potter of New York and Dr.
William J7 Holland, dean of the Car
negie Museum at Plttsburg. occupied
seats the platform and had conferred
on them . the honorary degree of doctor
of laws . which also was bestowed on
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, president of
Columbia University, New York, in ab
sentia.
The hail was crowded with scarlet
gowned undergraduates of both sexes
and the male students enlivened the pro
ceedings with the usual amount of chaff
and songs. The entrance .of Carnegie
was the signal for an outburst of enthu
siasm. *
In his rectoral address Carnegie ex
pressed thÂ« opinion that five nations, or
even three, banded together in a league
of peace and inviting all other nations to
join them, could banish all war in the
future. In outlining the plan for the
league of peace, Carnegie said:
If tho prlnlcapl European nations were not
free through conscription from th. problem
which now disturb, the military authorities of
Britain. . the lack of sufficient number, willing
to enter the man-slaylns profession, w. should
soon hear the demand for a League of Peace
among- the nations. Five nation* co-operated
In quelling the recent Chinese disorder, and.
rescuing their representatives In Peking. It Is
perfectly clear that these five nations could
banish war. Suppose even three of them
formed a league of peace. Inviting all th*
other nation* to Join, and agreed that slnca
war In any part of the civilized world affects
all nations, and often seriously, that no nation
shall go to war,"" but shall refer International
disputes to The Hague conference or to other
bodies for peaceful settlement, the league
agreeing to declare . non-Intercourse with any
nation refusing compliance.
Imagine a nation cut oft to-day from the
world. Tbe league also might reserve to Itself
the right, where non-Intercourse Is likely to
fall or haa failed to prevent .war, to us* thÂ«
necessary force to maintain peace, each mem
ber of the league - agreeing to provide the
needed forces, or money In ; lieu thereof, m
proportion to her population or wealth.*
The relations between Great Britain, France
and the United States to-day are so close,
their aims so similar, their territories and
fields of operations ,s o clearly defined and so
different that these powers might properly
unite in Jnvlting other nations to consider tbe
question of such a league as has been sketched.
It Is a subject well worthy the attention of
their rulers. Of all the modes of hastening
the end of war . this appears the easiest and
the beet. We have no reasonable doubt tha;
arbitration In its present optional form will
continue Its rapid progress and that In itself
contains elements required finally, to lead us
to peace, for It conquers - wherever It- Is tried,
but It Is. none the less gratifying- to know
that there is In reserve a drastic mode of
enforcement. If needed, which will promptly
banish war.
\u25a0 A new stain has recently crept Into thÂ« rules
of war as foul as any that war has been
forced by public sentiment to discard. To-day
It In 'held that a formal declaration of war
â¢Is not Indispensable and that war can exist
without It. Here 1. the only step backward
to be met with In the steady progress of modi
fying, the rules of war.

KKW TORK. Oct. 17.â An Increased cupply
of loanable funds which appeared la the cail
lean market this morr.lng started the profes
'eicral curators to buyir.g stocks. The rate
for call loans recovered later In the rtay and
stocks bouefct earlier were sold out. The re
sult wa.Â» a considerable Increase In the ac
tK-ity la the- market over that of yesterday
and on several preceding days. The day's
" market fnforc?<3 the opinion that a large wait
ing rpeculction Is rcrtrnlned from entering
tJiÂ« market only by the exiÂ«en<;leÂ« of the money
situation. The Urge supp'.y of funds early In
the day at Ii per ctr.t was offered by banker*
closely connected vrlth the flotation of the
Japanet* loan. This led to the inference that
the procen&e of tho rubscrlptlonp j>ald on Mun

Wfcen this supply had been absorbed rates
roÂ»e acaiu to nÂ».*r the prevailing; rate of yes
terday. Sterling exchange rose vigorously and
the Â»nppoK!tlon that preparotlcns fcr the re
ir.UtancÂ« of the Japanese fund* were a factor
in ihe exefcanffe market cauee<l a feeling of
distrust of u-e easinc fffect caused by the

sumably "would be ' only temporary- Reports

but continued downward at Berlin, tte din
count rate at the latter point, however, yield
ing a shade. Heavy retrenchment was shown
by tbc Imperial Bank of Germany's weekly
statement. Rates for time money In New
York were etrong and the bid tor sixty-day
lr*pi was advanced to sli p*r cent, with the
Â£#**>\u25a0 x r*s* > *t 6Â»Â» per cent. There were no
funlier tranÂ«fer* . of currency to the South
through the ti-.b-treamiry, while from San

but tils rerort <Slfl not receive much count*- ;
fe*oe la teUOss circles. During tbe upward i
movement of price* the coalers' continued con
spicuous and thÂ« high-priced members of the
Croup made new high records. Beyond the
Keneral prosperity in that Industry there was
no news to explain the movement, which was
attributed largely to speculative operations,
Ths meeting being held fn this city of organ
isations on the Â«teel trade to consider ad
vances In the price of different lines of nn
iÂ£h*d oroducts cave a flrm tone to the steel
j industrials. The Republic Steel stocks were
I helped in addition by gossip regarding the
: probable dividend action at to-morrow's meet
lag. The announcements of the entry of
United States Steel and General Electric in
terests Into the American Locomotive direct
crate was taken to explain the previous ad
vance in that stock. The coming meetlnc of
the Amalgamated Copper directors for action
on the dldidend gave occasion for a specula
tive movement In that 6tock. A downward
plunge in Chicago Subway on the curb was an
incident of the day. The day's net movement
was inconclusive and the closing tone was easy
and at small losses as a rule.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Trade in- fresh fruits was restricted some
what by the l late arrival -of the river boats.,
which brought large consignments of Melons,
Grapes and .Figs and a good portion of the
belated arrivals had ' to be held over. Table
Grapes were firm during the early trade, there
being a fair inquiry for shipment in addition
to the regular local demand. â¢ but the market
weakened upon the arrival* of the delayed
boat?, and crated stock, which was Intended
for shipment, could be bought at low prices
in the afternoon. Melons and Figs were low
er. Apples were quite active, but stocks were
too large to permit any . advance In prices. The
other. tree fruits remained- firm under a brisk
demand and limited supplies. Berries were
unchanged and Citrus goods were moderate^
active at ' the previously quoted rates.

SAYS RUMBLE
IS PERJURER
Graham Announces That He
Disbelieves Testimony of
the Sunset Mine Promoter
Georffe W. Rumbl*. under conviction
In the Federal Court for using the United
States mails to defraud through the sale
of "wild oat" stock In the Sunset Mining
Company, received a Jolt In Judge
Graham's oourt yesterday that astounded
fcim. Rumble had been on the stand all
ct.}- testifying in bis own defense in the
â¢uit Instituted against him by Dix W.
Bmlth to recover many thousands of dol
lars received through the sale of stock
It Is alleged he converted to his own use.
Rumble's testimony made it evident to
the court that he was evading the issue
\u25a0without retard to the truth, so when he
left the stand no one except himself ana
fcls attorney was astounded when Judge
Graham, addressing Attorney A. R. Cot
ton, said :
"Mr. Cotton, while 1 Have the fullest
respect for your integrity as a practi
tioner at this bar 1 must inform you
that you cannot expect me to believe one
word your clleat has testified to while on
the stand In this case. He has sworn
to statements at direct variance with each
other. Therefore I wish to inform you
that his testimony will be given no con
sideration whatever, as it would be an
insult to the dignity of this court to ex
pect It to believe any of the testimony
triven by him. "
Mr. Cotton did not attempt to make an
answer in defense of his client.
The anxiety of a certain class of East
erners to become stockholders in Western
mining companies, good, bad and indif
ferent, was well illustrated by Rumble
when fee was on the stand. He testified
that he <3i>j>ositf-d in the banks in h!r
name the sum of JISO.OOO altogether. Of
this sum, he paid, S&C'.OW' was his own
money and Sl^o.cOO had been secured
through the sa> of stock. The books,
however, show that he received from the
Fale of stocks a total cf $H3,9>n. Th!w
discrepancy was pointed out to him ana
he was asked what he had done with this
other f43.W and how it came to him,
whether, in checks, drafts or money.
"Well."' paid Rumble, "most of it came*
t" me in money. One man. a Mr. Finch !
cf lowa, came to California and went to j
look at^tue Old Glory mine. He was so '
tvell pleased with its sppearance that he â¢
came down to my office, and taking
fIMWO out of his sock lir paid It to me 1
for ftock, paying $1 a share."
"He carried that much money in his \u25a0
"Yep; some of it was in gold, but m<Â»st
of it was i;j greenbacks."
"What has become of all of that
money?"
"I Â«er.t mjn to Alaska to buy mines. |
They lx>uÂ£ht mines no*-th <if Circle City, j
Just where I do not kr.'>w. We also !
taught a dredge and sent it wj to the
Porcupine River. Where the dredge is
I do not know."
The attorneys representing Dix had
great difTirulty with Rumble fn an efTor
to secure an admission from him en to
what he has done with all the thousands
the Federal authorities hold he illegally
procured through the sale of "wildcat"
ftook. His testimony of yesterday I:; about
es near direct a? they have been able
to â¢wring from him and resulted in the
cnnouni.-fmpiit of the court that It would
be entirely discredited.

FAMILY LIVES
IN VILE FILTH
Parents' Weakness for Drink
Brings Much Suffering"
to Their Five Children
A pitiful case of live young children,
the lodest of which is 8 years, who are
in unhappy plight because of the weak
ness of their father and mother for
liquor, was called to the attention of
the officers of the Society for the Pre-
of Cruelty to Children Monday
night. President Newha.ll and Secre
tary White visited the home of John
Lynch at LSOB Fifth avenue and founu
it in such a filthy condition and the
little ones in surh sorry surroundings
that warrants were sworn out for the
arrest of the parents on the charge ot
neglect of a minor child. Policeman
Lord served the warrants on the couple
yesterday. The children were sent to
a home to be cared for.
Lynch, who is 35. years old, is em
ployed as a laborer at the Albion
Hrewery and earns a wage of $13 a
week. He is a steady worker, bat most
of his earnings have been spent for
liquor. His wife, who is five years
younger, is also addicted ,to the use of
intoxicants and lies about the house in
a stupor from the excessive, use of alco
hol. The children are at times clothed
and fed by neighbors. One year ago
the society was notified of the condition
of the Lynch home and the parents
were notified by the officers to clean.
It. This was done for a short time, but
alcohol held sway and the unfortunates
soon fell back into their old hab'.ts.
The officers of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children visit
ed the house Monday night and found
the premises reeking with filth and the
children were utterly neglected.
When Policeman Lord called at the
home yesterday to serve the warrants
for the arrest of the couple he found
the mother drunk. The five children
did not seem to realize the situation
Only two beds and a couch were In
the house. A baby 8 months old war
lying on a bed trying to satisfy its hun
ger on an ompty bottle.

POLICEMAN'S FIST RAZES
BIG PRISONER'S NOSE.
tt 1 Til ' r t ' 1 r\ T
Herculean Physique of. Maimed One Is
Eclipsed by of Officer.
Idea That Nasal Damage Was Inflicted
With Club Is Quickly Routed.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Prior to the exhibition of Special Po
liceman Oleson's right flst the mutilated
nose of J. D. Ilorton provoked varied
conjecture in Judge Conlon's court. Mr.
Horton sat among the prisoners, and his
..herculean physique lent color to the/ma
; jority's', surmise that his facial' dlsflgure-
I ment was caused by a blow with a heavy
J weapon of some kind, this hypothesis be/
j ing baoed ' upon the logical assumption
! that no person of ordinary prowess would
| be so intrepid as to engage in fisticuffs
| with such a giant. . .
"If the cop did it," declared one chair
+ : \\ â â â . -i-
warmer whose opinions usually carry
weight, "he did it with his club and when
the big fellow wasn't looking."
But when the complaining policeman
stood erect and displaced even more at
mosphere than did the defendant the
chair-warming sage was Inclined - to
hedge. And when the officer held up a
clenched hand and testified that It was
the only Instrument he used in his sub
jugation of Mr. Horton. all hearers be
lieved him, for the fist was almost as
large as the head it had visited with such
fearful result. Mr. Horton's nasal organ,
which originally had been Romanesque
was spatulous, despite the surgical prop
ping of Its bridge, and the wefrdness.of
its white-powder dressing was accentu
ated by the blackened and bruised skin
surrounding it.
Mr. Horton, the policeman averred,
spread terror in Pacific-street dance halls
by his reckless brandishing of a large re
volver, and when his arrest was under
taken he threatened to perforate his cap
tor. 'Twas then the fist swung against
the nose. The subjugation was complete.
In consideration of the punishment to
which he had already been subjected, Mr.
Horton was given only twenty-four hours'
Imprisonment and permanently dispos
sessed of his pistol.
Herman Martens* estimate of the law's
dignity was immeasurably enhanced by
Judge Mogan sentencing him to â¢ six
months' Imprisonment. - - 1
I So slight was the esteem in which Mr.
Martens held .the majesty of the Police
Court that when he was judicially com
manded to provide for the proper main
tenance of his wife and child lie fled the
city, leaving his^ family to starve or be a
public burden, and after remaining away
several months came back, boldly entered
illicit relationship with a Mrs. Koster, re
siding at 18 Rausch street, and even more
boldly instituted proceeding for divorce
on the ground of desertion. It was the
latter act of audacity, that led to his ar
rest and rearrafgnment on the original
! failurc-to-provide charge, which "had
never been completely dismissed.
"My client is willing to glvo his wife
j ?18, all the money he now possesses, and
! to cancel his petition for divorce, pro
i vided she withdraws her charge against
hlro," said the defendant's attorney to
the ' Judge, and the defendant himself
grinned propitiatingly at the bench and
then leered confidently at his unfortunate
better-half. She, poor woman, looked jis
if the proposal was worth considering.
but ere she could express her opinion of
it his Honor spoke. ' ;r; r
"To make such aji offer," he. said, "is
consistent with the brazen disregard of
justice which this defendant has exhibited
ever since he abandoned his family, three
years ago. During all that period he has
not contributed one. dollar to the sup
port of his wife and young daughter, but
has spent his earnings on a paramour,
and he has willfully held this court in
I contempt by breaking his promise to it
I that he would maintain his family. ; - I
j sentence him to six months' imprison- j
ment and regret my inability, to make the
term, six years."
If the roof had suddenly dropped upon
the head of Mr. Martens he could not
have displayed greater "astonishment, so |
sanguine had he been that.his wife would
be tempted lÂ«y t*he $18 to withdraw, her
complaint.
Mrs. Maud Peterson told. Judge Mo
gan that after she le/\ his court the
previous day. where "she. had '- appeared
as complainant against Mrs. pora
Messersmith, accused, of battery, she
was standing on the first block \u25a0ot
Rausch street and talking to her neigh
bor, Mrs. Bray,: when Mrs. Messersmith
passed them . by with her :nose tilted
in disdain, and they, plainly heard her
say the remark, evidently being ad
dressed'to Mrs. Peterson: ; , ;
"Humph: So .ye're jealous of me and
yer husband, are ye? : Humph! So! ye
say I give him drinks, do ye?-. Humph!"
"Them was her words; Judge," said
Mrs. Peterson.
"I never said 'em." Mrs. Messersmith
contradicted. "But as I was passin'
her by and not payin*. no attention ;to
her she said to ' Mrs. Bray, 'Well,*, this
chicken '11 get all that's comin' .to her,'
mcanin' me. of : course."
Mrs.\ Messersmith ; will be sentenced
for battery. " V." . . --l^K

Probably because he rossesses. a
name made som/what famous as that
of the very handy welterweight pugi
list, to whom he is not consanguliie
ously related, George Peterson lias sev
eral .times been arrested for fighting,
and in every .instance the evidence
showed that he deliberately provoked
the combat. It was also shown chat
his opponent invariably was his phyKi
cal inferior â a ..fact which indic.vr.;d
that hIS valor was not destitute of dis
cretionâand when he was arra'^nrd
yesterday before Judge Conlan on a
nÂ«w variation of the old charge and
his fellow-defendant proved to bo ,a
diminutive colored man, the court mar
veled not. But when hisi Honor glanced
at the , stalwart Caucasian's battered
countenance and then directed his gaze
at the unsca.thed Ethiopian visage- he
sighed as one quietly exulting, and
murmured, "At last." \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢
It was the same old story of Mr!
Peterson primarily aggressive, but the
repetition ended with his striking of
the first' blow. After that his experi
ence was entirely novel, as the small
negro literally swept a portion of v
Montgomery-street sidewalk between
Clay and. Washington with him. Su
perior height, weight and fistic skill
served Mr.'. Peterson not well a.t all,
for the little dark man afforded him
no time to exercise any of his Inh2rÂ«Â»nt

Three Commercial Bodies
to Send Delegates to
Convention at Chicago
OTHERS MAY FOLLOW
San Francisco Will Have
Voice the Interstate
Commerce Law Gathering
Two, commercial organizations â the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation and the Board of Trade of San
Franciscoâ decided yesterday to send
delegates to the Interstate. Commerca
Law Convention that will be held 1 in
Chicago on the 26th inst? for the pur
| pose- of discussing legislation relating
to railroads in the United States ":and
especially concerning the powers of
the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Kiich , of the . organizations herein
named will have two delegates..
The Chamber of Commerce has elect
ed one delegate, William R. Wheeler,
and may possibly elect two more, as,
under the call for the gathering, each
commercial organizatioa-Js entitled to
one delegate for .100' members and an
additional delegate' for each additional
:.'OO or greater part, thereof, r \ - .
There are six commercial organiza
tions in kan Francisco, including the
California. State Board of Trader -The
Merchants' Association directors met
yesterdays-discussed' the appointment,
of delegates and tabled the matter,
and it ;is improbable that .the x Mer
chants'. Association, will be represented
at. the Ciifcago gathering 1 . , The Mer
chants' Kxchange has not appointed
any , delegates. It -is said, u'notttclally,
that the California 'State Board- of
Trade will no,t" appoint delegates. Not
long ago -resolutions were adopted by
the State Board of Trade, in which.it
was declared that the< Uourd would not
take up any work that was not ger
mane to thÂ« development of the State.
This aotion may -be- considered sufn-.
cient to cover the matter of naming
delegates to consider national legisla
tion regarding the powers of the In
terstate Commerce' Commission.
.Of the three San Francisco bodies
that have decided to be represented- art
Chicago only one had favored giving
more power to the. - Interstate Com
merce Commissioners than they now
possess. This is the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce. As^far back as
last January and February the matter
was considered, by the commercial bod
ies of this city. An increase in the
membership of 'the Interstate Com
merce Commission - was generally fa
vored, the proposition that was in
dorsed being to add two members to
the commission, both to be, represent
ative of the Pacific Coast. There was
also general agreement, with the one
exception ; of the Sun Francisco Cham
ber of Commerce, that the powers of
the Interstate Commerce Commission
ought not to be Increased. This is the
principal issue that will come up at
the Chicago convention of the Inter
state Commerce Law delegates on the
26* th inst.
The California State" Board of Trade
in its resolutions declared that the ex
port-commerce of California in green
deciduous and citrus fruits would be
endangered by permitting the Inter
state Commerce \ Commission to make

the railway rates and become a board
of traffic managers for all the rail
roads carrying Interstate traffic. The
Merchants' Association formally de
clared that "the present welfare of the
manufacturers, producers, wholesalers
and jobbers of the Pacific Coast and
the future growth of and development
of their various and varied business
in/crests depend largely upon a system
of rate-making by the transcontinental
railroads, by which the terminal rate
to which the Jobbing and manufactur
ing cities of the coast are Justly Â«n
; titled by reason of water competition,
is recognized."
1 The resolutions adopted by thÂ«
Manufacturers' and Producers* Asso
ciation and by the Board of Trade of
'\u25a0 San Francisco were similar In tenor
to those approved by the Merchants'
Association. The. San Francisco Mer
chants' Exchange took no definite ac
tion but reserved judgment until the
question at Issue could be Investlga-ted.
The ChamÃer of Commerce adopted
the following resolutions:
RÂ»Holved. That we urge the passage of some
form of legislation with respect to the regula- I
tlon of railway rates that Is in line of thÂ»
recommendations 1 of the President In h!s last
annual report: and
Resolved furthermore. That we urge that the
Interstate Commerce Commission be enlarged
by the addition of two members and that one
or both of these new members be from the
Pacific Coast.
.Possibly the delegates to represent
the Manufacturers and Producers and
the Board oosf s Trade of San Francisco
at Chicago maybe named to-day.
