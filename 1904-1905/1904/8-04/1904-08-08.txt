ran admitted in the Jefferson Market
Police Court this morning that he was
not in the habit of drinking fancy
drinks and promised to stick to
straight whisky hereafter and avoid
the temptations of the new Subway
Tavern. It was a simple story that
he told to Magistrate Ommen, but it
cost him a $5 fine.
He said that out of curiosity he vis
ited the place that Bishop Potten had
stamped with his approval, and the
prices of fancy drinks were so cheap
that he could not let them alone. He
drank three pousse cafes, two brandy
cocktails, four absinthe frappes and
two - liqueurs and then the police got
him.

"When Bishop Henry C. Potter went
through the performance of dedicating
with solemn ceremonies, in the name
of Jesus Christ,, a place where intoxi
cating liquors are to be sold as a bev
erage, he was guilty of blasphemy and
every day that he gives to such a
scheme his sanction and blessing he is
guilty of as base a betrayal of Jesus
Christ as Judas Iscariot was ever
guilty of."
Rev. J. W. Lee of Camden said from
his pulpit, to-night:
"Bishop Potter lowered his manhood
and destroyed his influence for good,
while the devil rejoiced and hell was
enlarged."

"It is very difficult for these society

that he ought to give up his beer

wines. And this is why the Bishop
is in such despair over -the problem.

"His church, however, does not deal
with great problems. While the other
bodies of Protestantism are dealing
with' the ' problems that touch the
lives of the people, like the pres

Sabbath and how to meet the awful
aggressions of the liquor traffic with
Its 150,000 deaths per year, Its con
tribution of 80 per cent of crime' and

ter's church is engaged in settling the
stupendous question of the color of al
tar cloths and other millinery, or how
to get its 750,000 communicants called
the Catholic church, as though this big
label on this comparatively small ec
clesiasticism would make It larger or
more impressive.
"And yet, even his own church peo
ple, though so few of them are total
abstainers, are not ready to go with*
him in his attempt to make drunkards
of men with benefit of clergy. No
wonder he is perplexed as to a prac
ticable method of dealing with the
drink evil while he and his fellow
churchmen are almost universally wine
bibbers and do not turn their glasses
down even at public banquets, where
example, either- good or bad, is so po

In Trinity Methodist ' Episcopal
Church, corner . of Market. Noe and
Sixteenth streets, the pastor. Rev. John
A. B. Wilson, last night took up the
utterances of Bishop Potter of New
York and his dedication of the Subway
Tavern with religious services, and
said in part:
"I have long regarded Bishop Pot
ter as the greatest ecclesiastic in
America. "Whatever he may say or
do in these days of evident senility,
the development of his diocese during
the period of his incumbency is a suf
ficient monument for one man, even
if he could live half a dozen lifetimes.
In this he has been broader than his
church and has found, room for men
of the widest divergency of thought
and ecclesiastical practices and by the
strength and \ tactfulness of his own
personality has made the whole diocese
homogeneous.
to make whisky less intoxicating to
the poor, he extends his hands in bless
ing and sings a doxology over a new
drunk-factory.
"Here- stands this Christian Bishop,
with ; extended hands, pronouncing a
blessing upon. another, saloon. If this
be not recreancy to a sacred trust, then
the only loyal moment in . Peter's life
was when he denied his Lord and Mas
ter.
"But let us hope and believe that
senility is the secret of this otherwise
Incomprehensible attitude."

Thomas N. McCauley, who rose from
"an ordinary farmer's lad to the posi
tion of president of the International
Mercantile Agency of New York and a
director in other prominent institutions
of the Empire State, arrived here yes
terday with his wife and is registered
at the St. Francis. He and his w,ife
and a party of friends have been visit
ing Meiico, where McCauiey is inter
ested in several enterprises. While in
the capital of the neighboring republic
McCauley was introduced to- President
Diaz and the newly electee Vice Pres
ident, Ramon Corral. During a formal
talk with Diaz he was informed that
the President of Mexico is sincere in
his recent announcement of his inten
tion to visit this country shortly. Mc-
Cauley was informed by Diaz that the
itinerary of the President's proposed
trip includes San Francisco.
Captain Diaz, son of the President,
while entertaining the New Yorker, re
ferred to the cordial feeling entertained
by his father for Americans, and as
sured his guest that nothing would
please the chief executive of the re
public of Mexico more than an extend
ed trip through the United States. It
is the main purpose of President Diaz
to visit the principal cities of this
country with a view to meeting lead
ing financiers with the hope of encour
aging them to invest their capital In
the southern republic, where American
enterprise is already lending much as
sistance in the /'development of the
mining and other industries.
McCauley, who was accompanied on
his visit to President Diaz by the
United States Embassador, joined the
latter in assuring the President that a
trip through the United States would
be attended by -demonstrations of
friendliness that would convince the
visitor that Americans are wholly in
sympathy with him in his administra
tion of the affairs of his own country
and fully appreciate the treatment he
has accorded citizens of the United
States.
. Vice President Corral, who has fre
quently visited San Francisco, has been
constantly urging President Diaz to
make a, tour, of the States, and McCau
ley savs the President has become en
thusiastic over the prospect of a pleas
ant journey in the north.
Among the properties in Mexico in
which McCauley is interested is the
Des -Rios plantation, which is owned
by the Mexican Gulf Commercial Com
pany, of which he is the president. It
is his intention to return to Mexico in
a few months.
To avoid difficulty it also included
a textual reproduction of the Russian

Sometimes I am ashamed to say I am a
resident of San Francisco, with the plug uglles
who are ' permit t<?J here. If it were not for
puMic sentiment the administration would give
a permit for bullfights.
I am pledged th<Â» support of numerous so
cieties in thlc determined step against an aw
ful evil. The Citizens' Alliance, with Its 15,
0<Â» members, has promised me Its support,
and I now appeal to the Typographical Union
to see that thÂ» union stamp shall be no longer
placed on such matter. It Is then I can eay
that the conservative members will be com
pelled to condemn it, if not to withdraw from
the union entirely.
The responsibility partly rests with the
printer who prints them. Ho says that It is
for money that he do<^i no, but that Is no ex
cuse for selling them to the youths of our city.
The storekeeper 1Â« responsible for the eiml he
gives in disposing of the vile stuff. I am in
formed that not only do men purchase the
obscene matter, but women, too, are known to
purchase It.
Common decency demands the suppression of
the unlawful traffic, 'but what can one ex
pect of an administration that opened the
Inirleside racetrack in defiance of the expressed
wish of fathers and mothers of this city â
parents who have no desire to see their boys
Lecom*Â» gamblers? What can bÂ« expected of
an administration wl-ich licenses prize fights,
even without restriction?
Who is responsible? The resorts where these
vile cards and pictures are distributed. A Si
beria Is too jfood for those responsible for the
distribution.
In the face of all this, who can measure the
effect of the evil? It has its influence en the
home and on the church; it prepares for a li
centious life in boy and girl.
France Â»ewÂ«l this seed, and her morals to
day are low and shameful. If this state of
affairs 13 permitted here, then San Francisco
mu.-i in cpuree of time become a second Paris.
When the complaints first came to mÂ« I did
not believe euch practice could be widespread
in our c!ty. I was advised that the only thing
to do was to awaken public sentiment and con
science, (or nothing practical would be done
by th3 city's administration.
Since last Monday, when I brought the mat
ter before the Methodist Ministers' Associa
tion, we h&ve had additional information that
this cbecenity has been going on for years in
Kan Francisco, while nothing has been done to
suppress It.
Cigar stands circulate these vile advertising
cards and Indecent pictures, and they may be
purchaMrd alfco at certain shops of the city.
The addresses of these offenders we will give
later.
My soul is filled with righteous indignation
at the revelations which have been divulged
anent the circulation In this city of obscene
adverti*exncmÂ» printed on the backs of busi
ness cards. It is not often that I diverge from
the gospel of Jesus, but this subject Is so Im
portant, the destructive influences that sur
round our youth. are eo pernicious, ' that it
would be a crime not to speak and not to pro
test would be to brand myself a coward And
unworthy the position I hold.
The flithy, .Jiwni-iiiif; pictures and foul read-
Ing matter circulated in San Francisco call for
our united contempt, and after a. few days I
and nearly all the ministers of San Francisco
will bring before you the names and the ad
dresses of such parties who have been further
ing their own low interests to the danger of
our boys and girls.
"Who is responsible for the. whole
sale destruction of our boys and girls
through the circulation of obscene lit
erature and pictures In San Fran
cisco?" was the subject discussed by
the Rev. F. A. Keast at the Epworth
Methodist Episcopal Church last night.
The Epeaker said in part:
The California Commandery of
Knights Templars got Into the going
yesterday morning. A quiet roll call
was ordered and a bunch of the state
ly gentlemen managed to get staked to
some steeds. The order was passed
around and the entire layout made a
graceful getaway in the direction of
the ocean boulevard.
All along the line the residents of
the peaceful Western Addition district
were awakened by cries of "Whoa
there," "Spit out that bit," "Say. son.
if you stop him, I'll give you a quar
ter," and other such phrases, some of
which were punctuated with language
that in some circles would be consid
ered strong. . j
: Some of the Knights managed to
keep from hitting the ground, while
others were wise enough to have
grooms following with buggies well
stocked with surgical instruments, all
kinds of linaments and a little of that
which cheers a man who is subject to
falling from a horse's back.
W>hen the ocean was reached the
real rough work began. Even the po
licemen on the beats were paralyzed
with fear and admiration at the won
derful sight. Pedestrians who never
swam a stroke in their lives plunged
headlong into the sea and others
scaled the walls of the Cliff House and
other places that seemed to offer a safe
refuge.
Many bets were laid at even money
that the cavalcade was going to in
vite Jack Munroe to, a preliminary
battle for the preliminary world's
championship title. No one seemed to
know where the gallant riders were go
ing or where they came from and the
wagering on this Question was brisk
for a while.
Joe Campbell was the leader, because
his horse insisted on being in front
of the gang. He looked like Tod
Sloan after being barred from the
British turf. Dr. E. R. Bryant posed
as a circus rider and some thought he
was the goods by the way he was hold
ing on to the saddle with one foot in
the air and his hand touching the
ground. He made r.n awful hit and
was awarded a prize.
Dr. Hartley could not make his horse
take on a burst of speed, but he was
there with the grace and had a polite
way of whispering into his horse's ear.
William Hibbler thought he was riding
an elephant and gave his nag a prod
with a stick. He does not thick so
any more. He got his quick and with
out warning.
They all swore that the ride was a
swell affair and a success. Each said
he had a good time, though the leave
taking with the horses was a brief one
and every man went right home.

FIERY STEEDS
VLADIVOSTOK. Aug. 7.â The evi
dence on which the British steamship
Knight Commander, sunk by the Vlad
ivostok squadron, was condemned by
the prize court was contained in a
letter-copying book taken from a press
in the captain's cabin. This book had
not' been delivered when the captain
surrendered the oth^r documents and
it proved conclusively to the Russians
that the cargo of railway material car
ried by the Knight Commander was
destined for Chemulpo and not for
private firms in Japan.
Before the prize court the captain
was not compelled to take an oath, the
president of the court saying that he
would accept his word of honor as a
gentleman.
The captain testified that neither he
nor the owr\ers of the Knight Com
mander knew that the cargo was con
traband and that they believed it was
not destined to be used as war ma
terial.
He was then confronted with his own
letter book and was dazed for a mo
ment. He then exclaimed:
"Heavens! I thought that book was
at the bottom of the sea."

The possession of Yinkow (the port
of Newchwang) has enormously sim
plified the transportation problem for
the Japanese. It gives their two ar
mies a freedom.; of movement which
they have not heretofore possessed.
The Japanese are speedily repairing
the railroad, which the Russians failed
to seriously damage in their hasty re
treat.
It is generally believed that the crisis
will come shortly at Liaoyang and that
Kuropatkin will be forced to give bat
tle, whatever his present purpose may
be. General Oku's and the Takushan
armies are pressing northward and
General Kurokl is close at hand, ready
to take any part necessary in the gen
eral Japanese play.
It is considered here that Kuropatkin
sacrificed his prestige by abandoning
an immense territory without a battle.
He was forced to abandon or destroy
valuable stores and munitions of war
when transportation was the most se
rious problem to the Russians. He also
impaired the morale of the army, but
he preserved his men and guns.
It is evident that Kuropatkin had
hoped and planned to check the Jap
anese at Tatchekiao. Then, after hold
ing the enemy in check, it is believed
to have been his purpose to concen
trate his remaining force at Liaoyang
and to strike Kurokl. The unexpect
ed loss of the Russian left at Tatche
kiao and the appearance of the Jap
anese Takushan army on the flank
forced the abandonment and surren
der, without a fight, of Yinkow, Hai
cheng and Newchwang.
TOKIO, Aug. 7.â General Kuropat
kin's success in extricating his army

certain to Involve it in disaster. It
was popularly believed that a great

either at Tatchekiao or at Haicheng.

leg being badly torn.
Two rival saloon-keepers on opposite
street corners were giving away beer in
an effort to outdo each other, and a
crowd surrounded each place. Peter
Dimero, who was acting as doorkeeper
at one of the saloons, says that Donetto
approached him and demanded money,
which was refused. He immediately
stepped back, took a bomb from his
pocket, lighted its fuse and threw it.
An explosion followed and men, women
and children ran screaming from the
place. Donetto was knocked down, but
soon recovered sufficiently to be able to
get away. When the police went to
arrest him to-day he threatened to
commit suicide. .
To-day an additional score of labor
agents representing Mississippi and
Georgia planters left for the Northern
and Eastern cities to buy contract la
bor in aa large numbers as possible.
Urgent telegrams were also dispatched
in frantic haste to the labor agents al
ready in these cities to make extraordi
nary efforts to get thousands of men.
In eight of the heaviest cotton pro
ducing States there is pressing neetl
of 2,000,000 more laborers, not alone for
cotton picking, but for railroad and in
dustrial development. Reports from
these eight States made to the co
operation bureau place the shortage
of laborers absolutely necessary at this
time at an even two million.
NEW ORLEANS. Aug. 7.â Th*
States in the cotton belt are facing a
labor famine of immense proportions.
The planters of the various States
have been co-operating In haste to ob
tain, labor for the opening of the crop
season and the results are disappoint

Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
At this point the Japanese torpedo
boat destroyer Inazuma Joined the
other two and the three turned and
spiritedly attacked the eleven Russian
boats^^The latter retired within the
harbor. The Japanese boats were un
injured. The damage to the Russian
ships is unknown. ...
Admiral , Togo congratulated the
men and officers of the three Japan
ese boats on attacking and causing the
retreat of, a superior number of the
enemy's ships.
TOKIO, Aug. 7. â Admiral Togo re
ports an exciting torpedo-boat destroy
er fight which took place off Port Ar
thur on Friday evening, August 5.
The Japanese torpedo-boat destroyers
Akebono andOboro approached the
entrance of the harbor for the purpose
of reconnoitering. Fourteen Russian
torpedo-boat - destroyers dashed out,
separated, and endeavored to surround
the Japanese boats. '. The latter broke
through the cordon, however, driving
off three of the Russian boats.
DIAZ TO TOUR
UNITED STATES
General Kuropatkin reports some
Russian successes In outpost fighting
on August 5, without the expected
great battle having opened.
The simultaneous receipt of favor
able news from these commanders in
the Far East raised the spirits of the
populace of the Russian capital Im
mensely. The dispatches were printed
in special newspaper bulletins and
were eagerly bought on the streets.
Newsboys around the depots met the
strong crowds of Sunday pleasure
seekers and shouted their wares with
out being reproved by the police and
thousands of St. Petersburgers went
to their homes to-night apparently sat
isfied that a favorable turn of affairs
had commenced at the front.
General Stoessel's dispatch, though
ten days old. is taken as a satisfactory
refutation of the recently repeated
rumors of the fall of Port Arthur. He
says that the determined Japanese as
saults were repulsed with tremendous
losses and figures 10,000 as the number
of Japanese killed or wounded.' This
is admittedly on Chinese information,
which, heretofore, has proved of doubt
ful value. But with Russian losses of
1500 as a basis, the authorities here
consider that 10,000 is a fairly "conserv
ative estimate, since the Japanese were
beaten off In what must have been a
desperate assault on tremendously
Rtrong fortifications. The fact that the
Japanese were not able to remove their
dead and wounded is taken to prove
that their defeat must have been one
of great severity. .
The part played by the fleet bears
out the prediction that Rear Admiral
Withoeft is able to render efficient sup
port to the garrison. It is considered
significant that no mention is made of
Vice Admiral Togo, Indicating that the
Japanese fleet is impotent to aid friends
or Injure foe. Possibly the bulk of the
fleet has been detached for other ser
vice, though this would not be likely
at a time when a serious land assault
on the fortress was contemplated.
The authorities do not divulge the
source of General Stoessel's report,
though It is understood that it came
by way of Chefu..- The fact that the
Japanese are in' possession of the
country is far north as Haicheng ren
ders it unlikely that it came by the
land route.
General Kuropatkin's report states
that the Japanese are stationary on his
eastern front, the greatest activity
being on the south and southeast posi
tions, where, the Russians are able to
take the offensive. While the move
ments In themselves are apparently of
no great importance, they are interest
ing as showing that the Japanese are
still halting before undertaking the se
rious task of attacking Liaoyang, with
its strong circle of defenses.
* ; : : â â b
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 8.â The of
ficial report ' from Lieutenant General
Btoessel, commanding the military
forces at Port Arthur, says that the
Japanese were repulsed with tremen
dous losses in a three days' fight, from
July 26 to July 28.
LIAOYANG, Thursday, Aug. 4.â
Liaoyang is in no immediate danger,
though the Russians have been com
pelled to fall back, owing to the su
perior numbers of the Japanese. A
Russian cavalry division was until to
day in contact with the enemy south
of Anshanshan. The Japanese did not
capture any rolling stock at Haicheng.
It is rumored here that the Japanese
are changing their base to New
chwang. . . ....
Though apparently beaten at every
point and though the Japanese have
advanced well on the Russian flank,
the Russians in council of war have
determined to defend all their positions
as heretofore. All the foreign at
taches and newspaper correspondents
are hurrying to the lines.
ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 7.â General
Kuropatkin, in a telegram to the. Em
peror, dated August 6, reports a recon
naisance on August 5 Â¦ on the south
front, in the direction of the Japanese
positions. The Russians set fire to the
village of Henchuantsa, thirteen miles
northeast of Newchwang, from which
place a small force of Japanese fled
precipitately, leaving their transport
animals. -
LIAOYANG, Saturday, Aug. 6.â The
Japanese are advancing on Mukden
and it is probable that a simultaneous
attack will be made on Mukden and
Liaoyang, in which case a decisive bat
tle is assured. "Â¦':

REGULAR DEMOCRATS.
We can see no hope for party suc
cess under the present unfair and au
tocratic rule. Under that rule the
Democratic vote is constantly dwin
dling and the influence of the party
is becoming minimized. Yet San
Francisco is naturally a Democratic
city, and we believe a better under
standing with the mass of the voters
will again put the party in a position
of triumphant mastery.
McXab says the Democrats are sat
isfied with the Dresent conditions. If
they were satisfied it would have been
impossible to give the Democratic
League movement its present propor
tions^ â proportions so formidable that
I feel certain that at the r>olls to
morrow the Democratic voters of San
Francisco will put an end to McNab
ism once and for all.
Then all Democrats can come back
to the party ranks. Then we can go
into battle with the Republicans with
confidence instead of a feeling that
we are foredoomed to defeat. All the
League asks is that every Democrat
will make it a, special point to vote
at the primarv.' We want a full ex
pression of party opinion, and I am
confident that expression will be in
favor of party emancipation from the
thrall and delivery from the evils of
McXabism.
In the present county committee
there is never a roll-call to get at the
wishes of the members. The body is
rarely called to order. When one of
the rare meetings is held there is no
pretense of getting at the demands of
the districts through the members rep
resenting those districts. There is
nothing but the arbitrary forcing
through of a prearranged programme
prepared by the one-man power. Me-
Nab. The Democratic League prom
ises to put a stop to that sort of thing
and to take the voters into the confi
dence c-f the governing body.
The League movement is not an
effort to substitute O'Brienism or any
bossism for McNabism. It is an ef
fort to get Democrats back into the
party from which they have been
driven by McXabism and then to let
the Democratic voters govern the
party councils.
The Democratic League does not
believe in calling by hard names every
Democrat that opposes its purposes or
its policy. We want Democrats to get
together and to stay together, so that
the party may again win victories at
the polls and give to San Francisco
a government that will be honest, effi
cient and Democratic.
HEAD OF HORSE AND CARTS.
WHO WANTS TO START SOME
THING AMONG DEMOCRATS.
The league believes that when patron
age is to be distributed the district
leaders should be called into council
and their opinions solicited.
Why should tITe districts have to
submit their lists of delegates to Mr.
McXab before they are permitted to
vote on those names? Should not the
districts be supreme in such matters?
That is one of the things we are fight
ing for. If the Democratic party stands
for anything it stands for a submis
sion of all questions directly to the
people. We demand that the Demo
cratic voter be consulted about the af
fairs of the party in this city. At pres
ent the voter .is ignored with con
tempt.

The Egan faction of the Union La

sent the political views of Mayer
Schmitz and A. Ruef, has filed a com
plete list of delegates to a local nomi
nating convention. Opposition has
been announced in several districts.

will meet at Santa Cruz on Monday,
August 22, and nominate ten Presi

The people have voted overwhelming
ly their confidence in the present of
ficials. Why then aim to destroy an
organization that produces such re
sults? Why should such an organiza
tion be opposed?
The answer is plain. Although the
people at large immensely profit by
henest government, there are classes
that lose. Corruption has been limited
to places beyond the reach of the Su
pervisors. The larger forms of cor
ruption can only be successfully ac
complished by having control of the
legislative body. These have been im
possible for six years. If the regular
organization could be overthrown by
the graftsmen, not one of the men who
have so nobly upheld public honor on
the Board of Supervisors would ever
again be nominated.

Police Judges â Alfred J. Fritz.
Charles T. Conlan, Edmund P. Mogan
and George H. Cabaniss.
These are the exhibits which the or
ganization places before the people in
proof of its character.
When the municipal administration
now in office will have completed its
term the Democracy will have con
trolled the legislative power for six
years. In that time no Democrat on the
board has failed in his duty. Neither
malice nor partisanship has dared be
smirch a single name. No other city in
America has such a record.
Honest officials cannot be procured
from other than an honest organiza
tion. Figs cannot he gathered from
thistles now any more than in the
ancient time.

That organization stands for cleanli
ness in politics. If it is true that you
know men by their works, then the
local Democracy has only to point to
the men elected during six years. Those
now in power are:
The issue of this primary is honest
government. The purpose of injecting
my personality into the contest is to
obscure the fact that the Democratic
organization has produced honest and
elficient men in office to whose worth
the voters testify by increasing ma
jorities. I am no part of the organiza
tion. I am its friend. I admire Its ag
gressive honesty, which is not exampled
in any similar organization in America.
That organization was chosen by a con
vention elected at a primary under the
lav/, where ' every man had a right to
run as a delegate and where .every man
had an opportunity to vote. The organ
ization had its being in a primary when
its opponents who are making so much
noise in the Examiner ran a ticket in
every district. The enemies of the or
ganization were defeated by the Demo
cratic voters.
BY GAVIN McXAB.
Under the McNab regime the dis
tricts have had nothing to say about
the distribution of patronage. All the
Democrats of a district might recom
mend the appointment of some one to
a place. The appointment might be
one to greatly benefit the party. But
those Democrats would petition In
vain. McNab was the sole arbiter and
dispenser. The Democratic League
promises an entire reform in this also.
The Democratic League has not ped
dled around the streets promises of
nominations before a single delegate
was elected, as Mr. McNab has done.
Our delegates will be free men. not
mere tools or chattels. Under the Dem
ocratic League plan the people will con
trol the nominations and not a man in
a small office in the Mills b'uilding. We
will get our commission directly from
the voters and render a sharp account
directly to those voters.
In past Democratic conventions it has
been necessary for Democrats before
they could get upon the convention
floor to secure a pass from Mr. McNab,
countersigned by Mr. Hickey. We want
to put a ston to that sort of thing. In
the convention proposed by the Demo
cratic League all Democrats win be
more than welcome on the floor. Their
ideas will be given attention; their ad
vice will be heeded. The Democratic
party gatherings are for all Democrats,
and not merely for a tagged and tick
eted few, specially privileged.
At the present time the party is sup
posed tc- have a county committee. The
"organization" is presumed to be some
thing mere than Mr. McNab. But what
has that county committee done to
prepare for this primary? When have
the district members been called to
gether to make up the district tickets?
There has been no meeting. One man
has done it all.
Against such undemocratic methods
the Democratic League protests. It
promises a complete reform. The dis
trict leaders know the Democrats of
the districts. They know their neigh
bors. They are familiar with the dis
trict needs. The Democratic League
promises those district leaders and the
district voters that once again they
will have a voice in the party coun
cil?.
The Democratic League depends upon
the Democrats of the different districts
for its strength. It goes to the districts
to make up its primary tickets. When
the delegates from the districts meet in
open convention they will make up
their ticket for submission to the voters
in November. There will be no slate,
no advance programme.
To-morrow the Democratic voters of
San Francisco will say whether they
intend to have a voice in the party's
affairs or whether they will continue to
be manipulated by a few men in a back
room. I feel confident the voters will
insist on taking the control of the party
into their own hands, and in this strug
gle the Democratic League represents
this movement for party independence.
The Democratic League is th* out
growth of the general demand that
loyal Democrats shall no longer be ig
nored in the councils of the party. Its
first insistence is that the driving of
Democrats out of the party must stop.
We want equal rights and equal oppor
tunities for all who are loyal to the
party and true to the Democratic faith.
We charge Gavin McNab with usurp
ing the position of leader and then ig
noring the Democratic voters.
What body of Democrats ever elected
him to leadership? Where was the
meeting held? How many votes were
cast? What was the title given him?
There was no meeting; there was no
election. Then how did Mr. JIcNab
come to be the boss of the party? His
position was not given him. He took it.
Now the Democratic League asks that
the matter of leadership be submitted
to the Democrats of San Francisco, and
not decided offhand by Mr. McNab.
Mr. McNab and his followers have
called me a boss. I am not. I have no
ambition to be a boss. But a year ago
an open meeting was called at Pioneer
Hall. Notices were printed in the pa
pers telling of that meeting and its pur
poses. The Democrats who gathered
there did so to ask why they were shut
out of party councils and why Mr. Mc-
Nab was trying to drive them away
from Democracy. At that open, adver
tised meeting 1 was elected president
of the Democratic League. But no
open, advertised meeting of Democrats
ever elected Mr. McNab as president,
leader or boss.

FIFTY THOUSAND registered voters in San Francisco are entitled to vote at the primary election which will take place to-morrow. It is estimated that 25,000 of these electors will take advantage of the voting privilege. Dele
gates to the State and local nominating conventions of the several political parties will be chosen. In the Democratic ranks there is an animated fight for the control of the City Convention. In the Republican party the regular
organization ticket is confronted by active opposition in four Assembly districts. Only one Union Labor ticket has been filed in the Registrar's office., and this simply embraces local delegates, as no State convention of the

Harris of the Methodist Episcopal
board of foreign missions, who has been

years, gave an address this evening at
the First Methodist Church on the war
between Russia and Japan. He de
clared that the Russian people were not
responsible for the conflict, which was
brought on through the machinations
of men high in religious and political
circles. The. leaders in the church of
Russia, he said, exercise a power as
great as that exerted by the political
leaders. These, men, imbued with the
ambition to make Russia a worldwide
power, were responsible for the war.

BERKELEY, Aug. 7.â The attend

the summer vacation, demonstrates
that there is not room enough to ac
commodate all the children comfort
ably with the present number of
schoolrooms. Superintendent S. D.
Waterman sets forth the. situation in
a statement to the public, in which
he shows that, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of many children on ac
count of the recent vaccination order,
there has been an increase of 250 in
the number of school children. In re
viewing the conditions Superintendent
Waterman says:
"The need for more school accom
modations and especially for the con
centration of the scl.-ols in each dis
trict was never more apparent than at
the present time. At least sixteen
rooms to the building, as soon as the
population in each district will war
rant, are the least number that should
be provided to adequately meet the
needs.
"The enrollment in the different
schools is as follows: Lincoln 487. Le

CHICAGO, Aug. 7. â The report of
the adjutant general of the Grand
Army of the Republic to be made
at the national encampment at Boston
will show an active membership of
a quarter of a million. The total num
ber of Civil War veterans still livins U
estimated by the Pension Commis
sioner at 800,000.
During the year ending June 80.
1804, 9029 members of the order died.
The Pension Commissioner reports
that but a few more than 30,000 vet
erans passed away during the aamu
period. It is a plain inference there
fore that the Grand Army of the Re
public is composed of the younger and
more active survivors of the great war.
During the last year the gains In the
Grand Army aggregated 23.000, while
the actual losses were slightly In ex
cess of the gains.
The order is organized Into forty
five departments, embracing about
8200 Grand Army posts. During the
last year thirty-three new posts were
organized, sixty-five surrendered their
charters and about 100 failed to mako
reports.

DES MOINES. Iowa, Aug. 7.âAwak
ening from a Rip Van Winkle dream
of six and a half years, during which
he killed three men and fatally wound
ed three others, John W. Stone will be
brought from the insane ward of the
Iowa penitentiary to Des Moines to be
tried on a charge of murder.
Stone undoubtedly lost his reason
while in search of an invention that
would make him famous and wealthy.
He worked for years unceasingly upon
all sorts of peculiar devices and finally
obtained in Canada a patent cm a corn
elevator for carrying corn .from the
wagon to the crib. His studious appli
cation made him nervous and excit
able and, flnalW positively violent.
Several times he ran amuck and used
his revolver with deadly effect. Now
he must face the court here In a trial
for murder.
Judge Conrad, who sentenced Stone
to the insane hospital, has died and
Stone's father has removed from Sioux
City to Ohio, but will return. to be with
him at his trial.
Stone has apparently awakened from
the stupor that has hung over him.
Mystified by his surroundings, he has
asked his whereabouts. ' He was as
tonished to find himself In an institu
tion for the insane and asked why he
was there. He was told the story of
his crimes. He could not believe the
record of his own deeds.
Though a mental and physical wreck
when he entered the institution. Stone
has gradually improved in body and
mind until he is apparently in posses
sion of all his faculties.

ST. JOHNS. N. F., Aug. 7.â The seal
ing steamship Erik, which was char
tered by the Government and convoyed
an auxiliary expedition to the steam
ship Neptune, which has been in Hud
son Bay for the past. year with the
Canadian official expedition sent for the
purpose of annexing territory there, re
turned here to-day, bringing Major
Moodle of the Northwest mounted po
lice, Governor of Hudson Bay.
The Erik met the Neptune at Port
Burwell, Ungawa Bay, on Monday,
July 25, and spent a week transferring
coal and supplies. She started on the
return Journey last Tuesday, while the
Neptune cruised north to Lancaster
Sound, hoisting the British flag and
proclaiming British sovereignty over
that region.
Major Moodie reports that the Nep
tune went into winter quarters in Ful
lerton Inlet last October and found the
American whaler Era, the only vessel
known to be in Hudson Bay during the
past season, wintering in the same vi
cinity. The Neptune built a fort there,
established a garrison of police and or
ganized the place as a port of entry
and stopped illicit trading with the na
tives. The Era paid duty on all goods
intended for trade with the natives,
thereby admitting Canadian authority.
Is Persia's Persuasive
Way.
Nailing Their Ears to the Sidewalk
"There is only one custom in our
country which I would like to see es
tablished In America, and that is the
custom of dealing with drunkards,"
said Isaac Yohannen, a Persian mis
sionary who lectured to a large audi
ence at the Norwegian Lutheran
Church last evening. "In our country
when a man gets drunk we take him
and nail him to the sidewalk, driving
the spikes through his ears. Then when
other people come along they spit in
his face and kick him until he is so
ber. I think this method would do a
great deal of good in America, because
you have more drunkards than we do.
There are no saloons in Persia, the
chief beverage being home-made wine.
They don't even know what beer is."
"Our officials have several ways of
making prisoners confess to crimes,"
said Mr. Yohannen. "The favorite
method is to take them on a stand,
around which all the people of the
town gather, and then put out one eye.
If the crime is not very great an arm
is cut off or a leg severed. If it is
only a trivial offense probably an ear
is sacrificed. Very often innocent peo
ple are subjected to these torments,
but it cannot be helped..
"The Persians very seldom hang a
man for crime. If he kills another he
is fined $15 and allowed to go. If he
kills ten or a dozen and the people
finally decide that he ought to be put
out of the way he is hanged. "But
he is not hanged as they hang men In
this country. He is hanged by the feet
and a heavy weight is tied to his head.
Then he is allowed to die. If the ac
cused prisoner Is a woman her hair
is 6horn from her head, providing the
offense is a trivial one. If it is a se
rious one she may be turned into a
room filled with mad cats and be
scratched to death.
"Persian Jails are dark cellars and
contain no furniture whatever. The
Government doesn't feed prisoners,
this being left to friends of the. ac
cused. If he happens to have no
friends he will starve to death. Often
times when food is brought by friends
the keepers of the prison and other of
ficials appropriate it, so that the pris
oners have to go hungry."

recently and buried them in a tin box
beneath the little shop which he con
ducted on Howard street.

his shop in ruins and his money gone.
He was frantic with excitement. His

Klein says he had, $500 in bills and
several thousand dollars in securities

says many of the securities are ruined.
Two boys, who were poking in the
ruins this morning, found two flfty

KEENE'S TROTTING HORSES
HELD UP BY RAILROAD
Station Agent Finds Too Many "Dead
- heads" In Charge- of the
Animals.
SYRACUSE, N. Y., Aug. 7.â Seven
carloads of James R. Keene's stable
of trotting horses were held up at the
New York Central . station here to
night and not allowed to proceed to
Yonkers until the stationmaster, Syl
vester Burns, had collected $212 80 in
railroad fares from men deadheading
their way from San Francisco. The
men protested vigorously and not un
til Burns threatened to sidetrack the
horses in the yards did they settle.
The horseman's contract with the
railroad company provided for six
men to care for the horses in each
car, but when the train reached here
there were as many as fourteen men
in some cars.
It is human nature to dislike those
who are smarter than we areâ also to
despise those who are not.

Passing of Meerschnum Pipes.
"A meerschaum pipe that would have

bring more than $10 now." said a to
bacconist. "Meerschaum pipes used to
be fashionable and popular in America,
but they are not much sought for to
day.
"It Isn't strange that the liking for
them should have waned. The meer
schaum is an unsatisfactory pipe at the
best. Drop It. and it is irretrievably
broken. Try to color and for a month
It tastes like soap.
"It Isn't the meerschaum In one of
these pipes that colors, anyway. It is
a mixture of beeswax and oil that the
carvers rub into the block before they
carve it. You could smoke a pipe of
pure meerschaum all your life and
at your death it would be as white as
It had been at your birth. It is the
oil and the beeswaxâ only thatâ which
colors.
"While meerschaum pipes have fallen
In cost and favor, briar pipes have

Great Rangoon Bell Restored.
â¢ After conquering Burmah the British
undertook to carry the great Rangoon
bell, the third largest in the world, to
Calcutta as a trophy, but dropped it
overboard In the Rangoon River, where
it defied all the efforts of the engineers
to raise it. Some years later the Bur
mese, who had not ceased to mourn .is
loss, begged to be allowed to recover it.
Their petition was granted, and. by at
taching an incredible number of bam
boo floats, the unwieldy mass of metal
was finally lifted from Its muddy bed
and triumphantly restored to ita place.
"I am not mixing up in eleventh hour ;
fights." said Frank C. Jordan, "and I |

and not doing politics."
So a waiting public will have to con
tinue its waiting if it hopes for en- |

The supervisorial fight in the Fifth ]
District will be the only excitement of
the Republican primary, with the ex
ception of a little contest in Alameda.
The fight will center in the Second j
Ward with twenty-six delegates, and |
Â¦whoever carries that section on Tues
day will probably be the nominee of
the rarty.
The contest between R, H. E. Espee
and Clinton G. Dodge, both of the Sev
enth Ward, for the Assembly nomina
tion in the Fifty-first District, is* unset
tled. There will be one ticket in that
district which will support Lukens for
Senator and Rowe for Supervisor. Espee
has agreed to take his chances with this
ticket. Dodge said to-night that his
decision would be given to-morrow.
In Alameda the contest between J.
Clem Bates, the present Assemblyman,
and former Senator E. K. Taylor for
control of the delegation is assuming a
peculiar condition. Bates takes the
ground that the list of delegates an
nounced by him will be for him for the
Assembly. As there is no vacancy in
the State Senatorship, Senator Know
land not yet having been nominated for
Congress and not yet having resigned
his State office, delegates to fill a va
cancy that don't exist cannot be elect
ed. In a circular issued to-day Bates
gives a list of names of those who were
given places upon the Taylor ticket who
will support his ticket as against Taylor
. and who refuse to recognize their place
on the Taylor ticket. They are Peter

"in situ" and evidence such as this
can be accepted as proof of the asser
tion that man existed in California at
a period earlier than it has been proved
that he existed anywhere else in the
world.
The excavations of the old Indian
mounds at Shell Mound Park go far
to bear out this theory of the exist
ence of primitive man. Dr. Max Uhle
of the anthropology department is pre
paring for publication a report on the
excavations and all that he found
there. The age of the mound is indi
cated by the fact that although its
summit rises twenty-nine feet above
the surrounding plain, its original base
is three feet under ground and about
two feet below the level of the sea at
high tide. The sinking of the ground
is believed to have been a very slow
process, extending over thousands of
years. The mound. Dr. Uhle believes,
was undoubtedly begun on low ground,
the immediate proximity of a creek be
ing one of the principal reasons for the
selection of the spot.
Some 600 specimens have been taken
from the mound, half of them being of
bone, the others mostly stone. Ten
skeletons were discovered in lower lay
ers of the mound and all the evidence
points to a gradual change in the bur
ial methods as the layers of earth were
piled up higher and higher.
In the higher layers were found un
mistakable signs of the custom of
burning the dead. The interior of the
mound is visibly stratified in many
places by distinct layers of shells,
fishes and charcoal. There are un
doubted signs of differences of civil
ization among inhabitants of the
mound at various periods. The frag
ments of mortars and pestles were
found down to the lowest layer, but in
other respects ground objects of stone
were found only in the upper layers.
Well-shaped bone awls were discovered
in the higher layers. A curious in
crease In the number of Implements of
bone of finer workmanship, not repre
sented in the upper layers, was visible
in the lowest layers, signifying a dif
ferent use of the natural resources
of the region at different psriods.
The fauna represented by the re
markable number of bones found dur
ing the excavation corresponded to
that of the present environment of the
bay, except that it included the beaver,
elk. bear, otter and numberless other
large animals long since vanished from
this part of California.
The specimens taken from the mound
correspond in many cases to thone
taken from the limestone caves of
Shasta County, which have yielded so
many fossil remains to scientific re
search. Rude implements found in
the Shasta caves indicate that prehis
toric man lived thousands of years
ago on this rim of the continent.
An account of the investigation of
the question of the antiquity of man
now being made by the department of
anthropology of the University of Cali
fornia is for the first time made public
in a bulletin issued at the university
to-day. There are already in the uni
versity museum a number of relics of
early man that have been declared by
their discoverers to have been found
in the auriferous gravels. No scientist
yet, however, has found such subjects

BERKELEY, Aug. 6.â The tendency
among all late purchasers of property
in* Berkeley is to locate in the north and
southeast parts of town. The Wheeler
and Scenic Park tracts are the most
attractive in North Berkeley and the
Berry & Bangs Tract seems to have
been singled out as the most desirable
in Southeast Berkeley. In each of these
districts may be seen some of the finest
residences in the college town. Many
new ones are building and contracts
are being let daily for others.
, Within the last sixty days the firm of
W. J. Mortimer & Co. have sold $19,000
worth of building lots in Scenic Park.
Upon all of these will -be built substan
tial homes. Among the houses being
built in this tract is one for John Galen
Hownrd, the supervising architect for
the university, who has designed for
himself a home of most original design.
Besides this there Is being built a mod
ern apartment-house to be called Cleon
Court, upon which $60,000 will be spent.
In the Wheeler Tract Mortimer & Co.
is building for Professor Edward N.
Prouty a home that will cost $5000, and
for Dr. W. W. Underhill of San Fran
cisco another that will cost $3500.

While the section to the north of Oak
land is building up very rapidly, there
is also a decided development to the
south, and H. A. Pleitner of Fruitvale
reports the following sales in support
of this fact:

I have such unbounded faith in the future of
Central Oakland on account of its geographi
cal location between Oakland and Berkeley
that I have given up .my office at 467 Ninth
street In order to rive my personal attention
to Central Oakland property.
Central Oakland Is also attracting much at
tention on account of its warm belt and uni
form high elevation. I have lived there many
years and know whereof I speak. Owing to
the fact that many of the streets were not
graded until recently the prevailing impres
sion has been that the land was low. The
extension of the sewer system and the grading
of streets has fully demonstrated the fact that
Central Oakland averages 64% feet higher
elevation than Fourteenth street and Broad
way, the rise being so gradual that It Is hardly
perceptible to the naked eye. The property
to be sold at auction ranges from 106 to US
feet elevation.
Having been for several years heavily In
terested In Central Oakland, I have opened
an office at the Key route station, corner of
Telegraph avenue and Fortieth street, and will
co-operate In handling the auction sale In con-
Junction with A. J. Snyder of 4ti7 Ninth etreet
and the Realty Bonds and Finance Company
of Fourteenth street and Broadway, Oakland.
OPENING NEW SECTION.
A strong indication of the increasing
interest in choice real estate on the
eastern bay shore is the revival of the
auction sale. Only one auction sale
has been attempted upon this side of
the bay in many years, and that was a
success. The Realty Bonds and Finance
Company sold an entire tract in one
afternoon a few months ago, and now
another event of the same kind is an
nounced.
The tract that is now being placed on
the market by this means is on the
Telegraph-avenue line of the Oakland
Transit Company, and within a few
blocks of the new Piedmont branch of
the "Key route" ferry system. Three
of the'most influential real estate firms
in Oakland are behind it, the Realty
Bonds and Finance Company, A. J.
Snyder and Richard J, Montgomery.
Montgomery has opened an office at the
corner of Fortieth street and Tele
graph avenue in order to care for those
who wish to visit the property. In re
gard to the opening of this new sec
tion and the plans being made, Mr.
Montgomery said:
Since the inauguration of the Key Route
Ferry Electric Railroad, giving Central Oak
land the benefit of a twenty-minute train
service with -monthly commutation tickets at
$3 per month and the shortening of the time
to thirty minutes between the foot of Market
street. San Francisco, and- Telegraph avenue,
in this city, there has been an unprecedented
demand for houses of all kinds within walking
distance of Telegraph.avenue station. It is,
therefore, not surprising that many far
sighted people with idle capital are seeking
investments In this locality and buildln*
houses to rent. In fact, the demand has been
so active that few opportunities are given to
the thrifty and industrious, who have a lim
ited capital, to purchase lots on easy pay
ments. It Is gratifying to note that a largo
property- owner has authorized the sale of over
sixty lots in Central Oakland tract No. 2 at
public auction on Saturday. August 20, at 2
p. m. The Â»ale la to take place on the prop
erty to enable purchasers to see what lots

-To Markham the affair Is no jest.
The section hands at Sabine refuse to
work unless protected from the pests.
The mosquito catchers say they will
stand pat. The construction work of
the Southern Pacific in Texas is tied
up by a "union" consisting of two ne
groes.
j The negroes are peculiarly adapted
â¢ to the work because of their color,
| which is not easily distinguished in
; the dark. " To white men the work
j would be fraught with peril. For the
j labor of killing mosquitoes the "nig
â¢ gers" have been receiving $1 75 a
i day. .They want $2 25.
During the week that Markham has
been wondering how to arbitrate the
Â¦strike, numerous substitutes for the
| expert, slayers of the insects have been
â¢ suggested. Gatling guns were pro
[ posed. They have been tried before
' but found impractical. Ammunition
is too expensive and wounded mos
quitoes have been known to tear up
sections of the track in the death
i agony.
Another method once tried proved
I too costly. A herd of Texas longhorns
j into whose bran mash gallons of Ken
i tucky moonshine had been poured.
(were driven out for mosquito feed.
j The insects became intoxicated and
were easily chloroformed while in
Ithat condition. Many of the mosqui
j toes were teetotalers and survived to
Â¦ warn their descendants to say always
I "cusses on the rum."
General Manager Charles H. Mark
ham of the Southern Pacific is pon
dering 1 over the queerest strike on rec
ord. The Mosquito Catchers' Union
of Sabine, Texas, has walked out,
practically tying up construction work
in that part of the country, for the
section hands cannot work unless pro
tected from the ravages of the insects.
The union consists of just two
negroes, who have made a life study
of the work, as their methods show.
They steal among a swarm of mos
quitoes after dusk with bits of straw
and bags of snuff. The insects are
peculiarly sensitive in the rejrion of
the third rib. The cunning negroes
tickle that part of the anatomy with
the straw. When the insect opens its
mouth to laugh they pour snuff down
it3 throat. The mosquito sneezes to
death.

an average horsepower of 18,558 and a
speed, as taken by six runs over a

Commander Newton is among the
number remaining of- the classes who
entered the Academy in 1S64-65-66, con
stituting the so-called "hump." Officers
of prior years gained their promotion
to higher grades rapidly, but those in
"the hurnp" remained stationary as
lieutenants for more than twenty years,
getting gray in the service without the
recompense of rank and salary. It took
Lieutenant Mason twenty-two years to
become a lieutenant commander, which
rank he held three years, and then,
through- the operation of the personnel
law of 1SSU, he was. promoted in Novem
ber, 18i>&, to be commander. Command
er Mason is 34 years of age and will not
go on the retired list until October It,
11*12. He has therefore eight years be
fore" him of active service, for which
d,uty he is qualified by years of labor
and experience, and he is likely to
prove a thoroughly competent chief of
bureau of ordnance. -
IMilCKY L1EUTEXANTS.
The selection of Commander Newton
Kliphalet Mason as chief of the Bureau
of Ordnance brings to- the fore an of
ficer who, judprinjr from his service
record, is well qualified for the position.
He entered the navy July 24, 1865, and
up to the present time has had eighten
years and six months sea service,
eighteen years shore duty, and w;as un
employed only two years and six
months, making a total of thirty-nine
years in the service. At present he is
in command of the cruiser Cincinnati
and on his eighth cruise. Exclusive of
four years at the naval academy,
counted as shore duty, he has been
fourteen years on shore service, eleven
years "f which he spent at the tor
pedo station gun foundry bureau and
proving grounds, gaining an experience
in the theory and practice of ordnance
details, without which no one is com
petent to discharge the important
duties of chief of the Bureau of Ord
nance.
striking illustration. He was a candi
date for the position of Engineer in
Chief Melville, but. failing in getting it, i
was content to accept that of chief of
the Bureau of Equipment fn October
last, and held it until March, when he
was shifted into the Bureau of Ord
nance vacated by Charles O'Neil. And
now he has landed in the Bureau of {
Navigation, having been successively j
chief of three bureaus in less than ten
months, though each one of the offices
named requires special technical
knowledge. Captain Converse will prob
ably make a better desk admiral than
he did as a seagoing officer, for j
he has had less sea duty in his forty- |
two years and eight months of service
than Â£0 captains, 120 commanders and
1*>8 lieutenant commanders. He has had
only thirteen years and nine months
at sea. of which five years and three
months during the last twenty-six

SAN EIEGO. Aug. 7.â A crowd of
between ZOO and 400 people from San

fornia attended the first bullfight of
the year at Tia Juana this afternoon.
Mary excursionists came from Los
Angeles to spend a day or two at the
seaside and incidentally to see what a
Mexican bullfight is like.
Lieutenant Oovernor Barreto was
present and directed the cc-ntest. in
that he gave the signals when the bulls
should be admitted and attacked. The
fcr:r.er leader of the bullfighters met
death at Mazatlan since he was here
a year agro and the new leader, Bar
rera, proved his equal, though both he
and Palmero had close calls by the
hcrr.s of the beasts.
When the fifth and last bull was
about to be admitted the leader walk
ed to the center of the ring and an
nounced that in general Americans did
not want to see a bullfight carried to
the extent of killing, but if it was the
pleasure of the audience the matador
would do his work. There was a yell
of approval which was taken to mean
that the bull should be killed. Barrera

What must strike the person un
familiar with notions prevailing in the
navy is the assumed adaptability and
fitness of officers, ranking not lower
than commanders, to fill the position
of chief of any bureau. Such, how
ever, is the custom, in the navy, .which
has become a fixed fact, limited only
by such safp^uanls as United- States
statutes prescribe. Up to 1S53 the
design and construction of ships was
under the control of captains of the
navy, the naval constructors being
subordinate and having no rank.'Since
then the chief of th<* Bureau of Con
struction has been a naval construc
tor. The Bureau of Yards and Docks
was likewise under the control of a
navy captain until April 4, 1898, when
the law was changed and a civil en
gineer was appointed chief of that
bureau. The bureau chiefships open
to the officers of the line have thus
been narrowed down to those of navi
gation, equipment, ordnance and
steam engineering. The corps of engi
neers having ceased to exist as a dis
tinct and special branch in the navy,
any officer above the grade of lieuten
ant commander * may be appointed
chief of the Bureau of Steam Engi
neering. In the navy rank and knowl
edge are synonyms. ,. ,

FURTHER COMPLICATIONS.
Some remarkable changes and shift
ing about among the bureaus of the
Navy Department have taken place I
within the past year and the Board of j
Construction as a consequence Is j
composed of officers none of !
whom have hitherto had anything 1 â¢
to do with ' determining upon the j
general or detailed designs of i
ships to be built. This will natural- |
ly result In delaying n*w construction, Â¦
as the new members will require time j
to formulate and present their ideas j
and finally agree upon some com- Â¦
premise design. The first vacancy was J
made when Engineer in Chief George |
Wallace Melville, chief of the Bureau !
of Steam Engineering since August 9, I
1SS7, was retired August S. 1903, and I
was succeeded by Captain Charles !
Whiteside Rae. Next followed Captain i
Royal Bird Bradford, chief of the Bu- j
reau of Equipment since December 18, i
1SS7, who resigned October 21, 190o, and |
went to sea in command of the battle- \
Ehip Illinois. Bradford was succeeded
by Captain Albert George Converse.
On October 31, 1303. Chief Constructor .

"Is this necessarily Â¦ always the

pleasantly on the public ear. Certain classes of employes
on the water front have been warned that intoxication
during office hours wilt not be tolerated. It is extremely
unfortunate that a State commission should be forced to
such a measure and worse that it should be compelled to
let taxpayers know of its predicament. "Drunk and dis

While at an open-air bazaar and fete
In the Estrella Gardens recently, the
Queen Dowager of Portugal lost a gold
bracelet set with diamonds, which she
greatly prized as the gift of the late
King Luiz on their wedding day. A
close search of the grounds for the
missing ornament met with no success.
On going home In the evening one of
the oldest of the keepers was relating
the incident to his wife when their lit
tle 7-year-old granddaughter slipped
out cf bed and. to their astonishment,
held out the lost bracelet, asking them
to look at the pretty round thing she
had found in the gardens.
Next day the keeper hastened to the
palace with the ornament, and on an
nouncing his errand was admitted di
rectly to the Queen, who offered him a
Â£10 note as a reward. The old man,
however, proudly declined to accept it,
saying he had only done his duty.
"But," he added, "my- wife and I are
old. and will soon die. If her Majesty
wishes to do something for me let her
protect my little granddaughter, the
finder of the bracelet, who will be left
alone."
The Queen smilingly granted this
humble request, and promised to inter
est herself in the future of the child,
who is forthwith to be sent to a good

WHILE the Democratic leaders have been as
prompt as ever to begin a campaign by claim
ing everything in sight, they have not ven
tured this year, as in times past, to name the States in
which they expect to be successful. They put down the
solid South, of course, as being certain for them, then
they claim New York, but that is about as far as they
go in the way of specification. For the rest, they are
about as willing to claim Massachusetts and Iowa as
anything else.
It seems indeed as if there were hardly any doubtful
States this *year, unless New York and New Jersey be
so counted by reason of the fact that both candidates
are from the Empire. State. There was a time when
Democracy had a fighting chance in Ohio> Illinois and
Indiana, but that time has gone by. Indiana has not
gone Democratic since 1892. Four years ago it gave
McKinley a plurality of over 26,000, while two years
ago it gave, in a State election, a Republican plurality
of over 35.000. The record of Illinois is even more dis
couraging to Democratic calculations than that of
Indiana, for during the past ten years the average Re
publican majority in that State has been upward of 80,
000, and two years ago it was nearly 90,000.
Since the decline of Populism Kansas has returned
to her old allegiance to the party of protection and sound
money. Wisconsin, despite the faction fight in the Re
publican ranks, can hardly be counted as doubtful in
the Presidential campaign. California is sure for Roose
velt, and the same may be said of all the Pacific Coast
States. Under the circumstances, therefore, the claim
of victory put forth by the Democratic leaders to en
courage the rank and file of the, demoralized party can
hardly be regarded as anything more than what is known
on the streets as "hot air." It will serve, perhaps, to take
the chill off the party, but that is all.

Not Grateful.
THE first results of the inquiry now being carried
on by the British Tariff Commission has been
made public in a report on the condition of the
steel and iron industries of the kingdom. The evidence
submitted is sufficient to justify, in that trade at least,
all that Mr. Chamberlain has ever said of the folly of
continuing a free trade policy in the face of the intense
industrial competition of our time.
It appears that the industry employs upward of 265,
000 persons, and the commission examined. representa
tives of plants at which some 235,000 of them are en
gaged. The report, therefore, cannot be objected to
on the score of a lack of comprehensiveness. It has
covered well nigh the whole field of the industry, and the
witnesses were drawn both from the employed and the
employing class. The report shows that many works
have, v.ithin the last ten years, closed down utterly
and many more are running on reduced time, so that
while in protective tariff countries, like the United
States and Germany, the iron and steel output has been
steadily increasing, it has been diminishing in Great
Britain.
The strictly economic results of free trade, as shown
in the report, are too well known to be worth elaborate
review at this time, but there is a comparatively new
point brought out by the inquiry that is worth noting.
It was asserted by many of the witnesses, examined that
the practice of running on short time not only reduced
the earnings of workingmen, but had an injurious phys
ical effect and diminished their value as workers. The
fact was stated repeatedly in the testimony given before
the commissioners and occupies a prominent place in
the report.
According to a review given in the London Mail of
the report, one witness said:
"I think there is not the slightest doubt that our labor
would be very much more efficient If it were regularly
employed. The men get into a slack sort of way through
irregular employment, which has a very serious effect
on the efficiency of their laboV." And another said:
"I think that in consequence of the intermittent char
acter of employment our workmen are noticeably de
teriorating in physical condition. The effect of short
time is to induce loafing, a condition which they cannot
easily get out of again. They are much better workmen
when they work full time than half time." Yet a third
says: "I consider that the physical condition of our
workmen is deteriorating because we do not keep them
fully employed. A man working three days a week is
not as good as a man working six."
Facts of that kind stated by men who know and who
are first-class authorities on the subject are not to be
offset by the theories of academic free traders, and the
report of 'the commission is certain to immensely
strengthen the position of Chamberlain. The statements
are worth noting in this country, too, for while it is not
likely the Democrats will undertake a straightout free
trade fight, it is just as well to keep in power the friends
of protection, so that there will be no free trade tinker
ing with the tariff.
LABOR* AND t?REE TRADE.
Modern naval warfare is one of the
most costly things that can be imag
ined and a combat between two fleets
means the expenditure of vast sums of
money. Some idea of the high cost
can be arrived at by taking a Japanese
warship like the Kasuga or Nysshin
and calculating the number of shots
she would discharge, say, at Port Ar
thur. The first named ship carries
four cannon which cost $30,000 each.
One of these guns can fire two shots
per minute and every shot. costs $400;
thus In flve minutes these four cannon
can discharge forty bombs at a cost
of $16,000. The smaller cannon cost
each $18,000 and every shot they fire
means an expenditure of $70. They are
very rapid and it Is estimated that in
five minutes the twelve cannon could
discharge shot to the value of nearly
$35.000.â Leslie's Weekly.
What It Costs.
This evidence alone was almost suf
ficient 10 convict Beck, but seemingly
more convincing proof was forthcom
ing. Several v/omen entered the wit
pen bcx and solemnly swore that Beck
v.as the man who had robbed ar.d de
frauded them. Against such over
whelming evidence hla protests of in
nocence availed nothing. The jury
found him guilty and he was sentenced
to seven years' penal servitude.
After serving his sentence and re
ceiving the usual commutation for good
behavior he sought diligently to discov
er the man for whose crimes he had
suffered such cruel punishment. But
though he shifted his address contin
ually and haunted the places where he
thought he would be most likely to run
across the villain who looked like him
he did not find him.
While still engaged on his self-ap
pointed task which he hoped would es
tablish his Innocence before the world
the crudest blow of all befell him. He
â¢was again arrested early in the spring
on charges similar to those for which
he had undergone a long term of Im
prisonment. As before, he protested his
innocence; but a^ain women appeared
who swore that he was the man who
had robbed and deceived them, and as
before a Jury found him guilty.
But * his words to the Judge when
asked if he had anything to say why
sentence should not be passed upon
him must have Impressed that official,
for sentence was deferred until July 25.
"I have no recollection of what I
said,- Beck subsequently declared. "I
felt that words from heaven were put
into my mouth and they saved me."
An investigation was begun. George
R. Sims, the well known author, play
wright and Journalist, and some other
influential people who had become con
vinced that Beck was the victim or a
Mistaken identity is a favorite device
of the novelist for creating trouble for
his hero, but he would be regarded as
a daring author who should twice make
the Fame man the victim in a court of
justice of his "double." Yet this is pre
cisely what happened to Adolph Beck.
And what makes the case still stranger
than the examples abounding in fiction
f? the fact that the real criminal,
Thomas Smith, bears only a general
resemblance to the man who has suf
fered for his misdeeds. Seen together
they are easily distinguished. Smith
has a. scar on hi? chin and a mole over
one eye. while Beck has no such marks.
Despite Beck's awful experience â
herded as he was among vile criminals
and regarded with scorn and loathing
by his former associates when he had
regained his freedom â they have not
embittered him, though they have
turned hi? hair nearly white. Faith in
divine justice never failed him. After
his second arrest and conviction, he
cays, "I prayed day and night that the
great wrong which I was undergoing
would be redressed. 'Surely,' I said to
myself, 'God will not allow a further
injustice to be done me after all that I
have gone through.* And so I went on
hoping and trusting that in the end all
would be well.
. "I x\as never downcast. When I was
in my cell I sometimes heard music
played on barrel organs outside, and
so cheery did I feel that I was occa
sionally inclined to dance. But it v.o.?
this that impressed me more than any
thing else with the belief that I should
t-e released. Three weeks before the
I>olice arrested rrsy double on the
charge brought against me, while I
v as lying asleep, dreaming in my cell,
I heard a voice say: 'You will be
saved! You will be saved!' From that
moment I never despaired. I knew it
vas only a matter of time when all
v. ould come out right."'
The circumstances which led to tho
confounding cf the innocent with the
fcuilty date back twenty-seven years,
although Beck knew nothing of them
at the time. In 1877 a man calling him
self Thomas Smith was sentenced to
five years' penal servitude for fraudu
lently obtaining jewelry and money
from young women whose affections he
had won while posing as a lord. In
UN Beck was arrested on a similar
charge and it was then alleged that he
vas the tame who as Thomas Smith
had been convicted in 1S77. Beck stout
ly protested his innocence, indignantly
denied that there had been any pre
vious conviction against him, end de
clared that he was in Peru in 1877. The
handwriting of the man who commit
ted the 1S77 frauds was compared with
notes written by the author of the
crimes with v.hich Beck was charged,
and the writing was found to be iden-

'A Victim of Justice.
This vessel has had several interest
ing experiences. One day last April,
when the Haimun was within twelve
miles of Port Arthur and eighty-five
miles from Weihaiwei, on the lookout
for war news, she was held up by a
shot across her bows from the Russian
warship Bayan. Xot knowing what
might^happen, Captain James, the cor
respondent of the London Times on the
Haimun, sent a wireless dispatch to
Weihaiwei, notifying that station that
they were about to be boarded by offi
cers of the Russian battleship Bayan.
"If you do not hear from us in three
hours," said the message, "notify com
missioner, captain of British gunboat
Leviathan and London Times." There
was some natural anxiety to know if
the message had been received, . but
presently all anxiety was relieved by
the welcome signal "O. K." from the
Weihaiwei operator. In a short time a
reply came stating that the commis
sioner and the commander of the Brit
ish fleet at Weihaiwei had been prop
erly notified and that from the window
of the operating-room it could be seen
that the fleet was getting up steam â
"and that," added the operator, "is no
dream." Two Russian officers boarded
the Haimun, inspected the wireless ap
paratus and took a copy of the last
message sent. In the midst of their In
spection the officers were hurriedly re
called to the Bayan by apparently ex
cited signals from that ship, which im
mediately returned to Port Arthur. It
was surmised by those on the Haimun,
as an explanation of their hasty re
turn, that the Russians had detected
Japanese wireless signals. On the other
hand. It is quite possible that the Ba
yan's wireless operator may also have
received the mes*ages sent from the
Haimun and from Weihaiwei relative
to the boarding of the Haimun, and
this, for prudential reasons, may have
occasioned the hasty recall of the
boarding officers. On this point it may
be noted that while the ether itself
transmits all forms of electric waves
Impartially, it is quite within the prob
abilities that some characteristic in the
method of transmission, or some pe
culiarity of code used by one vessel or
fleet, might after a little experience be
quickly recognized by other fleets and
In this way the presence of friend or
enemy could be recognized without a
regular message.â From "Wireless Tel
egraphy of To-Day." by William Ma
ver Jr., In the American Monthly Re
view of Reviews for August.
According- to the advices from the
operators of the De Forest wireless
system in Chinese and Japanese wa
ters, there is an unending train of
wireless signals going on day and
night in that vicinity. The signals of
the Russians and the Japanese, and
especially the latter, can be heard at
all hours, these nations, in common
with all others, using in telegraphy 11
modification of the Morse telegraph
alphabet. The telegraph alphabet
used by the Russians contains thirty
character?; that of the Japanese is
said to contain forty characters, while
the American Morse contains but
twenty-six characters. But, apart
frcm the difference in the alphabets,
the belligerents use cipher codes,
v.hich render theif communicat'ons
unintelligible to otusiders, even if they
were otherwise readable.
The De Forest wireless station in
North China from which the wireless
war news is cabled to Europe is sit
uated on a cliff somewhat east of Wei
haiwei. The height of the vertical
wire used is about 150 feet, which is
also the height of the station above
sea level. The Chinese steamship Hai
imin, which was chartered by the Lon
don Times for newsgathering by wire
less telegraphy, has a vertical wire
about ninety-six feet high. The trans
mitting and receiving apparatus em
ployed at Weihaiwei and on the Hai
mun are practically identical and. the
orerating: rooms virtually correspond
to those of the Panama and Port
Limon stations. Messages were freely
sent to and from the boat at distances
ranging from ten to one hundred and
fifty miles. The signals could be
heard at greater distances from the
boat to the shore than contrawise, the
rolling of the boat at times interfer
ing with the reception of signals. At
the time of Russia's announcement
that correspondents employing wire
less telegraphy in the war zone would
be treated as spies, the Haimun was
on the Korean coast and those on
board were promptly informed of the
interesting situation by wireless teleg
raphy.
Wireless in the War.
A rational view of the situation seems to be that the
wheat conditions have become completely reversed dur
ing the past three weeks, both in America and Europe,
and that owing to the impairment of the crop in both
countries Europe will have to draw on the United States
after all. The loss in weight will be largely offset by
the higher price, so the net result of the year will be
fair, though many individual wheat growers will suffer.
Regarded calmly, the situation does not appear very
serious, as the excellent outlook for corn and cotton
is a powerful counterbalance. This is the light in which
Wall street looks at it, so the stock market, while it
wavered and hesitated under the pessimistic crop re
ports, still retained the buoyant undertone which it has
exhibited for some weeks past.
The labor strikes continue to exercise a deterrent
influence on general business. East and West. Chicago
is the center of the disturbance and reports business in
a vague and floating condition, with certain disagree
able features, one of which is that money is accumulating
in the local banks and depressing interest rates. The
Western packers are great borrowers, not only in Chi
cago but in other money centers, carrying permanent
loan accounts of something like $100,000,000, of which
about $40,000,000 is carried by the Chicago banks. Now,
the strike., by checking the operations of the packers,
has led them out of the market as borrowers, and they
are taking up their notes at the rate of about $4,000,000
per week, the total since the beginning of the strike
being about $10,000,000. In other words, instead of pay
ing out all this money in supplies and wages, the pack
ers are turning it into the banks in exchange for their
maturing notes. The , loss to circulation and general
trade must therefore be very serious, and illustrates
one oi the forms of mischief caused by a great labor
strike.
In spite of these two adverse influences, however â
the damage to the wheat crop and the strikes â commer
cial reports from most sections of the country con
tinue cheerful and indicate the approach of a very fair
fall trade. The best reports at present are from the
South and Southwest, where collections are good and
the distribution of merchandise excellent. Good returns
are ,also being received from the Pacific Coast. It is
curious 1 to note that the very cities in which, under the
deterrent crop and labor conditions, one would naturally
look for poor returns are sending in larger bank clear
ings than last year, the gain at Chicago during the past
week being 1.5 per cent, at Minneapolis .4 per cei\t and
at St. Paul 5.4 per cent. Now, Chicago is supposed to
be bearing a double burden, being the center of both the
wheat stfare and the packers' strike, and still it shows
a gain over last year. All the Atlantic seaboard cities
show a loss, and the aggregated clearings of the coun
try are down again to about $1,800,000,000, against a
normal aggregate of $2,000,000,000. The failures for the
week were 230, against 178 for the corresponding week
last year.
Reports from the staples show some improvement in
business.. Delayed orders, for iron and steel are being
placed, but new business is not-heavy. The woolen mills
ieport increasing activity and the raw wool continues
very firm. Tanners are actively looking for hides, as
the packers' strike has diminished the supply. Sugar
is in active demand and prices have advanced. The for
eign commerce of the port of New York shows' a de
crease last week of $1,047,000 in exports and $3,230,000
in imports, compared with the same week in 1903.
Locally, we are running along about as Jaefore. Some
lines are reported quiet and others active. The net
result is satisfactory. Prices for everything we produce
range from fair to excellent, there is hardly any product
of the field or factory that is not yielding a remunera
tive profit, money is plentiful and collections are nor
mal, hence California has no complaints to make as
iar as business is concerned.
"rust.''.
As the reports multiplied and the scare increased
large operators chartered special trains with automobile
attachments and went out into the wheat fields of the
Northwest to see for themselves. All sent back gloomy
reports. One from a good authority in South Dakota
said that the trade would be stunned if it could be
brought to realize the damage wrought by rust. An
other said that the berry was small and shriveled and
there was not much even of this. Another said that
thousands of acres, promising a few days ago, would
not be cut. Europe came along about this time with
a reported large deficiency, chiefly in Russia and the
Danubian provinces, France cut down her estimates to
55,000,000 bushels less than last year, and so on. Chi
cago is a nervous market at best, and these grisly crop
reports simply drove the Board of Trade into an old
fashioned attack' of hysterics.
But there were some who did not scare very badly.
Snow, the statistician, whose word goes a long way in
the grain trade, said the damage was overstated. Wall
street declined to take much stock in the sensational
reports and remarked that this was the time of the year
for crop scares. Even Jones of the Commercial West,
another recognized authority, issued a statement modi
fying his previous gloomy reports of rust. Still, even
the most sanguine admitted pronounced injury to the
crop, though they saw in a crop of 550,000,000 bushels
a small surplus available for export.
TRADE conditions last week were practically the
same as for the preceding two or three weeks. Crop
prospects and labor disturbances were still the gov
erning factors. Both being unsettled, business was
therefore also unsettled.
The crop conditions may be summed up in a â¢ few
words. The wheat outlook is by no means as bright
as three weeks ago, but the condition of corn is excel
lent and that of cotton brilliant The latest estimate
of the cotton crop is 12,500,000 bales, which is much
higher than the estimate of a month ago; that of corn
2,500,000,000 bushels and that of wheat anywhere from
525.000,000 to 575,000,000 bushels, even the most san
guine estimate hardly venturing to forecast as high as
000,000,000 bushels whereas six weeks ago 625,000,000
bushels was considered a safe calculation.
While the disposition always is to magnify any dis
aster to a crop, it is undeniable that the wheat crop
1ip."5 suffered much deterioration during the past few
days from rust. The realization of this caused a sensa
tional flurry on the Chicago Board of 'J^rade, where
quotations for wheat advanced with violent daily fluc
tuations and a large volume of trading. Toward the
clo?e of the week a rumor that Armour was actively
tying up the September option enhanced the excite
ment and sent the shorts scurrying for cover, which
added fuel to the flames. All sorts of scare reports were
received from the spring wheat States, chiefly the two
Dakotas, though Minnesota and Northern Iowa' were
fair seconds. Rust seemed to be in the air. All crop
reports from these States contained the ominous word

made to appreciate the importance of
this line by the great demand for low

in abundance in Southwestern Colo

road company to build its new line
through the northern part .of New
Mexico. The Arizona and New Mex
ico branch of the Southern Pacific
now extends as far as Clifton, from
which point the Southern Pacific can
build through almost the entire length
of New Mexico, a distance of several
hundred miles, and give the coal
mines of Southern Colorado an outlet
by way of El Paso, Galveston and
New Orleans. At the same time the
road will give large sections of New
Mexico and Arizona an opportunity to
secure fuel for the operation of their
mining regions.
Among the many matters taken up
by Julius Kruttschnitt, director of
maintenance and operations of the
Harriman lines, and General Manager

RELIEF COMMITTEE
ELECTS NEW OFFICERS
The meeting of the Association - or
Pioneer We men of California, which
tfas held en Friday afternoon in Gold
en Gate Hall, was one of unusual in
terest. A motion to admit proxies at the
October election of officers was defeat
ed by a large vote. The topic of spe
cial interest was the -preparation set on
foot for holding a reception on the
fourth aniversary of the organization,
August 27, at 2 o'clock, in Golden Gate
Hall. A general invitation is extended
The school is in working order now,
with Miss Ray Alexander in charge of
the class, under the supervision of
Principal Richard K. Faulkner.
The work of the school will necessa
rily be slow, but with proper handling
it cannot but prove of infinite value,
pven as it has in Chicago, New York,
Bostcn, Philadelphia and other pro
gressive cities.
The club women will keep In close
tntich with the school, lending their
aid wherever possibleâ which, by the
way, Mr. Faulkner seeks.
The truant officers went a-touring in
the canneries last week, strongly sus
pecting that many of their wards were
peeling peaches. And they were not
disappointed. About 150 were rounded
up, all under the age of 14 years â the
age limit prescribed by the compulsory
education law â and they were promptly
relieved from further duty.
Scores of boys and girls slightly over
14 years were found who should have
been in school, but these were exempt
ed on the presentation of a card de
claring them over the age limit and
signed by the principal of a night
school of which they were members â
more or less regularly.
The greatest difficulty Is found by the
school officers In the Latin quarter.
Here a large percentage of parents
speak no English, and it is a difficult
task to make them understand that the
law haa a right to interfere in their
family arrangements, although the
Board of Education has caused to be
published cards bearing upon the law
in Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. It
is among these people that education is
valued the least and where the least
effort "is made to obtain it. And, withal,
their ignorance, while indefensible. Is
absolute bliss and the family relation
one of joy. However, it is a spot where
in vice thrives on its ignorance, and
the. spot that the school authorities
must delve into with vigor.
The schools most affected by the
"cannery" habit â the proceeds of which
are considered "pick-up" money and i3
used to purchase the grapes that will
ferment into the family wine for the
yearâ are Lafayette, Garfleld, Irving,
Hancock. Cooper and Washington.
There is some trouble for the truant
officers on the south side, but most of
that is deliberate truancyâ hence the
formation of the Parental School.
Here it is hoped, by a special kind of
training (based on a knowledge of each
boy's personality and environment),
that good results will ensue.
Surely, our city, with its vaunted
half-million (by Los Angeles notation),
can provide for its deficients and de
pendents If the matter be brought for
ward vigorously. And this is a matter
that concerns the city intimately.
In the early sessions of the civic sec
tion of the California ~Oub a matter
that will appeal to every woman in the
city will 'be brought Op for considera
tion â the compulsory removal from the
streets of the horrible incurables that
wander about through the residence
and downtown districts, frightening
children and shocking delicate women,
many of whom are made ill from the
cripples' Importunities.
The section will investigate the ca
pacities of homes for these poor unfor
tunates, for whom every human crea
ture bears the deepest sympathy, and
endeavor to place them where they
may pass their days in comfort without
leaving their hideous image upon un
born babes. And that such calamities
have resulted from unwelcome visits
from these people there is ample proof,
many physicians of the highest repute
standing ready to furnish data as to
the effect of horrible prenatal impres
sions.
In this manner will unity result â
and in no other. And only in unity,
ladies, is there success. Besides, there's
the benefit that accrues to the individ
ual in this mental discipline, which, to
my way of thinking, transcends any
other benefit women get out of clubs.
And. heaven knows, we need i* â most
of us. That such is the case, however,
is no fault of ours, since it is only
within a quarter century that women
were permitted to have opinions on
any other topics than dress, domestics
and diseases. What I most marvel at
is that we're not sillier than we are!
There's the California Club, with its
clubhouse proposition to settle. To be
sure, it was settled once, but it didn't
stay settled. Among the really humor
oub situations of the affair are the
questions now propounded in all seri
ousness'by their authors â who appar
ently don't know a joke when they see
one. '"Do you reaiiy want a club
house?" (question No. 1); "If so, what
do you wish it to cost?" (query No. 2).
Now, these unconscious humorists are
furnishing much amusement â at least
to that part of the community which
insists that women don't know what
they do want and when they do hap
pen to find out, they forthwith pro
ceed to want something else.
Now, Question No. 1 was answered
years ago and has long since become
an "article of "faith" with the club.
Why dig it up and question its sanity
at this late day?
Then the question of cost â that, too,
was decided last May and supposedly
for good. Alas! alas! Why will some
women vote for a measure with ap
parent deliberation and then a week
later hop up like kindergartens and
cry out, "O, madam president, I really
didn't mean that. I didn't know what
we were voting for, you know."
Now, silly as this sounds, we all
know that it's the unvarnished truth
and is met with in clubdom every day.
And this very fact is the strongest ar
gument I know in support of the state
ment that women are not yet ready for
the ballot â not yet.
Therefore, when the clubs convene
for the winter's work, let every mem
ber determine to bring her wits with
her into the business sessions of her
club and use them as a rational being
while thereâ shutting out, to the best
of her ability, prejudice. Intolerance
and petty personal views and holding
but ene thought in mindâ "Is this
proposition the best for the club?"
Xext month win see a gathsrins of |
the clubs â of clubwomen. Already the.'
"hello" maiden is beginning to work
overtime in the clubwoman's districts
and vc-lubie and Various are* the tete
a-tetes over the wires. What club
woman could survive the long summer
vacation without the littie brown box
in the hallway? However, September
brings together the 3000 ciubu'omen of
San Francisco â and then things '11 be
oirv to hum.
The annual business meeting of the
San Francisco Teachers' Club will b=
held to-nisht at S o'clock, in room 255
of the City Hall. It is expected that a
large number of members will be in at
tendance. A conference on the "Mate
rial Needs of San Francisco Schools"
will be held, at which President Ronco
vieri of the Board of Education will as
sist. The various reports of the club
will be presented and the officers for
the coming year installed. x
Every effort is being made to in
crease the membership of the club and
on Monday night fifteen names will be
presented. The dues have been re
duced. There is no initiation fee and
?Il members of the department are
urged to join. Besides various Iecture3
and social affairs, the club contem
plates the following four special lines
cf activity for the ensuing term: "Edu
cation," leader Dr. MÂ« E. Blanchard;
"Conference," leader Mrs. M. I*
O'Xeal; "Physiography," leader W. A.
Leggett; -Literature," leader John
Darwin Gish.
to all members and friends who are in
terested in the welfare of this popular
society. No formal or printed invita
tions wiil be issued. The membership
continues to grow, four new names
having been added to the roll at the
last meeting.

ed" Cook's tour, with the charming

CiuÂ«e of Pearl Enlow.
Edlter ThÂ«. Call: Under the . heaiJtns
"Christian Science Fails to Save Life," a Sis
patch frosi - Stockton was published in your
issue of the 5th last, concerning the death of
Pearl EjJqw at Lodi as a result of sever*
burns caused by her dolhlns taking lire from
an overturned lairo.
As the above beading is mislead!-? 1 would
aÂ«k you kindly to publish the facts in this
caie, which are as follows: Immediately after
the accident the father of the child called a
Christian Science practitioner. Miss. Enlow
suffered a arreat deal until the arrival of th-s
practitioner, after which she became very
easy and experienced very little pain. After
the practitioner arrived Mr. Enlow sent for "a
doctor, and when he came he took complete
charge of the case. . ilorphlne was adminis
tered ard the child went Into a Mupor. remain
ing In that condition until she passed on about
twelve hours later. Miss Enlow was under
Christian Science treatment about an hour,
after which Â«he was uisder the doctor's car-s
entirely. In view of the** facts It win be seen;
that Christian Science had very little,oppor
tunity to effect a cure. Sincerely yours,-
Lorenzo Munyon, a stable owner of

driving in the park panhandle by Po

razor-like blade, was found upon him.
A second charge of carrying a con
cealed weapon was lodged against
him. - '
At the Emergency Hospital a boy

Alls that corse from coffee are cumu-
lative; That is. unless the coffee is taken
av.aj- new troubles are continually ap-
pearing and the old ones get worse.
"To begin with," says a Kansan, "I
â¢n-as a slave to coffee, just as thousands
cf others to-<Iay; thought I could not
l:ve vritbout drinking strong coffee
. every mornins for breakfast, and I had
Â£ick headaches that kept me in bed sev-
eral days every month. Could hardly
; keep my food on my stomach, but
would vomit as long as I could throw
anything up, and when I could get hot
coffee to stay on my stomach I thought
I was better.
'â¢Well, two years ago this spring I
was that sick with rheumatism I could
ziot U3e my right arm to do anything,
had heart was nervous. My
serves r.-ere all unstrung and my
finger nails and tips were blue as if I
*hz.cl a chill a.11 the time and rn>* face and
hands yellow as a pumpkin. My doctor
said it was heart disease and rhpuma- ,
tisra and my neighbors said XI had
. Bright's Disease and was going to die.
"Well, I did net know what on earth
was the matter and every morning
would drag myself out of bed and so to I
breakfast, not to eat anything, but to !
force down some more coffee. Then in \
a little while I wou!d be so nervous, my
.heart would beat like everything.
â¢â¢Finally* on? morning I told my hus-
band I believed coffee was the cause of
this trouble and that I thought I would
try Postum, which I had seen adver-
" tised. He 5aJd *AH right.' so we got
Postuin. and although I did not like it
at first I got right down to business
lind niade it according to directions:
then it was fine, and the whole family
sot to using it, and I tell you It has j
' worked woutfers for me. Thanks to
Postum In place of the poison, coffee, I
cow enjoy good health, have not been
* !e bed with tick headache for two
years, although I had it for SO years
. before I began Postum. and my nerves
crc now strong and I have no trouble
Â¦ from my heart or from the rheumatism.
"I consider Postum a necessary arti-
cle of food on my table. My friends
who come here and taste my Postum
fay It is delicious." Name given by

ing what kind of property you prefer in ex-
change, and you will be surprised how quickly

interest.' and, likewise, all bonds redeemed by
lot shall cease to bear interest as in this
act provided, and the said state treasurer shall

Scythes as Cherub Ornaments.
At first sight the scythe is a strange
ornament for a church, but there is
nothing incongruous in these ' curious
agricultural implements as seen in the
parish church of St. Mary's, at Horn
castle, in Lincolnshire. Thirteen of
these blades are nailed above the door
in the north chapel. At one time the
blades numbered forty or fifty,' but
owing to rust and decay many of them
have been lost. Each of the scythes is
about a yard in length.
The general belief is that these
blades were ulaced in the church in
commemoration of the zeal of peas
ants who wielded them in defense of
their faith in the rebellion known as
"The Pilgrimage of Grace," which had
its rise at Louth in 1536. When peo
ple saw the ruins of their churches
and abbeys they rose in revolt, and,
arming themselves with the instru
ments of husbandry, such as the
scythes, they went forth to encounter
the enemy. They were beaten and dis
persed, but in the eyes of their coun
trymen they were heroes, and the rude
implements with which -they fought
were deemed worthy of. an abiding
place in the old church, .Jivhere the
peasants had worshiped. â Christian

They have a band, made up among
themselves, and a cockpit and danc
ing for recreation and amusement. To
handle the native laborer successfully
high-grade white foremen are essen
tial. The average native is mentally a
child, and must be taught how to
Â¦work.
A cockpit and a church are the espe
cial attractions offered to the laborers
on the big Government breakwater
contract at Manila, says an exchange.
A million "long tons" of rock were
to be moved from a quarry thirty
miles away and dumped in the harbor,
â¢where a safer harbor is being de
veloped.
In the early stages of this work
the contractors used American white
labor, but this gave place to the negro
(American), Chinese and Japanese,
until finally native labor was drilled,
and it has proved satisfactory.
At its quarry- at Sisiman the con
tracting company has erected a village
of nipa houses, in which over 1000
natives live. They do all the work of
drilling and handling rock, except that
of derrick engineers, blacksmiths, etc.
The natives are well housed and fed,
they have their church and school
house, a native doctor to look after
their physical wants, and a native
padre to minister the offices of their
church. I Â¦.** r .

Charles WatÂ«en. an elderly Chinaman who
resides at 720 Washington street, was badly
bitten on the ear and cheek yesterday by a dog
which he was playlns with. Watson v who is
about 03 years old, came to the State In thÂ«
early fifties. He has been an expressman on
the water front for many years and Is a fa
milliar figure there. He was plying his.voca
tion yesterday on Jackson-street wharf .when
the accident took place. His son was with
him tit the time and took him to the Harbor
Kmergency Hospital, where his wounds were
dres-seti. Watson married a white woman
many years ago, and a result of tha union was
a son, now 1ft years old, who entirely adopts
American customs and manner and mode of
dress.

The British ship Glenburn, ' Captain John

decks calked. She sailed from that port on
May _fl. making a good run to this port.

The news that pigeons are being used
to convey news of the raisins of the
ill fated submarine reminds one that
these useful birds are part of the per
sonnel of our navy. There are Gov
ernment lofts at Portsmouth, Dart
mouth and elsewhere, and the birds
are numbered and registered in ex
actly the same manner as our blue
jackets themselves. In the Ports
mouth lofts, which are in the Royal
Clarence victualing yards at Gosport,
and from which the birds how doing
such useful work are drawn, is an of
fice where the offlcl?l log books are
kept with the utmost detail and pre
cision. There are rtud registers and
report books in vrtiich the doings -of
every pigeon are chronicled; one vol
ume is devoted to pigeons homing at
the loft and in another volume the va
rious messages carried by the birds
are pasted. Among these it is inter
esting to notice many that have been
sent to the lofts by members of our
royal family when crossing the chan
nel. The moment a bird enters the
loft it is automatically shut into a box
by the dropping of a noiseless slide
and an electric bell summons an at
tendance to take, the message It has
brought. â Westminster Gazette.

Report was also brought by the ves
sel that the Japanese foreman of the
cannery at Karluk had been killed, but
who committed the murder was not
known. It wai reported that it was
one of his own countrymen employed
in the caner'y.
The American ship Star of Russia
sailed in through the Golden Gate early
yesterday morning. She is the first of
the Alaskan salmon fleet to return
from the north. Captain Lindberg
confirms the report that so far the
catch is HshtMn Alaskan waters. He
says that fish were scarce at Karluk,
but that the run was unusually heavy
at Chigrnlk. In fact, when he left the
north the cannery people were com
mencing to ship fresh salmon from
Chignik to Karluk to be canned tfiere.
The Star of Russia made a quick trip
of twelve days from Karluk. She only
brought 31,378 cases of salmon, where
as her capacity is 55,000 cases. She is
consigned to the Alaska Packers' As
sociation. As soon as she has landed
her cargo she will return .north for an
other load.

PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 7. â Willard
Hess, known In the theatrical profes
sion as Max Arnold, died here to-day
In a sanitarium after an illness of sev
eral months.
Hess was born In Boston forty-three
years ago. . He began his stage career
In San Francisco, but later came East
as a partner of Daniel Sully. He first
appeared in the old varieties as a song
and dance man. He was at 'various
times associated with Ilarrigan and
Hart and Tony Pastor and subsequent
ly made his appearance in comio
opera. About seventeen years ago his
eyesight began to fail and eventually
he became totally blind. Despite his
affliction he was popular as an enter
tainer.
He was an honorary life member of
the Detroit Lodge of Elks.

J. Pierpont Morgan's only son, who
Is named after him, worked for several
years as a clerk in the different, de
partments of a great Morgan banking
house before he was taken into his
father's office to learn the elements of
higher finance. He is a serious and
hard working business man and is now
the practical head of the London
house.
George Gould is looked upon as one
of the best business men in America.
He was given absolute control of the
Gould fortune upon his father's death
and he has doubled it. He is in every
sense a man of affairs and he takes no
more time for loafing than his father
did. Howard Gould is, like his elder
brother, a serious business man not
given to frivolity.
Peter Cooper Hewitt inherited a for
tune from his father, Abram S. Hewitt,
but he has devoted himself to the
study of electrical science with mag
nificent results. His Cooper Hewitt
mercury vapor lamp is not only a
practical but a commercial success. He
is devoting himself now to the prob
lems of electrical power transmission
and to wireless telegraphy.
John D. Rockefeller Jr., Harry Payne
Whitney, John D. Spreckels, Clarence
Mackay, George Crocker, John R.
Drexel and James H. Hyde are cited as
other illustrations of- the way the sons
of very rich Americans are fully meet
ing the responsibilities placed upon
them. Each in his particular sphere
has demonstrated that he is fully cap
able v of holding his own place In the
lists of "captains of Industry.
Such men are good citizens. Their
careers put to shame the many feather
brained and pinheaded sons of noveau
riche fathers who seem to think that
idleness and frivolity are synonymous
with gentility.â Atlanta Constitution.
Cornelius Vanderbilt insisted upon
learning the trade of locomotive build
ing by working in the shops of the
Vanderbilt railroads.. He has invented
a firebox which is said to have prac
tically revolutionized the freight loco
motive and now this is being used on
a number of the principal railroads of
the country. .
John Jacob Astor. for instance,'
spends most of his spare time in study
ing and experimenting in electrical
science. With a fortune approximating
$100,000,000 he finds no time for Idle
ness. He has developed a system of
marine turbines which old engineers
say are destined to be of great practi
cal value; and, while he has taken out
patents on theee inventions, he has de
clared that all the benefits of his dis
covery are to be freely given to tha
world.

presumed to be the trade mark of the

The total distance from St. Peters
burg to Port Arthur by the Russian
Trans-Siberian Railway and the Rus
sian lines in Manchuria is 5913 miles, or
practically twice the distance from New
Tork to San Francisco. This is one of
the numerous interesting facts about
Russia and her railway and commer
cial systems presented in a monograph
Just issued by the Department of Com
merce and Labor, says Harper's "Week
ly. Regarding the railway the report
says:
The Russo-Turkish war of 1878-9
caused an almost entire suspension of
railway building. It was only during
the decade beginning with 1880 that ac
tivity in this field was again resumed,
but the character and method of con
struction of the newly built roads
changed abruptly. In place of the
former trunk lines, connecting either
the black soil area with the seaboards
of the Baltic, Azov and Black seas, or
with the central industrial region!
around Moscow, these years witnessed i
the construction of great strategic rail- !
roads, such as the Trans-Caspian, the
Polessie system, besides roads primar
ily destined for the service of relatively
small though important industrial re
gions â Catherine line, Ivangorod-Dom
brovo. Moreover, the system of grant
ing franchises (concessions) was super
seded by the building and working of
roads directly by and on account of the
state. At the same time the redemp
tion by the Government of- great rail
way systems was going on, so that for
some time it seemed as if all private
roads were going to be acquired by the
state. Although of late greater latitude
has been given to private initiative, by
far the greater part of Russian rail
ways is In the hands of the Govern
ment. Out of 36,673 miles under the con
trol of the Ministry of Communica
tion on January 1, 1904. 24,436 are
worked by the state and 12,237 miles
only by private companies.

missing. Oakland bunched. its seven
on Knell and five runs were easy for
them. The score:

The match in which most interest
centered at the park was a doubles, In
which R. N. Whitney and J. F. Brady
were opposed to Fred Adams and E.
P. Finnegan. Whitney and Brady won
three sets out of five, after losing the
first by a 6-1 score.
The scores follow:
The disagreeable weather yesterday
kept many of the tennis cracks away
from the courts, but the lower class
men were much in evidence. The
park players usually turn out strong
ly on Sunday, regardless of the
weather, but they could not stand the
cold, penetrating fog and consequent
ly the attendance was light. The more
sheltered courts-of the California Club
were better patronized and some in
teresting matches were played.
George H. Busch, the Montana State
champion, joined the club on Saturday
and his playing has already made an
excellent impression on the clubmen.
Busch has clever strokes and goes at
it as if he knew the game thoroughly.
On Saturday he won a set from Will
Allen. The local crack won the flrst
two games, but Busch took the next
six easily. Yesterday he figured in a
doubles with lower classmen and his
clever strokes were again in evidence.
An interesting doubles was â¢ played
on the club courts. The contestants
were George Janes and Herbert Long
and Chester Smith and Melville Long.
Smith and Long made a good com
bination and beat Long and Janes
rather easily. The losers were un
steady and made many errors.
Young Long kept up his good work
by winning two sets out of five In a
singles with Janes. Long won the
first two and would have done even
hetter if he hadx not become tired
toward the end. . _
The scores follow:

On account of the sudden death of
Edward Brown, president of the Cali
fornia Cricket Association and of the
Alameda Cricket Club, the match set
for yesterday between the San Fran
cisco County and Alameda elevens was
not played. It will be played on the
flrst open date on the schedule. Mr.
Brown was president of the California
Cricket Association for several years,
and his loss will be severely felt by
cricketers throughout the State. He
had been failing for some time, and
an operation was performed two or
three days ago at a private hospital
in this city. He rallied at first from
the operation, but afterwards sank
and passed away. He was the senior
member of the insurance firm of Ed
ward Brown & Sons.

by defeating Bright Columbia in the
match race. In the first trial Bright
Columbia defeated Secretive pointless
and the talent at once tabbed her to
win. In the three succeeding trial3
Secretive reversed matters and worr
without much trouble. â¢ In the first
two courses Columbia sold favorite,
and then the talent switched.
The class stake was taken handily
by Little Plunger, which defeated Sil
ver Heels In the deciding course. Full

James Sweeney's coursing Futurity
candidate, Rocked Asleep, was the sen
sation in the all-aged stake yesterday
at Union Coursing Park. The promis
ing son of Rocker-Gallant Foe won
all his trials in dashing style until he
met Pomona in the all-important de
ciding course. In this, while beaten,
he was not disgraced, as the score was
6 to 5.
The imported greyhound Gambit
broke a long string of defeats by tak
ing the reserve stake. He met Gold
Chain in the deciding course and shut
him out pointless. Gold Chain was
fortunate in getting three bye courses
out of the five trials in which he ran.
Real Article, at once one of the fast
est and one of the most unlucky of
greyhounds, succumbed to hard run
ning during the afternoon. He had a
trial with Liberator lasting one min
ute 'and forty-four seconds. This was
followed by one of two minutes and
thirty-three seconds with Conroy.
which proved too great ' a strain on
him. Real Article was by imported
Firm Friend-Wildflower and was con
sidered one of the fastest greyhounds
in the country. He was always un
lucky in getting hard trials and in
sustaining injuries. The day's results

a scene of marked activity. A large
number of marksmen were in attend
ance to take part in the contests set
out by the California Schuetzen Club.

When Joe Corbett wandered from his
native heath a few months ago he
never for a moment imagined the base
ball public of San Francisco would
yearn for his return. It was necessary
for him to come home again and star
in their midst. Yesterday was a day
! of triumph for Joe if he ever had such
; a day in his life. When he appeared
| on the slab to toss up the first ball
12,000 loyal fans cheered him. He
proved faithful to his trust by sending
Oakland away runless.
Even though the day was a bad one
for baseball, the fans arrived in flocks
and long before the game was called
the largest attendance of the season
was on hand. It was Corbett who
drew them and It was Corbett whom
they watched from the moment the
ball was in play. If he lost his game
the fans would have forgiven him, but
by winning it he quickly ascended the
: throne of popular fancy and can reign
as a king in the eyes of many for some
time to come.
Corbett twirled a masterly game rt
ballâ far better than even his most ar
dent admirers expected. He started
well and kept up the pace throughout.
Only once did he get into a hole and
then he quickly rallied and struck the
next two batters out. Five hits was
Oakland's share and nine of them hit
naught but wind.
While Corbett pitched the most ex
clusive kind of ball, he did not have it
on Jimmy Buchanan one single bit. In
nings after inning went by and still
Buchanan was there. But disaster de
scended upon him with all its fury in
the eighth round and San Francisco
made three runs on errors and hits
and the great game was lost.
It was unfortunate, as Buchanan de
served a better fate. At that he made
the first bad break himself when Wal
dron opened up the eighth with a bunt.
It was Devereaux's ball, but Buch
anan was overanxious and' he tried to
field it. He fell in the attempt and the
runner was safe.
Hildebrand followed with another
and this time Devereaux threw the
ball away out to the right field fenc?.
Waldron tore over the sacks and*
reached the plate ere the leather was
recovered. Hildebrand got as far as
third and Van Buren's drive over third
base scored him. Van took second
on the play and Irwin brought him
around with a pretty one to left. Dun
lfavy's throw was a trifle wide, other
wise Van would have been out.
That was the beginning and the end
of the day's scoring. Oakland .quit bad
ly then and the rest was easy for Cor
bett. Devereaux roasted Buchanan un
mercifully for taking the fatal bunt
and the crowd came back at Brick.
Every time Buchanan came to bat hi3
lot was one grand volley of cheers. He
had done his best and lost and the
crowd was struck by the game man
ner in which he took his defeat.
Outside of the pitching, the most r?
markable playing of the day was done
by Buck Francks at short. He made
two plays that were marvelous, If
such a thing can be on a ball field.
In the fifth inning Irwin sent a hard
drive between third and short that was
apparently going out to left field.
Francks grabbed it and threw Irwin
out at first by a foot. Anderson dis
patched a liner on its way to left In
the seventh and this time Francks
arose in the air and got it with one
mitt.
Van Buren played left field and re
ceived the only two bases on balls is
sued by Buchanan, besides bringing
Hildebrand in with his timely drive.
Leahy was hit on the ear with a
pitched ball In the second inning and
badly hurt. The Score:

SUMMARY.
RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 7.â Los An
geles never had a chance to win from
Seattle to-day after the first Inning.
Shields held the locals safe at all
stages after the initial round, while
the visitors batted Newton hard.
Loose fielding by Los Angeles helped
to give Seattle an easy victory, the
fourth of the series of six games. The
batting of R. Hall and a remarkable
catch by C. Smith were the features.

-say were inflicted by Thomas McNally,

The trio declare that as they, were

Kentucky streets, the motorman
started the car. When remonstrated
with, they say the motorman started
to beat them with the iron controller.
They also allege that A. Simonds, the
conductor, took part in the row. Mc-
Xally says that the party attacked
him, and he exhibited a damaged eye
to prove this. He was held at the Po

swore to battery charges against his

Misfortunes are crowding thickly
about -Mrs. Maria Burdase. a widow
who supports four young children and
an aged mother. While working at
a washtub at her home yesterday she
slipped on an Improvised stand and
broke her leg. She was taken to the
Central Emergency Hospital, where
the fractured limb was set by Dr.
Pinkham.
Since the death of her husband, a
year ago, Mrs. Burdase has been sup
porting her children and her mother
by taking in washing. She did not
complain of the injury, but expressed
a fear that her little ones would suf
fer while she was forced to lie in the

VERY QUIETLY
"The man who bore the message to
Garcia" yesterday bore his love to the
altar. As the shadows were lengthen
ing Into the evening, Captain A. F.
Rowan and Mrs. Josephine Morris de
Greayer wandered into the little gray
church of the Swedenborgians on Lyon
street and there in the gloaming were
made man and wife.
The words that Joined the soldier and
the lady were spoken by the Rev. Mr.
Worcester, while the birds in the trees
without warbled the. wedding march.
There was no retinue, no gaping
crowdâ not even a chattering friend
to break in upon their happiness. The
service over, the happy pair withdrew
from the little gray church and disap
peared in the shadows. Only the
"cabby" knows where they went and
he has the dark secret hidden within
his breast.
But of one thing the friends of the
pair are sure â they must soon come
out into the open, for the gallant cap
tain is due at Camp Atascadero for
maneuvers. And then may the sweet
stupidities of congratulation be said.

The Elmer Walters company began
itt> second week at the California

much feeling, in which a young man
of wealth under a temporary
setback to his love affairs drops
dewn the social scale until he
reaches the bottom. Jay Pier
pont as the tramp handles the role
successfully, while Stanley Johns is a

"A Millionaire Tramp."
In attempting to portray the role of
Earon de Chevrial in "A Parisian Ro
mance" at the Grand last night, James
Neill failed to give a convincing delin
eation of that difficult character. His
best work was in the death scene, but
its effect was marred somewhat by the
behavior of the Sunday night audi
ence. Edythe Chapman was very
winning as the danseuse and resisted
all temptation to overdo the part. Miss
Gilman bravely attempted Marcelle,
but the part needed a more experi
enced woman. Her work compared
favorably with that of the rest of the
cast. John W. Burton looked and
acted the doctor and Donald Bowles
made the most of the short part of
Juliani. Sheldon Lewis, whose cuffs
had a tendency to interfere with his
acting, was very "stagey." The rest
of the cast had very little to do, for
tunately.
Grand Opera House.
After the chanting of the "Prayer
for the Dead," by Cantor Liederman,
a memoir on Herzl was read by Dr.
M. S. Levy. He said among other
things:
The villainous revelations In the . Dreyfus
case and the sufferings of the Jews In Russia
awakened the rreat purpose of Herzl' 8 life.
He saw the misery of his brethren, their
gloomy political and economic slavery, and
conceived the plan for their liberation. To
him the only hope for the race was the reoccu
patlon of Palestine. The idea waa taken up
with enthusiasm and he became famous as the
leader of a wonderful movement of modern
timee. Whatever may come of Zionism In
other hands, the changes It has already
wrought in the Jewish consciousness, the sense
of manliness It has Inspired in the despised
Jews will not be easily effaced.
Theodor Herzl is a cedar of Lebanon fallen.
At 44 years of age he had done what no other
man in modern times accomplished for Israel.
He did not create Zionism, but he. drew it to
gether, mo\-ed it into activity and made the
salvation of a race possible. The Jew wander-
Ing over the earth, ever remembering the past
of his people, has always prayed for a return
of that past, but It waa left for Herzl to mold
Zionism into practical form. Now the Jew
will have a home in a land hallowed by the
blood of his fathers and he will no more be a
Pariah driven here and there by the police of
all nations.
A solemn memorial service In honor,
of the late Dr. Theodor Herzl, the
founder of modern Zionism, who died
in Vienna ) on July 3, was held last
evening by the Zionists* Society of this
city In B'nal B'rith Hall.
The meeting, of which Dr. Isldor
Meyers, the president of the society,
acted is chairman, was opened by
Canton Samuelson, who chanted the
ninetieth psalm. This was followed
by an address in German by M. A.
Sommers. The Rev. Benjamin Lied
erman, a cantor of New York, who
is to be associated with Rabbi Meyers
in the high Jewish festival at Frank
lin Hall, conducted the ritualistic
portion of the services, opening with
the chant, "O Lord, What Is Man?"
Dr. Meyers in his eulogy, "What
Herzl did for Zionism," spoke of the
great sorrow that has overwhelmed
all Israel in the death of the man
who united the scattered Jewish race
once more in. the unity of old. ' He
said in part:

Chang is not a native son, although
he has lived under the Amarican flag
since the Hawaiian Islands were ad
mitted to the Union. He was born in
the city of Canton, China, twenty-six
years ago. His parents were poor and
it seemed in his early boyhood as if
his fate were to be that of the yellow
hordes among which he lived. But
beneath his blue blouse were desires
and ambitious and a spirit and deter
mination that made him different from
his fellows.
At the ase of 13 he ran away from
home to Hongkong in search of a bet
ter life than that he had known as a
goatherd and laborer in the rice
swamps of the distant Chinese prov
ince. In the great English stronghold
he was told of a beautiful land beyond
the seas where he could earn plenty
of gold and be answerable to no grasp-
Ing mandarin.
He decided to seek out these elysian
fields of which he heard and stowed
away on a vessel bound for the United
States. When the boat reached Hono
lulu he was put ashore. He found
employment at once and, still cherish
ing lofty ambitions in his young heart,
he saved every cent he could possibly
spare from the cost of existing. In a
year or two he set up a store on the
island of Hilo. He was very young,
but he prospered in business never
theless and his little establishment
grew to be a big one.
At the age of 21 he sold out his busi
ness, which was one of the largest
concerns of its kind on the Hawaiian
Islands. With much money in his
pocket, the slant-eyed boy then sailed
to America. He commenced upon his
studies immediately and applied him
self as busily as ever to the fulfillment
of his purpose.
After he had learned to read and
write English he determined to be a
doctor. He was admitted to the Col
lege of Physicians and Surgeons and
always held a high rank in his class.
He was graduated with honors last
spring and recently appeared before
the Board of Medical Examiners for
the final test, which he passed easily.
He does not intend to practice in the
United States, and after a trip through
the country he will return to the city
of his birth. He has been Christian
ized and wears no queue. He staces
that he means to uplift his country
men as far as rests In his power. He
will cure their bodies of physical Ills,
teach them the advantages of civiliza
tion and instruct them spiritually.
Chans A. Holt of 804 Stockton street
enjoys the distinction of being the first
Chinaman admitted to practice by the

proud of his achievement and his coun
trymen exult with him over his suc

BLANCHE PARTINGTON. j
All day yesterday and late into the
night, the unusual spectacle was pre
sented in the detention ward of the
Central Emergency Hospital of a de
voted husband pleading, but pleading
in vain, with his pretty young wife to
forsake the gay life she has chosen.
Hour after hour he stood at the little
wicket of the cell and in tones of en
dearment that had the ring of sincerity
begged the woman to return with him
to his home, promising her to forget
and forgive all. His entreaties were
unheeded or answered only by sneers.
The forsaken husband is Charles
Macfarlane, an employe of the Ameri
can Canning Company. The wife, who
claims that Macfarlane's salary of $250
a month is insufficient to support the
two of them, has for some time been
living in a house on Ellis street under
the name of. Millie Williamson. The
couple were married in St. Louis about
two years ago and recently came to
this city. Mrs. Macfarlane is a native
of Virginia. 22 years of age, handsome
and apparently of a bright and cheerful
disposition, Her husband Is a young
man and passionately devoted to her.
The couple did not come to this city
together. Macfarlane made the trip
first. After he secured employment he
sent for his young wife to join him.
It was not long after her arrival that
the attractions of a gay life began to
draw her away from her home. The
seductive butterfly, life which at first
leads along a rosestrewn pathway
flanked by hot birds and cold bottles
was the life she chose. The easiest way
of living high waa hers.
In order to win her back Macfarlane
swore out a warrant for her arrest,
charging that she had a suicidal mania.
The officers searched for her several
days, but only found her yesterday
afternoon. When given access to the
telephone the woman kept busy calling
up people who haunt resorts where the
lights burn all night and the blinds are
closed during the day.
Late last night Macfarlane regretted
the step he had taken and made an
unsuccessful attempt to procure the re
lease of the woman. In explanation of
her conduct she said she liked a
"sporty" life and $250 a month was
insufficient to purchase the luxuries
she craved. Her case will be heard by
Judge Kerrigan to-day.
George Wllllard, alias Joseph Ban
croft, etc., who was arrested Saturday
morning by Policeman Wolters, was
released. The police failed to have
him identified by any of the recent
victims of pickpockets.
A. L. Steuart, an employe of the
Southern Pacific Company, reported
to the police last night that an at
tempt was made to pick his pocket
yesterday afternoon at the ball game
at Recreation Park. Steuart accused
Ralph Bradley, an employe of the
Santa Cruz powder works, of the. at
tempted larceny. Bradley was arrest
ed, but later released, Steuart's identi
fication not being complete.
Turnbull attempted to follow them
but lost them In the crowd. He val
ues his watch at $150 and the ticket
at $5. He gave the police a good de
scription of the thieves and says that
he will be able to identify them if they
are captured.
Harry Turnbill, a carpenter resid
ing at 132 Rotteck street, had a gold
watch with a diamond settinjr and a
commutation ticket snatched from his
hand Saturday night at the Ferry de
pot. Turnbull met two young men in
a saloon at the northeast corner of
Steuart and Mission streets, where he
stopped on his way to the ferry. They
had several drinks together and the
newly formed acquaintances accom
panied Turnbull to the ferry.
Turnbull is stopping in San Ansel
mo for the summer and was on his
way to the ferry. He stopped to look
at his watch. In taking the timepiece
out he also brought forth his commu
tation ticket. One of the young men
grabbed the ticket and watch and
then both ran.
Last night the two alleged crooks
were booked for grand larceny. It is
said that the police recognize them as
hard characters.
Two young men, Harry Rose and
George Murray, whom the police be
lieve are professional pickpockets,
were arrested early yesterday morning
by Policemen P. O'Brien and Frank
Fontana at Market and Post streets.
The prisoners are accused of taking
a watch from the person of Sergeant
James Armstrong of the United States
Marines. Armstrong and a friend
were walking down Market street at
2:30 a. m. when Rose accosted him
and asked for the price of a bed.
Armstrong refused him and the young
man grabbed his arm. At the same
time, according to Armstrong's friend.
Rose dipped his hand into the ma
rine's pocket and took his watch.
Armstrong was informed by his friend
that he had lost his watch. The sail
ors called for help and Policemen
O'Brien and Fontana captured Rose
and Murray. Murray was not with
Rose at the time of the alleged theft,
but Rose was seen to attempt to join
him after he left Armstrong. Rose
had $4 in his pockets and claimed to
be a telegraph operator from Detroit.
Murray said that he was a miner from
Redding. The stolen watch was
found in a dirt pile near the scene
of the robbery.
Jordan says that Corrillo and another
man seized him on the corner of Mar
ket and Powell streets, and while one
held him Corrillo went through his
pockets. Jordan's watch chain was
torn from his vest, a missing button
bearing evidence of the fact.
The police believe that Jordan was
robbed, but think that he is mistaken
in charging Corrillo. Nothing was found
on Corrillo. Jordan, who was still
drunk, was held as a witness against
the man he claims did the robbing. No
witnesses of the alleged robbery were
found, although it occurred on a crowd
ed corner.
A telegram was received last night
from H. W. Newman, manager of the
Standard Oil Company in San Jose.
Newman gives Corrillo a good reputa
tion and says that the prisoner has
been in the employ of the company for
fourteen years, he has been foreman
of the packing-house for three years,
and left San Jose on his three weeks'
vacation two weeks ago. Corrillo waa
spending a part of his vacation in this
city. He has a wife and six children
residing in San Joset
Batiste Jordan, a winemaker from
Stockton, raised a disturbance yester
day afternoon on Market street, near
Powell, by alleging that he had been
assaulted on the busy street corner and
robbed of a watch and $75. Emil Cor
rillo, a foreman for the Standard Oil
Company in San Jose and treasurer for
a Mexican society in the same place,
was caught running down Market
street, near Sansome, and was arrested
by Policemen Groat and Ogden on sus
picion that he was the thief.
Jordan positively identifies Corrillo
as one of the men who he alleges
robbed him. The police do not believe
his story, but have detained Corrillo
pending developments.
Jordan was very much under the In
fluence of liquor, and Corrillo says that
he attempted to pilot him across Powell
street, when Jordan turned and struck
him to the ground. He says that he
then left Jordan and ran down Market
street toward the ferry, where he was
to meet his sister-in-law, who was com
ing from San Jose. The police doubt
Jordan's identification of Corrillo.
