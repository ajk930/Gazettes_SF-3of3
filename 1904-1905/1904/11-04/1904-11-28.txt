. CHEYENNE.. Wyo., Nov. 27.â Mrs.
Nancy Richardson, a ranch woman of
Fort Bridger, Wyo., some time ago
confessed that it was she who shot
Mrs. Leona de Mars, a neighbor, who
was wounded during a fight over the
division of irrigation water last Au
gust and died a few days ago. Mrs.
Richardson said she was prepared to
euffer any penalty, even death. Her
confession was made to shield George
Renner, her son-lrf-law, who is a
prominent ranchman of Fort Bridger.
Renner, however, is now in Jail, pre
pared to make a full confession, and
Mrs. Richardson has been discharged.
â¢ At the time of the fight it was sup
posed that Mrs. Richardson did\ the
shooting, but admissions of Rehner
and his mother-in-law show that Ren
ner was disguised as Mrs. Richardson,
What gave the officers a clew was the
statement of the dying woman that
her assailant, although she resembled
Mrs. Richardson, threw stones at her
with the force and accuracy of a man
and his voice was distinctly masculine.
Mrs. Richardson,, It is now learned,
was secreted in i the brush and wit
nessed the assault. The crime shocked
all Wyoming and its surprising sequel
has caused a sensation.

"When seen by a Call reporter Cor
oner Shepard had little to say beyond
admitting that the stolen money had
been found. Shepard said he hoped
that he would have no trouble with
th<Â» bank officials in getting the $1500
reward offered by them.
"Not so much for myself." said
Shepard. "but I do want to see my
three assistants â Geer, Dependener
and Monaghan â well paid."
Sheriff Keena, when Interviewed to
day, said: "There are many things
which I cannot tell the public at thl3
time. The finding of the bank money
was the missing link which proves
Adolph Weber guilty of the robbery
charge. Shepard has been of great
assistance to me in both cases and he
is entitled to the reward, and will
get it."
Under Sheriff May stll believes that
Weber may have purchased the pistol
in Auburn and has been devoting his
efforts to several clews which point
that way.
The question of who shall be ad
ministrator of the Weber estate will not

which meets next Tuesday, as a pre
cautionary measure. I leave for San
Francisco to-day on other business
and will return Monday night."
QUESTION OF REWARD.
Shepard. is the only man who knows
where the money is now, and he says he
does not know how much there 4s.
Sheriff Keena and Banker Lubeck were
told Thursday of the find, but it was
deemed best not to make It public until
Keena * returned from San Francisco.
Keena got home last night and this
morning read the warrant . to Weber
charging him with the robbery.
Banker Lubeck Is the most surprised
man in town- Though he has looked
upon Adolph Weber with suspicion for
many days and has therefore displayed
considerable interest in the ; youth. He
has not" until to-day, when he was
summoned by Weber to his cell, and
made an effort to see the youth- Lu
beck was seen after his interview with
the youth, and said:
: "He is a remarkable specimen of hu
manity. Why, he actually laughed at
me."
â¢It is now probable 'that the rob
bery charge will be heard before young
Weber is placed on trial for the murder
of his mother. District Attorney Rob
inson said as he stepped on the train
bound for San Francisco this after
noon: "We have a complete chain

If nothing had happened.
SECRECY MAINTAINED.
The money was found in the Weber
barn In the cowshed under a* foot of
packed earth and manure. On Tues
day last, the day after the finding of
the pistol, Sheriff Keena and Coroner
Shepard made ur> their minds that
the bank money was not far away
and hit UDOn the barn as the most
likely place. Shepard even suggested
the cowshed, but as they had no pick
and shovel the search was. postponed.
Sheriff Keena went to SJfcramento
Wednesday morning In "search of
some one to identify the pistol and
cartridges.
Shepard engaged â¢ three men, who
have been his trusted lieutenants ever
since the tragedy â Clarence Geer, Ben
Dependener and John Monaghan â to
aid in the search. Borrowing a pitch
fork, they went direct to the barn.
While his assistants were turning over
the hay in the loft Shepard went home
and returned with a pick. This he
put into the hand3 of Clarence Geer
and directed him where to dlff. Be
fore ten minutes had elapsed and
when a hole about a foot deep and as
wide had been dug. the pick struck
an obstruction that gave forth a
metallic sound. "The loose earth was
shoveled out and a five-pound lard
can full of $20Â«Â«old pieces was un
covered. ''-".'Â¦â¢ ~ Â¦'
At Weber's request Banker Lubeck.
president of the Placer County Bank,
was summoned to the cell. Weber
asked the banker -if he would press
the robbery charge before the con
clusion of the murder trial.
"The law will have to take its
course," answered Lubeck. "I do not
know what course will be pursued."
"Oh." he said, "I thought you had
discovered the motive for the murders."
' There was not a tremor in his voice
and when he took the warrant from
the Sheriff his hand was steady. Hasti
ly he glanced at the paper and then
with a shrug- said:
"This is a trivial matter. It does not
amount to anything. I hope the mur
der charge will be heard first. I want
to get it off my hands."
SENDS FOR BANKER. "â¢'
The serving of the warrant, in the
eyes of the officers and the bank offi
cials, was more_ than a formal affair.
With them It was the completion of a
chain of evidence that branded Weber
not only as a thief but as a foul and
fiendish murderer, a creature capable of
dyeing his hands in the blood of his
kin to satisfy his love for gold. They
expected that Weber would show some
sign that the mass of evidence against
him was having an effect upon his iron
will,*- that he would weaken and betray
his inmost feelings, and it was even
expected- that the "youth* might "give
up the .hard struggle he is making
against circumstances and confess his
guilt.
'; But they were disappointed. When
Sheriff .Keena stepped â¢ into the cell of
the accused and unfolded the imposing
document that charged the boy with
robbery, young Weber displayed only
curiosity. As the. Sheriff read aloud
the accusing words Weber's eyes glit
tered. Then he smiled, the same con
temptuous emlle that he has worn at
all times since his arrest. .
AUBURN, Nov. 27. â The money
stolen from the Placer County Bank
by a masked bandit last May has been
found and young Adolph "Weber, who
since his arrest on the charge of mur
dering: his father, mother, sister and
brother, has rested under the suspicion
that he was the bold highwayman, who
broad daylight entered the bank and
at the point of a pistol held up the
cashier for $5000, has had the charge
of robbery preferred against him. The
money was found on the Weber prop
erty in a cowshed last "Wednesday by
Coroner Shepard and three assistants.
The discovery of the gold on the
"Weber homestead, in a place not many
feet removed from the spot where was
found the bloody pistol with which
young Weber Is supposed to have dealt
death to his parents, his schoolgirl
sister and crippled brother, is regard
ed as almost proof conclusive that the
prisoner's hist for gold drove him to
commit the two crimes, one foul and
fiendish, the other bold and daring.
Immediately after the gold was
found the bank officials were informed.
The fact that it was found on the
Weber estate caused them to form but
one conclusion â that Adolph "Weber,
as they had long suspected, was the
thief. Cashier Smith swore to a com
plaint charging Weber with the crime
of robbery and a warrant was Issued
by Justice of the Peace Smith. It was
served on Weber in his cell yesterday
morning-.

will be founded on a charge that
Winans has ' given improper bills of

While the prevalence of bubonic
plague has not been officially declared
in Chile, it is stated that there are
case3 that the Chilean Government
daily conceals in order that steam

at which there are -no sanitary regula

Chief- Hodgkins declares that : he has
sufficient evidence. to convict the man
of murder, despite the fact that the
eyidende against him is almost wholly
circumstantial. Â¦ Just what the evidence
is will, of course, not be disclosed until
the case is tried, but Hodgkins. during
his three days' stay in Los Angeles,
has discovered evidence which will
serve to greatly strengthen the chain
of circumstances which seems to in
dicate the prisoner's guilt.
Kiniry himself has repeatedly stated
that a verdict of guilty against him
would cause him . no surprise. In an
unguarded moment he dropped a re
mark to a fellow prisoner in the City
Jail here which indicate^ that he would
take desperate chances in any effort
which would prevent his going to Oak
land for trial. After he had been in
formed that- the Oakland Chief of Po
lice was here and would take him away
in a day or two Kiniry said:
"Well, ij/s a long trip to Oakland and
he hasn't got me there yet.- You may
; hear something about that trip later."
> Hodgkins will take no chances with
his prisoner. The man will be hand
cuffed and shackled and will wear an
"Oregon boot." j Unless friends attempt
the foolhardy plan of trying to rescue
him there? is hardly a possibility of his
escaping, for ho has barely recovered
from a pistol shot wound which would
have killed some men and. can hardly
walk. Two deputy sheriffs of this
c6unty will be on the same train tak
ing prisoners to,San Quentin and the
officers will "pool issues, 1 ' making any
attempt to escape a hazardous under
taking.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 27.â Chief of
Police Hodgkins of Oakland will leave
for home to-morrow having in custody
P. David-Kiniry, alias Fred West, all
round burglar, professional porch
climber and the- supposed -murderer of
Patrolman Smith *of the Oakland Po
lice Department. But for the fact that
the Oakland officers feel confident of
their ability to convict him of murder,
the Los Angeles authorities would not
surrender Kiniry, for there are no less
than twenty-six cases of burglary and
one of attempted murder against him
here, with evidence sufficient to convict
in practically all of them: Inasmuch as
the murder charge is so much more im
portant, however, the crook will be sur
rendered to Oakland and there tried for
his life. If he is not convicted Kiniry
will be either turned over to the San
Francispo" authorities and tried for sev
eral big burglaries committed in that
city, or returned to Los Angeles for
trial.

It Is a pleasure to bring the greetings of th^'j

President and the people of the United States

discussion has arisen, and hope to reach a so
lution full of honor to both countries. I have
the great honor to present the personal greeting
of President Roosevelt and expressions of pro
found good will.
President Amador, in reply, said:
Your arrfrttUn Panama, with the purpose
that brings you, is the highest honor this re
public has received since it was born. The
Government and people will know how to ap
preciate this new proof of sympathy with
which the United States has desired once more
to distinguish us. -

construction of the canal. He was re
ceived by President Amador and the
Panama Cabinet at 4 o'clock this
afternoon. . After greetings had been
exchanged, Taft said:

Officials here regard as of .great sig
nificance the statement of Delcasse ii:
the French,. Chamber of Deputies yes
terday in support of the Franco-Rus
sian alliance; No less significant is the
statement of the French committee on
foreign budget that "Already Japan
has made known the conditions on
which she is ready to close hostilities.
These consist in the return of Man
churia to China," etc. '
It is â¢ thought that this may be the
clew to Prince Fushimi's real misfeion
to the United/States. The United
States is vitally interested in the re
turn, of Manchuria to the Chinese. Sec
retary Hay's policy in support of the
integrity of China contemplated . the
evacuation of Manchuria by- the Rus
sians on October S, 1903., Failure so to
do' deeply irritated the State Depart
ment. The restoration of Manchuria
to China is made -a point of common
American and Japanese interest by the
desire af the Japanese Government to
make it one of the conditions of peace.
The United States might not be ap
proached with propriety by Japan with
a request to intervene, but it is be
lieved Prince Fushimi has broached
the subject of the fate of Manchuria
when peace shall have been restored.
riWOPS. SUFFER GREATLY.
It -is now expected that diplomacy
will make a great effort to forward
peace, . All powers save Russia are anx
ious to end the war. Prince Fushimi
of Japaiu who is now in this country,
has not disclosed any purpose of his
visit except to see the President and
the World's Fair, but it is believed by
diplomats' here that behind this there
was- something far more important.
The fact that Prince Fushimi had two
conferences with Secretary Hay while
he was in Washington is most signifi
cant.

Bpeclml Dispatch to The Ca!
A thousand men, wome^ J\nd chil
dren swarmed panic-stricken out of
the Chutes zoo shortly after 11 o'clock
yesterday morn'ing when Sultan, the
ferocious liorf, attacked his brave
trainer, Charles Hendricks, while the
latter was lying' helplessly at the feet
of the blood-thirsty beast. After the
brute had sunk his claws into the leg
of the unfortunate man, Hendricks re
gained his presence of mind and fired
his pistol several times, frightening
the lion away and giving the attend
ants time to drae the trainer from the
cage before he was torn to pieces.
Hendricks entered the cage of the
lion as usual to give a public exhibi
tion. As he walked Jauntily toward
the corner where the enormous beast
was crouching, quivering and ready to
spring, Hendricks slipped and fell. A
cry of horror arose from the 'spec
tators Just as - the maddened beast
pounced on his trainer, who was mak
ing valiant efforts to rise.
The lion sank his massive claws !
into the fleshy part of Hendricks' leg j
and with a roar was preparing to tear j
him to pieces when the trainer's pres- :
ence of mind saved his life. He
quickly pulled out his revolver, which !
he always carries, and fired several j
blank cartridges in the face of the ,'
big beast. This served to daze and i
partially subdue Sultan, and while he j
stood gazing bewildered on the pros
trate form of his trainer several at- I
tendants came to the rescue and took#
.Hendricks out of the cage. !
Meanwhile the crowd in the place
was transformed almost into a fren
zied mob. Men and women ran
hither and thither, screaming and
shouting. The very spectacle of the
lion springing- on the trainer served
to make many sick. .It was some time
before order could be restored in the
zoo. /^
Hendricks way removed to his home
and put under the care of a physician.
He. was found to be suffering from a
painful wound in the fleshy part of the
leg, but there is no danger of serious
consequences. The trainer was badly
shaken up by the sudden attack. v

termination to fight'to the last extremity.
Wh>n the war came on it so happened that
our financial condition was such that every
thing indicated a fresh awakening after & pe
riod of long dullness and inactivity. Thus our
latent financial energy was directed toward
the war fund. Our people are showing ample

PORT ARTHUR WAII'S CENTER.
The delay in the decisive result of our oiege
of Port Arthur gives Russia hope of being able
to relieve the garrison, and for this purpose
she resSTvfd to empty her naA - al Vdefense at
home, while on land corps after corps has been
mobilized and sent eastward. The military and
naval plans of Russia seem to center in the
rfiief of Pert Arthur, and General Kuropat
kin's southward advance, which resulted In his
serious defeat, had the relief of the garrison
as 'its sole object. The Russian Emperor's in
structions to Kuropatkin not to retire beyond
Mukden were designed to raise the gloom that
had been hanging over the people of Russia
since the defeat of Russian arms, at -the battle
of Liacyang, and Kuropatkin assumed the ag
gressive, perhaps, against his own Judgment.
Kverything seems to -.hinge on the fall of
Tort Arthur, but 1 do net console myself with
the thought that the capture of that ill fated
fortress will bring thÂ» war to a speedy termi
nation. Its capture will give occasion for re
newed plans of warfare by Russia, and I am
watching keenly for such developments.
The domestic conditions of Japan are highly
satisfactory. The history of our IMet may be
summnl up by sayine" that from the first it
planted itself firmly in opposition to the Gov
ernment on financial questions. r After my ap
pointment friction became increasingly violent.
The -two great parties, "the Constitutionalists
and the Progressives, presented a combined
front !n opposition tp my Ministry. Despite
adminstrative reform effected on their demand
we failed to satisfy them.' They criticized our
financial measures as excessive and refused to
pass the bills.
Judging by those conditions, serious collisions
between the governed and the g6verning were
predicted, but when the. war came this frifctlon
entirely ceased, and the House of Representa
tives, which once refused to pass a budget of
/125.<X"iO,tKX) as excessive and unbearable, gave
a ready and willing assent to the first war
budget of ?2SS,000,00O. -
To injure peace in the Orient and to safe
guard our national existence is the' aim
purpess of .our eniplr<\ and no^sacriflce shall be
too great for successfully .effecting this purpose.
Â¦Hus:-ia, bcikleu vioiating'i her pleUgreg in Man
churia, crowned her overbearing and aggres
sive policy by extending "her arms to the'Ko
rean peninsula. We were highly solicitous to
preserva peace, but had no alternative except
that of war, which was forced upon us.
Througiiout the^ negotiations ftussia showed a
haughty anu c-.i-rtejii.nij attitude, wnich. as tias
latterly .been shown, was inadequately sup
ported by military strength. Russia allowed
iieii-tii io ba dtceived and slishted our empire,
for she never believed that Japan would draw
the sword of war. Then, after, suffering re
peated defeats on land - and en sea, Russia
perceived the mistake. she had made, and, hav
ine discovered the eeriouEness of the situation,
bÂ«san to take adequate measures.
Thu case was different with us. We were
ever alive to the .seriousness cf the situation
and were prepared for emergencies.
Russia must see that the *ar cannot be con
eluded try the issues of a few battles. With
bs this war means life or death, and not one
of our forty-five million brethren remains ig
norant of the vital issue at stake. \^'e are pre
pared to sacrifice our last man and our last
ceni_ for this war.

Modern science recognizes the fact that

To cure indigestion is largely due to the

There are no "cure alls" among them.

sergeants at the City Prison, said yes
terday that he had known Smith for
nearly thirty years. His ftrst acquaint
ance with him was when he went to
serve a warrant, upon him on a charge
of battery. The complaining witness
was with him and when Smith saw
the complainant he promptly attacked
him again. Melody cited the circum
stance to show that Smith had a vio
lent temper when aroused.
Smith will appear in the Police
Court this morning, but the case will
be continued pending the Coroner's in
quest, which will be held in a day or
two.
Joseph Smith, the aged contractor,
who shot and killed Joseph McGowan
at the brickyard, 2969 Mission street,
on Saturday morning, was visited by a
large number of his friends in the City
Prison yesterday. He was no sooner
finished talking: with one than another
took the vacant place. One of them
brought him a box of cigars and
others had little reminders of their
friendship.
Smith said he spent a miserable
night in his cell and yesterday morn
ing he was changed to another cell,
where he has more light and comfort.
He did not care to talk about the
shooting, but said he had acted in self
defense. McGowan had knocked him
down two or three times and he was
afraid McGowan and James Beatty
would seriously injure him, as they
had threatened him several times.
They wanted, he said, to drive him out ;
of the place. Beatty had been cursing
him from early morning. He thor
oughly realizes the gravity of his posi
tion and says he hopes the law of
ficers will not be too hard on an old
man. He claims that he must have
pulled the trigger *unintentionally in
hrs excited state.
The police at the park station were
very much surprised yesterday when
a little boy, Donald Park of 850 Clay
ton street, walked into the station
carrying a human hand. When ques
tioned by the officers he said that Wal
ter Morton of S51 Clayton street had
shown' him where the hand was burled
in a lot on the west side of Tremont
avenue, south of Frederick street. The
two boys dug up the hand and hid it
in a clump of bushes, thinking they
might make some use of it, but after
ward concluded" It would-be better to
turn it over to the police.
The boy said that the hand was
found by Mrs. Devant, 834 Clayton
street, on her front stoop", about two
weeks ago. â¢ Mrs. Devant went shop
ping at about 11 o'clock in the morn
ing and on her return found the
Bevered member on her steps. Instead
of notifying the police she buried it in
the lot back of her house, and the
boys, thinking they might make some
capital of it, dug it up yesterday.
The police believe the hand was
thrown on the stoop by a student re
turning from the Affiliated Colleges.
It was brown and winkled, as though
it had been ln pickle, and also bore
evidence of having been dissected. It
la a right hand and the long, tapering
fingers indicate that it was the hand
of a woman.

SMITH CLAIMS
SELF-DEFENSE
' With the intention of punishing
those responsible for his son's injury,
Albert de Rome, the" father of Albert
T. de Rome, who was hazed by some
of the students of the Hopkins Art In
stitute,, has begun an investigation of
the hazing. , Mr. de Rome came from
San Jose to Oakland yes'terday to see
the boy. Accompanied by his son he
came to San Francisco to consult Dr.
Charles Clark, under whose care the
young man is. After hearing the doc
tor's op : nion of the case, Mr. de Rome
said:
"I have not "yet decided just what
course to pursue in regard to the stu
dents concerned in the hazing, of my
son, but I have begun an investigation
and" do not intend to allow the guilty
students to escape. My son has been
badly injured, in fact so severely that
Dr. Clark refuses as yet to say how
long it will take him to recover, or
whether or not he will ever be com
pletely well.
"While I do,/ not hold the directors
of the institute responsible, I do be
lieve' they should put a final 'stop to
such practices. If Albert's injuries
should prove permanent I would not
be inclined to show any mercy to those
responsible for them, but shall pun
ish them to the full extent of the law,
and even if he recovers I shall take
such steps as will put a complete stop
to this practice of hazing students."
The victim of the hazing, when seen
last night at his "ncle's home ln
Golden Gate, said:
"I am riot feeling so well to-day as I
'was Friday and it seems as if my
strength is leaving me. Yesterday I
suffered with terrible pains in my
back, and while they have left me. to
day I feel very weak. The doctors
said that this was partly the result of
the nervous shock, but my whole body
seems to be eiving out."

We learn that five years before the
war began the Japanese commenced
sending coolies by the hundreds into
Manchuria, with instructions to live
with the Chinese therein, fraternize
with them and be in position- to fur
nish true information when war be
gan to the Japanese and false advices
to the Russians. The secrecy which
the Japanese commanders have been
able to maintain as to the movements
of their army â a secrecy that Kuro
patkin has over and over again
acknowledged himself to be unable to
illumine â shows how admirably the
Japanese efforts in this direction have
been applied and how completely they
were prepared for the campaign they
knew to be a question only of months
or years. â Cleveland Leader.

Sunday Sermon on
Whisky Drinking
To day is a good day to rest and do
a little thinking on tlie serious prob-
lem of life.
If you are a drinking man stop and
figure out how much you are spend-
ing a j-ear for whisky and beer. Think
if you stopped drinking how many
more comforts and pleasures your
famil3 r could have. Think what you
might be able to do for your children.
Why not stop drinking? But you
say, "I've tried and can't." You
haven't really tried i r you haven't
come to me. In three days I can kill
all desire for further drinking. After
taking my treatment your general |
health will be better than since you
were a boy. I have treated success-
fully over is,ooo men. Write me to-
day or call at your first opportunity.

Peace has come at last to the First
Baptist Church, and after months of
waiting, in which the congregation
was obliged to do without the ser
vices of a regular pastor, the vacancy
has beenfiJlerl by the Rev. William*]
C. Spencer, formerly of Alameda, and i
recently of Moline, Illinois... j
Dr. Spencer took charge of the
church to-day, preaching hiÂ» intro
ductory sermon this morning. He is
expected to heal the wounds found in
a divided â¢church and bring prosperity
to a congregation that hajÂ» undergone
disheartening experiences during the
last year. The church became di- |
vided over a former pastor, the Rev. i
R. L. Halsey. who was objected to by
pome because he engaged in secular
pursuits, ia addition to his ministerial
work. The congregation split into j
two factions over Mr. Halsey. and |
arguments which were bitter and j
acrimonious resulted finally in the !
pastor's leaving the church and ac
cepting work in tho government ser
vice at Honolulu. Then the two fac
tions in the church renewed their
arguments. , j
Rev. Adelbert S. Coates. a capable,
scholarly clergyman, took charge of
the church, but was unabie to bring
peace, and eventually his eupporters
withdrew from the older organiza
tion and founded a separate church.
Meanwhile, the old First Baptist
Church, possessing- a fine church
buiiding but no minister, tried various
preachers, without being able to unite

OFFICERS OF CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR SOCIETY WHICH HKLI> REUNION YESTERDAYS
" Letters addressed to Johnny Strode,
Isleton, Sacramento County, with en
velopes stamped were taken in charge
by Deputy Coroner Quellen. Strode
is supposed to be Mrs. La Perle's fath
er. One of the messages, dated No
vember 26, invited "Dear brother and
father" not to write again, as Mrs. La
Perle was going away. A note dated
to-day, however, announced that she
would go home Thursday or Friday.
The hospital surgeons said the
wopan had taken carbolic acid, but
a seach of her room failed to uncover
the 1 vial in which, it is supposed, the
pofson was contained. Several hours
before she was found Mrs. La Perle
had tried at drug stores to buy car
bolic acid. A woman companion had
prevented the sale of the drug to her,
by asserting that the applicant in
tended to commit suicide. But Mrs.
La Perle eluded her friend and got
the poison. , |
It was at 2 o'clock that occupants
of the lodging house heard . screams
fcr help from Mrs. La Perle's room.
The woman was writhing in pain
when the startled people reached her.
The police were called and quickly
sent the su.fferer to the hospital. She
was beyond relief. The hospital sur
geons said she had taken a large
quantity of the poison.
Deputy Coroner Henry Quellen took
the body to the Morgue. Mrs. La
Perle had been living at the Davis
house for several months. She was
supposed to have been married to
William La Perle, a teamster.
Among Mrs. La Perle's effects the
following note was found:
"Alice â Please give George back
what money was left from last night,
and good-by. I am goind to end my
troubles. MAE.'*
Despondent and weary of life. Mae
La Perle, 30 years old. took poison
this afternoon. An hour later she
died at the Receiving Hospital, where
she was taken by Policeman McSor
ley, who had been called to the wom
an's room in H. Davis' lodging house.

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Nov. 27.
Despite the action of the university
authorities in dismissing W. T. Hale,
editor of the Daily Californian, from
college for one year, thus testifying to
the disfavor in * which he is held by
the university faculty, friends of the
young student editor have determined
to give him a substantial testimony of
their admiration and esteem, before he
leaves this week for his home in San
Diego.
Hale was dismissed for criticizing in
sarcastic editorials the faculty and par
ticularly the military section of the in
structors. He ridiculed the order of
Captain Nance, that the "potent, grave
and reverend seniors" march in mili
tary fashion into the classroom. Hale
in his paper invited all and sundry,
on the day of the order was issued, to
"come up to the campus and see the
fun," or words to that effect. A sen
sational riot followed, with reports of
which the pres3 of the State were filled,
so that it was found necessary, even
tually, for the university authorities
to take cognizance of the offenders.
Forty-eight of them are now on proba
tion, threatened with expulsion if they
do not obey orders.
Hale was suspended for a year, as
being â¢ indirectly responsible for the
liot. He persisted to the last in de
claring his right to criticize the facul
ty, when justice demanded criticism,
but the faculty decided that* he was
wrong, and President Wheeler gently,
but firmly, applied the official ax, and
the boy editor's fate was at once the
sensation of campus and college hall.
He is now to be the guest of honor
at a testimonial banquet given by his
classmates and such alumni as are in
terested in the affair. He will sit at
the liead of the festal board and listen
to the eloquent words of youthful col
legians who wish to show that despite
Hale's humiliation they esteem him
highly, and believe him to be a youth
of character and high ideals, in disgrace
temporarily, but deserving of tokens of
regard.
Hale will receive a bound copy of
The Daily Californian. which he edit
dU, and in the volume will be blank
pages of paper, on which will be placed
the signatures of those who attend the
dinner given to him. Richard O'Con
nor. '04, editor of The Daily Californian
during his senior year at the univer
sity, is arranging the details of the af
fair, which probably wJH take place
next- Wednesday night In Oakland.
Joseph' Loeb; managing editor of The
Daily Californian, has been directed by
President Wheeler to remove Hales
name from the paper as editor when it
is issued to-morrow.
The question of faculty censorship
of college publications is to be dis
cussed exhaustively at a meeting of the
University Press Club to-morrow night.
The club is composed of prominent un
dergraduates who are connected with
university publications.
Screams for Help Are An

BERKELEY, Nov. 27.â Extensive im
provements in North Berkeley, which

ment Company, which to-day awarded
a contract to the King Construction
Company for the sewering, macadamiz
ing and the laying of 3000 'feet of drain
age pipe In land near Grove and Cedar

cost $30,000. i
It Is said to be the intention of the
Oakland Traction Company to extend
its Grove street line Into the tract to
be improved as soon as the work of Im
provement Is completed. : The . creek
there will be filled in after the drainage

During the last two weeks Hammond

ent conditions of the market. Con
cerning the firm's business. Mr. Hawks
said :
While the election and campaign may have
had a quieting effect on the. realty business
that is fast passing away. When people are
seeking homes they are not an a general thing
deterred from doing so by political matters.
We have had numerous demands for four, five
and six room cottages to rent and have been
unable to give prospective tenants what they
want. There is an unprecedented call for
homes that rent for from $15 to ?2l> a month.
We recently sold a lot to a Mrs. Lawrence
on Railroad avenue, between Fifth and Sixth
streets, upon which the new owner will Im
mediately erect a commodious cottage.
Berkeley and Alameda Deal
ers Are Well Satisfied
With the Present Outlook
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway. Nov. 27.
With the opening of winter the ex
pectations of local real estate dealers
that there would be a marked increase
in business have been fully realized.
There Is hardly a firm in the city that
has not had all the business that could
be handled during the last week, de
spite the fact that Thanksgiving week
is generally rather dull. All parts of
the city seem to rind favor with pur
chasers and renters, and many in
quiries have been made for centrally
located business property.
Dealers In Berkeley and Alameda also
report increased activity since the elec
tion. In Alameda the demand for cot
tages continues to exceed the supply,
and it is expected that as soon as the
winter is over there will be a build
ing boom in the "Island City." Much
street work is being done in North
Berkeley at present, for the purpose of
opening up new building tracts.. A
contract has just been let by the
Northland Development Company for
street and sewer work to cost $3000
The Syndicate Investment Company
has just secured Barker. Park, one of
the finest residence tracts in Frultvale,
which has already been snbdivided into
building lots. Nineteen of' these- lots
wtre sold last Thurday Barker Park
Is a part of the F. L. Barker property,
and is located on Fruitvaje avenue Just,
above the county road. The price paid
for the tract was $35,000. and the value
of the lots already sold approximates
$10,000. \
William J. Laymance, president of
the Laymance Real Kstate Company,
reports an active market with a splen.
did outlook, for the winter. He said:
. We have sold during the past week for John
W. Phillips, the well known capitalist, and E.
B. Pond to A. Silvergteln the two-story busi
ness block and lot 2.1x1 (X> feet on the north line
of Eighth street, 1'2!> feet east of Washington,
fcr $Â»T.Vi.
V\> havp also sold a suburban tract of unim
proved iota in the neighborhood of *1O,(XH> to
another local capitalist.. This property Is be
ing purchased to be held by the buyer as an In
vestment, a* he has great faith in the future
value of Oakland suburban property.
We have also sold for Mrs. M. McGinn to
George Ro?lh. anothrr well known capitalist,
the southwest corner of Sixth and Clay streets. (
size T5xlOO feet, with improvements, for $S5U>.
For Professor George C. Edwards to W. A.
Pattiani. an- eiijht-room house, with lot 40x100
feet, situated on the north Bide of Twenty-flrst
street, 200 feet east of Webster, for $0000.
We have also leased two of the handsome
new home* In this same block at $45 per
month. This proves the fact that new houses
find ready tenants. White these houses were
built for the market, the rentals paid such good
interest that Profensor Edwards leased same
instead of Â»el)inÂ». - .
Several sales 'uf 'cheap house* and lots Indi
cate that the man of moderate means is very
much In evidence. There is also a large class
of buyers who are hard, to accommodate â peo
ple who arr wanting Income. Investment prop
erties. It is difficult to find this class of prop
erty because the present owners have such
confidence In their holdings that they will not
place the. same in the market.
A prominent Oakland banker remarked to me
yesterday that there must be a great many
new people coming into Oakland, as he cannot
r.'member a time when there were so many
new bank accounts opened. This speaks wel
for our city. And not only new residential
people are coming to Oakland, but new busi
ness firms 'are looking toward our fair city.
We have recently located the Pacific AN ood and
Willowware Company, a wholesale concern.
This company has taken a long lease on a two
etory brick building on Washington street,
near Seventh. We have also leased two of tha
ntores in the new O. H. King building at
Twelfth and HarrUon streets, one to P. Me-
Mullen for Hve years for a wholesale and re
tail hardware business and the other to R.
Price for three years for a wholesale and re
tail candy business.
We are informed that the success attending
the soliciting of students by the Polytechnic
Business College, which has leased the three
upper floors of this new building, iÂ» so encour
aging that another story may be added to the
building. Mr. King haÂ» expressed h )Â¦Â»Â»Â»?*:
ness to make this a flve-story building should
they require the added space. He says he
realizes the great importance of 1000 or }-**>
student*, coming from the States of VVÂ«shing
ton. Oregon and California, means to this clt>.
The president of the Continental Paint and
Varnish Company, which company was recently
located by us, informed me that he was well
pleased with Oakland as a manufacturing and
distributing point, and that he was Re ting
some splendid business from San Francisco
and Pac.nc Coast firms. He also said he. had
negotiations on for some large orders to the
South American countries.
A. F. Cornwall, secretary of the E.
P. Vandercook Company, said:.
The real estate outlook Is much better since
the elAtlon. We look forward to an exceed
ingly good winter trade, as there is a strong
demand for small properties ranging In price
from $1500 to f'tOOO, and ' situated near, car
lines or local^trains.
A large number of Eastern people are mak
ing inquiries about Oakland and its surround
ings, with a view to locating here in the near
future. The demand for good cottaÂ«es and
small flaU for rent continues Â»tÂ«* d >'-' and â¢"
many Instances we are unable to fill the wants
of our customers.
A. L. Krelss of the firm of Kreiss &

ginning and gives it as his opinion

ALAMEDA. Nov.* 26.â With the po

realty look for a quickening in every
department of the business. The de
mand for modern cottages to rent con
tinues as strong as ever and' the sup
ply, as short as formerly. Flats,
apartment houses and the larger two
story residences are not sought for in
Alameda as are in, other cities.
When people, come here to live they
want, to" get, close to the earth and,
for this reason," the cozy cottage with
its 'ample rear yard and front lawn
and' 'garden has' the call over other
classes of homes. â¢.

"FASHION M0DEL5" '
Of the very swellest and most up-to-date gowns will be issued by*
|| THE SUNDAY CALL
to all its readers in the near future.
By special arrangement with .The American Lithograph Com-
pany THE CALL will place in the hands of every reader a beauti-
ful form model (in colors), showing from week to week the very
latest patterns of gowns, garments, hats, etc., on the market. This
series of Fashion Models will run for several weeks and will cer-
tainly prove of great interest to all lovers of beautiful designs in
garments. In addition to the series of models there is a figure
printed (in colors) on heavy cardboard, which is given with the first
model issued by this paper. Being printed on heavy stock it is not
easily mutilated, or destroyed â all gowns fit this figure, are strictly
up-to-date and designed under the supervision of one of the best
fashion experts in this country. Every little detail is attended to
with the greatest care.
In all cases where it is appropriate a hat appears with the model
of costume and is designed to harmonize with it. The series in-
cludes patterns ranging from shirt waists to ball gowns. The quality
of the fashion plates is unsurpassed.
Patterns for the gowns, etc., shown in models are manufactured
by The May Manton Pattern Company and may be secured through
this paper. m
Aside from their value as a pattern series it has great value as
a doll. The children will be delighted with such a creation, and each
Sunday they are supplied with a new gown, so that when the series
is complete they have a fine doll with an attractive wardrobe.
If you are not already a reader of THE CALL, be sure to sub-
scribe soon and secure this series of FASHION MODELS.

Gam*" They Will Meet Tigers.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 27.â Los An
geles won both games to-day from
Seattle. If President BÂ»rt of the Pa
cific Coast League decides in their
fai-or a protested game with Portland
the Angels will be one game ahead of
Tacoma and will thus be entitled to
play them a vost season series for
th* championship. If Bert decides in
favor of Portland the Angc-Is will lose
by a few points and if the game is
thrown out altogether the Angels and
Tigfrs will be tied and a i>ost series
will certainly result. The game in
question was played some months ago
in Portland. McDonald and Mc-
Carthy wrre umpiring. The latter
gave the game to Portland. Manager
Morjoy says the former was in favor
<>f giving it to the Angels. Bert prom
ised to decide the, question when Mc-
Donald returned to San Francisco, but
so far has not given out his rulinr,
Both games to-day were played ra the
afternoon ar.d drew 6000 people. The
firFt was easy for the Angels, as they
ouihit their opponents. Baum was
a mystery to the Siwashes in the sec
ond fiamo, which was called after
one-half of the sixth inning had been
rlay?d. Scores:

The baseball season of 1904 !s but a
memory, a bitter one to some and one
DUed with Joy for others. Following
the ancient tradition that has held good j
for years San Francisco walked off the :
field triumphant in the goodby strug-
Cle yesterday at the Eighth street lot. |
Oaldand made but a sorry showing and i
the g3jne finished 7 to 3. In a bright !
exhibition at Oakland in the morning i
the Seals snowballed the Commuters.
Scon 2 to 0.
The teams finished just about the
way they promised to do about a ,
week ago â Tacoma first, in a canter;
Los Angeles a fair second, Oakland
Just in third place, the Seals fourth
and coming hard, Seattle nagging and
hugging fifth position, and the unfor
tunate Brownies, the Joke of the sea
ton, last and a bad last at that.
A fairly good crowd invaded the park
to ger a last glimpse at their favorite
toshers, whom they may never lay eyes
on again. It was a good natured gath
ering that seemed to enjoy each play
and some pretty bad ones came off
during the progress of the game. The
field was wet and slippery and fast
fk-ldingr was out of the question.
The Commuters wore outplayed, espe
cially on the bases. Wheeler handed
them a brand that they never quite got
j' rry to, except in the first two spasms.
Ihe Seals soon became wised up to
the fact that they might do some good
work on the sacks and they neglected
no opportunities to show their speed
and at the same tirr/e get several easy

PORTLAND. Nov. 27.â That the Cud
ahys of Omaha and Chicago will soon
be in a position to dictate terms in the
salmon market ofÂ»the world is apparent
by a deal now on for the control of the
Pacific Packing and Navigation Com
pany, the largest cannery corporation
upon the Pacific Coast. Demlng &
Gould, brokers of Chicago and San
Francisco, are backed by the Cudahys In
their effort to obtain' the majority of
stock in the company.
The Cudahys now own some stock in
the Pacific American Fisheries Com
pany, a subsidiary company. Most of
the Puget Sound salmon are packed
under Cudahy management. They
wished to buy out the Pacific American
Fisheries Company entirely, but the
other stockholders would not sell to
them. T. McGovern believed he could
buy the stock for about J225.00p, but
George T. Myers, apparently acting for
Cudahy. forced him to pay $310,000 by
close bidding in the auction.
It is believed that the people back of
McGovern will not be able to put up
the money stipulated and the Cudahy
agents can then secure the stock. The
deal for the control of the Pacific Pack
ing and Navigation Company will be
closed December 10.
Wanted for Perjury.
Lawrence Alexander, formerly in
the employ' of the United Railroads
as a conductor, was taken into cus
tody Saturday night by Detective Silva
and will be' charged. with perjury.
"When about a week' ago, he secured a
license to marry Edith Hyde, it ap
pears that Alexander married Miss
Madge Callahan last February,: but
the couple separated soon after the
ceremony. Alexander then kept com
pany with Miss Hyde and represented
to her that he was a single man.
Recently Mrs. Alexander informed
Miss Hyde of the true condition of
affairs and Alexander, in order to em
phasize his denial of his wife's story,
offered to 'procure a marriage license.
In doing so he swore he had never
been married before and now his wife
will prosecute hirft on a charge of
perjury. , -
A number of boys and girls received
their first communion yesterday morn
ing at the 8 o'clock mass at St. Jo
seph's Church, the Rev. Father P. E.
Mulligan, the pastor, officiating, as-
Eisted by the Rev. Father Eugene
O'Sullivan, the Rev. Father P. J.
Keane, the Rev. Father J. Collins and
the Rev. Father B. Cahtlllon.
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon an
other class was confirmed by Arch
bishop Rlordan, assisted by the. Rev.
Father Mulligan and the Rev. Father
O'Sullivan, the Very Rev. Father
Frieden, S. J., giving the benediction
of the Blessed Sacrament.
The remarks of Archbishop Rior
dan to the confirmation class were
rich with advice that each boy and
girl should remember the vow taken
and keep it throughout life, lie spoKe
words of commendation to the sisters
and the brothers who had so faithfully
tended the class and prepared it for
confirmation. He paid especial atten
tion to the necessity of religious homes
and pointed out the duty of parents
toward their children â their duty be
ing to guard them with a true religious
surrounding.
Before the conclusion of the cere
monies the Archbishop called upon
the boys to pledge themselves to the
Order of the League of the Cross,
which required of them strict sobriety
until they reach the age of 21. After
that period had been reached hia
Grace was sure that with the lesson
of abstention they will have received
they would all be the better and in
after life would be sober men.
He deplored the fact that there are
more than 3000 saloons In San Fran
cisco and recommended the abolition
of the practice of resorting to liquor
In the homes on the occasion of a
b:rth, a marriage or a death. -
Xine-tenths of the criminals, he
said, were so on account of drink, a
fact which had come to his .notice
while chaplain at an Illinois prison.
He- asked them to look at the murders
that were taking place and observe
fights in saloons. Nine-tenths of those
incarcerated in the penitentiaries, he
said, will admit that liquor is respon
sible for their downfall.

munion were:

Adverse currerite and a lack of breeze
came near being, the undoing of the
crew of the schooner Lizzie Prien, out
bound for Coquille River yesterday aft
ernoon. Captain Hanson remained by
his vessel, until after midnight in the
hope of getting her into deep\ water
without the aid of a towbe-at, but he
was finally obliged to 'accept a line
from the tug Reliance of the Spreckels
Towbtrat Company, and be towed into
the channel.
Early in the afternoon the Lizzie
Prien sailed. for the Oregon port. IJttle
difficulty was experienced until the
Heads were reached. Here the wind
failed, and the schooner beat slowly
about, with barely enougn breeze to
till her sails for several hours.- At 9
o'clock Captain Hanson noticed that
his vessel was drifting- toward the
breakers, and at 9:30 p. m. heÂ»sent up
rockets as signals of distress. \
The life-saving crews of the Golden
Gate and Park stations responded, and
a telephone message was sent to the
office of the Spreckels towboats. The
tug Reliance was detailed to lend as
sistance to the schooner, but Captain
Hanson, when the tug arrived, said
that he preferred to take a chance of
kedging his vessel off rather than un
dertaking the more expensive tow.
The life-saving crews removed the
schooner's crew of six men, but Captain
Hanson remained by his ship, directing
the efforts of the Hfesavers to get out
additional anchors. The Reliance stood
off and on while the schooner's crew
transferred their personal effects to the
tug. Both anchors of the Lizzie Prien
were let so and she held rast, giving
Captain Hanson hope of being able to
catch breeze enough to beat seaward
at high water. However, at 12:15 o'clock
the skipper decided that It was useless
to 1 attempt to battle against fate, and
he accepted a line from the Reliance.
The Lizzie Prien was towed safely to
smooth water and proceeded to sea
after transferring all of her property
that had been removed to the towboat
when it was thought that the schooner
was in danger of being smashed to
pieces by the surf.

I > Making It Hot for the Ice.
In the third rail systom of electric
roads the removal of sleet from the rail
which is not used by the car.3 has
caused much trouble, but'recent experi
ments show that it is possiblerby the
use of the electric current Itself, to
raise the temperature of rails twenty
degrees in twelve 'or fifteen minutes.
Is expense to be measured against
human life? If railway companies
could barely maintain themselves at
their present equipment patience with
wrecks might be a virtue, but when
the earnings made from the public are
taken to pay dividends 5 on watered
stock and to provide enormous for
tunes for railroad owners the plea of
commercialism is an affront to com
mon humanity.â Kansas City Stan:;!
THANKSGIVING DAY â Old Sub
scriber, City. Setting aside a day for
special thanks in the United States
dates back to the days of the Plym
outh colony in 1621. In 1TS9 Pres
ident Washington appointed a day of
thanksgiving for the adoption of the
Federal constitution. Subsequently
various days November were rec
ommended by "Presidents and Govern
ors, until" in the third year of the Civil
"War, under President Lincoln, the ob
servance of a regular Thanksgiving
day began, the proclamation by the
President being supplemented gener
ally by one from the Governor of each
State and the fixing by custom of the
last Thursday in November as the day.
Rogers lost his fishing outfit, but the
County , Commissioners will give him
52 for the wildcat's scalp. \
. Rogers tried to paddle away, but the
cat caught the boat and began to
climb in. "Bill" knocked the animal on
the head with the paddle and the 1
movement capsized the boat. Then'
there was a sjuvage battle - in the
water. .
The fisherman defended himself so
Â¦well with the paddle that he was able^
to reach the shore. The wildcat fol
lowed., but a few well directed blows
finished it. *
"Bill" Rogers while bass fishing in
the Susquehanna River recently saw
a wildcat swimming across -the stream
in front of him.
Rogers cast a line toward the ani
mal. The hook caught in the cat's ear
and It at once turned and swam toward
the boat.
HOOKS -/WILDCAT.
THE concerted action of Berkeley's several promotion clubs
seems to assi:re the speedy issue of bonds for municipal im
provements in the college city. To further the bond campaign
steps are already being taken to unite the different civic societies
into a progress federation so. that systematic work in favor of the
projected improvements may be prosecuted.
This is a commendable spirit on the part of the enthusiastic
Berkeleyans. Town spirit has never been lacking 'in the suburb
across the bay, as its miles of macadamized streets and its excellent
sewer system attest. With the beautiful university campus in the
very^ heart- of the community there is every incentive to make thu
rest of the town commensurate in attractiveness. To this end tree
plantings by two of the college town's women's clubs, the efforts
of individuals in making beautiful the environs of their homes, and
the liberal policy of the town board have all contributed in generous
measure. Berkeley to-day has every right to be proud of. its
appearance.
Two much needed improvements, however, call imperatively for
immediate institution â an adequate police force and fire department
are sadly needed. A month does not go by but what the residents
of Berkeley are forcibly reminded of these two deficient factors of
the town's, protection. Not long, ago the town hall was totally de
stroyed by fire from a blaze that started in the upper stories and
gradually ate its way to the foundations against the feeble efforts
of hose streams, which had no pressure save that of the water mains
themselves. Xot long since "a large manufacturing plant near the
bav shore was totallv destroyed because of .the same deficiencv.

it's becoming rather monotonous for

HEARD AT THE ZOO.
OLD Liberty Bell, after being stared at by admiring thousands
of eyes and poked at by an equal numbef of canes and
umbrellas, has been returned from the St. Louis Exposition
to its resting place in Independence Hall, there to remain until the
ladies' church fair at Bird Center or the semi-centennial exposition
at Weehawken-on-Hudson requires its presence. Then the precious
relic will be crated and battened down to a flat car and sent skim
ming across the country with a beribboned guard of honor in
attendance. May the fates grant that it will ride light.
It is to be hoped that in the near future a more conservative
sentiment will arise concerning the migrations of the Liberty Bell.
This making of an object of patriotic sentiment a pin-a-poppy show
with the advent of every international exposition held in America
tends to cheapen the sacred sentiment that tradition has invested
in it, besides laying it exposed to imminent destruction by a wreck
on the rails. When young America can stop on his way to the
catch-pennies of the midwav or the pike to view for one hurried
instant the bell that proclaimed liberty to the land he will probably
reckon the loop-the-loop or the hula dance that subsequently glad
dens his eyes much the better attraction.
Independence Hall, fondly known as "the cradle of liberty," is
likewise the only logical cradle for old Liberty Bell in its honored
age. Separated from the environs where once it spelt in brasen
measures the story of American liberty, the ancient relic loses the
dignity of association and becomes for the time being very near
old junk. In Independence Hall it belongs and there it should re
main, the object of reverent pilgrimage and not possible fair mate-

The staples exhibit increasing activity. Woolen mills arc
active, and the only complaint in this line is the scarcity of raw
wool, which continues in brisk demand and firm. New England
reports an active demand for footwear, and the iron and steel in
dustries are gaining strength. Other metais are strong, with slight
advances in copper, lead and tin. Cotton manufactures, while in
good movement, lack snap at the moment, and the mills are not
overburdened with rush orders. Provisions continue quiet at all
Western centers, with the packers operating languidly in the specu
lative markets. Hides and leather are still active and firm. The
railroads are doing such a lively business that they have not sufficient
cars to handle all the freight tendered them, and complaints of car
shortage arc heard from all over the country, while the earnings of
the roads are 6 per cent over iast year's gross returns. A fine sign
of the times is the continued activity in building all over the coun
try, the increase in October over the same month in 1903 being
1374 buildings, with an increased valuation of $6450,000. Were
there cars enough to transport all the lumber needed even this in
crease over i'/>3 would have been largely swelled.
The above represents the condition of trade throughout the
country. It will be seen that it is highly gratifying and that pros
perity still smiles on the land.
The disposition to call a halt on the continued rise in .stocks
seems to be.j^rowirig. Many conservative and powerful financial in
terests have come to the conclusion that stocks are about as high
as they ought to be and are therefore inclined to check any further
advance, but they are opposed by equally powerful interests, who are
still cm the bull side of the market, hence the feeling in regard to
stocks is no longerhinanimous as it was for several months, and the
diversity of opinion leads to counter operations and unsettles the
market. This condition is likely to prevail for some time, and its
outcome is a matter of considerable conjecture at the moment.
The condriion of general trade continues very satisfactory and
all parts of the country are sending in cheerful reports. Unseason
ably mild weather aga^in has caused some check to the demand for
winter goods, and the unwillingness of farmers to part with their pro
duce has interfered with collections in some Southern sections, but as
a generality the recent expansion in business is maintained. Labor
is better employed than at this time last year, hitherto idle mills are
resuming one after another to meet the increased demand for manu
factured goods, and the foreign exports for the week exceeded those
for the same week in 1903 by $2432,000. while the imports were also
Si. 533.000 larger, showing a general expansion in our foreign com

'.vas small and confined to a day or so. it caused but a transient
ripple on the &nancial pool. Russell Sage contributed largely to
the rise by suddenly calling in some millions of loans, which took
away the Wall strccf breath for a few hours, sent the borrowers
skurrying for cash and broke the stock market for a session or two,
b'Jt the market almost immediately recovered its balance and went
sailing gayly along again. Sage made a neat little turn out of his
coup by making fresh ioans after his call had advanced the interest
rates and showed the street that although a very old man of .over
eighty the old gentleman had a good deal of snap in him still.

T AST week was another excellent one in trade, but the volume
I of business was hardly up to that of the preceding week, which
was a record breaker. The country's bank clearings showed a
gain, of 55.1 per cent over the corresponding week in 1903, with a
remarkable gain of 82.6 per cent at New York and large expansions
at Boston. Baltimore. Philadelphia. Pittsburg and other large cities
and with onlv two cities â St. Louis and Providenceâ out of the
twenty leading centers showing a loss. The clearings themselves
amounted to over S2.500.ooo.ooo, against an average" of $2.ooo.coo,

PROSPERITY STILL WITH US.
Both men and women clln* to their
Ideals In love almost as tenaciously as
they do to life itself. But there is a
difference in the attitudes they main
tain toward the gods they worship.
To a man it Is the ideal which he
has of womanhood that matters. In
the beginning his love is invariably a
selfish proposition, though it may grow
in grace as the years pass by. He ex
pects that the girl whom he has chosen
will conform to his requirements for
her, and if she fails to do so he comes
before long to feel that she Is not the
girl for him.
A woman, on the 'other hand. Is stead
fast to her Ideal of the man whom sht
loves. Heloise. in her devotion to
Abelard. offers a historic eiamde of
the self-abnegation which a grreat love
means to a woman. Every letter that
she wrote to the man who ruined her
life by the cold selfishness of his con
duct rings with a passionate unwill
ingness to blame him in any way for
the unhappinees which shut out for her
all the beauty of earthly hope.
One feels In reading the letters that,
were her Idol to fall from Its niche
above her, It would crush her kneeline
before it.
"Men are not like women, who. when
they love, give themselves ud to their
feelings," comments Mantegrazza. the
Italian professor of psychology, who
has made love hie especial study. "Men
love much as they eat or drink or walk.
With them love is merely one side of
life, It is not life itself,"
She realizes that she looks much
more attractive when well groomed for
the street, or society, than she docs
early In the morning In the privacy of
her boudoir. <
She knows her fault3; no one else on
earth knows them so well; and she
learns to take compliments on her an
gelic temper with a pinch of salt, as
delicacies pleasant to the palate, but
too rich for the digestion.
Therefore, she tries consciously to
keep the love which she has gained, if
it means anything at all to her. She
seeks tÂ« make herself necessary to the
man whom she lores. She tries to cut
his Ideal of womanhood into visible,
tangible form. She accepts her lover's
preferences as her best guide in mat
ters of conduct. She adjusts herself to
him mentally so far as she is able. And
she strives to be. morally and spiritu
ally, an inspiration.
A girl" who has common sense appre
ciates that she is not really a queen,
though men of her acquaintance may
have told her so. She comprehends
that her personal charms, while suffi
ciently great, perhaps, to distinguish
her from the crowd, would not de
servedly win her rank at a beauty
show.
LOVE resembles other more material
forms of riches in btine easier to
get than to keep. The situation
is exactly as the author of -Love
Affairs of Some Famous Men" has
stated it: "Dove at first eleht is
easy enough; what a girl wants is a
man who can love her when he sees
her every day."
Any good looking girl, who has that
indescribable attribute called stvle. can
go as a stranger to a town of medium
size, and in an incredibly short time
have many of the young men of the
place enamored of her charms. The at
traction of- "the new girl in town" Is
worthy of a proverb. To retain the
devotion which she has Inspired is an
other story. Accomplishment of this
i requires spirit Â«md delicacy of art; but,
more than either, are purity of mind
and purpose indispensable.
The witticism which declared the
average taxpayer no more capable of a
grand passion than of a grand opera
may be as' just as it Is ciever. but this
; Individual, as we see him in America, is
conspicuously a manly man. and his
love for woman is a manly love. Fem
inine lightness may catch his fancy,
but it takes the wholesomeness Tof an
, upright womanhood tr> hold it.

Stung by their taunts, he bet heavily
that the little actress would jrive him a
kiss before the boat dropped down the
the postofflce and generaV store? Her
disdain had been noted by the town
people and. with the memory of their
poker losses still fresh, they were dis
posed to twit him upon his lacii of suc
cess.
They were about thirty miles below
Vicksburg. and Branscome had about
decided to let Burrowes go, no matter
what the consequences, when fate
solved the problem for him. It was
their custom to tie up at a town for
several days, avoiding the cities where
there were permanent theaters. The
company could then play to a profit
three or four nights.
At this particular landing a profes
sional gambler had been drivine a brisk
business, and, with well-lined Dockets,
sought to attract Miss Montaeues at

rice began to weigh the doirn-boats.
and money was plentiful.
Branscome would; gladly have dis
charged Burrowes to save Blanche, but
Burrowes had an ironclad two years'
contract without ,a canceline clause.
Usually two weeks' notice might be giv
en on either side, and Branscome
groaned when he remembered that it
was he. thinking only of the leadinsr
man's popularity, who had ureedâ and
finally had carriedâ the omission of tie
cancellation clause. * "
Branscome strove to win Blanche's
confidence,* with the result that she
cultivated Burrowes all the more as
siduously.
Meanwhile Miss Montague showed a
preference for the society of the leading
man, Jim Burrowes. and Branscome
passed sleepless nights wonderinc how
he could warn her of the actor's real
character without making it appear
that jealousy was the motive of his
remonstrance.
As for Miss Montague, the philos
ophy of life was summed up in the
quotation. "Men were deceivers ever,"
and she had heard that the "Nancy
B." was named after Branscome's
wife. Somehow she could not* help
being attracted to the big-hearted,
out-spoken giant, but there ever rank
led the memory of his letterâ the only
love letter he had ever writtenâ and
the side comments of the players
about his wife. They had come almost
slmultanenously. k>^
Branscome soon" saw that his at
tentions were unwelcome, and. being
at heart a gentleman, he desisted from
any further attempt to woo her. He
had no idea of the rumor that the
boat was named after his wife, and,
being keenly aware of his lack of pol
ish, he supposed that his rejection was
due to this cause.
Being a strict disciplinarian. Brans
come gave no outward evidence of
his love, and none of the company,
with thÂ» exception of Miss Montague,
whose real name was Blanche Blake,
ever dreamed thai the hard-hearted,
brusque .manager had fallen a victim

During Saturday, evening Mrs. Bair
and Miss Easton had dined at a
downtown restaurant and after mid
night the men of their party sum
moned a coupe from the United Car
riage Company to take the ladies
home, as . it was raining heavily.
Driver Charles Harding turned down
II street toward Ninth avenue andVhls
vehicle made poor progress over the
street, which has recently been torn
up. When he reached^Ninth avenue
and Hs street an electric" car overtook
him and. according to the officials of
the United Railroads, he turned sud
denly in front of the car, which was
moving at a rapid riite.
In an instant coupe, horses, passen
gers and car were mixed in indescrib
able confusion. Harding was thrown
from his seat: he. struck, on his side
some distance ahead of the wreck.
Miss Easton and' Mrs. Bair saw their
danger and attempted to get out of
the coupe just before'the collision oc
curred, but they moved too , slowly.
Miss Easton was thrown under the
coupe and the debris o.f^ the wreck
was piled about her. She had a re
markable escape. Mrs.. Bair was
caught in the coupe, 'thrown violently
against the side of the vehicle and
bruised and cut about the head and
hands. No one. was injured on the
car. The horse that was killed was
struck down in front of the car and
caught in such a menner as to have
his feet under the forward wheels and
his body crushed by the fore end of
the conveyance.
Harding was removed to the Park
IKspita). where injuries were
treated. The frightened and bruisd
women .were sent home in a hack.
The United Railroads officials say
Â¦ that it ' was an unusual route that
Harding chose when he drove to the

Bair and Miss Easton are at the home
of the former, 1283 Tenth av-jnue,
and Harding is resting at his room,
792 Grove street, somewhat the worse
for his experience, but not very badly
damaged. /
One of the horses was killed in the
collision and it is a marvel that the
two women and the driver were not
killed outright or. maimed for life.
Harding, was the most seriously in
jured. He suffers from contusions of
the back and hip. He was treated

VENERABLE POET OF THE WOODS. WHO DISCUSSES THE PREVENTION OF FOREST FIRES.
All California was In consternation
lately to learn that the great State
Redwood Park. only, lately acquired,
â¢was on fire. Some said "campers,"
some said "hunters," some said
"spontaneous combustion." No one
can say or ever will know. Stanford
students turned out by scores as fire
fighters. The State spent $50,000 try
ing to put the fire out, but it had its
own way and stopped only when it
was ready. It' was consuming the
debris of twenty-five years. : If this
stuff had been burned up in spots and
by spells no harm at all would have
been dene to the great sequoias. Even
as it was, I am told by students who
IX REDWOOD PARK.
But burn the first brown spot that ap
pears and burn about sundown, when
the wind is still; burn and keen burn
ing till you have the rank and file of
your wild growth broken; and above
all, kftp an eye on, the public road
and that young man with an old gun
and a box of cigarettes who is hunting
his way to the penitentiary.
And yet it should be frankly said that
forests are not always set on fire by
foolish hunters or anybody else. As
you steam down the Yukon River dur
ing: sultry August you see mountains
on fire right and left, away uu where
foot of man has never trod. May be
tall dead gopher trees have had their
tops whipped together in the wind till
fire was made by friction, as an Indian
makes it, or may be decaying pins and
needles, at their roots .have spontane
ously ignited in the tremendous heat
of the overhanging sun.
Fortunately our season of danger is
short in any part of the State: some
places longer and greater than others,
but all at some time in peril, as you see
by the furrows and the fire Hne3 drawn
around the stacks and ricks in the
lk*!ds. It is likely if there had been u
better way to ward against fire my fel
low grangers would have found it out
by this time. Our farms and orchards
and great national parks are only hay
stacks of greater dimensions. For the
life of me I can see no other way to
pet ready foj* the fires that will surely
come, sooner or later: cattle, sheop.
horses, anything that will subdue the
wild growth of this generous soil. If
you have not these, or if the grasses
get ahead ot'the stock, then. burn.
Of course this hillside is only a little
spot on the map. But I happen to know
that the mighty forests of Mount Shas
ta owed their/ existence and preserva
tion to careful old Indian squaws. Un
derstand, they did not burn everything,
nor was' all burned at one time. The
head of McCloud River is a series of
warm springs. Here were dense thick
ets of vine maple for elk to winter in:
there were also preserves * for bear,
deer and so on. But this was long.
lor\s ago. The burned stumps of to
day are not of their doing. '.?
I for use. When the county is done !
i with it the man who gave it has it '
back again. The saucy young nimrod
has no more right to build a fire in the
public road than to build it. in my'
barnyard./
Now, I 'do not say that all foolish |
young hunters are bad at heart; but I \
do say that they are all too reckless |
and ignorant to be at large with such ,
risks. Why, if I should go to San j
Francisco and deport myself as these \
youngsters do I would be in jail in less j
than two hours. And the oldo> - men i
are not blameless. And the press of j
the State is far from blameless. For i
instance, a story went the rounds late- |
ly of a big club man shooting a deer .
across the public road and then rush- ;
ing to .the nearest Justice of r?he Peace, j
making a charge against himself, pay- i
ing a fine of five dollars and then tak- !
ing his game into camp in great tri- j
umph. It is not to the point to tell
how the deer turned out to be an old
farmer's pet. It proves, however, that
a clubman may not only shoot across
the road, but shoot from it and defy
the law for a pittance. And the press
has no word of rebuke. The man in the
country has no rights which the citv,
man respects, it is little wonder that
the fanners of Mendocino wanted to
Jiang some men lately for starting fires
Jn order to drive deer from cover. I
think if the press would help us grang
ers to make known the law and hold
it in respect we would have feiver great
losses by fire. Xov; here are two laws
that are broken all to bits every Sun
day all along the way from my door
yard down to the cars; here are the
two most frequent and disturbing vio
lations of law, for it is forbidden: (1)
To shoot meadow larks; (2) to shoot
on inclosed lard without permission.
The '"hunters" not only shoot from
the road, but across thÂ»Â» road and their
game, if any, is the dear little meadow
lark; and their answer generally is. if
you take the trouble* to ask them off:
your grounds: "Why, where are your
notices?"
THE INDIAN" Â¦ METHOD.
But with all precaution possible, as
in your city, we can only lessen our
care and our losses. The auestion
asked me is: "Shall we follow the
Indian method, as described bv an
Englishman in one of the oldest books
on America in the British Museum, or
shall we let the forest take care of it
self?' My answer is special rather than
general, for I have a special spot of
ground and have managed to plant,
and preserve by the Indian method, a
forest that can be seen afar.
An enterprising company holding
thousands of acres and on all eides of
me has planted about 200.000 trees this
last season. They have lost a few thou
sand young trees by fire. . The trees
were left entirely to nature, with the
grounds carefully guarded. I am afraUl
they will never be able to cover the
Contra Costa foothills, as is their most
laudable design, till they keep the
grasses subdued, cither by stock or fire.
To illustrate: the old Governor Low â or
McGecâ place grew some beautiful
groves all right for more than a dozen
years by leaving them to nature. But
only last month they all went up in
Brooke.
LÂ«t tne call attention to the fact that
fvery one of our great- fires in this
:r.fÂ»Ft disastrous year in the coast's n'la
ir>ry was fed by debris. The pla'n
truth \s there can be no great hres if
ve have small ones. I do not know
â¢-hat there are advocates of Indian Â«r
f.rti-Ind;en methods. I Fhould say It
it mostly a matter of carelessness or
iriiiffereuce. When there has not been
it fire for ten or twenty years ve are
not >:Â¦ :.-.k to bother much about It fn
irrip FpaiÂ«Â«ely-settled and busy coun
try. 1~he. only real worker 1 in this line
:? the railroad. Look out of the oais
for thousands of miles and you %\ill
e?e that the grass has been burned o
fViP emu? plowed. If there is o. bet
ter m<=;rod the learned engine :rs of
this ti lion investment should practice
Â». turtly.
As for the burning up of small tieca
cne should know that nature is most
generous here. A thousand little trees
art panted to one that perfects: Look
along the railroad trenches above the
Cpe line and you will see little pine
tiWkets that a bear couldn't get
through. A dozen years later end nine
<".v of ten are dead. Twenty years
later and not one in a hundred lives.
Hig trees, like big men, must grow
Â¦wide apartâ the survival of the fittest
â or tightest.
"There is one thing that no man is
ever quite prepared for. and them is
twins!"
No man is ever quite prepared for
Â» :th>=-r fire or its twin-destroyer, flood.
They truly come as a thief in the
iiitrht. It would seem that njan, with
tu his ingenuity and great numbers.
Â¦should be able to defeat ,the great fires
of ''hicago. Boston, Baltimore and so
"n. Rut they come right along at al
most regular periods. And if trained
urn in millions can't conquer ifires in
the great cities how can we expect the
thinly settled country with no disci
pline or appliances to do so?
The best that can be done, it seems
to me. is to set a few plain facts be
fore the people and urge them through |
the press to constant care durin? the j
riry jrraes season. For our fires, unlike \
th'ise of Michigan. Wisconsin and likÂ» '
lumber regions, are not forest fires to i
begin with We have but little forest
on the level, as those States have. Our
trees are on the mountains and arÂ«Â»
rearh<r<5. as a rule, by grass fires that
tiffin in the valley. When we have
m^re stock on the foothills it will be
better.
The Swiss start thpir dairy cattle up
the foothills early and kepp climbing
snt < limbing till the <>nd Â«>f the season,
â¢wh^n the cold drives th^m back home
vith th* cattle laden with chsese. They
r>Â«"ver have fires, because they leave
n-'thirg for the fire to feed upon. H^nce
I advise the use of fire. aftÂ«Â»r the In
dian fashion, in places where the grass
Is too luxuriant. Of course, as Mr.
Furling says, it is dangerous work.
Few men have the pat'ence and the
fine sense of nature that an Indian
voman has, and if ignorant and irre
sponsible strangers, knowing litti<j
about the work. Fhould be set to burn
grass, only trouble could come of it.
BIRMNT, THE GRASS.
I have, in the last eignteen years,
planted about twenty thousand trees
on my hills here and have succeeded In
preserving some hundred redwood trees
rf th^ F*'-<>n-J gr<>y,*h in my canyon. I j
could not have donf this without burn
ing the grass as fa<u as it ripened so
as to be fit to burn. I of course kept
â¢â¢^ttle on my grass ail the time, but
mine is a roujrh bit of ground and
there is always a spot here snd there
that escapes the cattle. This has to
bÂ«> burned. I also burn the publir road
when it can be burned. A public road
should he a good fire lin*\ a wall
against tho fires of careless neighbors:
bat as thf country could hardly afford
to plow or mow the ground I try to dis
pose of the dry grass myself.
The generous eoil of Lake County I
noticed only last year sends up a
growth of vine?, moss and grasses that
leaved hardly room for the stage to
pass. This year all that part of the
State is in mourning. Had the pub
lic roads '>eon ko:H clf-an the chances
are that the millions that went ud in
smoke this year in the northern coun
ties would have bern spared to us.
And now one word about -the men
â¢who use the public highways. At the
most critical season v;f the year hun
dreds of smart and ignorant' j-ounp
men rÂ»our out of the cities into the
foothills and mountains. And every
one has a gun, generally some old
style that loads with a "wad"; this
wad is the very thing to fire the grass. !
Or if the noisy young "hunter" does |
not gtart a fire with his old s^in he \
camps by the wayside and leaves thej
embers of his campflre to the winds, j
All such creatures eeern to think the,

Land should Be Carefully Burnt Over Where Not Kept Clean by Livestock
'T'HIS forceful plea for the prevention of forest
1 fires is made by Joaquin Miller. The veteran
lover of the woods tells his own experience in start
ing a yoang forest, which he has saved from destruc-
*
tion by burning the dry grass and undergrowth.
This was the method of the Indians in the old days,
he declares, and to it California owes her great for
ests of to-day. It must be followed wherever live
stock fails to keep down the grass, which the care
less hunter is ever ready to set on fire.

The hulk of the barkentine Quickstep, with
her 500.000 feet of lumber, is In all probability
still floating around the waters of the Pacific,
off Rogue River, a menace to all shipping pass
ing In that locality. So far as could be learned
yesterday; no efforts had been made by those
interested in her to send a tug to her assist
ance or to remove her from a path where she
is liable to obstruct navigation. Why a reve
nue cutter had not been sent to look up the
derelict could not be learned. - < '
Xo Xcws of Quickstep.
The Tottenham was from Samarang.
Java. She brought a cargo of 5000 tons
of raw sugar.
All the lighter upper works were
either swept overboard or badly
smashed up. The steamer at times was
at the mercy of the waves, and was
tossed about like a cockleshell. Every
officer of the ship was on constant
watch for days. The storm continued
all the way down the Alaskan coast, as
far as the Queen Charlotte Islands.
The British steamship Tottenham ar
rived at Victoria, B. C, on Saturday
on her way to Y-ancouver.
According to Captain Peters 1 reports,
it is a miracle that she did not succumb
to the terrible storms she encountered.
Captain Peters says that In all his
thirty-five years of seafaring, he has
never experienced such weather as the
vessel passed through near the Aleu
tian Islands in the early part of No
vember. He states that the fury of the
seemingly endless storm exceeded in
violence the typhoon of the China seas
or the hurrieqries of the West Indies.
Puring the height of the gale, although
the vessel" was steaming full speed
ahead, she could hardly make steerage x
way. Great volumes of water pounded
on her- decks, and mountainous seas
continuously swept over her. It seemed
at times as if the gfeat masses of water
that poured, over her wouldsmash her
to pieces- Everything movable was
carried away., .
British Ste.afnship Tottenham. Has

It is 'sincerely to be regretted that
Mrs. Malcolm Henry is indisposed, and
will probably not figure among the hos
tesses. Last winter she was a valiant
aid to her mother, Mrs. Voorhles, as
was Mrs. Thomas Porter Bishop and
Miss Voorhies.
The patronesses are as follows: Mrs.
Alfred Hunter Voorhles, Mrs. James
Potter Langhorne, Mrs. Eleanor Mar
tin. Mrs. Bowman H. McCalla, Mrs.
William A. McKittrick, Mrs- William
F. -Herrin, Mrs. Francis J. Sullivan and
Mrs. John D. Spreckels.
All things prompt the prediction that
the first Assembly will eclipse any of
its affairs of last winter, as -'tis moot
ed abroad that a splendid assortment
of dancing men â darlings of the gods â
are to be present to gladden the hearts
of the maids.
The welkin will ring with gladness,
for every maid who has curtsied to so
ciety this winter will wrap her charm-
Ing little selfâ or bigâ into yards of ele
gance and expectation, and be whisked
off to the Palace. There's always a dis
tinction about the first balls of the sea
son, and the reasons therefor are two
foldâthe maidens are not yet wearied
nor satiated, and their frocks are fresh
as a daisy-patch In the early morn.
Contrary to expectation, there will be
a few dinners preliminary to the dance,
notably the Sabin affair; but as the
ball is an early "stunt," being called
promptly at nine, these little affairs
are relegated to memory. And the
gods be thanked! For a crumpled
frock and a pinkish complexion from
the strenuosities of a dinner are not
conducive to ballroom charm.
Behold, to-night the first Assembly
cometh! â and with it cometh much
Joy!. . .

tance. Among the witnesses was a

reputation easily withstood the fact
that on" occasion his habits took a con
vivial turfc. -,111s evidence [had. been; of
considerable value to the prosecution
and counsel for the .defense was en
deavoring to discredit the testimony.
"Now, doctor," said thV lawyer, "were
you ever drunk?" Â¦ The handsome-look
ing physician sat bolt upright as he an
swered: â¢ "Certainly not, sir." Then
he added gravely, though with a de
cided twinkle In his eye: "I have, how
ever/ on more than one -ocra^ion been
profoundly alcoholized." The Jury

The beneficial effects of bacteria are
r\fi less interesting than the part they
play in the propagation of disease, and
a recent discovery, is that the vegeta
ble gums found on trees, such as a gum
arable, are the results of their ac
tivity.. Previous to some investigations
by Dr. S. Greig Smith of New South
Wales, It was believed that vegetable
fc'.ima were the result of the unhealthy
, or pathological conditions of the trees
on which they formed, but the entire
subject was one about which compar
atively little ' was known. Dr. Smith,
believing that bacteria produced the
gum, examined two trees from which
It exuded, and obtained two varieties
of bacteria, of which he made cultures.
Under ordinary, conditions of culture
the . formation of gum' was only sug
gested, but when tannin, a constituent
of bark, was added to the culture me
dium, a thick slime was produced in
considerable quantities. This slime was
made up of gum, a3 well as bacterial
cells and albuminoids, and by a simple
chemical process a clear, transparent
and brittle gum was obtained similar
to the arabin- derived from gum arable,
and. resembling in its essential.proper
ties the naturalfsubstance.' Dr: Smith's
conclusion was that the arabin gums
derived from trees arej bacterial and
not higher plant products, and that cer
tain constituents of the sap, under the
action of the bacteria, are changed Into
gum,, which exudes from cracks or
wounds in the bark, /or else Is carried
by the. sap to the fruit. âHarper's

George Nethercott's. greyhound
proved the class of the stake at Union
Coursing P*rk yesterday, winning the
deciding course with ease. In this she
met Reckless Acrobat and .was in
stalled a 1 to 15 choice. Â¦
The winner made all her trials short
ones,.rurinim; but 121 seconds throuch
out the day. Reckless Acrobat was not
so fortunate, running a total of 318
seconds.
There were a number of decided ud
sejs. Frisky Barbara defeated Texas
Mamie at 7 to 1; Van Nora beat Red
Rock at 5' to 1; Panoche beat Rocked
A'Sleep at 4 to 1, and Runaway Actress
beat Hudson at the same price. The
day's results:
Eddig Santry and Jack Cordell will
fight ten rounds to-morrow night and
there will also be a short curtain
raiser, so there wil be plenty of action.
Galley seats will be $2. There will be
a lot of 53 seats. The highest priced
seats will be ?10. The management
promises fighting and not vaudeville,
aÂ«? the Gans affair turned out to b,e.
Battling Nelson spent a strenuous
time at his training quarters at Smil
ing Metzner's tavern, Larkspur. He
was, out at daylight and hit the high
places on the Marin rpads for fourteen
miles. A brisk rubdoWn followed. .In
the afternoon many sporting men
visited the camp. â¢ By the time Nelson
started to work standing room was at
a premium and many spectators wj?re
turned away. Nelson wont through
5Js usual gymnasium stunts- and also
oxed four fast rounds with Eddie
Santry. The visitors were all " im
pressed at the improvement in boxing
shown by Nelson. . He says he is In
fine condition and hopes to be de
clared a winner; in about fourteen
rounds.
Sheehan's Tavern, was thronged with
visitors yesterday. At times the doors
had to be barred against multitudes
anxious to get a glimpse of the Den
verite. Corbett does not underesti
mate his adversary. Neither does
Harry Tuthiil. "Corbett has worked
hard for this fight," said his handler.
"N-elson will know he haa been in a
little trouble, win or lose. It "will! be
a fight, you can bank on that. Both
boys are honest and will go some."
â¢ Among the celebrities who paid
their respects to the camp were Harry
Corbett and Billy Jordan, the Ned.
Greenway of the squared circle. ,The
veteran announcer said he never saw
a fighter so fit as Corbett looked yes
terday.
Young Corbett and Battling Nelson
have practically completed their train
ing for to-morrow night's contest in
Woodwards' Pavilion before the Hayes
Valley Club. A desperate encounter
seems inevitable, as Corbett is anxious
to win quickly, while Nelson expresses
confidence in his ability to go at any
pace Corbett may elect to set.
Nelson boxed fqur fast rounds with
Eddie Santry yesterday, but Corbett
took to the road both morning and
afternoon. The weight question is ap
parently worrying the Corbett camp.
Trainer Harry Tuthiil says his man
will be comfortably inside the required
notch to-night. - The Denverite will
take things easy to-day. He may tear
on* a few miles of the dusty pike, but
he will do no heavy grind.
The men who will be in Corbett's
ccrner when the gong sounds to-mor
row night were decided upon yester
day. They are: Frank McDonald, Billy
Otts, Benny Garson and Harry Tut

The Alameda German comedy play
ers presented "Grossstadtluft" (city
manners) at the Columbia last night
to a large audience. Throughout the
dainty little comedy was well enacted.
Otto Rauchfuss, as Martin Schroter,
made a big hit. Etta Eiben was very
pretty and fetching as Sabine, and
Bruno Burkhardt was thoroughly up
to-date in the leading role of Fritz
Flemmlng. . . i
The first nlghters at the Orpheum
wore out their glove$ last night wel
coming this week's bill. Rosner, the
leader of the famous Hungarian
orchestra, sprang a lightning hair
growing stunt on the Tyce and Jer
mon team that plunged the house Into
a sea of gigeles. The "Awakening of
the Toys" skiOmore than made good
and the Josselyn Trio's "Pictures In
the Air" created a startling effect.
"Finnlgan's Ball," with its Hibernian
comedians, pretty girls, and catchy
songs was greeted at the California
Theater last night. The audience
seemed glad to see Â¦ the old favorite
back again and the result was a volley,
of applause after each song, dance or
joke that made a hit, and there were
many. Edward F. Gallagher and J.
J. Barrett, two San Francisco boys who
perform in the leading roles, were met
with a bunch of floral offerings and
cries of welcome as soon as they
stepped upon the stage. Their work
in the comedy roles was high class and
each had a number of new jokes to
unload In rapid-fire order. They re
ceived good support from the balance
of the company. The specialties Intro
duced were exceedingly clever, especial
ly the Indian dance in the second act-
The chorus, though small, Is away
above the ordinary and makes up for
its lack in numbers by its unity. The
show will continue for one week.
As usual, Dora de Flllippe as Angela
and Edith Mason as Piola did excellent
musical service, both singing unusually
well. Miss Mason in the white satin
breeks looked scrumptious, and with the
Amazons, headed by Aimee Leicester â
who got a hand all to herself on her
stunning get-upâ aroused no end of en
thusiasm in her song, "The Lad Who
Leads."
Schuster has a good song as Mudge,
the court chamberlain, "Look In the
Book and See," and sings it gallantly.
Teddy Webb does the Dr. Fizz enjoy
ably, and Bessie Tannehill Is a good
Queen Lil. Mr. Stelndorff, the chorus
and orchestra were in fine fettle, and
the production is evidently booked for
a long run.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Certainly Wlllard Slmms has not the
suave, inimitable way ot drawling
through the part that Hitchcock had.
but no one need fear spoiling the Hitch
cock Dodo by seeing the Slmms. It is a
laughable conception, odd, snappy, and
full of drollery. And In a day or so it
will be funnier, as it will be easier â not
that Mr. Slmms 1 performance was not
perfectly smooth and letter perfect. He
has some up-to-date gags In which the
hand of that veteran gagster Ferris
Hartman appears, and his sones are as
usual given with all point and flavor.
The performance was the occasion
also of the debut of a new soprano.
Miss Irene Outtrim. who appeared as
the Annette of the cast. Miss Outtrim
is pleasing, though not remarkable in
any way, dancing lightly and singing
fairly well through her part. As It was
Miss Outtrim's first American appear
ance, however, one iriay safely wait to
judge of her capacities, and meantime
Miss Outtrim was quite favorably re
ceived by her audience.
The production strikes first as a pro
ductidn. It might hav&come In a band
box from New York. 'It is glltteringly
smart, crackles with newness. There
Is nothing 'of the shows of yesterday In
"King Dodo." To a slipper everything
is as handsome, smart and fresh as.it
can be. The scenery, with particular
reference to the first "back drop," a
summer sea with ships and lightly
clouded sky, Is exceptionally pictur
esque. In fact, they have done what
they promised, outdone "The Torea
dor."
One has been given to saying, when
a New York production comes along:
"Oh, yes, the thing is all right now,
but wait till the stock companies get
hold of it. It is likely we said the same
about "King Dodo." Chiefly one would
be thinking about Raymond Hitchcock
a^ the king when we said it. That,
however, was before Mr. Slmms came
to the Tivoli.
He would have been rash who two
years ago would have said that the
Tivoli would rival a Henry Savage pro
duction. " Last night they so did, how
ever, in their production of "King Do
do." The two thousand strong that
gathered at the theater evidently ex
pected it. The opera made many friends
when Mr. Savage presented it here with
Raymond Hitchcock. . The songs stay
ed here â half the house might have
been caught humming the "Tale of the
Bumble Bee" last nightâ the ensemble
music left attractive memories and the
story aroused piquant reminiscence.
It is not another "Burgomaster," per
haps, but PIpely and Luders offer thor
oughly enjoyable entertainment In
"King Dodo." Last night there was a
man to every seat in the house â and
more â to make and renew acquaintance
with the opera and they all seemed
glad to be there. Â¦

must lend our ear to the serious
things that are concerning the
thoughtful-minded. These are things
that count. .
The League of California Munici
palities, which met In Santa. Cruz for
purposes of civic improvement, heark
ened unto the pleadings of the Cali
fornia clubwomen (led by Mrs. Syd
ney S. Palmer) in behalf of a State
tubercular hospital. The following
resolutions were adopted by the
league:
Whereas. It has long been the sense of the
California Club that State and municipal laws
should be enacted whereby the spread of tuber
culosis in all Its forms may be prevented and
whereby there shall be inaugurated a system
atic education of the public in the care, treat
ment and prevention of the disease, and where
by State or municipal sanatorlums shall be es
tablished for the cara and treatment of pul
monary tuberculosis; and.
Whereas. The California Club Is now pre
paring a bill carrying a reasonable appropria
tion for the above named purposes to be Intro
duced in the California State Legislature dur
ing it* coming session; be it
â¢ Resolved, v That the League of California
Municipalities, now in convention at Santa
Ana, CaL, November. 1904, does hereby hearti
ly Indorse such proposed action of the Cali
fornia Club and furthermore that it will aid
that organization in all possible ways to enact
such laws.
In line with the blessed spirit of
feminine good fellowship is the merry
Cap and Bells Club, Mrs. W. P. Buck
ingham president. . Â» '
ThÂ» club foregathered on Friday at
the SoVosis Club^rooms, where a fam
ously good programme was projected,
as follows:
Wit and humor by members; vocal selection,
"Russian Romance." Mrs. Paraskera Greersky;
reading. "The Picture on the Barroom Floor."
Mrs. Celine Straus; vocal selections, (a) "A
Splendltto Notte." from "King Mars" (Gou

C. Driffield; cello solos, selected. Al W. Nlel
een. Programme under direction of Mrs. S. P.
Blumenbergf.
These Cap and Bells women can tell
a story -with the best of masculine
raconteurs of older growth, and give
a good account of themselves, like
wise of the story. The day has slip
ped Into the dim gray past when
women tell a story with the climax
first Therefore were these Cap and
Bells tales well worth the hearing.
Who shall say but that the next
crop of clubwomen may give us a
feminine Chauncey Depew?
That was a famous day â Saturday.
What a gay assemblage gathered at the
Papyrus' bidding! Surely Mrs. C. Ma
son Kinne and her kindred spirits
must have been glad of heart. As
suredly, their, guests were, among
whom were a goodly number of men â
bless them!
The gowns were smart, the decora
tions striking, the punch superb â
what more could be asked? And, by
the way, that ruby-red nectar was of
Miss Jenne Morrow Long's brewing,
and a past master is she in the decad
ent art.
The guests of honor â Mrs. Evelyn
Almond Withrow, Miss Marie With
row and Mme. Francisco â were quite
overwhelmed with s 'tentions, jyhlch
they sufficiently survived to enjoy a
delightful musical programme ren
dered by the Papyrus Quartet and by
Amon C. Cain, with Mrs. Cain accom
panying. 1
Among the ladies to. whom the
splendid success was due are as fol
lows: Mrs. C. Mason Kinne, Mrs. W.
S. Leake. Miss Ella McCloskey. Mrs.
Louise Batles Cooper, Mrs. Henry
Bergstein, Mrs. S. W. Backus, Mrs. W.
W. Briggs, Mrs. W. H. Brown, Mrs.
'Katharine Boynes, Mrs. Samuel Bis
slnger, Mrs. - M. Ferguson, Mme.
Caro Roma, Miss Jenne Morrow Long,
Mrs. Thomas Archer, Miss Anna Had
sell. Mrs. Alfred Gerard, Mrs. Guy S.
Mellberne. Mrs. Blanche King Arnold
and Miss M. Driscoll.
Good fellowship is the mental pro
duct of congenial spirits, who blind
themselves to foibles and note the
good points only. And any club that
makes for good fellowship among
women is doing mankind a noble ser
vice. It makes mothers more patient
and understandable, wives more sym
pathetic and companionable and helps
to break down some of the ridiculous
distinctions of sex.
Said a man who ventured into the
Papyrus Club reception on Saturday:
"I believe the highest purpose of
women's clubs is to amuse and to teach
women to frivol intelligently; to* teach
them to see the glamorous side, as
well as the solemn side of human af
fairs, and to be quicker to laugh than
to weep; to cultivate an interest in
other women and thereby grow to be
more human and sympathetic in their
relations to their families and friends."
Now that chap spoke better than he
knew. "Women do need that sort of
atmosphere â not training, good friend,
but atmosphere.
