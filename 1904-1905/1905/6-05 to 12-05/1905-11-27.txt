VOICE SAYS
"KILL YOUR
BABY GIRL!"
Mrs. de Paoli Hears
Command to Mur
der Child.
Wife of Homicide Plans
to End Life of Her
rt First Born.
Is Overheard Giving Vow
to Demons She Thinks
Infest Her Cell.
~Tbe voice erieÂ« around me all dayâ
the voice of my M*trr-ln-lavÂ«. Urr soul
la <-rj Intr â crying for to Kct Into
btairn. Tltc 'evil e>e* in still after me
What can I dor Tbe voice cries, 'Kill
l.runura, kill your baby srirl!* 1 must
kill her. s-be Is the cod-child of my
joÂ«Â»r, dead atster-in-law. l,Â«inora must
*le so that Catherine's Â»oul may be
trued into heaven.**
In these frantic words Mrs. Virginia' de.
â¢ 'aoll gives voice to the dreadful desire
that holds sway In her dfsordered 'brain.
Alternately she raves and moans and
prays in her cell. It was her- husband
that murdered his sister-in-law last Fri
day morning because she had, as man
and wife both believe, caused the blight
of the "evil eye" to fall upon their home.
But for the vigilance of Policeman John
Kocca the unfortunate mother might
have slain her two-year-old girl, named
Leonora. She had asked that the little
one be brought to her cell. But the po-
Jiceman had heard her utter her awful
prayer and the request was denied.
All day long the unfortunate woman
prayed fervently in her cell at the deten
tion hospital for tbe Insane. She prayed
in Italian, her supplication being offered
for ,the benefit of the soul of the dead
woman who was sent to eternity by her
husband's murderous band.
Hl.Nl)*> lIEBSELF TO EVIL OMS.
The wails of anguish, the fervid prayer
in rapid Italian, brought Policeman
Kocca, who had been dttailed to watch
the woman in the cell. Listening, he
heard tbe expression of Mrs. de Paoli's
dread and bloody purpose. Rocca speaks
Italian fluently, lie heard the prayer, the
fiendieh desire of murde/ spoken and the
frightened cries of his prisoner.
Rocca walked to the cell and peering
through the wicket asked Mrs. de Paoli
Vfeat was the matter. Without answering
him the poor wretch begged him to bring
to her her children. "Bring little Gio
vanni; oh. please bring my little Leonora,
that 1 may just kiss her for a moment."
she cried.
It had been the custom of the authori
ties to allow the woman to see her chil
dren at intervals. She had often pleaded
Fince her incarceration for them. Yester
day they were lo have been taken to see
their mother for a while, but the weath- I
rr prevented. But for the hearing of the
woman's fiendish desire yesterday after
noon by Roera the partly demented wom
an might have eluded the vigilance of the
officers when the children were finally
brought to see her and with one cruel j
blow or a grasp at the child's neck extin
guished the little life of her first born/
"SOUL WILL CRY ALWAYS."
Hearing her request. Rocca. asked her
why she wished to kill the child. The
woman told him that the dead woman
was hÂ«*r baby Leonora's god-mother.
"All day long." she said, "I hear" the
voice crying* to me â crying, oh, so hard
to me. The soul, it Is not in heaven. It
haunts me all the time. If I kill my baby
girl the soul will go to heaven, then my.
husband me and my child will have no
fear of the 'evil eye.*- I would murder my
Laby. yes, gladly kill her. to save the
soul. It cry so. it cry all day. Then Leo
nora must die; yes, baby must be killed.
If the god-child of my dead sister-in-law
is not murdered then the soul will cry to ;
me always. Bring me the child, I want to j
!:i. i :s her." ;
Policeman Rocca afked the woman if
the. wouid not rather give her . life, "" be j
murdered, to save the coal,, than to lose I
the baby. To this the woman, replied j
th;it the, life of her baby girl and" only j
the life of the baby girl would save the ,
* oul Â«>f her dead sister-in-law. "She is
the codchild of my poor stster-ln-law. I
She must die to save the soul- and stop J
the voice crying to me. If I die. then the i
voice 'wilt torment my, husband and the
little boy end it will do no good.".
Rocca notified headquarters, so that the
mother might not be permitted to see the
children, as she would probably carry
out her threat ; of murder. ; Great , carp
will be exercised by the police to prevent
the woman carrying out her plan to mur
der the little girl.

MIST OBSCURES SIGNAL.
Of the dead sixteen' were passengers in
the two rear cars of the Marlborough
train. The other two .were Engineer
Barnard of the Montreal express and his
fireman. No passengers on the express
train were injured. Of those who lost
their lives a number were apparently
killed instantly in the collision, while oth
ers were either burned to death or died
from suffocation. â¢
The^ wreck was primarily due to thick
weather, . which apparently obscured sig
nals set by the forward train, which at
the time of the disaster was standing In
front of Bakers Bridge station. .The
Montreal; train, drawn by two locomo
tives and consisting of nine cars, crashed
into the rear of the Marlborough branch
local, demolishing the two rear cars.
According to the statement of persons
who .were at the depot a brakeman was
sent from the Marlborough branch train
to place a fuse or redflre torch some'dis
tance in the rear. The night was unusu
ally dark, partly owing to a dense mist
The torch had not been set more than a
minute before the' roar of a heavy train
around a curve a short distance east* of
the depot was heard. Within a few sec
onds the headlight of an on-rushing loco
motive showed through the mist, and be
fore a voice could be lifted . to warn the
passengers in the waiting train the two
ponderous engines, traveling at a speed
of thirty-five miles an hour, crashed into
It. The Impact was terrific.
The lcadtng , locomotive "telescoped the
rear car of the Marlborough train and the
second forced this mass against
the .third car of the local and completely
wrecked it In these two cars all, but
two of the â¢ fatalities occurred : arid prac

Montreal train, but ' the~ engine following
although much /damaged, did not leave
the rails. None of the cars of the ex

REFORMS SUGGESTED.
PHILADELPHIA, 'Nov. 26.â Following
the suggestion of President Roosevelt for
uniform eligibility rules in college athlet
ics and for the elimination of unnecessary
roughness, brutality,; and foul play in
football,, the' University, of Pennsylvania
has taken the initiative for the suggested
reforms and has addressed a" circular let
ter on the subject ; to ' the heads of all
universities, colleges, private schools and
other, institutions in the United States in
terested in athletics. 'This action was
taken after a number of meetings of the
university committee: on athletics of the
University :.' of ' Pennsylvania, -S Â« at : ' which
President Roosevelt's^ thoughts \u25a0 on the
subject were \ discussed. The committee
formulated rules which 'it. is thought will
meet the situation and decided to 'semi
them to the authorities of all educational
institutions in the country for" considera
tion and adoption if ;they met with ap
proval. . ;.
, /The rules proposed provide that no stu
dent shall represent his college. in athletic
sports during, his first year,, of residence,
nor for more than four years thereafter;
that ;only- bona fide amateurs,' and -those
proficient in scholarship be allowed on'tho
teams, and that' the, college authorities
be > given . the power to ; arbitrarily bar a
student from athletic- sports. .
'The "committee inclosed a- copy \u25a0â¢ of a
communication received by it from the
board : of coaches, which (so - f ar as : the
committee feels - itself' competent; to deal
with the technicalities of football) meets

ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 27-1:30 a. m.â
At .midnight the .press was Informed by
an. official of the Admiralty that the re
ports received up -to that ; hour showed
there had been no conflict at Sebastopol
yesterday. So far as the officials knew,
the crews of the Black Sea fleet were
still loyal, " but beyond that no informa
tion was - vouchsafed. It Is ' not . known
whether the troops which were ordered to
proceed from Simferopol have arrived at
Sebastopol.
The sailors who mutinied number about
4000 and belong to various equipages, from
the : Twenty-eighth to the Thirty-sixth.
Including; the sailors on board the ships
there were 'about- SOW hi Sebastopol when
the mutiny occurred. The troops In the
Karrlson consisted of the Brest and"Ble
lostok regiments, with . two battalions of
'artillery and., one battalion of fortress
artillery. The Bielostok : regiment, during
the outbreak several â¢ weeks ago, fired
upon the soldiers, and at the Admiralty
no doubt i 3 now entertained that the mu
tiny, was the result of the carefully pre
pared wprk of revolutionary workers, to
whom' the support given the mutineers
at Kronstadt by the workmen of St. Pe
tersburg offered a powerful weapon. Prof
iting^ by the mistakes of the mutineers
at Kronstadt. however, those at Sebasto
pol particular' care to.' adopt meas
ures, to prevent their meeting degenerat
insr-into a drunken' riot, and, so. far as
known, both tho mutineers and the work
men â¢ in the port : have â¢ comported . them
selves in a ; perfectly ; orderly . fashion.
'REBELS HAVE ABLE LEADERS.
There. ls a strong impression here that
intelligent leaders are at.t he head of the
movement-. It^ is -evident .'also that the
sailors - at ' Kronstadt have had .under
ground information of ; what was occur
ring at Sebastopol, because on Saturday
morning. , before the news was known "in
StJ Petersburg, reports: of the mutiny
were freely" circulated at Kronstadt.
Vice LAdmiral Birileff, \u25a0 Minister of Ma

MAACHL'RIAX TROOPS MUTINY.
Lineviteh * SoppreiuteM Outbreak and
Forty -Two Leaders Are Shot.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 26.â The suc
cessful mutiny of the sailors of Sebastopol.
accompanied by the first ooen revolt of
an entire regiment of troops, has createJ
the* greatest alarm in Government circles
and 'no attempt is made to disguise the
seriousness of -this latest crisis.
The army is the last prop of the Gov
ernment. Mutiny is- contagious and the
epidemic of revolt, which haa . attacked
In turn practically all the units of Uu>
navy from ' Vladivostok to Kronstadt, it
Is now "feared is destined similarly to
spread throughout the army.
Ugly reports have been repeatedly cir
culated ; Â«.f sedition among the .sol die rfi
In Manchuria and it was specifically re
ported a week ago that General Line
vltch had to put down a mutiny with con
siderable bloodshed and that subsequently
he caused forty-two men to be shot.
, No confirmation of this report was ob
tainable, but whether it be true or not
the morale of the troops on garrison duty
in* Russia has certainly everywhere been
shaken by the revolutionary propaganda
and the fidelity of individual units.: even
of the Guard regiments. Is questioned. '
' During the disorders followins the pro
mulgation of thellmperial manifesto some
of' the. provincial Oovernors refralntnl
from testing loyalty of the troops,
preferring ; to on the . Cossacks; who
showed' no signs of wavering.
I Count de Witte, called" an extraordinary
session of the Cabinet this afternoon and
another session was held to-night to c<j;i
sider the situation. Grand Duke Nicholas
Nlcholalevltch. president of tho' Council
of National Defense and commander of
thelmperla^Guard. was present and th:V
fact caused a revival of the rumor that
the Grand' Duke" might immediately fc-s
appointed dictator: but it. can be taken
for - granted that this step has 'not beea
decided upon, as it is plain* that a dicta
torship at the present Juncture would tÂ»
sure to precipitate an immediate* armeil
revolution. Nevertheless Count de Witte's
Government; if- it continue its present
policy, in the opinion of many student!) of
the situation, will be powerless tv copa
with the' increasing, Droblems by whlcd
it is constantly confronted. The revolu
tionary tide .subsides only' to '.mount
higher, and tha 'extreme elements, "con
vinced .that the Government must- fall,
are raising. their demands proportionately.
The Slovo to-day^ pertinently pointed out
the \u25a0 inconsistency : of the demand of the
revolutionaries for 'the abolition of the
death â¢ penalty, saying: "They, base their
demand ', on .' humanitarian grounds, yet
they , closed the \u25a0 drujr . stores, which fur- :
nished medicines .to the sick, and stopped
the railroads, which were carrying relief
to -.millions suffering ; from â¢ famine."
\u25a0The Russ halls the mutiny, at Sebasto
pol'as the. beginning of the end, and calla
upon i the ' Zemstvo congress to 'quit talk
ing and to come to St.;Petersburgln tha
name ' of ; the â¢ country and ask Count d^
\u25a0\Vitte .what he proposes to do" to tran
quillize Tthe people, and if the reply b3
unsatisfactory -â¢ to take the only ste?
which] remains, namely, \u25a0 the. formation oi
a^prbvisiohal government.

a colonel and five other officers surrender
ed and were sent under escort to the ma
rine Drison.
Being reinforced by the rank and file of
the entire' rejrfment, the jnutineers and
workmen formed a procession, composed
of 10.0 M men. and marched. through the

resisted the appeals of the mutineers to
Join them and, obeying the orders of Com
mander Schulm&a. marched off .toward
the road lea dins to Balaklava. The bat
tery, however, remained with the mutl
i;t*rs and ' participated in the meeting.
After the meeting the procession formed
again and went to the barracks of â¢ the
Ittelostok regii&ctft, where there j were
other companies, but , these companies
also declined the invitation of j the muti
neers to Join them. \u0084 ...
In the afternoon the eailors from . the
barracks signaled their comrades aboard
the warships to join them and also. sent
a deputation to Vice. Admjral Chouknin

The sailors thus far have . comported
themselves well. The city* is panic strick

WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.â Despite the
boycott against American products the
export trade of. the' United States with
China .as figured up to November, for 1905
was more 'than twice as' ; large as for the
same ; period . in /any preceding year. This
is shown by a bulletin issued by the
bureau of statistics of the Department of
Commerce arid - Labor. The ; officials who
computed It have not concerned : them
selves with the reasons for this Increase
in the face of the boycott." The advent of
peace, the industrial awakening of the
'entire Chinese -, empire and the efforts
which American cotton "manufacturers
have made to make and maintain an
Oriental market have been potent factors
in the growth of the" export trade. The
bulletin says: 'Â».
I In the month' of ' October/ 1906. for which , the
Department of Commerce, through Its bureau
of statistics, ; has Just announced its figures, the

CORPSE OF MAN
Kailroad Men Make Ghastly
Discovery That Indicates
Suicide of a Maniac
STBAXGER RUNS AMUCK
Terrorizes Town of Midway
a Few Hours Before His
Mutilated Body Is Seen
OAKLAND, Nov. 26.â Mystery envelops
the case of an unidentified man whose
body, with the head severed/ was found
last night lying near the Southern Pa
cific Company's tracks near Midway, east
of Livennore.
Only a few hours before the headless
corpse was seen by railroad men on a
passing freight train the stranger was
running amuck in the little village, at
tacking men with a maniac's ferocity.
Armed with a big wooden bludgeon, the
'erased man tore through the main street,
howling like a mad dervish. Several per
sons, among them A. Winters, who tried
to check the wild actions of the stranger,
>eie assaulted and with difficulty Â«es
caped serious injury at his hands.
At dusk the madman disappeared, after
running riot for several hours. When
Deputy Coroner Edward Conrad was no
tified at Uverrnore of the trainmen's
find he drove out to Midway to recover
â¢the body. There the corpse was identi
fied as that of the Insane stranger who
had raided so much disturbance during
the afternoon.
The appearance of the corpse indicated
that the man had committed suicide by
resting his head on the railroad track
and allowing a passing train to crush
the neck. Examination of the body,
â¢which was removed to LiivermoVe, dis
closed nothing by which immediate identi
fication could be made. The man was
between forty and forty-five years old,
Â£ feet 9 Inches tall, 165 pounds weight,
with short black hair, bald head, dark
mustache. He wore a black cloth suit.
Only 6 cents, a pH?e and tobacco were
found in the garments.
WATCHMAN FRIGHTENS
BUBGLAES AT WOBK
Shots Fired at Fleeing
Crooks Fail to Stop
Them.
BERKELEY. Nov. 26.â Two burglars
seeking to effect an entrance into the
home of D. A. McDonald, 1615 Hopkins
street, Peralta Park, were frightened by
Night Watchman J. Krutz early this
morning and ran from the scene, leaving
their skeleton keys in the door. The
criminals had cut a hole in the screen
on the porch and then opened the porch
door. Krutz espied them while they were
at work and attempted to capture them,
but the men heard him coming and fled.
The watchman fired as they ran, but
missed his mark.
The McDonald house is furnished, but
is not occupied, the McDonalds being in
Alaska. Captain R. Frobese is in charge
of the premises. He reported the act of
Watchman Krutz to Marshal Vollmer to
day.
Angelo Pantajo, a section hand on the
Santa Fe Railroad, is charged by Max
imilian Molino with stealing from him
wearing apparel valued at $25. The ac
cused men quit the grading camp where
the goods were lost yesterday.
Policeman C. A, Becker found a lot of
plunder in the form of nuts, canned goods
and other delicacies cached at Addison
and Shattuck streets last night, thieves
apparently having hid the goods for' re
moval at a more convenient time." The
owner of the stuff has not been found.

ARE OVER LAND
Dr. Hadlock in Thanksgiving
Sermon Gives His Views
Some: Vital Matters
SUNLIGHT IS COMING
All Depends Upon Citizens
; Doing Their Duty by Their
and by Their God
Thanksgiving, sermons were preached in
some of.the city. churches yesterday, and
in numerous instances the choirs rendered
special: music.
j.'.At Trinity; Presbyterian Church there
was a most beautiful Thanksgiving praise
service, and at . Calvary Presbyterian
Church the singing: was extremely fine.
The \ music service, at Trinity Church,
,Gough and Bush y streets, under the direc-
I tion of ; Louis, H: Eaton, was grandly ren-
I dered, as was that at Grace Church, Cal
i if ornia street, under the direction of Or
ganist W.-H. Holt.
> Notable â¢ among the . sermons was the
one delivered by. the Rev. Edwin H. Had
lock, Phi D.; pastor of the English Luth
eran I Church,". Geary, street, ' near Gough:
Dr. Hadlock chose for his subject; " Ame
rica, Her Shadows : and Sunlight."
After speaking lof - the divine guidance
in the development of the nation Dr. Had
lock said that, all nations have repre
sented some great ideas. He continued:
; To the UnlUd States :it was (iven to reore
sent freedom | and , faith/ 1 Our Goddess Of â¢ Lib
erty.-should . not; only, raise the touch of free
dom at the - Ea stern i xate way. - but also tha
cross which makes man free. This nation has
been Riven a : B rand religious mission and for
this purpose the creator has meeted out to the
'American people . the . greatest national Inherit
ance ever Riven to man. '. . \u25a0 â¢
\u25a0 While all this is a fact,. the nation has not
only great possibilities, but also great dangers.
Wh SHADOWS ARE FOREBODING.
The shadow* which lie upon the land are in
places dark and foreboding. 1 The first shadow
la ; worldly ; luxury. The more, repulsive vices
arc being fought, while the so-called "respect
able sins" are eating the nation at the core.
' Men make money easily and spend It care
lessly/ or -hoard it. as misers,' making two
classes that" are both enemies of the social

NAPA. Nov. 25.â Word v.as received
here to-day that the Supreme Court of
this Etate had rendered an important de
cision in the George A. Gibbs habeas
corpus case, upholding the constitution
ality of the new State law prohibiting
the sale of intoxicating liquors within one
and a half miles of the Veterans' Home
property at Yountville. Gibbs is one of
the eight saloon-keepers in Yountville
charged with violating the law. In his
application for a writ of habeas corpus
asking for his release from custody
Gibbs attacked the constitutionality of
the law, contending that the law was
special and discriminatory legislation in
that It made restrictions at the Yount
ville Home which did not apply to the
Boldiers' Home at Santa Monica, a sim
ilar institution. The Supreme Court holds
that the Legislature had a right to pass
the law in question. The cases asainst
the saloon-keepers at Yountville will now
be prosecuted.

CAPTURED MEN SUSPECTED
OF SEVERAL BURGLARIES
Williams and Haw
kins Are Old
Offenders.
Thought to Be Gang
at Present Infest
ing City.
Chief D^nan and Captain Burnett were
loud m their praise yesterday morning: of
the courage and good judgment exercised
by Policeman E. G. McDonnell in captur
ing the two burglars, Joseph Hawkins
and Joseph Wiliaras, in the residence of
B. F. Allen, 2204 Jackson street, on Sat
urday night. McDonnell had a narrow
escape from being ehot by Hawkins. The
revolver is a double action Colt, and
Hawkins was evidently not familiar with
its mechanism, as when he pulled the
trigger it snapped, and before he could
pull it again McDonnell knocked the
weapon out of his hand and soon had tho
handcuffs on him. . '
Policeman Meagher took charge of
Hawkins and McDonnell went In search
of Williams. He found him. crouched on
the roof and quickly placed him under
arrest.
When searched a number of skeleton
keys were found in the pockets of the
prisoners. Yesterday McDonnell placed a
charge of assault with a deadly weapon
against Hawkins besides the burglary
charge, which was made on Saturday
night. ;
Williams, who gave the name of Frank
Mansfield, has served two terms in the
State's prison for burglary and two terms
In the County Jail for having burglars'
tools In his possession. Hawkins has been
arrested several times on suspicion, but
the police always failed to get a convic
tion against him.
Detectives Matheson and Mulcahy have
been detailed on the case, and they ex
pect to be able to connect Hawkins and
"Williams with several of the recent
burglaries in this city. The addresses of
Mrs. A- H. Altmann. 1256 Jackson street,
and Miss Jennie Erikson. dressmaker. 3015
Buchanan street, were written on cards
found in Hawkins' pockets, and the de
tectives will make inquiry to ascertain
whether their places have been robbed or
why Hawkins should have their names
and addresses.
Two other men suspected of being day
light burglars were arrested on Saturday
afternoon at Washington and Broderick
streets by Policeman Ceinar. They gave
the names of HI March and Bay Robin-
Bon. They had been hanging around that
neighborhood all day and watching the
residence of Arthur E. Shattuck, presi
dent of the Pacific States Type Foundry,
at 8020 Washington street. When Mrs.
Shattuck left her residence in the after
noon they walked across the street and
March rang the door bell. A fireman obr
served him and asked him what he want
ed, and hÂ« and Robinson walked away.
Marlus P. Johansen was arrested on
Saturday evening by Detectives Regan
and O'Connell and booked at the City
Prison on a charge of burglary. He broke
into the furniture factory of Hayman
Goldman at 420 Fifth street on November
24 and stole a quantity of tools, which
the detectives recovered at his residence.
John Gibbons was arrested by Detec
tives Burke and Smith on Saturday even
ing on a charge of burglary. He is ac
cused of breaking into the residence of
Captain Charles Douglass, at 1425 Ver
mont street, on November 15, and steal
ing an eight-day clock and other prop
erty.
Charles Burke was arrested on Satur
day night by Detectives T. B. Gibson and
Bailey. He Is accused by Andrew Brandt,
181S Stockton street, of entering his bed
room and stealing $160 from a bureau
drawer.
Eastern Pickpockets Arrested.
William Thomson, John Watson and
Carl Johnson, who, the police say, are
well-known Eastern pickpockets, were
arrested on a car at Mason and O'Far
rell streets yesterday afternoon by De
tectives Taylor and Braig from descrip
tions given to Captain Burnett. They
are suspected of picking the pockets
of passengers on the cars. They will
be shown to the different watches at
the police stations. One of them was
arrested here during the visit of the
Knights Templar, but nothing could be
proved against him.
Victim of Pickpockets.
Paul Stenfors. 81 Clementina street,
reported to the police yesterday that
while he was in a penny auditorium at
769 Market street on Saturday night
his silver watch and fob. valued at 518,
were-stolen from his vest pocket. He
became aware of, his loss after he had
left the auditorium.
EVA WESTCOTT
IS CLEVER IN
REALISTIC ACT
A striking but rather startling and
over-realistic one-act playlet, entitled
"An Episode in Modern- Life," was
presented as one of the headliners at
the Orpheum last "night by Miss Eva
Weetcott. It represents a giddy young
wife prattling about. social gayetiesto
a silent spouse. Not till the woman is
through with her gossip does; she real
ize her husband is dead. It is very
cleverly staged, and acted by Miss
Westcott and it won much applause
last night, surely being something:
novel and quite' unexpected on the
vaudeville stage.
Dlxon and Anger are a couple of
comedians who are really funny. Their
sketch Is a lightning one and the Ger
man accent of the, former is weird and
not of the usual order. - The Esmeralda
sisters and their flower girls did a very
graceful singing and dancing act, much
to the delight of the crowd. Whistling
Tom Brcwne returned, to come in for a
big greeting after a long absence. His
work last night was high class and he
was forced to respond to several en
cores.
Among the holdovers the Fadette
Woman's Orchestra continues to bask
in, the limelight of public approval.
The programme was changed last night
and is just as. good as over. Charles
Leonard Fletcher had ,some "new imita
tions, and Lucy and Luclcr and Troba,
the Juggler, again made good with the
crowd.
Â»w Bill at Chutes.
"Princess Fan. Tan," Bothwell
Browne's Japanese musical extravagan
za, pleased two large audiences at the

MONDAY NOVEMBER 27, 1905
ANOTHER RECORD WEEK.
WE have recently had several remarkably active weeks in
trade, but last week broke all previous records in one
particular. Of the ninety cities and towns reporting bank
clearings only two^-Richmond and Topekaâ showed losses as com
pared with the corresponding week in 1904. This is not likely to
occur again for years, and may never. As these clearings are
accepted as the best business barometers of the country it is natural
to conclude that there was a general expansion of business last week'
from one end of the country to the other. The aggregate clearings
were very large, running over $3,000,000,000, and many of the indi
vidual gains were heavy, such as 33.3 per. cent at Chicago; 36.7 at
Philadelphia, 32.3 at San Francisco, 37.7 at New Qrleans, 79.3 at
Los Angeles, 68.3 at Seattle, 76.3 at Spokane, and so on. The
smallest gains among the most important distributing and pur
chasing centers were 15.9 per. cent at, New York and 12.7 at Min
neapolis. Truly this is a remarkable trade record for one week.
These figures chiefly represent internal commerce. But our
foreign trade is also making a most excellent showing. The imports
for the country in October were $107,500,000, an increase of
$5,200,000 over October, 1904, while our exports for that month
were $154,000,000, a decrease of $8,000,000, the excess of exports
being less than $47,000,000, against about $70,000,000 last year.
These figures show a declining foreign balance, but this is the period
when we move our grain and cotton, so when the year closes we
will probably find a reversal of the balance to our favor. The for
eign business of the country is very large, the exports' for the ten
months ending October 31 being $1,256,950,000, against $1,147,
996,000 in 1904, while the imports were $9/9,937,000, against
$844,172,000.
The staples continue fairly active as a rule, though less so thaji
several weeks ago. Wool is quieter and the market at some points
is weaker, the" extremely, high prices having checked the demand.
Provisions are steady in price, but not especially brisk. Hops,
which for several .years have been in urgent demand at quotations
about three times of the cost of production, are now down to cost,
and the common grades are below cost. Hides, which have lately
touched the highest figure since the civil war, are also showing some
signs of quieting down, though they have not yet developed any
weakness. There is nothing new in the iron and steel industry, the
mills everywhere having orders sufficient to keep them running far
ahead into 1906. Minneapolis continues to report an excellent
demand for both wheat and flour.
A significant feature which developed during the week was less
complaint of car shortage, taking the country as a whole. This
rather indicates a falling off in the movement of general merchan
dise. But the railroads themselves report an increase in business of
9 per rent during the first half of November as compared with the
same month last year, while the net returns for the first nine months
of the year show an increase of 7 per cent.
The money market has eased off considerably during the week.
Rates for call money in New York have dropped back to about 4l4 l / 2
to 5V* P er cent, and there was little talk heard of tight money
during the week, the impression being that the acuteness of the
recent stringency is about over. Still, this is the time of the year
when funds are apt to exhibit sharp fluctuations, and we are there
fore liable to experience another flurry almost any day. The last
agitation in this direction produced no effect beyond attracting
general attention, for the supply of funds is still large and nobod}
fears any pinch serious enough to affect the general business of
the country. Wall street smiled at the sharp rise in rates as being
part of the autumn programme, and the stock market went through
the episode with noteworthy steadiness. The copper stocks have
been the center of attraction lately, the higher quotations and urgent
demand for the metal having greatly enhanced the prospects of the
mining properties.
Cotton has been excited of late, owing to the incoming of the
ginners' reports, the Census Bureau's estimates and the guesses of
all sorts of trade journals and operators on* the' size of the crop,
which have kept the market extremely sensitive and bobbing about
like a shuttlecock. Conservative and reliable estimates calculate
the crop at about 10,500,000 bales, and the Southern planters, bullish
to a man, are holding back for higher prices, a large and powerful
section of them having decided to hold for 15 cents. The present
price is about ny 2 cents.
Conditions on this coast remain abo&t the same. The long
dry spell has been slightly broken by a light rainfall, not sufficient
to do much good except in the southern counties, but enough to
break the drouth and extend promise of more rain to come. Even
the few showers of the past week have given the public more con
fidence in the future and a good soaking rain all over the State
would produce a very perceptible effect on the whole community.
There is still plenty of time for this soaking rain, for it is not* yet
the first of December. v-:
INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE.
INQUIRY into insurance methods, which is now being given such
wide publicity, may result in bringing about great improvements
by awakening the people to the extravagance which present sys
tems indulge in. The expense of policies in ordinary insurance is
considered high by well-to-do people who can pay premiums pn
$1000 policies anl upward; but when we' consider the charges in the
so-called "industrial insurance" the expense put. upon the poor who
seek insurance by payment of small weekly installments the figures
read like robbery. : -^
The expense to these people who are able only to pay by driblets
of dimes and quarters amounts to very nearly double what the or
dinary insurance costs. Reports of the investigation of the Metro
politan Life Company show this. It appears that, while a policy on
the ordinary plan for $1000 costs $16 55, to those who have to pay
by weekly installments the charge is $31 20. Last year the company
collected over $50,000,000 from policy-holders, most of whom were
the poor who pay by weekly installments, and it. returned in death
claims and dividends only $16,560,000. The expense of salaries,
commissions, etc., was $20,000,000. , That is, the expense far ex
ceeds the sum that goes back to the poor. The salary of the presi
dent of this company is $100,000, and that of the vice' president is
$75,000. . .: . '
In one year this company gained $3,000,000 from lapsed poli
cies. This means an immense loss to the poor people who have^to
throw up their policies after havingpaid premiums on them for sev
eral years. It is an immensely profitable 'business for the ; officers.'
Even the third vice president gets over $16,000.
While it is true that extraordinary financial talent rightly com
mands large salaries, it would seem that a man with such gifts- in
that way should surely be able to arrange a system, by which the
poor would get a more adequate return from what they stint them
selves to pay for insurance, and that something, might be done by
the managers to shut off the enormous loss from lapsed insurance,
which is usually causejd by such misfortunes that the poor indus
trials cannot spare even the weekly dimes and quarters.
The fact is that graft cannot be eliminated in any other way than by
independent voting. It is a system which has grown out of the habit of
hidebound partisanship. â Rochester Herald.

COON AND TIGER
A small, dirk Coon was walking cne day
In the desert for the sake of his appetite,
when he ran full tilt into a largo .and
comparatively healthy Tiger. The Coon
realized, instinctively, that he would ro-
Quire to exert all his wits to keep things
going on as satisfactorily as usuaL And
bo he spoke up in a perfectly candid way:
"Good morning, he said to the Tiger,
who did not answer, but looked at him
roguishly.
"The desert air Is very fine this morn
ing," continued the Coon, and the Tiger
smiled in a humorous manner.
"But I derive no benefit from, this very
fine air," proceeded the Coon, "for I'm
ill. Yes, I have taken poison!" he went
on, with a feverish look in his deep brown
eyes. M Last s night I ate a pailful of
strong arsenic which I mistook for white
wash. My physician tells me that I am
so saturated with poison that, if any
thing only Just touches me, nothing could
postpone immediate death. If , you, for
instance, touched me with your teeth only
it would kill you instantaneously. Noth
ing could postpone, death!" .
"Why wish to postpone death?" said the
Tiger, cheerily. "I may tell ybu that I
consider this meeting shÂ«er good luck, for
I'm tired of life and came out to commit
suicide . ... Kindly stand still,' so,
while I spring. \u25a0â¢'* A little farther to the

ESTIMATES OF WOMAN
ANGELA MORGAN
DOES the present age call for the emancipation from woman rather than the
emancipation of woman? .
Helen Bosanquet of England in a strong, comprehensive and satisfying ar
ticle offered by the International Journal of Ethics sounds this rather startling
note. *-.:\u25a0
: She quotes Rlehl. the German sociological historian, who vigorously advocates
woman in the home and as vigorously opposes her outside "of that sphere.
Riehl. maintains that wherever women are intellectually active . there is mani
fest a' lowering of the general intellectual - Â«_
standard ; that such activity is detriment-*
al to the intellectual spirit of the age.
\ "Publishers speculate eagerly for wom
en's reading;-a poet -whom women read
is a made man. Women have become 'a
public* for /poets; Ultimately, indeed,
they are the "public, and the public deter
mines what its. poets -shall 'be.' We have
female high schools, women's newspapers
and lectures', for ladies of all kinds.
Scarcely "a. branch of . science remains,
from metaphysics to engineering, which
has not been worked up into special hand
books for the use of women."
The gist of this argument is that the
age needs to be emancipated from woman.
Another German writer, Hugo Munster
berg, is : quoted as advancing the same
ideas concerning American culture to-day.
In his Sook on Americans Munsterberg
asserts that unless a more masculine in
fluence comes in to nominate where now
the feminine influence makes itself felt so
supremely T our national culture will ulti
mately become feeble and powerless to
affect the progress of the world. .
Helen Bosanquet does not hold the
pessimistic view , maintained by these
writers. She quotes them, to point out
the sharp contrast between the German
ideal of women and the ideal sustained
in America. Then she goes on to show,
that whereas the German ideal is true
and beautiful, the American ideal Is yet stronger and more beautiful.
She admits the accuracy of the German estimate concerning our culture, agrees
it is dominated by woman., and that possibly the, feminine influence is at present
softening and refining rather than deepening and strengthening.
Yet she stands firm in her belief of woman's right to intellectual development.
She declares woman has the "same improvable mind" as man and is as fit a me
dium for the realization of intellectual progress as he is. 'ââ¢,:â
â¢ Her attitude toward present unfavorable indications is most hopeful. "W nile
fully admitting the vulnerable points in woman's intellectual armor, and goes on
to show that these weaknesses are not peculiar to the feminine intellect, but are
merely Incidental to the particular stage woman has reached in her progress to
ward knowledge. . .
She sees the remedy for the tendency to superficiality arising from feminine
supremacy in the intellectual world.
"It lies in pushing still farther forward, in making women's education still
more complete and thorough." ': -J \u25a0<.-'â¢ _ . ,
This writer has given as clear, logical and just an estimate If the situation as
it would be possible to find. One of the strongest things she says is this:
"The truest comradeship is found when man and woman meet on the common
ground of mutual intellectual respect. Innumerable happy homes bear witness to
day to the truth of this higher ideal, and so far the battle has, in principle, been
won forever." f r ; : ,
THE WAY OF LIFE
NINETTE M. LOWATER
I HAVE loved life, and drank its brimming cup;
I have known joy, and felt it surging up
Through all my soul, as waters fill the sea.
And took my fill, where others only sup.
Once I had love, but love is hard to hold;
Once I had youth, but I am growing old;-
Once I had friends, but friendship passed me by,
And what of life is left when this is told?
If love has vanished, so have all its pains;.
If hope is gone, then friendship still remains;
% If friends have left me, others may be won; ,
*If . life has losses.. wisdom:counts its gains.

CLUBWOMEN DECLARE AGAIMST
DISTURBANCES IN THEATERS.
Hat- Grab bins Be
fore Last Curtain
Is Denounced.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
Control tolerance, consideration for oth
ersâthese are a few of the qualities that
women are supposed to get out of the
discipline and the Intelligent associations
of their clubs. And most clubwomen do.
If they be endowed with a modicum of
brainsâ and most of them are.
The latest evidence that clubs are
awakening a consideration for others in
women is the determined stand taken by
a number of California clubwomen in the
matter of "hat-grabbing" in theaters be
fore the last curtain.
To be cure. no well-bred womanâ by
which is meant one who is concerned
with the rights and privileges and com
forts of othersâ ever makes one of those
half-yard dashes for hat pins, hat, gloves,
ecarf, muff, ccat, etc.. before the curtain
is rung down. And when a woman does
It she brands herself forthwith as a vul
garian and a dolt.
Only ' thoughtless ?
That may be something of a defense.
But It Btanfls In the same category as
does drunkenness as a cloak for crime.
Often the last lines in the play contain
fine sentiment or a bit of clever witâ at
any rate, they are written to be heard,
end the audience has paid to hear itâ and
it has a right to demand to hear it.
But at the first suggestion that the
players have unfolded their tale a good
half of the women forthwith begin to
â¢wTiggle, a general commotion sweeps
over the house, â¢ a buzz drowns the voices
of the players, hats are hoisted into place
and riveted with multitudinous jabs, ob
structing the stage.
Meanwhile the Interested auditor, who
entertains a decent regard for the play
ers, as well as for himself and those
about him, suppresses a mighty swear
and goes out Into -the night hating him
self for herding with barbarians.
Now, It is to discourage and suppress
this outrage of decency that the afore
mentioned clubwomen are setting out by
individually and collectively declaring
against It and pledging themselves to be
gin a campaign among their ' friends
against Jtâ all of which will ultimately
lead to an extension of the ."hats off"
law into the "hats off until the last cur
â¢asn" law.
And heaven hasten the day!

HEALTH NOTICE
v- Warning against the use of Witch Hazel. V
RECENT investigation has disclosed an alarming condition of affairs
existing in this widley known family remedy.
It has been proven couclusively that unscrupulous manufacturers
have been selling Witch Hazelnot only below .the recognised stand-
ard of strength, but which is adulterated with Wood Alcohol {poison\
ForSialdeiiyde {poisoii) or both..:
These "conditions prevail throughout the United States and are
especially; alarm ing on the Pacific Coast. Of thirty-three samples of
Witch'Hazer bought of retail druggisfs and department storey in San
Francisco, Los Angeles} Portland, Tacoma, Spokane and Seattle, twenty-
seven were adulterated with Wood Alcohol (poison), Foemaldehtde
(poison) or both. .
VjirThe sure way to avoid the danger, incurred in using these poison-
oas witch hazels is to use the only standard extract of Hamamelis (witch
hazel), sold "only in original packages as bottled by the manufacturer.

* . - â : â Â»
A class singles tennis tournament at
the California Club and a handicap
doubles tournament at the park yepterdsy
Â¥ occupied the attention of the players of
this city. Play was completed in the \u25a0sec
ond, third and fourth classes, the re
spective winners being George Cutter,
â¢A- K. Black and \V. 11. H. Murphy.
George Janes and Melville Long reached
the finals in the first class, but failed to
eppoar in the afternoon for the final
match, as they were competing in doubles
a i the park.
Just what action will be taken by the
tournament committee will be decided to
morrow night, when that body will meet.
It is possible both players will be de
latilied and the entire class played over.
The handicap doubles tournament was
productive of some unusually close
matches. The handicaps were more lib
eral than in the past and one-sided
matches were less numerous. George
Janes and F*cd Adams (owe 15 3-6) and
the Guerin brothers (15) reached the semi
finals in the lower half. Four teams re
main in the upper half. They are C.
Foley and M. Lons (owe 15 3-6), Peck a.nd
Vonsano (15 3-â¬), C. Griffin and H. Long
(owe 15) and F. Guerin and Finnesran
(scratch).
Uespite the largre handicap three of the
remaining, six teams are composed of
lirst-class players. AVhitneys place was
taken by M. Long, who played with C
Koley. The uew team won bath its
matches and will make a strong com
bination.
The best match of the day, although by
no means the closest, was that between
I Adams and Janes mnd Dunlap and G.
Â§_3?aker. They met on even terms and
Ailams and Janes won In straight sets.
In the class singles tournament the
most interesting match was that between
Melville Long and Herbert Schmidt. The
former beat the winner of the last tour
imment two sets out of three. Janes eas
ily disposed of Herbert Lons and thereby
won his place in the finals. . -
In the second class George Cutter and
Jlenry Mills played a long, five-set match.
After losing the first two sets Mills took
the third and fourth easily. He lost the
fifth and deciding set.
In the third class A. E. Black won
handily. In the finals he beat H. Black
In straight sets.
After having a hard match with Web
ster in the first round Murphy took the
final match of the fourth class from N.
Blaisdell in -straight sets.

For the first'time in his life Danny Shea '
responded- with a home "run yesterday at J
the Eighth-street lot. It was a healthy'
blngle that went over the.-, center field I
fence without touching anything but. at- j
mosphere. It Â»not only made the ' crowd
feel glad, but gave the Seals a lead which
the Tigers could never 'reachX, \u25a0\u25a0/".]
Mr. Shea performed this memorable *
feat in <h<? fourth round and, a flock of [
errors by the Tigers alone gaye v Danny i
the opportunity to become great .for a |
few minutes., Nealon led off the inning by .
getting a walk. "When Householder start
ed a simple one at Keefe- Nealon tore for
second. Keefe winged the ; leather away
out to center field and the Pi ttsburg
beauty pulled up at third. Again the ball
was heaved wild, this time by (Lynch.
Nealon registered -on the ' wide f pcg 1 and
Householder anchored, at the third sack. I
Irwfn immediately saw thel whole Tiger i
layout was on" Balloon street, so he dis
patched a resounding '.sinsle out to left
field that chased Householder in. -Then
came Shea with that four cushion swipe
over the fence that separates Mrs. Clan
cy's back yard from' the ball field/; Some
of the fans were bo surprised they-exT
pected to see that ball come back, but it
never showed and victory was complete.:'-
After making a start, that looked good
the Tigers fell down.' , Doyle inaugurated
the fight with a- hit to right and Sheehan
bunted. Nealcn dropped the- .throw and
Nordyko sacriliced. Truck Eagan died by
the Irwin- Nealon route, but he ' brought
Doyle home. Casey swung through with
a double, to left, scoring Sheehan. Nor

several shots at goal none of them scored.
Antrobus doing \ some â¢ good clearin*.
When a penalty kick was awarded to tha
Hornets by Henry Roberts,' the referee,
a goal seemed certain, but Antrobu3
fended the ball out cleverly. The" first
period ended without a score on ' either
side.
Early in the second period Elliot. thÂ»
Hornet captain, kicked a goal from thÂ«
field, but it was disallowed. 'Shortly
afterward the independent forwards mads
a determined attack and P. Fay i>ut the
ball into the net. Score:- Independents, 1
goal: Hornets.; ft. The Hornets soon
equalized the score, which stood for somÂ«
time at 1 all. "Many- spectators thought
that the match would end In a tie. but
before the call of time the Hornets
pierced the Independent net again, .tha
score reading: Hornets, 2 goals; Inde
pendents. 1 goal. For the winners Chrts

SAYS OFFICERS
HAVE CONSPIRED
A Yard en Tompkins Dec! ares
He Is Victim of a Scheme
to Oust Him From Place
j Warden J. W. Tompkins of San
Quentin prison declared in an inter
view yesterday that there was a con
spiracy between Clerk J. M. Oliver and
James Russell, captain of the guard, to
oust him from office. He says they are
angry at him because he at times over
sees the work and they do not like' this
interference. He says he has made
enemies because "he has personally tried
to supervise every department of the
prison, as he believed it the warden's
duty to know what was going on in
an institution of which he Is the head.
"Other wardens in the past have let the
officers do as they pleased without one
inquiry us to how the affairs were be
ing run/ he said, "while I have made
it my rule to personally see that every
department of the prison is being con
ducted in a business-like style.
"ThÂ«e Iwo officers. Clerk Oliver and
Captain Russell, took a dislike to me
tlie minute I became warden. I im
mediately made a personal supervision
of Clerk Oliver's department, much to
his anger. He had been used to doing
as he pleased with no supervision, and
he could not brook the Idea that the
warden should have anything to do
with his work. Captain Russell acted
I in the, same manner.
"These two men soon began to talk
together at frequent intervals and Up
discuss matters at length. I â¢ did not
at first think anything of their increas
ing desire to be together until I.heard
rumors of a conspiracy against me. \ If
the officers of this prison do not like
me it is because ;I; I personally interest
myself in seeing that the work of every
department Is carried on as it should
be. There should be no ill feeling over
that."
Although the Board of Prison Direc
tors will, not say whether or not the
present Investigation is aimed directly
at Warden Tompkins, yet it is the gen
eral impression about the prison that
such is the case. The directors will not
talk on > Ihe subject more. than, to say
that they are conducting a general in
vi'stigration of the affairs of the prison.
The investigation will be continued on
next Sunday at the prison.
.' Clerk Oliver, denied that- he- was -In
any conspiracy to- oust Warden Tomp
kins. He further stated that he did
not know of any such conspiracy and
denied positively that the officers ' had
sent a round robin" petition to! the
Board of Prison Directors.
Governor Pardee^was interviewed last
night at Sacramento upon the condi
tion of affairs at the San Quentin
prison, now under Investigation by the
State Board of- "Prison Directors. The
Governor could not express an opinion
on the present conditions at the prison,"
but Intimated great confidence in^the
Board of Prison Directors. "I think
the prison directors will be ' able to*
handle this whole -matter," said the
Governor. "The board isja good one
and is now on the ground. .The mem
bers know nil about the circumstances
at the-prison, and I feel confident that
they are perfectly, able to, take charge
of this entlrc/affalr."

HUSBAND DEAD,
W IFE MAY DIE
Escaping Gas i From a Eange
Overcomes Couple as They
Lie Wrapped in Slumber
OTHER INMATES ESCAPE
Three Children and a Man
Who ;Are -in Other Epoms
Luckily Have Shut
As Thomas J. Walcott and . his .wife
were sleeping: in their home, 120 Church
street, Saturday; night, gas escaping 1 , from
a range In their kitchen filled the bed
room. Walcott is dead, and 'Mrs. Wal
cott is in a critical condition. Three of
Mrs. Walcott's children by a former hus
band and Albert Hlgglns, a nephew of
Walcott, who were in different rooms,
escaped. ' . .
The room in which the husband and
wife slept was directly off the kitchen
and the door was open. , The fumes of the
carbon monoxide gradually filled the bed
room as the couple : lay wrapped' in
slumber. â¢
When the alarm was given the man
was cold in death. The woman was un
conscious, but was desperately fighting
for air. The gas had been : pouring into
the room for nearly eight hours, arid it
is a miracle that the woman Was able
to live after inhaling so much of the
poisonous stuff.
A stop cock on the gas range In the
kitchen was found partly opened. It is
not known whether this was acidentally
left open by Walcott or by Hlggins. ;
Mr. and Mrs. Walcott arrived at the
house shortly before midnight Saturday.
Before retiring they prepared coffee on
the stove. About a half hour afterward
Hlggins came home. He passed through
the kitchen on the way to his room. I He
did not notice any odor of gas. If "the
atop cock was not left open by Walcott"
the theory is* that Higgins may have
brushed against it and opened it. 'lt was
very loose. :: J _
The bedroom where the children slept
was closed. Only a faint trace of the gas
entered the room. Had the ' door> been
open the children would certainly have
been asphyxiated. Their names are:
Sadie Blandy, aged 16; Harry Blandy,
aged 13, and Lucy Blandy, aged 10. Hlg
gin's door was also closed.
While Higgins and the three children
slept peacefully Walcott ; and his wife
were slowly suffocating â¢'. to death. The
man must have awakened some . time
during the night for his position when
found Indicates it. He was probably too
much overcome to stir or give the alarm,
and sank back to die. .
About 9 o'clock one of- the children
opened the door of the room where" they
were sleeping. Gas flooded, the room In
an instant. The children screamed, rous
ing Higgins. He rushed into the room
where WaJcott and his wife lay.. f %
Medical aid was sent for. Walcott was
dead -when a doctor arrived. Mrs.^Wal
cott was alive, but in a critical condition.
Two doctor* .worked over her for sev
eral hours, but in the end were not able
to express much hope for her recovery.
The dead man was a plumber, aged
about 54 years.
EDWARD PERRY
DELIGHTS ALL
WITH LEGENDS
Edward Baxter Perry charmed . the
members of the musical circle of San
Francisco yesterday afternoon at Lyric
Hall with his wonderfully vivid rendition
of medieval legends set for the pianoforte.
His programme was entirely different
from that which he gave last Friday
evening; it was descriptive of well known
childhood tales, recited on the piano al
most,as plainly as though a mother was
cooing them to her babe..
The audience greatly, appreciated \ the
work of this blind artist and applauded
him continuously.- At the end of the pro
gramme he was. called back until he made
a speech.
A selection which* will j last long in the
memory of every " one -present at the re
el tal was Sain t , Saens' : ' 'Danse Macabre. ' '
It was a fantastic^' delightful description
of the -dance of theVdead. The devil
played his I tuneless ? violin and the skele
tons and ghosts i about until the
cock sounded' the^warning at daybreak.
Then they all scampered back into' their
graves. Legends -from every country in
Europe were giyen" yn the piano during
the afternoon. ,

SUFFERER'S PLEA
IS UNHEEDED
Williani Moffatt Is Denied
Mmission to City~ Hospital
by Dr. H.S. Levy, Interne
BATED AS NOT "FIT"
Patienf Sent by En^rgency
Service Told He Cannot
Enter Bigger Institution
'-\u25a0..'- \u25a0 \u25a0 i \u25a0\u25a0*\u25a0 \u25a0 : ' â¢ ' '-
Dr. H. y S. Levy,, an interne at the City
and County Hospital, refused to; receive
William Moffatt, a patient sent out from
the V Central . Emergency Hospital \ yester
day.- .Dr. Levy's . reason for not taking
the | patient was that Moffatt was \ not a
fit patient for the hospital. What Levy
means by "flt" could not' be learned. ;
Ordinarily ; the city admits to its hos
pitals all the sick poor, no matter, what
their malady. ; Moffatt was suffering from
eplstaxis, severe hemorrhage of the nose
and an abcess of the ear, involving ne
crosis of the bone. Besides this the sick
man was anaemic ; and emaciated from
long suffering. Moffatt is so \u25a0 sick that
he is scarcely, able to walk, yet Dr. Levy
refused to;, abide by the diagnosis arid
judgment 'of the surgeons at the Central
Emergency Hospital. He says: --â¢\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'
"I did not think. Moffatt a fit patient
for. our ' hospital, so I refused him ad
mittance."' â¢ \ â¢
The doctors at the Central Emergency
Hospital say that Levy could have learned
Moffatt'sf condition by examination. ..
Driver Baker of the ambulance, who
took the patient , to the City and County
Hospital, was obliged to return the sick
man to the Central Emergency Hospital.
On the . way back Moffatt had . a severe
hemorrhage in the wagon. Dr. A. C.
Hill treated Moffatt at the Central Emer
gency Hospital and said he was a sick
man. - ,
.Moffatt says he has no money and has
been weak and sick for some time. He
lives >t 617 Third street. Dr. C." B. Pink
ham, who examined him 'at the Central
Emergency Hospital, fears the abcess in
Moffatt's ear may have developed Into
an abcess of the mastoid -process of the
temporal bone. . i '
The Central, Emergency j Hospital needs
all its beds for. emergency cases and can
not house a medical case indefinitely.
The surgeons are In a quandary to know
what disposition to make of Moffatt.
CIRCASSIAN CARRIES
m DAGGER TO PRISON
Had j i Mahoma Struggles
Fiercely Wlien Arrested
for Carrying Weapon.
. There was ; trouble early yesterday
morning among a band of Circassians
who came here after the close of the
Portland Exposition with Charles Mar
quis, who has. charge ,of them. They live
on Mason street, nÂ«ar Ellis, and about 1
o'clock Marquis asked Policemen Hurd
and -Handley to arrest Themarchan Do
chada, who, he said, threatened to kill
him. Dochada was arrested and taken
to the City- Prison. \u25a0
Yesterday afternoon Marquis, accompa
nied by Hadji Mahoma, chief of the band,
appeared at. the prison; to arrange for
bailing Dochada out. ' After g having >an
earnest " conversation with Dochada, Mar
quis was asked what the trouble had been
and he replied that Dochada had become
t obstreperous. arid had. made for him with
a long dagger, such ;as each Circassian
carries in a sheath under ; his , long \u25a0 cloak.
To avoid} trouble. Marquis said he retreat
ed- from-'. the. room and sought the aid of
the policemen. '-.'
Marquis said ' that Mahoma had one of
the daggers attached to a belt round his
waist. 'Policeman Murphy, ;who is on
duty at the prison^^overheard . the re
mark, and, turning . up" the end of Maho
ma's cloak, disclosed the .dagger in its
sheath., pulled Tout; the dagger
and showed it to Desk Sergeant Anderson,
who ordered; a charge of carrying a : con
cealed weapon made against" "Mahoma.
Mahoma grabbed hold of "the dagger and
tried to take it away from Murphy, but
was unsuccessful. It took' four officers to
hold him while he was being .searched,
and- he protested; in Russian; all the time
to Marquis,' who advised him jto be quiet.
Mahoma had $1000 in currency \ sewed in
his undervest and when M*urphy was try
ing to get It \u25a0; out he struggled fiercely,
but the . money was .procured. He had
altogether $1098 65 in; his possession. ?, ' . \u25a0
Mahoma was released on $50 cash bail
and Marquis declared that his arrest was
an outrage,: as. the dagger was not used
for offensive purposes, but to "cut up wood!
in their work of carving,: in which \they
were experts. " Both Dochada* and Ma
homa- were attired , in. the native f pictur
esque | costume of j the Circassians.
quis wanted Dochada released, as he said
he: would refuse to prosecute him, but
he had to put up ball for* his release and
was instructed to-be in the Police Court,
this morning with him or the ball would
be forfeited. ' *. i-Vii -V i ; -

resolutions were adopted! pertaining to

people from this coast. A bill to be passed
upon" by Congress ' was unanimously
adopted and -the executive committee
was empowered /to go further into the

P. H. McCarthy, president of, the Build

and set forth the J necessity of establish

to co-operate ? with the league : and help
to raise the '\u25a0funds 'necessary "to carry

made a motion to 'appoint a committee

Edward Anderson, treasurer: of the

argument ; in I favor of < the bill. . He im
pressed \ upon ' the league ; that this was
the biggest question ever undertaken \by
the I laboring people and unless they were
willing to dig down In their pockets and
furnish * the ... money to> pass the . bill it
would / certainly fail.
Many other members , spoke . upon the
question* and .ways and means ot getting

the 'plan of distributing literature on the
