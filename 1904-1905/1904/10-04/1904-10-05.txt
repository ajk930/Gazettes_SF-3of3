the menagerie in Central Park, to-day
when the saurians were transferred
from summer to winter quarters. With
two men at. his head and two others
behind him the alligator was lifted
'from the ground. ' . .
Angered by the touch of his keepers,
he began to struggle and before they
could get out of the inclosure.he had
freed himself of the. rope about his
jaws. With open mouth he started
toward Keeper Cook, who, with a yell
of alarm, jumped Into a pond, but not
before Critto had taken a bite "out of
his. leg. Critto was finally conquered

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 4.â ThÂ© first b*.
ennial report of the State Board of
Charities and Corrections, filed with
Governor Pardee to-day, recommends a
complete change In the present meth
ods of handling prisoners In this State.
The report says that both of the penal
institutions are overcrowded, there be
ing as many as five men kept In* ens
cell, and in both institutions there are
2378 prisoners confined in 878 cells. It
recommends that the Jute mill at San
Quentin be removed to Folsom and that
the San Quentin penitentiary be con*
verted into a reformatory for first of
fenders. It urgently requests an appro
priation by the Legislature for the en
largement of the Folsom prison by the
addition of a building containing 800
cells, and that all hardened criminals
be kept there.
The report declares that the Stats
prisons are in the most unsatisfactory
condition of any State institutions, and
that little good- can be said of them
except that the prisoners are clean and
well fed and that the officials* are doing
the -best they can under the circum
stances. It recommends legislative ac
tion restricting the use of the strait
jacket as a means of punishment In
penal institutions, and suggests that
It- be abolished entirely after the pro
posed changes are brought about. It
states that there is a tendency at San
Quentin to use severe punishment for
trivial offenses.
PORTLAND, Or., Oct. 41â With a

Is badly clawed up, but will recover.
In company with two friends Short
took a stroll in the hills back of town

Short separated from the' others and
in crossing the trunk of a fallen' tree
he slipped, the gun rolled down the
hill and the man landed squarely on a
bear's back: Bruin rose on his hind
legs and charged. . . '
Whipping out his ..hunting knife the
terrified man drove- it home and
by a miracle escaped - the out
stretched paws of the beast After a
duel in I which Short despaired many
times, he made a -lucky swing and
drove the knife - to Â¦ the wild beast's
heart.
His first appearance In politics was in

was active in organizing the Young
Men's Republican Club and was made

the early Puritan days. He had. his
early education in the town schools and
at Shelburne Falls Academy, from
which he graduated In 1859. .
He at once entered business life at
Northampton, Mass., but in September,
1863, moved to Milwaukee, WIs.; where

WASHINGTON, Oct. 4.â William A.
Day, Assistant Attorney General, had
a conference with the President to-day
about the various United States of
cials in Alaska, charged with corrup
tion and other offenses. Included in
this, number are two United States
Judges. Day has : just returned from
an extended visit to Alaska as the spe
cial representative of President Roose
velt. He was selected for this work
by Attorney General Knox, upon the
request of the President. Day spent
twelve weeks in Alaska, talking with
people of all classes, having hearings
and otherwise seeking to. learn the
truth as to the charges. At the same
time he has been investigating the con
ditions surrounding the administration
of justice in. the Territory and his visit
to the President | this morning was to
make a preliminary report.' g
Last June the four-year terms of two
of the Federal Judges in Alaska ex
pired and the question of giving them new
commissions came before the President.
For some time prior to this attacks and
charges against these two men, Judges
Melville., C. Brown and James-Wycker

Justice. *$ The ' attack?.^and,charges;be
Â¦ came'f requerit*iarifr ;* Wtter "and ' state

Whatever action, - if any, the Pres
ident may have' determined upon - Is
not known, but ' he will have further
conferences with Day before doing any
thing.
Deputy Health Officer Dr. M. J.
Brady, veterinarian of the Health
Board, and Deputy Health Officer
William Lendrum arrived on the
ecene and did what they could to re
lieve the sufferings of the stricken
brutes. As quickly as possible the in
jured cows were moved to the out
skirts of the debris and examined. It
â¢was found that they were suffering
from broken limbs and the health of
ficers grave the owners the alterna
tive of having them killed or turning
them over to the care of a veterina
rian. A pathetic instance occurred
when a baby calf whose leg had been
broken tried to struggle close to its
dying mother.
The cause of the accident was the
careless overloading of the hayloft.
The barn was over fifteen years old
and the rotting timbers were not able
to stand the weight placed upon
them. The owners estimate their loss
at $10,000. The neighboring dairies
have generously come to the assist
ance of the Excelsior ranch and will
supply its customers for a few days.
Meanwhile a call had been sent in
to Truck 9 of the Fire Department
and Captain Bannon and his men
soon responded. On their arrival at
the scene the firemen cleared away
the roof beams while the ranch hands
removed the bales of hay. When this
â¢work had been accomplished a pitiful
eight met the gase of the workers. The
cows were lying in regular rows in the
relative position they occupied before
the accident. The two center rows
â¢were almost instantly killed. The
cows In the outer rows, however,
â¢were not all dead, and the suffering
of the dumb animals was pitifuL
HEALTH OFFICERS ARRIVE.
It was a race against time to get at
the imprisoned men before they be
came smothered. The men were
finally pulled out of their prison in
the nick of t!me. Peter Labrucherie
was sent home, having sustained se
vere bruises. Jean Labrucherie re
ceived contusions of the right leg.
John Bruchou escaped unhurt and
was apparently no worse for his expe
rience.
In the meantime the neighboring
ranch hands, summoned by the noise
of the disaster, came running to the
rescue. Armed with axes and bars of
iron they chopped through beams and
pried 2 part bales in a desperate en
deavor to liberate the imprisoned
men. Others hitched teams of horses
to the roof beams and attempted to
remove the debris that covered the
place where the barn once stood.
RACE AGAINST TIME.
While the men lay imprisoned be
neath the girders that formed at once
their prison and their refuge they
could hear the moaning of the ani
mals caught beneath the fallen mass.
Slowly the sounds ceased as the hay
pressed down upon the imprisoned
ecttle and their life was choked out.
With a crash thai could be heard
for blocks around, an overloaded hay
loft in a cow barn belonging to the
Excelsior ranch at 400 Harvard street
In tie University Homestead district
fell to the ground yesterday morning
and three men narrowly escaped be
ing killed. The falling mass of tim
bers aud bales of hay crushed to the
earth sixty cows belonging to the
dairy, killing some outright, while the
rest were imprisoned and were smoth
ered to death by 150 tons of feed that
was in the loft. The men who were
near the door had just begun milking
when the loft fell. They were im
prisoned in a cache formed by door
posts and roof beams and were
chopped out by neighboring ranch
hands barely in time to escape meet
ing death by suffocation.
Yesterday morning at 9:30 o'clock
Jean Labrucherie and his brother Pe
ter, the owners of the Excelsior ranch
dairy, together with one of their
ranch hands, John Bruchou, entered
the stable and began the morning
milking. In the large barn that shel
ters the dairy cows were four rows of
milkers peacefully awaiting their turn
at the pail*. Suddenly the men heard
a slight ripping noise and noticed the
floor supports beginning to give way.
Tthey made a rush for the door, but
were too Jate. The nsyloft â came
crashing down with a deafening roar
and in an instant the barn became a
thambles.
NEW YORK, Oct. 4. â In Newark
this afternoon a ten-ton rolling blast
furnace filled with hot iron, which is
used for welding the Joints of a trolley
track, became unmanageable just after
passing Osborne Terrace In Clinton
avenue, and striking a heavy down
grade went down the hill for a quarter
of a mile at a terrific speed and imme
diately In the wake of a trolley car
bound toward the center of the city.
The raotorman put on full speed, but
the great mass of Iron and fire gained
steadily. When it seemed that a dis
astrous collision was Inevitable, ten
passengers jumped and sustained
slight bruises. The motorman and con
ductor stuck to their posts, the fur
nace still chasing the car.
After the race had gone on for a
quarter of a mile the big furnace
swerved from the eastbound to the
westbound track. Almost at the same
instant a westbound trolley car came
along, traveling at top speed as the
motorman had figured on passing the
menacing iron monster. Just as it
seemed as if his car would escape, the
big furnace gave another lurch toward
his track and he sprang backward into
the car as the crash came. The big
furnace hit the front end of the car
a blow., of .great if orce. A dozen pas
sengers on. this, car were thrown from
end to end and landed in a.heap^men
and women, badly frightened and
more or less bruised. While all were
thrown, none was injured beyond a
few cuts and bruises.
, The last official caller to inquire as
to ' Payne's.. Condition? was ; President
Roosevelt, and he. had been'gone only
about ten minutes when 'the stricken
member of his Cabinet expired. As Mr.
Roosevelt was leaving he spoke feel
ingly of Payne to the newspaper men
gathered in front of the hotel as "the
sweetest, most lovable and most trust
ful man I ever knew."
Around Payne's bedside at the time
of death were his devoted wife, Dr.
Dunlap, pastor of St. John's Episco
pal Church; Major and Mrs.^V. S.
Cameron of Jamestown, K. Y. ; Mr. and
Mrs. Winfield Cameron of Milwaukee.
Charles L. Jones and Miss - Louisa

Whitney, Miss Mary Barleyert, an old
companion of Mrs- Payne; Mr. and
Mrs. W. L. Mason of Washington, 'old
time friends of Mr. and Mrs. Payne,
and the faithful colored messenger at
the department of the Postmaster Gen
eral.
When Payne had breathed his last
Dr. Magruder led Mrs. Payne out of
the room. It was stated that she had
stood up bravely under the heavy
strain.
Funeral services will be held at St.
John's Episcopal Church in this city
next Friday morning and at 3:16 o'clock
that afternoon the body will be taken
to the Pennsylvania Railroad station
and placed . aboard the private car of
President A. J. Earllng- of the Chicago,

nounced' that it would be here by to
morrow morning. The remains will
arrive at Milwaukee Saturday and ser
vices will be held there next Sunday.
Further plans for the funeral will k be
decided upon to-morrow.â
Payne had been in poor health for
at least two years, but his last illness
covered only seven days; an attack of
heart trouble last week precipitating
the end at a time, when, after a rest,
he seemed to have recovered a small
measure of the vitality impaired by
years of arduous labor. Death this
afternoon . came after ' nearly { six hours
of unconsciousness. , *

Arrested in San Jose.
Charles Coulter was arrested in San
Jose yesterday by Detective Taylor on
a warrant charging him with robbery-
Coulter Is accused of having stolen a
$225 diamond stud from Henry Young
of 3237 Harrison street. The alleged
theft occurred on an Oak street car on
Sunday, October 2, as Young was on
hia way to the beach.
A modern group closed the pro
gramme, with Sternberg. Rubinstein,'
Leschetltzky, Liszt and Hofmann him
self represented. Hofmann's contribu
tion was his tone paean, "Through the
Clouds," .deftly fashioned,' with a cap
tivating melody, surrounded by a nim
bus of arpeggi. He declined an encore
to it and plunged hlto a brilliant -bra-?
vura rendering of the "Don Juan'* fan- :
tasie. The audience, applauded itself
hoarse and lame and then went' home
To-morrow night the next recital will
be given. - . Â¦
BLANCHE PARTINGTON
Engaging . as ever with his boyish
smile and modest, awkward little bow,
Hofmann walked on to a lovely and
brilliantly logical reading of the E mi
nor prelude and Fugue of Mendelssohn.
Scarlatti, with his Pastorale (E minor)
and Gapriscio (E major), given with
delicate, whimsical grace, followed,
and then came the Waldstein Sonata.
Mr. Hofmann is in splendid technical
form this yearâ as always. Nowhere,
not even in that technical debauch that
ended the programme, the Liszt "Don
Juan," was this more in evidence than
in the Waldstein. But the pianist was
not in his full best Beethoven mood.
Hypercriticism awax, however, the de
mand for that absolutism of sympathy
that marked his Chopin stuff, 'twas a
regal rendering.
The Chopin group included the Noc
turne in E flat major â the other one,
its intertwining melodies most subtly
limned;, the E minor valse, the rarest
of fantasy; the Berceuse, a Mazurka
and the ;. immortal scherzo. Encored
lustily, 'the* pianist gave splendidly the
F sharp major impromptu. . Â»
I have not before heard Mr. Hofmarin
play in this wise. I have never before
heard the scherzo so played. It had
the supreme temperamental beauty,
the depth, exaltation, passion, that the
pianist to me has always fallen just
short of.. It. was memorable in the
fashion that Harold Bauer's Schumann
playing is memorable of, 41ke lyric
fascination.
Josef Hofmann told me yesterday
that if he had the choice he would
give bnly programmes that represented
his mood, classical, romantic, modern,
as the case might be. The pianist was
distinctly in romantic mood last night,
when he gave the" first of his three. re-,
citals of the week. The Alhambra was
not crowded, but after "the p*layer's :
Chopin group one did not miss a.thou
sand or so people out of the applause.'
Until he came to HiOne had felt .ever
so little of matter-of-factness in the
atmosphere. With- - the scherzo . that
crowned the group one saw the won

ALBANY, N. Y., Oct. 4. â David B.
Hill made his first speech in the Dem

Democratic Club marched to the hall
in a body and there was a large at
tendance of Albany Democrats. . The
speech was. devoted, to. an attack upon
the. course pursued by President
Roosevelt in connection with the Pan
ama canal treaty and the revolution
which resulted in the > : secession - of
Panama from the republic of Colom
bia. Hill declared that the Republi
can platform adopted -at Chicago did
not commend the "big stick" diplo
macy of Presidenf Roosevelt. It
merely said that the possession of a
route is now an accomplished fact and
that work on a canal "is at last begun
andit is due to the Republican party."
The essence of the reproach of the
President made in the Democratic na
tional platform, the speaker contend
ed, is that he has, as President, been
"lawless" In the sense of American
law and International law. The Dem
ocratic platform intended to assert
that President Roosevelt did in the
Panama affair violate plain treaty ob
ligations, plain international usages
and the constitution of the United
States.

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 4.â The War
Office has received the following dis
patch from General SaKharoff dated
October 3:
"At dawn of October 1 a squadron
of Japanese cavalry twice attempted
to break through the line of advance
posts of Cossacks of the guard in the
district between Khuankhuandia and
Fongtiapu. Both attempts were un
successful. Two sotnias of our cavalry
reinforced the advance posts and the
Japanese were disoersed.
"Toward noon the same day one bat
talion of the Japanese advance guard,
with two or three squadrons of caval
ry, renewed the offensive movement
against a regiment of Cossacks. The
tiring lasted until nightfall. General
Mistchenkb sent reinforcements to the
aid of the Cossacks and toward even-
Ing the enemy was repulsed at ail
points, the whole line retreating to
ward Siallonkhetzy, pursued by our
cavalry.
"Captain Tolstoukine. commander of
a sotnia, ambushed one of the enemy's
patrols at Konschautxy. One Japanese
officer was killed-
"In the positions abandoned by the
Japanese our Cossacks found a number
of cartridges and medical stores and
also a few dead horses. â¢ We had two
ofBeers and two Cossacks wounded.
"The 6am'; day & Japanese force of
one battalion and a half and a. squadron
of cavalry attacked in tnree divisions
our outposts between the Hun River
and the railway. Toward evening this
movement was checked with the help
of another company, which reinforced
the outposts. One Cossack was killed
and one wounded.
"One Russian patrol dispersed two
Japanese patrols in the vicinity of
Tchjantan. on the right bank of. the
Hun River, taking three Japanese
prisoners.
"Another Russian patrol sent in an
easterly direction discovered Tawang
hau Pass occupied by two hundred
Chinese bandits commanded by Japan
ese officers. During the reconnaissance
one Cossack was killed."

ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 4. â Each
day it becomes more evident that the
next battle \vill take place at Tieling,
aud not at Mukden. The deliberation
shown by General Kuropaikin in re
plying-, which is only equaled by the
leisurely advance of the Japanese, is
puzzling the Russians.
The lack of news accounts for the
prolific crop of dispatches sent from
here telling of the imaginary intrigues
against Alexieff and General Kuropat
kin: This backstair gossip, which an
noyed the correspondents at the start,
is now eagerly copied and is even
given editorial comment in English
papers. It is published one! day and
contradicted next. . !!*'-*'
Apropos of this. Novoe Trempa
publishes a curious special dispatch
dated Chefu of the arrival at that
place of a police captain, who es
caped from Port Arthur. He tells of
the awful conditions prevailing in
th*> fortress. It appears that the
Melinite shells used by the Japanese
in shelling Fort Kuropatkin had
feaiful effect. It was the capture of
this fort that enabled the Japanese
to cut off the water supply.

and German naval attaches at Port
Arthur, respectively Lieutenant de
Cuverville and Captain von Gilgen
heim, were assassinated by the Japan

Chinese junk. The statement says that
no' such junk has been captured and
that the most careful inquiries at To

close the whereabouts of the attaches.

NEW YORK, Oct. 4. â Every effort
is being made by the officials in the
navy yard to narrow down the num
ber of employes who, by reason of
their work, had access to that portion
of the hull -of the Connecticut that
was' punctured.
"The men now all know that the
suspect Is within their ranks, for there
has been none discharged since the
perpetration of the outrage," said
Naval Constructor Baxter. "I fully
expect that they will ferret him out.
for their indignation is high and
every man's actions are now watched
by the others in the gang in which he
is employed.
"As to the identity of the person
who drove the spike into the launch
ing ways, there is no reason why
others besides a regular diver should
have done it. Where the sDike was
found the water iÂ«j about three feet
deep at low water, and as we have no
suspicion of the divers employed here
we .believe the bolt was placed there
by some one who is familiar with

Baptist denominations and conferences
in various parts of the country. .
Two mass-meetings under the aus
pices of the congress were held to
night. At one was considered the work
of The Hague tribunal. Oscar Strauss,
formerly United" States Minister to
Turkey and "a member of The Hague
court, presided. Strauss advocated a
revision of The Hague treaty so that it
might be rendered certain that when
nations enter into a struggle some one
of them would take the initiative in re
ferring their differences to The Hague
tribunal. ,
Edwin D. Mead, the ehalrman-of the
organization committee of the congress,
delivered the opening address of the
meeting, speaking an earnest word in
favor of the reduction -of great navies
and a general disarmament among na
tions. . -
Robert Treat Paine Sr. of Boston was
elected president of the congress, and
Dr. Benjamin F. Trueblood, also of this
city, secretary.
Responses were made by one delegate
from each of the countries represented
at the Congress, including Alderman
Thomas Snape of Liverpool for Great
Britain. Snape referred particularly, to
Secretary of State Hay's appearance at
yesterday's peace meeting: as the repre

occasion to remark, uoon what an as
tounding thing it would be considered
in England did the British Minister of
Foreign Affairs officially represent
Great Britain at a similar meeting.

PLEDGED TO SECRECY.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 5. "1:15 a. m.
Official advices from the Far East
given out this morning describe a se
ries of skirmishes on the southern front
of General Kuropatkin's army, the only
importance of which lies in the fact
that the Japanese are showing a dispo
sition to press forward and feel out the
Russian position. General Mistchenko's
Cossacks In every case drove back the
opposing forces.
The activity of the Japanese outposts
is doubtless intended to screen move
ments of their armies, and therefore
may be regarded as precursory symp
toms of final preparations for an ad
vance, which probably will begin with
in a week.
A special messenger has brought to
the Emperor General Kuropatkin's full
report of the battle of Llaoyang. The
messenger, who submitted to an inter
view, declares that the main army is
concentrated at Tie Pass and that it is
not likely t General Kuropatkin will
make a determined stand at Mukden.

IXTEEESTIXG FACTS.
For Nearly Emy Man, Wom&a or Ciild.
A short time ago we published an ar-
ticle recommending to our readers the
new discovery for the cure of Dyspep-
sia, called Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
and the claims then made regarding
the wonderful curative properties of
the remedy have been abundantly sus-
tained by the facts. People who were
cautious about trying new remedies
advertised In the newspapers and were
finally induced to grive Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets a trial were surprised
and delighted at the results. In many
cases a single package costing but 50
cents at any drug store made a com-
plete cure and in every instance tho
most beneficial results were reported.
From a hundred or more received we
have space to publish only a few of
the latest, but assure our readers we
receive so many commendatory letters
that we shall publish each week a fresh
list of genuine, unsolicited testimo-
nials and never publish the same one
twice.
From James Temmeisler. La Crosse.
Wls.: Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets aro
doing me more good than anything I
ever tried and I was bo pleased at re-
sults that I gave away several boxes to
my friends, who have also had tho
same benefits, v-*'
From Jacob Anthony, Portmurray,
New Jersey: I have taken Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets with the best re-
sults. I had Dyspepsia for 6 years
.and had taken a great deal of medicine,
but the Tablets seem to take right a
hold and I feel good. I am a farmer
and lime burner and I heartily recom-
mend to everyone who has any troubla
with his stomach to use these Tablets.
From Mrs. M. K. West. Preston.
Minn.; I have received surprisingly
good effects from using Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets. I gave one-half of my
last box to a friend who also suffered
from indigestion and she had the same
good results.
From Mrs. Agnes K. Ralston. Cadil-
lac, Mich.: I have been taking Stuart's,
Dyspepsia Tablets and I am very much
better, and feel very grateful for the
great benefit I have received in so short
a. time.
' Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a cer-
tain cure for all forms of Indigestion.
They are not claimed to be a cure-all,
but are prepared for stomach troubles
only, and physicians and druggists
everywhere recommend them to all per-
sons suffering from Nervous Dyspep-
â¢ sla, sour or add stomach, heartburn,
bloating or wind on stomach and siml-
lar disorders.

CHICAGO, Oct. 4?â Leonore Fresnel
Loree, the highest salaried railroad
president in the world, suddenly re
signed to-day as executive head of the
Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Com
pany and the St. Louis and San Fran
cisco Railway. His retirement came at
the conclusion of a series of stormy
sessions with the owners of the Rock
Island properties, lasting through an
entire week and at which radical dif
ferences regarding policies developed
and failed of adjustment.
Loree's resignation came as a sensa
tional surprise to the railroad world.
Nine months ago he was induced to
leave the presidency of the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad by the payment of
a cash bonus of $500,000 and a five-year
contract, insuring, him an annual sal
ary of $75,000. This contract provided
that in the event of his leaving the
service of the Rock Island his salary
should continue during. the life- of the
contract and ihat in case of his death
his wife should receive it.
At meetings of the- two companies
held here * to-day Robert Mather was
elected chairman of the executive com
mittee of the Chicago, Rock Island and
Pacific Railway Company, and, B. N.
Yoakum chairman of the executive
committee of the St. Louis and San
Francisco Railway Company. Loree
also resigned as president and director
of the Rock Island Company, of New
Jersey, and Mather was elected to suc
ceed him. Â¦"Â¦ ' .
The Record-Herald to-morrow morn
ing, referring to the resignation of L.
F. Loree as, president of the Rock Isl
and Railway, system, will state that
Loree's resignation came after a battle
between Loree, supreme executive head
of the Rock' Island system, - and
Winchell, president of the Rock Island
Railway, whose methods "and | policies
have been diametrically opposed from
the beginning. The policy outlined and
advocated by Winchell won the day,
and hereafter he will be the sole execu
tive head of the system, Â» with power
subordinate only to the owners.

REDDING, Oct. 4.â A drunken Indian
Tvho started to shoot up the town of
Junction City, Trinity County, on Sun
day, was pursued into the hills by
an armed posse with whom he ex
changed twenty shots without any one
getting hit- The Indian is now In Jail
at Weaverville.
He became crazed from firewater on
Sunday afternoon and stole a rifle and
a box of cartridges from the Gribble
Hotel at Junction City. Going to the
hill back of the building he began
shooting into the hotel windows. For
tunately the bullets hit no one, au
though wrecking much furniture.
The men of the little town armed
themselves with Winchesters and
started after the Indian. He greeted
them with a shot from his rifle as he
took to his heels through the woods.
As many as twenty shots were ex
changed, but no one was hit. The chase
was finally given up.
Sheriff Bergin found no trouble in
effecting the Indian's arrest yesterday
at a wickiup down the Trinity River
from Junction City, as the Indian had
sobered up.

Very short and simple 1b the cere
mony when Uncle Sam takes over a
new war vessel and adds her to his
navy. There is no burst of eloquence â
not even a burst of gunpowder.
The commanding officer of the new
ship calls the officers and crew to mus
ter and reads to them his orders direct
ing him to take charge of the vessel.
Nobody objects and the flags are hoist
ed, the national ensign aft, the union
jack, with its white stars in a blue
field, forward, the captain's long pen
nant at the main truck amidships.
Then, and only then, is the vessel in
commission and authorized to wage
war if necessary in the country's de
fense. These flags must be unfurled
and visible between 8 a. m. and sun
down until the ship has completed her
cruise and goes out of commission or is
laid up for repairs.
Yesterday morning the battleship
Ohio was towed out in the bay from
the Union Iron Works and anchored.
For several days the officers and crew
have been gathered on board, 300 of the
men coming down from Mare Island
Monday. Two coal barges are now
alongside filling the ship's bunkers with
fuel for the great furnaces.
The Ohio is not nice to look upon
fresh from the hands of the builders.
Workmen and crew have been putting
in their time forming her, arming. her,
but not cleaning her. When her 570
sailors get their bags and hammocks
stowed on board they will be piped to
scrub paintwork, and when they finish
the Ohio will be the color of a snow
bank.
At noon Captain L. C. Logan and of
ficers and crew took their places among
the cases and other litter of the quar
terdeck, and as the new commander
read his orders from the Secretary of
the Xavy the silk ensign presented to
the ship by the Ohia Society was hoist
ed. Captain Logan was born - in the
queenly State whose name the battle
ship bears â a most appropriate appoint
ment. He graduated from Annapolis in
18C7. The date of his . present rank is
July 11,-1902, and he is forty-nine on the
list of eighty-two captains.
The other officers of the battleship
are: Lieutenant Commander W. D.
Buchanan, another Ohio man, . gradu

Following the barbecue held at Grid
ley celebrating the opening of the
Butte County canal, which will irrigate
215,000 acres of land, there will be an
other barbecue at Winters. Yolo Coun
ty, on October 8, to note the flooding
of a canal which will Irrigate 100,000
acres of land. ' The canal begins in the
Capay Valley, taking its waters from
Cuche Creek.
The canal, so reports the California
Promotion Committee, is forty feet in
width and carries a six-foot head of
water. It bears almost due south un
til it reaches the corporate limits of
Winters. Its course is along the foot
hills of the Coast Range and it lies
high enough to make its waters avail
able for acre of soil to the west
ward.- With the exception of a limit
ed orchard area at Esparto, almost all
the lands are now devoted to grain and
6ome of them have been cropped for
half a century. At Winters the canal
turns eastward. Going through some
of the .best orchards in California, it
approaches the northern bank of Pu
tah Creek and continues west to Davia
ville.
The present source of supply of water
for irrigation in Tolo County is Cache
Creek, which has its rise in the moun
tains of Lake and Colusa counties. Its
principal and most reliable source is
Clear Lake, which occupies about
eight square miles of Lake County, and
has a watershed of about 420 square
miles.
It is also fed during the winter and
early summer months by the north
branch of Cache Creek, which, with its
tributaries, gives a continuous flow of
water through nearly eight months in
the year, estimated at from 300 to 1200
cable feet per second. Clear Lake lies
about eighty miles north of San Fran
cisco, in one of the valleys of the
Coast Range at an elevation of 1325
feet above sea level. From the mouth
of the land to the head of Capay Valley
nature has forced a gorge thirty miles
in length, a natural canal to conduct
the waters to the valleys below. The
outlet from the lake into Cache Creek
Canyon, for six months in the year,
is estimated to carry 500 cubic feet per
second or more.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 4.â Preventive- legis
lation was the subject which opened
the discussion at" the second day's ses
sion of the International Congress on
Tuberculosis. The speakers told of
ways and means that might be en
forced through legislation for the pre
vention of infection and the spread of
consumption. The, session was opened
with an address "by Clark Bell, L.L.D.,
of New Tork. In the following resolu
tion, which was adopted, the main pur
poses for which the congress convened
are outlined: .
Resolved, That it. is the sense of the Ameri
can International Congress of Tuberculosis that
it is the Imperative duty of all civilized gov
ernments to take Immediate action for the
arrest of the spread of this scourge. And fur
ther, that it is the sense of this congress that
every government should appoint a Commis
sioner of Public Health, with a seat In the
Cabinet, empowered with adequate authority
and means to suppress tuberculosis.
Much discussion arose over the ques
tion of establishing municipal sanita
riums, as an outgrowth of. which the
following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That it is the duty of government
authorities to promote the establishment and
maintenance of municipal sanitariums in which
the tuberculosis patients may be Isolated from
their relatives and the public, and where they
may be placed under suitable conditions for
the cure or arrest of the disease.
Resolutions were adonted to the fol
lowing effect: That it Is the duty of
the health boards to repress this dis
ease; that to facilitate the early diag
nosis of this disease it is the duty of
every municipality to provide labora
tory facilities for the microscopic and
bacteriologic examination of sputa, and
that systematic efforts be made for the
education of the public in relation to
the curability of tuberculosis through
the circulation of pamphlets, the hold
ing of health conventions and the or
ganization of local and State societies
for the suppression of the disease.
Dr. N. Foster of Sacramento was
made a member of the committee on
resolutions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
IOWA FALLS, Iowa., Oct. 4â With
her employer driven insane by worry
over the shortage of $40,000 and her
own lips sealed by the advice of her
counsel, Mrs. Maud Hamilton, the pret
ty stenographer, still falls to produce
the much wanted books of the Iowa
Lillioett Gold Dredgring Company. B.
B. Bliss, the insane manager and sec
retary of the company, is now repre
sented by a guardian. Tremendous ex
citement prevails among the stockhold
ers, but the stenographer continues to
serenely enjoy her numerous luxuries,
while outsiders wonder how she can
provide so handsomely for herself on a
salary of $60 a month.
Mrs. Hamilton decided late this after
noon to make a statement regarding
the shortage in the funds of the com
pany. She declares that she knew of
the shortage a long time ago and that
she is innocent of any wrongdoing.
She admits that she has spent a great
deal of money, but she says she has
made it legitimately by scalping the
stock of the company on account of
inside tips which she has been able to
secure by reading the mail which pass
ed through her hands.
Here is the story of the bubble: Or
ganized two years ago, the company
sold stock for five cents a share. One
hundred thousand dollars was spent in
machinery. Another company, called
the Hawkeye, was organized. Stock
went up to eighty cents a share. The
manager^ and the stenographer gave
pink teas, bought diamonds and opera
cloaks and the Iowa Kalis people be
gan to talk. A check for $16,000, issued
by the company, was refused; the di
rectors were hurriedly called together
and a guardian asked for tHe manager.
Expert accountants* were then employ
ed and the stock, dropped to 1 cent a
share. â¢
That a complete and unwhitewashed
investigation and exposure of the man
agement of the company's business is
to be made at once was announced
to-day by President Charles T. Han
cock, and S. G. Hurd of Dubuque. gen

PR. "KILMEirS SWAMP-ROOT.
A LETTER TO OUR READERS
53 Cottage St. Melrose, Mass.
Dear Sir: Jan. 11th. 1904.
"Ever since I was in the Army. I had
more or less kidney trouble, and within
the past year it became so severe and
complicated that I suffered everything
and was much alarmed â my strength
and power were fast leaving me. I law
an advertisement of Swamp-Root and
wrote asking for advice. I began the
use of the medicine and noted a decided
Improvement after taking Swamp-Root
only a short time.
"1 continued Its use and am thankful
to say that I am entirely cured and
strong. In order to be very sure about
this, I had a doctor examine some of my
water to-day and he pronounced it all
right and in splendid condition.
-I know that your Swamp-Root Is
purely vegetable and does not contain
any harmful drugs. Thanking: you for
my complete recovery and recommending
Swamp-Root to all sufferers I am."
Very truly yours.
I. C. RICHARDSON.
You may have a sample bottlA of thia
wonderful remedy. Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, sent absolutely free by mall, also
a book telling all about Swamp-Root. If
you are already convinced that Swamp-
Root is what you need, you can purchase
the regular flfty-cent and one-dollar size
bottles at the drug stores everywhere.
Don't make any mistake, but remember
the name. Swamp-Root. Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, and the address. Bingham-

first, result*, of the. return of Secretary
Hay to Washington* v.as the closing up
of the incident growing out of the ar
rest of Secretary Gurney of the British
Embassy at IÂ«ee, Mass. The Secretary
concluded that entirely too much im

Hay Ends the Gurney Case.
A decision In a suit against .William
Branin, a case the outcome of which
had been anticipated by Branin with
such disappointment that he commit
ted suicide yesterday morning, was to
have been handed down by Judge Ells
worth to-day. The court continued the
matter for a week, however, the death
of Branin so changing the circum
stances of the case that the. decision,
already prepared and ready for deliv
ering, wiir need to be changed.
The matter will now be put In the
hands of the administrator of Branin's
estate when that official Is appointed,
with the other claims and property be
longing to Branin.
Branin had sought to have his claim
for $1500, loaned to Captain William
Roberts, who went Into insolvency,
made a preferred claim. The court in
timated some time ago that this plea
of Branin's would be denied. His fail
ure to secure such preference Is be
lieved to have created the despondency
which culminated in the suicide yester
day, when he cut his throat with a
razor. -V.-'--

The decorations at the Howard luncheon
were also very elaborate and beautiful, a trel
lis of blackberry vines forming a canopy over
the table, while tall hollyhocks grouped about
the room gave It the appearance of a quaint
old garden. On each place card, adorned with
pansles and marigolds in water colors, was a
verse from an original poem by Shafter How

and at each the appointments were both elab
orate and artistic. Mrs. R,equa is never so
happy as when entertaining and the hospital

BITS OF SOCIETY.
ISBCRETABT AND TWO OF THE
ORGANIZERS Â¦ OP THE STREET
CARMEN'S CLUB. â¢
letic and social club. General Manager
W. F. Kelly is the originator of the
idea, and he has offered on behalf of
the corporation to fit up all the Bpare
space in the general office building, at
San Pablo avenue and Twentieth street,
as an athletic club for the benefit of
the carmen and other employes of the
company.
It is proposed to utilize the entire
second story of the building tor the
various departments of the club, in
cluding billiard, pool and. card rooms,
a reading-room, lunchroom and gym
nasium. ,,In.;. the -j long -annex: of the
building, where the cable machinery of
the old power station formerly stood,
a bowling alley. and a shooting gallery
will be installed, and a part of the
space now occupied by the line repair
department and stable will be divided
off for a bath and wash room. Adjoin
ing this will be one of the locker rooms,
and another will be built on the second
floor adjoining the gymnasium.
Plans for the construction are well
under way. The company hopes to have
the clubrooms ready by the last of De
cember. The work of fitting up the
rooms will be done at the expense of
the company, and the use of the build-
Ing will not only be given to the mem
bers of the club free, but. the corpora
tion will buy the furniture and ap
paratus and install and maintain the
lights. . The only expense to the mem
bers will be the salaries of a janitor,
porter and other servants.
The carmen and other employes* have
received the proposition enthusiastical
ly, and committees have been appoint
ed to draft by-laws and to formulate
plans for the organization of the club.
These committees met last night and
discussed a plan of organization. The
committee on organization voted to be
gin work at once on all the different
lines of the company In' order to per

Before deciding on Its recommenda
tion last night the committee had dis
cussed one or two -of the items pro
posed for the bond issue and decided
to eliminate those calling for $166,000
for sewers and $100,000 for a city hall
on the ground that they could be built
at some future time.
BERKELEY, Oct. 4.â "What prompt
ed the Citizens' Bond Committee to
recommend â¢ postponement of the
much-talked-of bond election last
night?" is a question that was fre
quently heard on the streets to-day.
'The decision was so unexpected that
few. people, unless they had devoted
particular attention to the problem,
Were unable to answer.
The principal reason for the com
mittee's action is thought to have
been the lesson taught by the recent
disastrous attempt to float bonds in
Oakland. That the defeat of the bonds
in Oakland has left a deep feeling of
distrust everywhere there can be no
gainsaying. It. was the general opin
ion last nifirht that the moral effect is
so great that It would be incurring a
great risk to submit a bonding proposi
tion in Berkeley at this time, although
there never has been any question but
the town needs the improvements
suggested. '
i Professor Carl C Plehn. r chairman
of the meeting. Dr. P. F. C. Blehl,
Alan G. Clarke. Dr. W. A. E. Knowles
and Victor Robertson of the commit
tee were all of the opinion that to hold
a bond election so soon after the ex
perience of Oakland with bonds would
not be based on sound Judgment. A
bond election would cost $1500, a sum
the town can ill afford to lose in the
present state of its finances.
"It would be taking a great risk,"
said Professor Plehn. "I do not be
lieve the people are ready to vote
bonds right after the Oakland de
cision."

Suit was' commenced to-day by Ed
ward R. McDonnell of Alameda
against his aged uncle, Powell A. Mc-
Donnell, to quiet title to a ranch of
twenty-two acres situated on Bay
Farm 'Island, which the younger man
claims as his by virtue of a gift deed
made out to him by his relative a year
ago when the latter thought that he
was about to die. r E.- R. McDonnell
is in possession of the document and
wants the land. P. A- McDonnell is
enjoying restored health and desires
to dispose of the realty for $10,000.
When the elder McDonnell, who is
76 years of age and who has lived on
Bay Farm Island for fifty years, was
stricken with what he feared would
be fatal illness, Attorney M. W. Simp
son was summoned and at the request
of the patient drew up the deed. Some
months after this the old gentleman
recovered from his sickness and, it is
said, became displeased at his nephew
and decided to transfer the ranch to
another nephew, Jamea. McDonnell, a
member of the local Police Depart
ment. *
: The pioneer farmer visited an attor
ney and during the conference the
name "P. A. McDonnell." affixed to
the original gift deed, was torn oft
with the exception of the first initial
letter. This mutilated instrument Is
the one in possession of E. R. Mc-
Donnell, who believes that the paper
entitles him to the ranch and has.
through his attorney, R. B. Tappan,
asked the Superior Court to decide
the matter.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 4. â Demand has
been made by*the City Trustees upon
Superintendent G. A. Wiese of the Mu
nicipal Electric Light and Power Plant
for his resignation. He has requested
that he be allowed a delay before act
ing, awaiting the return of City Trus
tee Dr. H. M. Pond from St. Louis.
This has been granted and the change
In the superintendency will not be
made until the arrival home of that
official. . . Xy^:-
Repeated misunderstandings between
City Trustee William M. Bowers, chair
man of the electric light plant .commit
tee, and Superintendent Wiese over
questions pertaining to the operation of
the works are the direct cause of the
demand for the latter's resignation. In
speaking of the matter Mr. Bowers
said:"
We have demanded Wiese's resignation and
a majority of the City Trustees have acceptea
my belief that the present superintendent la
not the map for the place. He has asked
that . he be 'permitted . to talk with Dr. Pond
before he decides what to do. Dr. Pond Is
now out of town and it Is not probable that
we will take any action until he returns. HÂ»
agreed with me that Wlese's removal is neces
sary, and 1 feel that I have carried my point
that we musÂ»t have a superintendent at the
head of our municipal light plant who will
do what he is told.
Despite her â¢ prayers and entreaties
to be allowed to die, Mrs. Sarah
Graves has been brought back from
the gates of death, through the efforts
of physicians and nurses, in attend
ance upon her, at the Receiving Hos
pital. She was pronounced out of
danger to-day by Dr. Emerson, though
she is not yet perfectly rational. Mrs.
Graves declares that she wiy attempt
suicide again as soon as she is re
leased.
The gas Inhaled by the desperate
woman last Monday afternoon in her
home, 1116 East Thirteenth street,
would ordinarily have caused death,
but the prompt and effective measures
adopted by the authorities saved her.
This morning she gave the first signs
that she realized her condition.
"Why didn't you let me die?" she
cried, and then came waitings and
calls for pity from those whom she
fancied were persecuting her.
Mrs. Graves had been made desper
ate, apparently, by the coupling of her
name in two divorce actions, in both
of which she was accused of conduct
unbecoming a wife. Her husband,
Frederick Graves, sued her for divorce
ten days ago, alleging infidelity, and
she -was named as co-respondent in
Mrs. W. H. Smith's suit for divorce, a
month ago. Graves has not visited
his wife since her attempt at suicide,
nor communicated with the hospital,
where she lay for hours in a .precari
ous condition. -;'â¢: .-.; '

IklTDNTGHT FLAMES
THREATEN TWO LIVES
The Frye residence was at Webster
street and Benvenue avenue, in such
an isolated part of town that there
were nsne to warn the family of their
danger. It was not until after the fire
had eaten away a portion of the
liitchen that Miss McVean was awak
ened, the hour being 3 o'clock. The
noise of the crackling wood and the
stifling- smoke drove sleep away at the
critical moment and then the heroic
qualities In the girl developed. After
rescuing the family Miss McVean hur
ried to a telephone and called for the
Fire Department.
By the time the firemen arrived the
Frye house and the one next door, be
longing to Robert and John Davis,
were a mass of flames and too far gone
to be saved with the limited apparatus
at hand. The buildings burned to the
jrround because there was little hose
and less water, emphasizing the need
for fire fitting equipment In Berkeley.
The total loss was JSOOO.
Rising to the emergency In a moment
of danger Miss Mina McVean turned
heroine last night and eaved her par
ents and two children from a dwelling
that was being rapidly burned. Not a
bit frightened by the nre that crackled
overhead. Miss McVean hustled her
stepfather and mother, Sir. and Mrs. H.
D. Frje, out of a sound sleep and then
grabbing their little children, Louis and
Grace Frye. from their cribs hurried
Â¦with them through the smoke to the
street and to safety. A moment lost
might have cost the lives of the en
tire family.

He asserted, however, that his sister,
Mrs. Roche, now dead, had told him
about the child and that Edward Don
nelly had told him that he had advised
John Dolbeer to send his daughter to
a sanitarium.
ANOTHER WILL MENTIONED.
Schander had never heard that Miss
Dolbeer had made a will before the
one admitted to probate until he heard
William Mugan so testify at the taking
of a deposition. The will was sealed
and put in a safe and Mugan did not
know what had become of it. Schander
admitted that he had no information
that the will was different from the
second one except that he was told so
by his attorneys and the statement was
included in the affidavit.
It tocrk an hour's time to read the
affidavit to the court. In the purpose
to show that the contestant's attorneys
had used diligence in forwarding their
case and prosecuted their investiga
tions unremittingly the recital com
menced with the fact of Miss Dolbeer's
death on July 9 and followed each pro
ceeding up to the present time. """"
It was set forth that Schander, at the
beginning of the case, did not know the
circumstances surrounding the execu
tion of the will or the life of Miss Dol
beer for two years prior to her death.
Miss Warren's deposition was neces
sary to enlighten him on certain mat
ters and some of the names and cir
cumstances she mentioned tad not
been known of by him before. Other
information, relating to what evidence
certain persons might give, was re
ceived subsequently from agents em
ployed in New York, London, Paris and
San Francisco and upon the receipt of
such information due haste was used
in applying for orders to take deposi
tions.
The depositions in New York are to
be taken on October 13 and it is nec
essary, says the affidavit, for Hiram
Johnson to go there. But the deposi
tions of Popendick and Miss Pflugel,
employes on the Deutschland, cannot
be taken until the 21st of this month
because the ship will not be in New
York harbor until that date.
EXPECTED EVIDENCE.
In setting forth, seriatim, what cer-
Schander had a free and easy way of
responding to Mr. Pillsbury's questions
and declared" that he had no personal
knowledge of the facts alleged in his
affidavit, but that they had been re
ported to him by his attorneys. He
had not personally made any investi
gations in the case, but had trusted
everything to the Messrs. Johnson. He
admitted that the purpose of getting
the deposition of Miss Warren was to
find a basis for his case and that the
names mentioned by her in her exami
nation .were of the persons whose depo
sitions were to be taken, though he did
not know what the persons would tes
tify to. "If they don't know anything
they can't tell anything" was his epi
grammatical way of putting it. When
asked if he thought he was entitled to
a continuance, he replied that he saw
no reason for "railroading the thing
through."
Up to the time of retaining Johnson
& Johnson and starting the investiga
tion, Schander had gathered all of his
information about the death of Miss
Dolbeer and the contents of the will
from the newspapers. He had, he said,
received a postal from a man named
Schnltt, of whom he had never before
heard, telling him. that he could get
some information from the New , York
Coroner. This postal came early in
August.
Mr. Pillsbury ; questioned him about
his . acquaintance with his . niece.. He
said that he had, known her from the
time she was born until she was three
yearsTold.' Then "he went away and
after ? she grew to " be a young ' lady he
only knew her by sight and- when they
The trial w,as set for yesterday, but,
on behalf of the contestant, Attorney
Hiram W. Johnson made a motion for
a continuance. Attorney E. S. Pills
bury, representing Administrator Wil
liam G. Mugan, and flanked by Attor
neys Garret McEnerney and W. F.
Williamson, representing Etta Marion
Warren and Administrator George D.
Gray, was ready for trial and demand
ed that Mr. Johnson should make a
showing in support of his motion.
Johnson thereupon read a twenty
five page affidavit, signed by Schander,
and for the first time it was made pub
lic that the contestant expects to gain
some sort of support from witnesses in
New York, Paris and elsewhere, whose
depositions have been ordered taken by
the court. The uncle of unfortunate
Bertha Dolbeer in his affidavit declares
that he will show that she took her
own life and had long been mentally
deranged. On the stand, under exami
nation bv Mr. Pillsbury, he declared
that the girl had been "queer" from
babyhood, yet he had not spoken to her
since she was three years of age. "The
last time I crossed John Dolbeer's
threshold," he said, "was the day my
sister, his wife, committed suicide."
SCHANDER EXA3IINED.
Another preliminary skirmish, fought
with an earnestness which foretells the
bitterness of the real struggle to come
in the Dolbeer will contest, was begun
in Judge Coffey's court yesterday
morning and will be resumed to-day.
On the decision of the Judge will de
pend whether the trial of the contest
shall go on at once or De postponed for
two or three months.

tain of the foreign witness** are ex
pected to testify to, the affidavit de
clares that Miss Warren, at her exam
ination, said that Miss Dolbeer's death
was accidental, but that Gustave
Scholer, Coroner of New York, would
say that Miss Warren had told him
that Miss Dolbeer "had consulted a
doctor in Paris, who said that she was
suffering from neurasthenia" and
"would be apt to do something rash
for which she should not be held re
sponsible."
It was declared that William Pop
endick and Miss Pflugel of the
Deutschland would testify that on the
trip across the Atlantic Miss Dolbeer
was depressed and melancholy.
The five Misses O'Connor and two
Misses King, who visited Miss Dol
beer at the Hotel Regina in Paris,
would say that Miss Dolbeer seemed
depressed. One of the Misses King
would relate an incident of a visit to
the Arche de Triomphe in Paris when
those who accompanied Miss Dolbeer.
by reason of her actions, feared that
she was ill.
The contestant expects to prove by
Dr. Gros that in May last he was
consulted by Miss Dolbeer and pro
nounced her trouble neurasthenia,
which is a loss of nerve power result
ing from mental disorder.

A CANDIDATE'S SALUTE.
OKLAHOMA CITY. Okla., Oct. 4. â
Seven are still missing of a party of
eight men who went down with the
wagon bridge between Lexington and
Purcell last night at 9 o'clock after
battling with the swift rush of wa
ters for many hours In a vain attempt
to save the structure. It was the only
connection between the two towns.
Judge Hooker, who lives at Byers,
near Lexington, and who was one of

n.-imes of five others of the party are
known. They are: â Woliver,
manager of the oil mill at Purcell;

Lexington, Will T. Tyler, a boy, of
Lexington.
As all the telegraph and telephone
* ires in the south and southwest
portions of Oklahoma and the south
eastern part of the Indian Territory In
the flooded districts are down, infor
mation is hard to get, but that obtain
able is to the effect that the waters
are receding. Another rise was re
ported to-night from Taloga, but it is
thought if the water goes down at the
X-resent rate not much damage will be
caused by a second rise.
The Santa Fe depot at Purcell had
four feet of water in it this morning.
Since last night xixe Enid and Ana
darko bridge in Caddo County, the Sa
puIpa-Denison division bridge of the
'Frisco at Francis, I. T., and the Choc
taw bridge at Calvin, I. T., have gone
flown.
Santa Fe trains coming into this
city from the north go as far as
Noble and then return. Trains east
bound on the Choctaw canont go far
ther than Holdenville. Westbound
trains on the same road turn back at
Geary. No mails have been 'received
from the south and southwest for
many hours, and it is not known when
trains can come through from these
sections. The Rock Island has a large
number of m^n at work repairing its
tracks and preparing for the building
of new bridges.
The rxtent of the damage done in
th<Â» Territory cannot now be estimated,
but is colossal, and it will be many
days before trains can run on any
thing like their former schedules,

TOPEKA. Kans., Oct. 4. â The offi

jiassfr.gpr traffic for the West. Ar
rangements have been made to de
tour thÂ« trains around the washouts.
Stub trains will be run on the regu

and as good accommodation furnished
as possible.
The Santa Fe and Rock Island
roa<is have lost many thousands of
dollars in bridgres destroj-ed. The
railroads have received reports from
their agentB in the flooded districts of
Indian Territory and Oklahoma that
the damage to cotton and corn will be
enormous.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 4.â Senator
Fairbanks turned his face eastward
to-day and started upon his return trip
from the Pacific Coast, but, although
a considerable distance was covered, he
did not get far cm his way. The day
was spent skirting the southern shore
of San Francisco Bay and in traversing
the fruitful Santa Clara, Livermore and
San Joaquin valleys. Stops for speeches
were made at Palo Alto, San Jose, Liver
more and Stockton. Senators Fair
banks and Fulton made speeches at all
these points, as they did alsc/ here to
night. At San Jose and Stockton they
spoke from the Court House steps and
at the other two places from the rear
platform of the Edgemere. All the
speaking places commanded views of
semi-tropical vegetation and the tem
perature did r.ot fail to- perform its
share In maintaining the illusion that
the party were in the far southland,
for the heat was intense all day.
At Stockton was held the largest and
one of the most enthusiastic meetings
of the day.
The meeting here to-night was pre
sided over by Governor Pardee and was
large and enthusiastic. Both Senators
Fairbanks and Fulton spoke and both
gave attention to the general issues of
the campaign. Senator Fairbanks
dwelt especially upon the currency
question, claiming much credit for the
Republican party in its efforts to main
tain sound money. On that point he
said in part:
Go back to the Civil War. Take the ques
tions that arose during the progress of that
great national tragedy. The Republican party
met them all upon the high level of national
duty and national honor. After the war
closed and the armies of Grant returned to
the vocations of peace which they had left
to render heroic eervice to the Government,
the country was confronted with new ques
tions. Among them wae the question of bring
ing our national credit back to a sound and
safe basis. It was a work of great difficulty
under the circumstances. The Republican
party dedicated itself to the supreme duty
of firmly establishing the financial credit of
the Government and improving the money of
the people. It has always known that the
highest commercial prosperity and the great
est national development could only be ac
complished by adhering to sound and wise
monetary laws. It funded the Government
debt, reduced the high rate of interest pre
vailing during the period of the war. and by
so doing caved millions of dollars to the
people.
In 1S96 we were confronted with the ques
tion of the debasement of our money. The
Republican party went into that campaign
pledged to uphold the gold standard. It was
a period of intense excitement. We had then
a gallant leader, as we have now. The Ameri
can ]>eople put their standard in clean, brave,
patriotic hands â the hands of William Mc-
Kir.ley. He bore the banner to triumphant
victory, and when the Republican party was
intrusted with power it wrote upon the etat
ute books of the United States the gold stand
ard laws.
In thÂ«? campaign of 1S96 our Democratic
friends sought to frighten the country. They
said the gold standard meant the crucifixion
of our great commercial interests. They
claimed that the Republican party wae sub
servient to seme gold-hoarding class. They
claimed that McKinley and the Republican
party favr*-ed the gold mandard In the in
urest of dÂ«Â»ar money. Said they: "The gold
standard means to increaee th* "distress of
the people. Open the mints to thÂ» free coin
age of Â»ilvÂ»r and you will have prosperity."
But William M<-Kinley. wi^r than mosrt
men. Faid. "No. Open the doors of the fac
tories of the United States and set to work
three mlllionn of idle workingmen and you
will bring back prosperity to all of the in
dustrial centers of the republic."
W> wrote the rold standard law into the
statuUÂ« of the Vnlfd States and it proved
that all of the dire predictions of Democracy
were unfounded. Money was never more
plentiful and never cheaper than to-day.
VISITS STANFORD.
Booming Cannon Greet Vice Presiden
tial Nominee at Liivermore.
LIVERMORE, Oct. 4.â The train
bearing Senator Fairbanks and party
arrived on schedule time at 1 p. m.
The committee of arrangement^ for the
affair consisted of T. E. Knox, F. R.
Fassett, J. W. Clarke, William McDon
ald and D. A. Smith. The arrival of
the train was heralded by the dis
charge of cannon, the blare of music
and the blowing of whistles. All the
business houses in town closed at noon
and remained so until after the depar
ture of the train. The public school
had an hour's recess and the children,
under the guidance of their teachers,
lined up at the depot. James W. Clarke
acted as chairman and introduced Sen
ator Fairbanks as the next Vice Presi
dent of the United States.
At the conclusion of Senator Fair
banks' speech little Wilma Johnson, a
tot of about three years, climbed the
rear platform and presented him with a
beautiful bouquet of flowers in a child
ish, lisping speech.
She said: "Senator Fairbanks, please
accept these flowers as a token of our
love and best wishes for your suc
cess."
The Senator picked her up in his arms
and, kissing her, said to the audience:
"Here is something dearer and better
than all the political speeches ever
made."
Senator Fulton of Oregon addressed
the people, after which Joseph Know
land, who was received with vociferous
applause, assured Senators Fairbanks
and Fulton that Alameda County was
loyal to the party and would roll up a
majority for Roosevelt and Fairbanks
larger than any other county in Cali
fornia.

SCKXE OF DESOLATION'.
ROSWELL, New Mex., Oct. 4.â
RofwpII is a scene of desolation. The
food that started Thursday night has
receded. The damage will be over
$100,000. For days it was impossible
to get in telegraphic communication
with outside points. The electric
lijrht plant was flooded and the city
Â¦was in darkness. Water was three
feet deep in the main part of the
city and ran in streams through resi
dences and business houses. So far
as known no lives were lost. The
Roswell Opera-house and about fif
teen business and residence houses
crllapsed. The <like that was erected
\>y the rity was washed out.
Candidate Is Given Worm Welcome at
Palo Alto.
PALO ALTO, Oct. 4. â The special
train bearing Senator Charles W.
Fairbanks and party arrived here at
8 o'clock this morning and was run
on a siding, where probably 2000
people had gathered to welcome him.
The right of way was packed for two
blocks by the crowd. Fairbanks was
Introduced by Marshall Black and
spoke for ten or fifteen minutes.
He was pleased, he said, to visit this
splendid valley, which for centuries
to come would be a center of influence
and higher civilization. In his trip
across the country he had found the
people everywhere contented and
prosperous.
Charles W. Fulton of Oregon spoke
for five minutes on the benefit of lofty
ideals and a liberal education, so well
represented by President Roosevelt.
Fairbanks was conducted from the
train to the Phi Gamma Delta frater
nity house, where an informal reception
was held. There were present Dr. Jor
dan, Professors Stillman, Gilbert, New
comer Marx and Elliott and thirty or
more fraternity boys. Senator Fair
banks is national president of Phi
Gamma Delta, and it was due to the
efforts of this fraternity that he was
induced to speak here.
A drive to the university followed the
reception. Including a visit to Memo
rial Church, and at 9:30 o'clock the
train left for San Jose. The visitors
were In charge of Colonel Randell of
San Francisco, and E. F. Woodward of
Sonoma was one of the guests.
AT SAN JOSE.
Senator Makes Splendid Impression at
Stockton. Where He Addresses
Thousands.
STOCKTON. Oct. 4. â The special
train bearing Senator Fairbanks and
party reached here at 3 o'clock. Ten
minutes later the Vice Presidential
nominee was speaking to an audience
of several thousand people gathered
en the courthouse lawn. He was
enthusiastically received and his
genial mannerisms and straight talk
made favorable impression. In a few
sentences the Senator was introduced
by the county chairman. When the
cheering had subsided he said:
I an surprised at-the magnitude of this
demonstration. I am as much gratified as I
am surprised. It is evidence of the fact'that
you are actively lntercM^d in the great ques
tions eng-tfjinr the American people. It is evi
dence that you are pretty well satisfied with
the Republican policies and that you have
faith in the administration of Theodore Roose
velt. I have long heard of Stockton aa a place
of commercial activity. I am gratified to be
here In the home district of one of the most
splendid Republicans in the nation â Congress
man J. C. Needham. No district in the United
States is represented by a man more thorough
ly devoted to the interests of his constituents.
Mr. Needham is a typical Republican; he is a
man who does things. That is characteristic
of the Republican party. He is a man who
accomplishes what he sets out to do. No
matter how wine or how eloquent a man may
be In public Affairs, he cannot serve you as
â¢well if he has not the ability. My fellow citi
zens, honor yourselves by once more giving to
Mr. Needham the commission to serve you.
Senator Charles Fulton of Oregon
was then introduced and made a five
minute address. In the course of his
remarks a member of the audience
shouted: "How about the bullpen?"
The Senator came back with: "You
Democrats can strike out the bullpen
and substitute the souphouse." The
sally caused a ripple of laughter.

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 4.â Duncan E.
McKinlay. Republican candidate for
Congressman from this district, ad
dressed a large gathering of the em
ployes of railroad shops In this city at
noon to-day. McKinlay spoke from a
platform erected on the corner of Third
and I streets, near the entrance to the
shops. He talked to the mechanics on
the principles of unionism, saying that
he himself was a union man to the
backbone and if elected to Congress
would see that the laboring man's
rights were well looked after. He told
how he helped to organize the Team
sters' Union in Santa Rosa. He closed

Falrbanks Speaks From Courthouse
Steps to Larse Crowd.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 4. â A large and en
thusiastic crowd greeted Senators
Fairbanks and Fulton and party this
morning. They arrived about 10
o'clock from Palo Alto and were met
at the depot by a reception commit
tee, headed by E. A. Hayes, the Re
publican nominee for Congress in this
district, and the Fifth Regiment Band.
While the party was being welcomed
Amy and Roy Bogert, two pretty little
children of Gilroy, were lifted to the
platform of the car and received by
Senator Fairbanks. Miss Amy pre
sented the Vice Presidential nominee
with a handsome album Illustrating
the fruits and flowers of the Santa
Clara valley.
The Fairbanks party was escorted
to carriages, and headed by the band,
was taken to the courthouse steps,
frcm which Senators Fairbanks and
Fulton addressed several thousand
people who had assembled to greet
them.
The speakers' stand was directly .op
posite the McKinley monument, which
marks the spot where the lamented
President addressed the people when
he visited San Jose. E. A. Hayes was
chairman of, the meeting. Fairbanks
was greeted with applause as he as
cended the courthouse Bteps.
Senator Fairbanks stated that four
years ago he had visited San Jose In
behalf of Republican principles and In
support of the election 'of .one of the
greatest of Americans, the third mar
tyred President, William McKinley.
He said he was gratified once more to
be here and he had noticed a great
advance . in the incomparable richness
and unequaled beauty of the Santa
Clara valley.
' Senator Fulton followed. In all bi*.

An immense crowd surrounded Hig
gins' home, and the nominees were en
thusiastically cheered. Lieutenant Gov
ernor Higgins was greeted with a storm
of applause when he began his reply
accepting the nomination, and his ad
dress was frequently interrupted with
cheers.
The other important events of the
day were a reception and luncheon at
Lieutenant Governor Higgins 1 home and
a mass-meeting in the public park at 3
o'clock in the afternoon and | a parade
and ratification meeting in the evening.
Among the speakers at the mass-meet
ing were Senator Depew and former
Lieutenant Governor Timothy L. Wood
ruff.
It had been previously arranged to
have this part of the programme car
ried out at noon, but the wreck of a
train on the Erie Railroad delayed a
part of the committee and a number of
prominent Republicans from the east
ern part of the State, and it was post
poned until they arrived. V.
OLEAN, N. T., Oct. 4.â Lieutenant
Governor Frank W. Higglns, the Re
publican candidate for Governor, and
his associates on the ticket chosen at
the Saratoga convention were to-day
formally notified of their nomination.
The ceremonies took place at the home
of Lieutenant Governor Higgins at 4
o'clock this afternoon.
The United Independent Republican
Club of the Thirty-ninth Assembly
District. John R. Altken president, will
meet to-night at Richmond Hall to
take final action upon the following
resolution:
"Resolved, That it is for the best in
terests of the Republican party that
this club support an independent Re
publican candidate for the Assembly
In this district."
The regular Republican nominee in
the Thirty-ninth District is T. E. At
kinson, secretary of the Republican
County Committee. There is an active
element of good citizenship in the In
dependent Republican Club of the
Thirty-ninth and a nominee of inde
pendent proclivities would doubtless
receive considerable support. It is the
impression, however, in political cir
cles that another Republican nomina
tion would result in the election of the
Democratic candidate.
There will be a grand open air Re
publican rally at Mill Valley Thurs
day, October 6. C. M. Belshaw, Judson
C. Brusie, Judge Lennon, L. C. Pis
tolesi and S- H. Olmsted will address
the people. The posters announce "Free
trains to and from San Rafael and
Sausalito." Local and Instrumental
music, illuminations and bonfires will
be features of the demonstration.
IiOCALi COMPLICATION".
The Republicans are quite confident
that they will regain control of the
Second District and also win back the
Fourth and Fifth districts. A solid
Republican delegation from Califor
nia in the House of Representatives
will give the President the support he
deserves. The registration of voters in
San Francisco is very gratifying to Re
publicans. The following shows the
enrollment by Assembly districts:

The fact remains, however, that he repre
sents that idea by reason of having accepted
his nomination at the hands of men who stand
for the platform as formulated in party con
vention. If the Democrats have pronounced
protection a robbery, and no one will deny that
they have, why should any Republican, or any
other man who believes in the protection pol
icy, cast a vote for Mr. Bell?
There are several reasons why the Republi
cans who voted (or Bell two years ago should
vote for McKlnlay this year. One of them Is
that Bell has pronounced President Roosevelt
a dangerous man. The President's name was
not spoken, but the inference was so strong
that every one at that Saiita Cruz convention
knew full well who was meant. That alone
would be a sufficient reason why any Republi
can should not vote for him this year.
Then again, a Republican is such because of
principles. Strongest of these principles ia
that of protection. Mr. Bell is the nominee
of a party that pronounces protection a rob
bery. True. Mr. Bell does not dare to stand
firmly on that plank, as he knows full well
that this is a protection people in the Second
Congressional District.
Early in the campaign when the
Democratic convention was in session
at Santa Cruz, word was passed along
the line that President Roosevelt's
"dangerous personality" was to be the
Democratic battle cry. Bell, who got
the cue early from headquarters of his
party, waved the danger signal at
Santa Cruz when speaking of Roose
velt and sounded the praises of the
"safe" Judge Parker. Since then there
has been a change of Democratic front.
The danger signals have been taken in
and Parker "safety" Is no longer com
mended. â¢
The Chico Daily Enterprise, replying
to several questions propounded by the
Napa Journal, presents this argument:
The Republican newspapers of the
Second District; and the Republican
State Central Committee are well ad
vised regarding the tactics of the Dem
ocratic managers and are giving words
of caution to the Republicans of Napa
County.
DEMOCRATIC TACTICS.
The Republican State Central Com
mittee Is In possession of facts which
convince the party leaders j that the
Democrats in California are ready to
sacrifice the Presidential and local can
didates of their party in order to in
crease the vote for Democratic Con-'i
gressional nominees. It is computed
that the- Democrats require only the
gain of sixteen seats in order to secure
control of the House of Representa
tives.
The opponents of the Republican na
tional administration are putting for
ward special effc-rt in the Second Dis
trict to bring about the election of Bell.
Word comes from Napa County that
Republicans are importuned to vote for
Bell on the ground that he is the name
candidate. The plea foi- Republican
support of the Democratic candidate is
often made in this manner: "Of course
the district is largely Republican and
McKinlay's election is assured, but
'"heodore is a good fellow and li\es in
Kapa County. A few votes from out
side cf his party given to him will not
change the result, but the compliment
will be appreciated by Bell and his
friends."

BERKELEY, Oct 4. â Costly fum
bles by the California freshmen
against the Oakland High School
eleven on the campus this afternoon
prevented them from getting more
than six points. One misplay was so
expensive that their opponents scored
five points. Neither side scored in the
first half. Just after the second half
opened Kendall fumbled a ball kicked
by Oakland High School back of the
freshmen goal and an Oakland player
fell on it, scoring: a touchdown. Oak
land failed to kick the goal and had
to be satisfied with five points.
Smarting under this setback the
freshmen then pulled together and
by bucking the line hard scored a
touchdown and kicked a goal in the
next five minutes, making the score
6 to 5. Several times after that the
freshmen srot the ball within striking
distance of the Oakland goal, but lost
the ball by fumbling. Ghirardilli,
Oakland's quarter, played, a star game
and fooled the fresmen a number of
times on a /quarterback trick play.
Golcher did the best work for Califor
nia. The teams were made up as fol

CHICAGO, Oct. 4. â In the Iroquois
Theater trial to-day Business Manager
Thomas J. Noonan and Stage Carpen
ter James E. Cummings were granted
a change of venue to another county.
They alleged that a fair trial could not
be obtained in Chicago. In granting
the change, Judge Kersten declared
public sentiment had been so inflamed
that numerous letters had been writ
ten to him threatening him with vio
lence and with a visit from a vigilance
committee if his decision permitted
the case to be tried outside of Cook
County-
After the change had been granted,
counsel for Will J. Davis, president of
the Iroquois Company, moved that the
two indictments against Davis be
quashed on the ground they are de
fective and asked that arguments be
continued until the November term of
court.
Judge Holds That Public Sentiment
Would Not Permit of Fair
Trial In Chicago.

MORRIS PARK, Oct. 4.â No pret

sp<?n this ttOMOO than that witnessed
to-day in thÂ« Corinthian Steeplechase
Handicap for gentlemen riders, in
which five horses started. Three of
th<=>e came to the last obstacle so close
tcge-ther it was difficult to then predict
a winner.
Mr. Chamblett's game gelding,
noyelle, with H. S. Stone of Toronto
in ihe saddle, came away under a
drive and won easily at the end. Con
over, with his owner Charles M. Har
ris up. was a good second and M. J.
Cavana?h'f Flying Buttress, ridden by
Robert M. Taylor of Maryland, was a
jfood third.
Only one oth^r stake besides the
Corinthian was on the card. This was
tht- Fairview with exiling allowances,
f<Â»r which Grenade and Dick Bernard
were nearly equal favorites at 6 to 5
and II to 10 as named. Dick Bernard
was beaten, but the spectators' criti
cized the riding order, if Davis really
rede to orders, for he went out in
front at a suuidal pace, running the
half-mi!<Â» partly uphill in forty-eight
and one-flfth seconds and opening up a
big- gap. Grenade, with Travers in the
6addl*\ was ridden more judiciously
and his jockey only called on him in
thf last quarter. Just then Dick Ber
nard started to bear out and bumped
Grenade, but dropped back and Gren
ada took the rail, winning with ease.

turning into the stretch. Grace Bond's

This afternoon Lick and Mission
High will meet on the presidio
grounds at 2:30 o'clock. Mission has
improved since the opening of the sea
son, bat the same can be said of Lick
and the consensus of opinion is that
Lick will win easily.
If the protest is decided against
Lick the tie game and the Polytech
nic-Wilmerding contest will be played
this week. /

The Academic Athletic League foot
ball affairs among the hisn school
teams are more complicated than they
were last year at this time. Poly
technic and Uck are tied for rlrst
place, neither having lost a game.
Tmj played a tie game two weeks ago
and the eleven days allowed the teams
in which to play off the tls hava
elapsed. To further complicate mat
ters it appears Uck and Lowell are
thÂ«Â» only teams that registered in time.
Lick has registered a protest, which
will be passed upon to-night- If the
protest is sustained the Lick-Poly
technic game will not be played over.
Lick has already beaten Lowell and
the championship of the sub-league
will go to the school from the Mission
If the committee decides against Poly
technic.
Last year Lick and Polytechnic
played a tie game and Polytechnic
protested the play-oft on the ground
that they had won on percentage.
The game was played off under pro
test and was won by Lick. Subse
quently the matter was decided In fa
vor of Polytechnic and they were
awarded the champfonship.
The executive committee of the Ac
ademic League will meet to-night and
if possible will straighten out the tan
gle. It will be a great disappointment
if Lick and Polytechnic do not meet
again.

RUNS AND. HITS BY INNINGS.
The little baseball engagement at
Oakland yesterday : afternoon was a
gentlemanly set-to for five innings. The
pitchers had everything, the umpire
was competent and the fans sat dozing.
All this peacefulness and bliss were
rudely dispelled during the, sixth
spasm. Oakland enticed some runs
over the pan with the aid of some smart
bingles. After that it was curtains.
Scoreâ Oakland 2, San Francisco 1.
The Seals might possibly have had a
wider peep in had not Wheeler tried to
shake hands with a torrid one from the
bat of Jimmy Byrnes. It mutilated the
business mitt of the slabster, who had
to seek the bench. Barber was forced
out on the firing line before he had a
chance to warm up his good right wing.
Ganley, the first man to come up club
in hand in the sixth, flew out, but
Francks dropped down a neat bunt and
beat it out. Dunleavy swung through
with a single, which Waldron neglected
to stop, so the runner went on to sec
ond, while Francks pulled up at cush
ion number three. Schlafley picked out
one that was a good looker to him, and
while Hildebrand ( was giving *chase to
the leather out in the left garden both
runners were tearing to the plate. Kru
ger was then passed, and more runs
might have resulted had not Schlafley
been doubled up on Streib's fly to
Meany.
Uncle Hank tried out Poultney, an
energetic young man fresh from the
diamond of St. Mary's College. The
youngster showed he knows how to
handle himself. .He did. not get many
chances to star, but was in the game
all the time. Uncle will probably sign
the kid if he shows the goods.
The curves which Buchanan twisted
over the pan were the concentrated es
sence of mystery till the eighth, when
Captain Irwln hit off one for a pair of
sacks. He landed a moment later,
when Anderson followed the example
of his lesftier. Anderson went to third
Â»n Gochnauer's sacrifice, but died at
the plate on Francks' quick return of
Poultney's grounder. The score:

CHICAGO, Oct. 4 âMonte and Lord
Dixon furnished a hdir raising finish
in the third race at Worth to-day, in
which Jockey Helgesen clearly outrpde
Jockey Nicol and won the verdict by
a head- The two colts hooked up at
the final eighth pole and Lord Dixon
held the advantage until the final
stride, where Helgesen shortened up
on his strokes with the whip and Mon
te, fleeing from the severe punishment,
barely poked his nose in front.
Miss Crawford, which was consider
ed one of the outsiders In the fourth
race, captured the event easily by two
and a half lengths. Bad News, which
ruled favorite at 8 to 5, got off in the
lead and set a heartrending pace for
six furlongs. The Darden filly clung
to him like a leech all the way, and,
catching him about the last eighth
pole, drew away and won easily.

When the case was called on Sep
tember 15 for trial Assistant District
Attorney Ashe moved for a dismissal
on the ground that the evidence had
left the custody of the police. Attor
ney George H. Pippy, special counsel
for the prosecution, objected and the
Judge took the matter under advise
ment till yesterday.
On motion of the District Attorney
yesterday Judge Cook dismissed the
case of James H. Cox, charged with
receiving stolen goods. The evidence
was insufficient. The Judge, address
ing Cox, said: "It is lucky for you.
Cox, that the property clerk returned
the evidence against you, otherwise
you would certainly have gone to
trial."
Cox was arrested on November 1
last on complaint of the Standard
Milk Company for buying a milk bot
tje box and three milk tanks which
had been stolen from them. The
property was recovered and placed in
the custody of the property clerk.
After Cox was held to answer the
property was turned over to the
Standard Milk Company instead of
being held as evidence pending the
trial in the Superior Court.
Judge Cook Informs James If. Cox He
Is Lucky In Not Going
to Trial.

STOCKSLAGER FOUND
GUII/TY BY THE JURY
Ingenious Plea of Counsel That He
Was a.Repentant Counterfeiter
Falls to Move Them.
Guy R. Stockslager was convicted
by a Jury yesterday afternoon in the
United States District Court upon
both counts of an indictment. . one
charging: the making of two plaster ,
molds for' the manufacture of coun
terfeit dollars and the other charging
unlawful possession of same.
The' molds were found in his room
at 779 Bush street on February 1 of
this year. His counsel, Bert Bchles
ingrer, raised the ingenious defense
which showed that the defendant, af
ter haying made the molds, had
changed* his mind. Having so changed
his mind and obliterated the impres
sion, the counsel argued, there was no
crime.
At the request of United States Dis
trict Attorney Woodworth Judge de
Haven instructed the jury otherwise.
The jury added a recommendation
to mercy. - -_ _^ _Â¦ ;V:'r^^Â»

Captain John Bermingham, super

the decision of United States Local
Inspectors Byron Whitney and Rob
ert Turner of Seattle suspending for
twelve months the license of Captain
George Robertson and revoking the
license of Chief Engineer Scott A. De
launay of the steamship Clallam for
negligence. The Clallam was sunk on
a voyage from Port Townsend to Vic
toria on January 8, 1903, and several
passengers were drowned by the cap
sizing of the small boats.
Delaunay admitted on the investi
gation that he had left a deadlight
open and this admitted the water into

MUST SUFFER PENAI/TY
CHARGE OF RECEIVING
STOLEN GOODS DROPPED
The complaint alleges that on Sep
tember 11 representatives of the union
called upon the manager of the firm
and informed him that he would have
to continue to pay the stablemen wages
of $2 50 a day.. On October 3 the com
pany notified the union that it would
refuse to comply with the demand and
reserved the right to pay Its employes
the wage received by others in the same
line of work. The allegations continue
to the effect that the union men con
spired to devise means for Interfering
with the business of the company, and
In furtherance of the conspiracy de
clared a boycott and strike and placed
pickets In front of the stores to carry
banners bearing the false words, "Un
fair firm; reduced wages of Its em
ployes 50 cents per day. Please do not
patronize." It is charged that the un
ion's acts have Intimidated the em
ployes and customers of the firm, and
damages In the sum of $500 have al
ready been suffered. A perpetual In
junction is prayed for. Bush Finnell,
attorney for the Citizens' Alliance, is
prosecuting the suit.
Another injunction suit against the
Stablemen's Union to prevent boycot
ting and picketing was begun yester
day, the complainants in this instance
being Goldberg, Bowen & Co., grocers,
with stores at 432 Pine street and 232
Sutter street, and a private stable at
965 Sutter street.

At noon next Saturday the new
steel training ship Intrepid will be
launched at the Mare Island Navy
Yard, where she has been under con
struction.- Senator George C. Perkins
will make an address and the christen
ing ceremony will be performed by
Miss Helen de Young of San Francisco,
who was asked by Secretary of the
Navy Morton to act as sponsor for the
vessel.
Two interesting features in connec
tion with the Intrepid are that she is
the first steel warship to be built on
this coast by the navy yard with the
exception of the monitor Monadnock,
and that she will be propelled solely
by sail power. This is in accordance
w!th the accepted idea that the best
training ship for a man-of-warsman is
still the sailing ship.
The Intrepid's dimensions are:
Length, 176 feet 5 inches; beam, 45
feet 7% Inches; mean draft, 16 feet 5%
inches, and ' displacement, 1800 tons.
She will carry a battery of six 4-Inch
fcrty-caliber rapid flre guns; four 6
pounder rapid fire guns; two 1-pound
er rapid flre guns, and two Colt auto
matic guns.

The big liner Mongolia, which arrived Mon
day night '.rom the Orient and anchored in the
fctream, was hauled alongside cf the Pacific
Mail dock yesterday morning. In a few hour*
the wharf was crowded with her discharged
cargo. With the Siberia taking cargo froiÂ«
one side of the pic-r and the Mongolia dischatg
ing on the uther the freight is somewhat con
gested. The Siberia sails next Friday, and the
America Mam, which Is due on that day, will
take her place.
Pacific Mail Dock Busy.
The steamer Northland, which recently went
on the rocks at the entrance to Monterey Bay,
has been relieved of her lumber cargo as far
as is safe. The bottom of the vessel was badly
damaged and only the buoyancy of her cargo
kept her from sinking immediately on getting
Into deep water. The holes in her hull have
been sufficiently patched with canvas to enable
her to dock for repairs. It Is believed that It
will cost about $30,CC0 to get her ready for sea
again.
Troubles of the Northland.
Captain Davis of the British ship Ditton.
who recently broke the customs seala on the
hatches of his vessel, has been notified by
Collector Slratton to file a detailed written ac
count of the act. Captain Davis stated that
lie detected smoke coming from the coal cargo
and opened the hatches to get at the fire. The
customs inspectors examined the ship's hold and
found no mnoks, no unusual heat, nor any indi
cations of tire. The penalty is $500 and Cap
tain Davis must explain his actions.

the tale, a student who created a mon

the fragments of bodies picked from
churchyards and dissecting-rooms a
human form without a soul. The mon
ster had muscular strength, animal
passions 'and active life, but no breath
of divinity. It longed for animal love
and animal sympathy, but was shunned
by all. It was most powerful for evil,
and being fully conscious of Its own de
fects and deformities sought with per
sistency to inflict retribution on the
young student who had brought It Into
existence. The monster murders a
friend of the student, strangles his
bride and finally comes to an end in the
Northern Sea.

Xot only from Consul Handley's report, but from those of
every Consul in South American ports, we read of the great lack
ing in a solid foundation for American trade. There are few banks
controlled by American traders, yet in some places the German
and British banks have such strength as to be even of semi-official
character in their relations to the Government. There is a dearth
of agents for American firms to compete with the trained com
mercial scouts sent out by our trade rivals. The English study. the
wants of the people and supply them; our manufacturers usually
dump surplus product in the south, irrespective of the demands of
the general market.
While we are digging the canal for the use of the world and
while we are zealously guarding the little nationals of the lower
continent from aggression on the part of European powers, it
would not be without profit for our merchants to bid for some' of
the fruits of American political policy. At present they are going
over seas with startling measure of exclusion from our participation
therein.
Between the years 1873 and 1902 American trade with Asia
increased fourfold, our exports to Australasia rose in value from
$5,000,000 to $34,000,000, our trade with British 1 North America
increased in volume from $82,000,000 to $204,000,000; yet at present
time the balance of trade between the United States and South
American States is in favor of the latter by $80,000,000. Our
trafHcking with them has increased by 5 per cent only in the last
twelve years, while German and English steamship lines, even a
direct line from Canada, are yearly taking away the plums of the
southern markets.
AX English paper recently gave Jengthy editorial review of
the markets in South America with comparisons between
the respective spheres of trade enjoyed by the nations there
competing. In whimsical allusion to the American enforcement of
the Monroe doctrine and to American interest in political questions
touth of the line, the editorial draws attention to the small share
of South American trade that falls to our lot and questions whether
the game is worth the candle.
May we not conscientiously put the same question to ourselves?
Do our merchants derive the advantages that should come to them
through our political interests in the republics below us? Asking
this question and answering it through a display of statistics, W. W.
Handley, United States Vice Consul at Trinidad, has brought before
the attention of the American manufacturer and shipper facts well
worth}' of study.
TRADE WITH SOUTH AMERICA.
To the United States, then, the restless and mutually distrustful
powers look for the inception and prosecution of peace measures
which shall work for the good of all. President McKinley first
tirged upon the nations the acceptance of an agreement respecting
the exemption from destruction by belligerents of all private prop
erty at sea not contraband of war, and now President Roosevelt is
only awaiting a favorable moment to launch this project, already
sanctioned by our Congress. President Roosevelt waived the op
portunity of becoming an international arbiter between two Euro
pean powers in favor of action being taken on the same by the
Hague court, thus showing the strong support this country desires
to give that tribunal. Now on his initiative the powers are consider
ing the calling of a second conference of the nations before that
bar of international justice, similar in purpose to the pne which was
its creator.
IX extending the welcome of the President of the United States to
the delegates in attendance upon the thirteenth session of the
International Peace Congress, now assembled in convention at
Boston, Secretary of State John Hay gave voice to one of the most
trenchant and eloquent pleas for universal peace known to our
records. Concurring in Tolstoy's recently uttered opinion concern
ing the terrible enormity of war and the salvation of the battling
nations that can come only through an exalted and universal reli
gious uplift, Secretary Hay does not let the dreams of the Russian
theorist carry him away from the realm of the practical; war we
have, says he, and war we will have as long as the militant spirit
continues to be a part of the moral fiber of'our being.
"If all would do right, nobody would do wrong â nothing is
plainer," is Hay's interpretation of the Russian's philosophy. "It is
a counsel of perfection, satisfactory to prophets and saints, to be
reached in God's good time. But you are here to consult together
to see whether the generation now alive may not do something to
hasten the coming of the acceptable day, the appearance on earth
of the beatific vision. If we cannot at once make peace and good
will the universal rule and practice of nations, what can we do to
approximate this condition? What measures can we now take which
may lead us at least a little distance toward the wlshed-for goal?
Here is wise counsel ; here is a definition of the practical as
distinguished from the theoretical. The keynote of Hay's advice to
the peace congress is strict adherence to the practical, with the ideal
ever in mind as the goal of ultimate endeavor, but never as the
fundamental basis for endeavor. The Secretary's warning is, if you
would even in a little measure bring surcease to a world weary with
constant strife make no effort radically to turn out of its channel
the present prevalent war spirit, now so firmly set by the traditions
of centuries, but do all that in you lies to mitigate the horrors of
international bloodshedding, and trust to a possible millennium of
universal good will, for the eradication of the war desire.
With the militant spirit still unassuaged and with the world's
peoples still ready to grapple at one another's throats there are yet
things we can do "which may lead us to the wished-for goal. The
cause of arbitration, as yet a new and somewhat untoward element
in the ethics of world councils, has, as Secretary Hay makes evident,
its most logical and most certain exponent in our own country. "We
have," says Hay, "a greater relative immunity from war than any
of our neighbors. * * * If our example is worth anything to the
world, we have given it in the vital matter of disarmament. We have
brought away from the Far East 55,000 soldiers whose work was
done and sent them back to the fields of activity. We have reduced
our army 40 its minimum of 60,000 men ; in fact, we may say that we
have no army, but in place of one a nucleus for drill and discipline."
HAY ON* THE WORLD'S PEACE.
Apropos of the war which Is being
waged against field mice in France,
some computations have been made in
that- country in order that the depre
dations of these little rodents might
be realized.
It has, been calculated from experi
ments that each adult field mouse. eats
from two-thirds of an ounce to â¢ one
ounce of living plants a day, which
means a consumption of from sixteen
to twenty-four pounds a year. Ac
cording to the same calculations, if we
consider the loss by destruction at only
one-half of the quantity consumed we
have, a loss of ; from twenty-four to
thirty-six pounds a year for each lit
tle field mouse.
' Acording to the statement of Â¦ a
French newspaper, in the experi
ments made during the month of Feb
ruary last in the Department of the
Charente, Mr. Chamberland of : the
Pasteur Institute, estimated that the
average number of field mice to be
found at that ime upon a hectare (2.47
acres) was 1350. They consumed an
nually at least thirteen and , a half
tons of vegetable matter. In 1893, in
the- region' of Bar-sur-Seine, according
to i another, expert, there were; more
than 10,000 field mice to the hectare. â¢Â¦

Mayor Schmitz yesterday notified
George Collins that he would not con
sider the office held by Police Com
misisoner Hutton vacant and appoint
his successor as requested by Collfns
in a communication filed with the
Mayor last Saturday. This decision
on the part of the Mayor will leave It
to Collins to bring mandamus pro
ceedings to compel his Honor to ap
point a successor to Hutton, as Col
lins has threatened to do. The courts
will then determine whether the
charter provision that "when a mun
icipal officer is convicted of willful
violation of his official duties the of

judging of Hutton guilty of contempt
in violating an injunction to prohibit
him from interfering with the inmates

of police for that purpose.

The San Francisco Presbytery's
meeting at the Presbyterian Welsh
church. Fourteenth street, near Va
lencia, was largely attended yesterday.
The new moderator, Alexander H. Mc-
Donald, presided.
A request was received for the sup
port of the assembly's new committee
of the Young- People's Christian En
deavor work. The matter was re
ferred to the Young People's societies
of San Francisco. . .
The subject of mortgage tax on
church property was discussed and it
was said that Dr. .White of the Gen
eral Assembly was desirous of making
a test case of the tax. Another mat
ter brought up was evangelistic work
ir. the city, and it was conceded that it
needed weeks instead of days to do
effective work In San. Francisco. The
Rev. T. M. Boyd in speaking of the
circulating library connected with
churches said that novels and "trashy"
liferature-were found in some libraries,
which showed that care should be tak
en in the selection; of books that are
placed in the hands of juveniles.
The presbytery adjourned to the
synod, which meets irr Sacramento

Pie, cake and }ike viands are the
prizes that, await the outcome of a
novel experiment in getting members
for the Plymouth Congregational
Church Sunday-school, in which the
competitors are . all: the girls of the
Sunday-school on one side and all the
boys of the school on the other.
The contest began recently and Is
now fairly under way. The â¢ under
standing is that the boys or the girls
shall at a certain time i furnish a
dinner for the entire school, the losers
Â¦to be the providers. There is no lack
of pood dinners in,' the Western Ad
dition, wherein is the field of labor
of Plymouth Congregational Church,
and only rivalry prompts the boys
and girls to make extra exertions to
gather the young "people of their ac
quaintance .into the Sunday-school,
but that . is sufficient' to serve as a
stimulus. Â¦ .
: The neighborhood of the church has
built- up largely* of late. Flats and
apartment houses have been erected
and 'have been speedily tenanted by a
good" clasr of citizens. Whole blocks
of 'land that have been kept out of
.the market: tor many years until re
cently have been covered with" build
ings. > N Where there were sandhills
there \ are now , well â¢ "filled homes.
Probably a perception of the- larger
opportunities afforded spurred the
Plymouth Sunday-school people to
activity. Whatever the cause may be,
,the effect of the project, which is
still new, has been to create great in
terest. There are many churches In
the Western Addition, and their

will be given later.
On next Sunday the entire member
ship of the sodality, which numbers
1500, will meet at their chapel on Hayes
street at 7.20 o'clock and march in
eolemn procession to the Church of St.
Ignatius, where they will attend mass
and receive holy communion in a body;
afterward they will recite the Te Deum.
The Eastern newspapers were loud in
their praises of Father O'Conor's ver
sion and among the distinguished au
dience at its initial presentation wa^j
the apostolic delegate, Monsignor Fal
coni. his Eminence Cardinal Gibbons,
Archbishop Ryan, Archbishop Farley,
Archbishop Ireland and many Cabinet
Ministers, as well as the great Dante
scholar, Charles Eliot Norton, president
of the Dante Society of Boston.
Rev. Father Butler, S. J.-, director of
sodality, is much indebted to the au
thor, who kindly sent him several books
of his play as well as many other use
ful hints as to the presentation, and it
is needless to say after the many suc
cesses achieved by the distinguished
amateurs of St. Ignatius Sodality be
fore the footlights in the past in "Da
mon and Pythias." "The Maledict'on,"
"Henry IV,'.' "Henry VIII," "Riche
lieu." "Stdicais," "The Last King of
Judah" and the morality play, "Every
man," that a treat is in store for the
lovers of drama. â¢
Notwithstanding Sir Henry Irvlng's
impersonation of Dante, it was driven
off the American stage in a very short
time.
Rev. Father O'Conor was inspired to
write this play by the fact that Sardou,
the French playwright, wrote a play
last year called "Dante." So false, he
says, was it to history that almost
every scholar and Danteist was shock
ed at his portrayal of Dante as a bad,
immoral man, which, of course, was
for stage effect.
"Dante" is the title of the drama that
has been diligently rehearsed for -two
months, under the management 'Of Pro
fessor Nichols, by the Gentlemen's So
dality Dramatic Club, and which will
be presented at St. Ignatius College
Hall lor three nights, Monday, "Wed
nesday and Friday, October 24, 26 and
28. It was written in the early part .of
this year by Rev. J. F. X. O'Conor, the
author of many well known historical
and biographical works and who is
president of the Dante class in St. Jo
seph's College, Philadelphia.
The presentation of "Dante" in the
Eastern colleges and cities of the East
in June and July was witnessed by
many Dante readers, distinguished
scholars, as well as critics, who were
loud in their praise of its dramatic
merit.

LKVELERS
The Mission of Whiskey, Tobacco and
Coffee.
The Creator made ail things,- wÂ» be-
lieve.
ii so, He must have made these.
We know what He made food and
water for. and air and sunshine, but
v.hy Whiskey, Tobacco and Coffee?
They are here sure enough and each
perlorxning its work. Â»Â«
There must be some great plan be-
hind It all; the thoughtful man seeks
to understand something of that plan
and thereby to judge these articles for
their true worth.
Let us not say 'bad" or "jfood" v/ith-
out taking testimony.
There are limes and conditions
when It certainly seems to the casual
observer that these stimulant narcotics
are real blessings.
Right there is the ambnsh- that con-
ceals a "killing" enemy.
One can slip into the habit of either
wliiskey. tobacco or coffee easy enough,
but to -untangle" is often a fearful
struggle.
It seems plain that there are cir-
cumstances when the narcotic effect of
these poisons is for the moment bene-
ficial, but the fearful argument against
them is that seldom ever does one find
a steady user of either whiskey, coffee
or tobacco free from disease of some
kind.
Certainly powerful elements in their
effect on the human race.
It is a matter of daily history testified
to by literally millions of people that;
"Whiskey. Tobacco and Coffee are smil- j
ir>K, promising, beguiling friends on the j
start, but always false as hell itself in !
the end. Once they get firm hold
enough to show their strength, they in-
sist upon governing and drive the vic-
tim steadily toward 111 health in Borne
form; if permitted to continue to rule
they will not let up until physical and j
mental rulri sets in.
A man under that ppell (and "under
the spell" is correct) of any one of
these drups, frequently assures himself
and his friends, '"Why. I can leave off
any time I want to. I did quit for a
week Just to show I could." It is a
ture mark of the slave when odp cets
to that stage. He wiggled through a
v.-eek fighting every day to break the
spell, was finally whipped, and began
his slavery all over again.
The slave feoffee slave as well as to-
bacco and whiskey) daily reviews his
condition, sees perfectly plain the
Bteatdy encroachments of disease, how
The nerves pvt weaker day by day and
demand the drug- that seems to smile
and offer reMef for a few minutes and !
ihen ]eav<; the disease condition plain- j
tr to vie*/ than ever and growing j
worse. Many times the coffee slave
realizes that he is between two fires.
He feels bad if he ler.vee off and a
little worse .i he drinks and allows the
r-ff^ct to wear off.
So it goes on from day to day. Every
riifrht the struggling victim promises
himself that he will bre.k .he habit j
and next day when he feels a little bad
'as he is quite sure to) breaks, not the
habit, but his own resolution. It is
nearly always a tough fight, with dis-
aster ahead sure if the habit wins.
There have been hundreds of thou-
sands nf people driven to their graves
through disease brought on by coffee
drinking alone, and It is quite certain j
that rr.ore human misery Is caused by I
r-nffee and tobacco than by whiskey, j
*.<--r the two first are more widely used |
and more hidden and insidious in the
effect on nerves, heart and other vital
organs, and are thus unsuspected un-
til much of the dangerous work is done.
X"\v. reader, what is your opinion as
to the real use the Creator has for
these things. Take a look at the ques-
tion frr.rn this point of view.
There is a law of nature and of
nature's God that things slowly evolve
from lower planes to higher, a sturdy,
steady and dignified advance toward
rr.ore perfect things in both the phys- j
iral and spiritual world. The pon-
derous tread of evolutionary develop-
ment is fixed by the infinite and will
not be quickened out of natural law
by any of man's methods.
Therefore we see many illustrations
showing how nature checks too rapid j
advance. Illinois raises phenomenal |
crops of corn for two or three years, j
f she continued to do so every year
hf-r farmers would advance in wealth !
far beyond those of other sections or
< "untries. So nature interposes a bar '
every three or four years and brings ;
on a "bad year."
Here we see the leveling influence at
work. -
A man Is prosperous in his business;
for a number of years and grows rich, j
Then nature sets the "leveling influ- \
tnce" at work on him. Some of his j
investments lose, he becomes luxurious i
and lazy. Perhaps it is whiskey, to- i
bacco, coffee, women, gambling or j
some other form. The intent and pur- '
pose is to level him. Keep him from I
evolving too far ahead of the masses. J
A nation becomes prosperous and '
great like ancient Rome. If no level- >
ing influence set in she would dominate i
the world perhaps for all time. But
Dame Xature sets her army of "lev-
tlere" at work. Luxury, overeating j
and drinking, licentiousness, waste and i
extravagance indulgences of all kinds, i
then comes the wreck. Sure, sure, sure. '
The law of the unit is the law of the I
mas*. Man goes through the same
process. Weakness (in childhood),
pradual growth of strength, energy,
thrift, probity, prosperity, wealth,
comfort, ease, relaxation, self-indul-
gence, luxury, idleness, waste, de-
bauchery, disease and the wreck fol-
lows. The "levelers" are in the bushes
along the pathway of every successful
man and woman and they bag the ma-
jority.
Only now and then can a man stand
out against these "levelers" and hold
his fortune, fame and health to the
end. Â¦ .*
So the Creator has use for whiskey,
tobacco and coffee to level down the
succePFful ones and those who show
Figi;s of being successful, and keep
them back in the race, so that the
great field" r the masses) may not be
left too far behind.
And yet we must admit that same
all-wise Creator has placed it in the
power of man to stand upright, clothed
In the armor of a clean-cut, steady
mind and say unto himself, "I decline
to exchange my birthright for a mesa
of potage.
â¢ \Z m nOt - dPaden my senses,
toff my iTlp Â° n affair8 and k eep
rnyself cheap, common and behind in
fortune and fame by drugging with
whiskey tobacco or coffee; life is too
* .v ard " nou g* to win the
jrood things, without any sort of handi-
cap so a man is certainly a 'fool
trader' when he trades strength,
health, money and the good things that
come with power, for the half-asleep
condition of the "drugger" with the!
anead n " y Â° f Eicknees and disease!
It is a matter each Individual must:
decide for himself. He can be a leader
and semi-god if he will, or he can go
along through life a drugged clown a
cheap "hewer of wood or carrier 'of
water."
Certain it Is that while the Great
Father of us all does not seem to
' mind if some of his children are fool-
ish and stupid, he seems to select oth-
ers (perhaps those he Intends- for. some
Â¦pedal Â¦ work) and allows them to be;

If a man tries flirting with these lev-
elers awhile, and gets a few slaps as a
hint, he had better take the hint or a
good solid blow will follow.
When a man tries to live upright,
clean, thrify, sober and undrugged,
manifesting as near as he knows what
the Creator intends he should^ happi-
ness, health and peace seem to come to
him. Does it pay?
This article was written to set people
thinking, to rouse the "God for
every highly organized man and wom-
an has times when they feel a some-
thing calling from within for them to
press to the front and "be about the
Father's business," don't mistake it;
the spark of the Infinite is there and it
paj's in every way, health, happiness,
peace and even worldly prosperity, to
break off the habits and strip clean for
the work cut out for us.
! It has been the business of thÂ« writer
to provide a practical and easy way for
people to break away from the coffee j
habit and be assured of a return to |
health and all of the good things that |
brings, provided the abuse has not |
gone too far, and even then the cases
where the body has been rebuilt on a
basis of strength and health run Into
the thousands.
It is an easy and comfortable step to
stop coffee instantly by having well-,
made Postum Food Coffee served. rich
and hot with good cream, for the color
and flavor are there, but none of the
caffeine or other nerve destroying ele-
ments of ordinary coffee. . .
On the contrary, the most powerful
rebuilding elements furnished by Nat- j
ure are in Postum and they quickly J
set about repairing the damage. > Sel r |

change is made before the old stomach 1
or bowel troubles or complaints of kid- i
neys, heart, head or nerves show un-'
raistakable evidence of getting better

Â¦wonderfully.
Literally millions of brain-working
Americans -to-day use "Postum; having

5OUTREP.N CALIFORNIA.â War*n. dry
weather prevailed in the Interior, with fogs
in the coast districts. Conditions were very
favorable for ralFin-rcaking. Mont of the
relMn rrapes are on the trays and will be
ready for packing earlier than usual; the
quality Is exre-iient. Orange and lemon
orchards in the vicinity of Upland are re

more advanced than usual at this reason; there

'"OAST AND BAT SECTION'S. â The weather
was generally warm end partly cloudy during
The week, with fo*rs> along the coast. The
sot] '.s in good condition and plowing and
sÂ»f-<I!r4t have commenced In many places.
Orf-en feed hss made remarkable irrowth Eince
the rain and will eoon be plentiful in all
sections. .Grape picking is progressing rapidly
and i* nearly finished in some places: the crop
"aÂ« not so seriously damaged by the storm
is estimated last week. Fruit drying is
rearly completed. The damage to crops by the
rain of the preceding week was quite severe
in some sections and almoÂ«t nominal in others.
PAN JOAQVIN VALLETT.â Cloudy and
rainy weather prevailed the first part of the
weÂ«k and the latter was clear and warm
!n the northern portion of the valley and
rsrtly cloudy tn the â¢ southern. Very little
progpese was made in ra!*in curing and the
partly cloufly weatfcer following the rains in
*.hÂ« raJeln district caused considerable mold In
FtackeU tray*. The damajre to drying fruit
and hay was sot so great as expected. Wine

Bfans in Sasta Maria were not seriously daxn-
Eped by rain and threshing has been resumed.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY. â Cool weather
during the first part of the week followed by
warmer, with dry north wind. The latter
Â»a* beneflcial in absorbing the surplus moist
to* In the noil and drying out hay that had
b"tn exposed to tbe recent rain. Hay. grape*
and dried fruits were quite seriously dam

In progress in many places. Green feed is
prowiug rapidly and will soon be plentiful.
Grape picking has been resumed and large

ar. 1 a heavy crop is probable.
Partly cloudy and cool weather continued
during the first of the week, with higher tem
j â¢ rature at the close and frequent fogs in
the coast diftricts. Dry northerly winda pre-.
vailed in some sections.
The damage to crops by the heavy rain of
the preceding wetk appears to have been con
siderably overestimated in many Fectione. Late*
reports from the central and northern sections
Indicate that ' the injury to grapes- On- â¢ tha
vinÂ«-e was less than expected. Raisins and
deciduous fruits on th>- trays were slightly
damaged, although ample warnings were
iriven to" all gTowers who could be reached.
Grape picking and raisin making have been
rt-s-umed but conditions have not been very
favorable for curing except in Southern Call
f'jrnia. The wineries are In full operation
and heavy ehirments of table prapes are be
itk made. Fruit dryinir is nearly completed.
Walnut harvest has commenced in the Ana

Krowth. The southern orange crop is reported
light In xnort places but there will probably

for conversion Into bonds, which was the norn
inal cause for the buoyant rise in that stork
yesterday, made it natural that some wiling
should result to-day. It was not a â¢urprise i to
eee the force, of the day's rumor-monicericg
shifted to the Northern Securities' question,
as these two subjects have ihonn unexhaust
ed capacity for stimulating furious price move
menu.
The movement centered in St. Paul to-day.
That stock seemed to reach no limit to Its
flight. Its suction was the direct outcome of
the strength of Union Pacific and of Southern
Paclfls on the Exchange, and of Northern Se
curities on tha curb. The new phase of to
day's rumors regarding the settlement of the
dispute over the distribution of the Northern
SecurltieÂ« assets was that It involved the
lodgmont of control of Northern Pacific,
which is the vital point In the contest in St.
Paul, but not the faintest admission from any
official sourcÂ« of tha truth of the report could
be secured.
It was pointed out that the legal contest to
decide the question will of necessity be
pushed to a conclusion in order to meet the
obligation of the Oregon Short Line directon.
to the holders of the participating bonds. The
extraordinary action of St. Paul in the market
prevented entire discredence of the report.
Room trading incident to the movement was
on an enormous scale, and involved quick
turns in tens or thousands ' of shares. The
movement elsewhere was more moderate and
was accompanied by steady profit taking, not
only in United States Steel preferred but in
others which were prominent in yesterday's 1
rise, notably Erie and Norfolk and Western.
For a while during the final hour the profit
taking became general and rather precipitate
on the day's advance.
The advance started in the Southwestern cot
ton carriers yesterday by the Government's
estimate wae continued to-day with the Mis
souri Pacific leader. Pennsylvania moved out
of its instability of yesterday and shared in
the advance, although its August settlement
was not considered highly satisfactory owing
to the large decrease in gross . earnings, which
had to be overcome by a retrenchment in op
erating expenses. On the other hand, good
August Etatements did not help Southern Rail
way, Norfolk and "Western or Chicago and Al
ton. The Weather Bureau's weekly bulletin
on cotton somewhat â¢ modified the effect of
yesterday's Government estimate and the fore
cast of freezing weather and snow In the West
and Northwest was a factor in the day's
market.
The New Tork money market continued tran
quil, but both the Government and Interior
absorbed further large cash resources. Con
tinental exchange moved against' London, and
gold was marked up another i fraction there.
The stock market here closed unsettled and
irregular by reason of extended late-profit-tak
ing movement. St. Paul's net gain was 6V4,
one point less than the extreme advance.

The demand for fresh fruits wm limited,
and, as there was no movement In shipping
channels, the market had an easy tone with
trade of a hand to mouth character. Fancy
Apples continued firm and the top quotation
was easily obtained for top-quality offerings.
Bartlett Pears from cold storage were still
held firm at $1 5O@l 75 per box. but dealers
experienced some difficulty in selling their
holdings at those figures owing to the abun
dance of second crop offerings, which were
selling at $1 25. Fancy Solway Peaches from
Oregon sold in a small way at 75c per box. but
the top for the general market was 65c. with
plenty of poor stock offering at 35Â©40c. Figs
sold at a wide range as to size of package,
the top rate being obtained for large boxes
from the river. Table and Wine Grapes ruled
very weak, receipts being large and consisting
chiefly of rain-damaged stock. Attractive lots
of Berries met with ready sale, while poor
stock dragged as usual. A large portion of

comparatively light, i In consequence a steady
tone was manifested. December was a shade
lower to a shade higher at $1 13& to |1 13H-
May opsned %<8%c lower to a shade higher at
$1 13% to f 1 13}$. For the first few minutes
pit traders and commission houses were mod
erate buyers, December wiling up to $1 13 ft
and May to $1 13%@1 13%. Liberal arrivals,
however, in the Northwest soon caused active
selling of the December delivery. A reaction
followed, December declining to $112% and
May to '$1 12%. Later the pit crowd bought
back much of the wheat sold earlier In the
day. The market assumed a firmer tone, an
advance of about %c from the lowest point be
ing registered. Additional advices In regard
to reported record-breaking sales of flour in the
Northwest and advices from Australia indicat
ing poor crop prospects had considerable Influ
ence in bringing out the renewed demand.
Quick reversal in sentiment came, nevertheless,
with the announcement of an increase of 10,000.
000 bushels in the world's available stocks, the
market being again subjected to heavy selling
pressure. A3 a result prices slumped and the
feeling at the close was weak, prices being at
the lowest point of the day. Final quotations
on December were $1 12H- May closed at
$112%.
A decrease of 50 per cent In primary receipts
compared with last year counterbalanced the
weakening effect of the lower price of wheat,
creating a firm tone in corn. December opened
Vsi&'lii: higher at 51 ft c to 51 Vic, sold up to
51 ?;c and closed at 51% c. .
Oats were firm. December opened %c to
%@Ho higher at 31%Â®31Vic, sold between
31^0 and Sl^c and closed at 3U;Â®31%c.
Small receipts of hogs and higher prices at
the yards caused a firm tone in provisions
early In the day, but the market weakened
later on selling of brokers suppcsed to be act
ing for local packers. There was also some
profit- taking by outside holders. At the close

R. H. Countryman, attorney for the
F. M. Yorke Company, told about the
incorporation of the concern. The in
vestigation was concluded and the
committee retired to deliberate and
will file a report with the board next
Monday. Its findings will bear on the
right of the Board of Works to direct
whether asphalt or bitumen shall be
used and if so why it does not require
asphalt to be used since the Yorke
Company's bid for asphalt was less
than for bitumen.
bid four cents per square foot for re
pairing with bitumen and only three
cents for asphalt, despite the assertion
that asphalt costs more per ton than
bitumen, saying it was his own busi
ness. Later he stated that less asphalt
was used to cover a given area than
bitumen, there being much sand used,
which costs nothing.
Yorke said that when the contract
was awarded on July 14, 1904, the com
pany was composed of himself and P.
M. Gopcevic, the company being after
ward incorporated.
J. M. McDonald Jr. said it costs more
to lay asphalt than bitumen and gave
figures in support of his assertion.
After Chief Deputy Andy Donovan
and I. Schwartz, a clerk in the Bureau
of the Streets, had testified that de
pendence was placed on Inspector
Boc-ne's pencil report as to the area re
surfaced with bitumen, from which a
demand was made for the payment for
the work. Chairman Brandenstein
charged that there was not a single
employe of the Board of Works who
exercises any cupervision over the fig
ures as returned by Boone, although
there was a mass of redtape so far as
the signing of the demand by an army
of attaches was concerned.

Assistant District Attorney Whiting
said that the affidavits developed into
a case of guessing as to the defend
ant's death. It was impossible for the
prosecution, to bring forward evidence
that he was alive. It would possibly
take weeks before it could be deter
mined whether he was dead or alive.
He would ag^ain move that the bonds
be forfeited and a bench warrant issued
for the arrest of the defendant.
Murphy objected to the forfeiture of
the bonds and asked for another week's
delay, but the Judge granted Whiting's
motion and continued the case till
October 29 to be set for trial. 7 .
At the last calling of the case Attor
ney Frank J. Murphy for the defendant
read affidavits from employes of the
bathhouse at Long Beach to the effect
that the defendant had hired a bathing
machine, and although warned of the
danger from the undertow he took a
swim In the surf and had not been seen
since, the belief be'ng that he had been
drowned. When the case was called
yesterday . further affidavits were read
to the same effect. Murphy asked for
time to get more affidavits and said
that the beach was being patrolled for
Kratz's body.
Kratz was arrested, with his brother-
William of the defunct commission firm
of the Donandt-Kratz Company, on a
charge of felony embezzlement, the
amount reaching over $18,000. William
was tried and convicted and sentenced
to serve five years in San Quentin. The
defendant, A. A. Kratz, ; was waiting
his trial when it was reported that he
had been drowned at Long Beach on
the night of September 15.
Judge Dunne yesterday declared the
bonds of A. A. Kratz, in the sum of
$5000, forfeited, and ordered a bench
warrant issued for his arrest. The sure
ties are Mrs. R. M. White, a sister of
the defendant;* V. Kratz, his father, and
Attorney Hugo D. Newhouse.
The Supervisors' Joint Committee on
Finance and Streets yesterday resumed
its investigation into the contract for
repairing of bituminous and asphalt
pavements, which was awarded to F.
M. Yorke & Co. by the Board of Works.
The line of questioning pursued by the
committee appertained to a clause in
the specifications leaving it to the dis
cretion of the Board of Works as to
whether asphalt or bitumen should be
used on streets paved with a wearing
surface of bituminous rock. The com
mittee held that such a clause would
operate in favor of a bidder who might
be on the "inside." as asphalt costs
more to lay than bitumen. It was ar
gued that such a discretion would wc-rk
a hardship on a contractor who would
be ordered to use asphalt entirely.
Torke's company had never been so
ordered, although its bid was less for
repairing asphalt than bitumen.
Yorke would not explain why he had

McKellar was arrested at his home
by Detective Gibson. He could not ex
plain what he had done with the
money. He said he did not drink,
neither did he gamble, but he spent
the money.
McKellar is now 28 years of age and
had been in the employment of the
company for fifteen years. For some
years he had been confidential clerk
and the firm placed the utmost con
fidence in him. About a year ago Mc-
Kellar went East on a visit and got
married. He and his bride arrived
here three months ago and took up
their residence at CO 8 Elizabeth street.
Prior to his departure for the East
he resigned his position.
Recently a discovery was made that
McKellar's accounts were not straight
and an investigation developed a
shortage of $1360. He had adopted a
system of tags to cover up his de
ficiencies.

ANOTHER FRAUD ORDER
ISSUED BY OFFICIALS
While industriously plying his voca

day afternoon Albert Whiteman, alias
"Tangle the Newsboy," was struck on
that portion of his \ neck colloquially
termed the "Adam'# apple" by an an
cie,nt tomato which some mischievous
hand had hurled. The impact was so
sharp as to burst the vegetable and be
spatter "Tangle's" entire front eleva
tion with crimson pulp. Blinded by an
ger, he rushed around the corner, logic
ally deducing that the missile had been
cast by some person in concealment
there, and the first man he encountered
was Patrolman Joseph Tuite, whom he
punched and cursed until the officer re
covered from surprise and arrested him.
"I don't tink dat dis cop trew de to
mato," said "Tangle" to Judge Conlan,
"but I have a line on de identity of de
guy wot did it, an' if you give me a
chance I'll get him. It was a dirty
trick. Judge. Was yer ever hit in de
mug wid a rotten tomato?"
His Honor had no repollection of hav

"Den yer can't appreciate wot it is,"
sighed "Tangle."
He was given two weeks in which to
find and bring to punishment the per
son who threw the tomato.

Schaefer in a most ; inconsiderate ,way,
as a broken door and defaced walls
.would silently testify if they could be
produced in court. And to convey fur
ther anguish to Mr. Schaefer, the Rileya
refused to allow him to enter the house
or to admit possible future tenants who
desired to inspect it. The front door
was discourteously slammed in the face
of j any f person whom the j Rileys " sus
pected of having even remote connec
tion with Mr.-Schaefer. . So there was
only one course left open to Mr. Schaef
er, and that he took advantage of by
having Mr. Riley arrested on ; the
charge, of malicious mischief. He
hoped the court would do something
to clear his property ; of ' the Rileys. â¢-
Mr." Riley . in ; defense . denied 'Â¦ that he
or any member of his family had ma
liciously, damaged the -doors or walls of
the house. . He did _not Â¦ Intend to evade
payment of ;: the : second ';'., month's^ rent,
but simply postponed paying it until he
could find a more . desirable place Â¦' of
residence. Why should he pay an en
tire I month's rent in advance and Â¦ then
probably find it convenient to move out
a day or two later ? Did the court Im
agine that in such an event jMr. Schaef
, er would return . any portion of the
money^he had. thus received? If thÂ«
court, did: imagine ; such ' a thing .the
court > was :,less sophisticated ' than it

Mr. Riley the court certainly would sot
A policeman testified that when he
arrested Signor Wittele, on complaint
of Signor Daquisto, he found in his
prisoner's possession one large revol
ver fully loaded. Then the Judge con
tinued the case till to-day, when Sig
nor Wittele will: endeavor to prove
that he is not as bad as Signor Da
quisto avers.
Francisco Wittele, charged with
having threatened to kill B. Daqulsto,
was pronounced a very bad man by his
accuser, who resides at 440 Bay street.
, "Heem worka for me in da Alask,"
said Slgnor Daquisto to Judge Mogan,
"an' I fira heem because heem da bad
da man. Heem so'badda dat heem be
putta In de irons on da sheep dat
breeng heem backa from da Alask.
Heem so badda dat heem keela . da

da twenta year. Heem so badda dat
lasta Sund' heem pulla da gun an' say
heem keela me eef I no geeve heem
da four hundred doolaire. Oh, heem
de awful badda man."
Mrs. Lillle Stillman, accused of neg
lecting her three minor children,
pleaded not guilty and produced a trio
of chubby youngsters to convince
Judge Cabaniss that the accusation
was unjust.
"I take care of them as well as I
can," she said, ."but their father, from
whom I am separated, is better able
to provide for their suport than I am.
and you may transfer them to his
custody if you like."
The Judge agreed that the appear
ance of the children did not indicate
maternal neglect, but believed that
it would be better for both mother and
babes if their father was compelled to
pay. for their maintenance. So they
were given into his custody, and the
mother will be allowed to visit them
at reasonable Intervals.
Mary McCarty, who was arrested
for drunkenness five times within as
many days, was up yesterday on an
additional charge of vagrancy " placed
against her by. order of Judge Mogan,
who complained, that her daily arrest
and dismissal with a warning had be
come monotonous. Accompanying
the woman was a pretty fox terrier,
and when informed that the animal
would not be allowed to share her cell
she became hysterical and requested
to be immediately led to execution, as
life without her dog would be barren
of charm for her. Bailiff Hickey dip
lomatically told her that the quieter
she keot the more favorable would
be. her prosoect of seeing the dog at
brief intervals, and her emotion sub
sided sufficiently to permit her re
moval to the prison. She will be in
court to-day for. trial on the vagrancy
charge. Â¦
While ten-year-old Joseph Gatton
was on trial before Judge Mogan for
begging, his father, also baptized Jo
seph, listened to some uncomplimen
tary remarks from Judge Cabaniss,
before whom he was charged with
violating the statute which makes it
a misdemeanor to permit his child to
practice mendicancy. The son was
sent to the Juvenile court and the sire
was dismissed with a reprimand' be
cause the law provides no other pen
alty for a first offense of the kind
alleged against the defendant.
' Four hours after he stole a' coat
Joe Mulhatton, professional mystic
and phrenologist, was arrested ; while
leading the services at a Salvationist
rally. The stolen garment was on his
back, but a bank book containing
1300. in -' currency had disappeared
from one of the pockets.
Henry Wan tz, proprietor of the ho
telat 629 Clay street, in which Mul
hatton obtained his plunder, told Po
lice Judge ' Mogan of" how the rob
bery had been effected. He had taken
off his coat and hung it .upon a hook
in the hotel office, he said, and soon
afterward, when he went to don the
garment, he found that it had been
removed and a substitute left in its
place. The police were immediately
notified, and Inquiry led to the dis
covery that Mulhatton had been
seen loitering in the hotel at the time
the theft was committed, about 4
o'clock Monday afternoon. Soon after
8 o'clock the detectives caught him as
he was enthusiastically exhorting an
assemblage of Salvationists in their
meeting-place on Commercial street.
He was attired in Mr. Wantz's coat.
Neither the bank book nor the money
was on his person, but a handkerchief
that Mr. Wantz identified as his prop
erty lay in one of the pockets.
Mulhatton, short of stature and
wearing a heavy mustache and
chin tuft, pleaded that he knew
nothing at all about the missing
money, and said that if he were given
time he would be able to prove his
innocence. The Judge then continued
the case until next Friday, and hinted
that the defendant might employ the
Interim to his own advantage by di
recting his occult power fo disclose
the whereabouts, of the bank book
and the currency it contained when
it disappeared. Â¥ .! "
