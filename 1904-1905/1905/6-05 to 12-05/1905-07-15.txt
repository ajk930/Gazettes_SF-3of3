COPENHAGEN, Denmark. July 14.â
At to-day's Cabinet meeting It de
veloped that the Ministers were In full
agreement that Prince Charles of Den
mark should accept the crown of Nor

BERLIN, July 14. â The substance of
a statement made in Stockholm yester
day that a German-Swedish alliance
was contemplated was submitted to the
Foreign Office here to-day and the au
thoritati\-e statement made that the
question of an alliance between Ger
many and Sweden had never come be
fore the Foreign Office, nor had it been
discussed to the slightest extent. Of
course, . the Foreign Office could not
deny that Emperor William and King
Oscar had spoken of an alliance during
iheJr interview at Gefle yesterday, be
cause the subject of their conversation
is not known here. No indication of
the result of the meeting between Em
peror William and King Oscar at Gefle,
Sweden, yesterday has reached Berlin,
r.or is any report of their conversation
likely to be made public, as it 1b ex
plained here that this was a strictly
private visit of one sovereign to an
oÂ«ior. ThÂ« inlt!atfrÂ«^^prtrrjaTJty*''vrill
come from this side, as the Emperor
desired to have first-hand knowledge
of the Norwegian-Swedish situation.
The German Government's policy ' is
flne of complete aloofness â almost in
difference â according to the Foreign
OlF.ce. It is expected here that as a
result of. the meeting yesterday Em
peror William and Germany will be de
scribed in some countries as taking un
due interest In Scandinavian affairs and
in seeking for a way to influence a
settlement- Such an idea is disavowed
In advance by the Foreign Offib*-.

DavidÃelasco and Mrs.
Fiske Announce Plan
of Campaign.
Independent Organization Ex
; pects to Have Big Cir
cuit of Its Own.
NEW -YORK. July 14.â Announcement of
a new : combination of actors in America
against what Is known as the theatrical
trust was made -to-day by Lee Shubert.
The pleading companies in the new com
bination are those headed by David Be
lasco and Mrs. Minnie Maddern Flake.
Lee Shubert will manage the line "of the
aters, .which, will be placed at the dis
posal of 'Belasco, Mrs. Fiske and others.
â¢The new combine will back fifteen com
panies; on the road and such actors as
Sarah : Bernhardt, Ada -Rehan. Jefferson
de Angells. Henry Miller. Lillian '\u25a0 Rus
sell, David Warfield.* Blanche Bates,
Bertha Galland. Robert Hllliard. Mrs.
Fiske and Mrs. Leslie Carter. The actors,
under the new management expect with
in another week to have a separate num
ber of theaters on their own circuit in
America -to play; the. year round. Shu
bert -announced that this company now
has fourteen ; playhouses under its con
trol, including . theaters in New York,
Philadelphia. Chicago. St. , Louis and Lon
don,; England., arid that within a week
he ' would Ibe * able to " open aya v dozen . more
to*~hJs rattractions.v"vÃesidesr attractions. v"v Besides these ' places
the new -combination Is'countlng on the
aupportr of | lndependent^houses. -all-over
the country. VThe "amendment by the the
atrical syndicate -managers of a'' contract
which] Shubert*' says ' he " made , with them,
agreeing, to: pay .them 25 per cent i of. -the
profits oh all : of l the' syndicate's attrac
tions * booked :at his theaters, was the
cause of his; break from the trust ranks.
His friendliness â¢:' toward David Belasco
during the last few months, he said, was
a further cause of- the new combine.
"We signed a contract with the theatri
cal syndicate which : Is headed by Klaw
& â¢ Erlanger, ; agreeing \u25a0 that the syndicate
could book their attractions in our houses
for 25 per cent of the profits for a period
of five years." said Shubert. "After we
had signed this contract a letter was sent
to us by the syndicate asking us to amend
the, contract by agreeing not to \u25a0 add any
more" theaters to our own. circuit.
Shubert says at this point he has only
eight .theaters in hi 3 own circuit and did
not feel strong : enough ; to make a fight
against the j syndicate.
~ Y "When I asked." Shubert continued,
"why \u25a0 this new amendment was required.
I was told that our' company had violated
its 'contract s wlth the syndicate by refus
ing :to accept some of. their attracions
which they had booked at our houses.
"They said this was a violation: of our
contract with them, .though that docu
ment J contained the : provision that - the
syndicate 'attractions were at all times
subject" to our. order. After ; this.;con
versation the ! matter 'was allowed to- rest
for' a' tlmeT /; Meanwhile the Lyric Theater
Company : was~extendlng ' Its â¢ own circuit
and 'acquiring, new attractions.
\u25a0 >'. '."When* our company was building the
Garrick ; Theater - ! in i St." t Louis the syndi
cate-told'^ us ;that 'we would not-,be al
lowed to book our own attractions in our
own I houses "If we pursued our policy.
And yet at their, convenience they always
filled ,thelrÂ»tbeaters -with ' om% attractions.
'\u25a0- s "On' my return ' from Europe last June
I ; was ; met .by Mr..' Erlanger. and > had \u25a0 a
chat- with i him. about patching up our
difficulties.' \u25a0"â¢* He told me that if I , did not
book i Belasco ; in 1 * any *of : our theaters I
could have * anything I wanted. Because
I booked-Belasco in one of our houses, the
Garrick, ihe said that ithe tours of "The
Royal Chef , and of .."Fantana," already
booked.^: were . otLmfS&tNJ&B fSBQBBtm
\u25a0 VLet \me ; say that . to the present move
we â¢ are not attempting . to . fight i the : syn
dicate, but merely,' In \ self protection. try-
Ing :to â¢ find . a place ; for 1 our ' own attrac

NEW YORK. July 14. â Folio wlnjr the
sensation created by a Town Topics
man's arrest for alleged extortion of
money from the "400," it became known
to-day that a similar scheme, though
less ambitious, has been operating suc
cessfully.
Having ..as associate members such
men as President Roosevelt, former
President Grover Cleveland, Cardinal
Gibbons, Bishop Potter. Lyman J. Gage.
Andrew Carnegie, David R. Francia,
Senator Depew, the late Secretary Hay.
John Jacob Astor. Dr. Charles W. El
liot, president of Harvard University
and Washington Roebling, If one may
Judge from its letter-head, which bears
the photographs of these men. the "Re
porters' Association of America" haa
been operated so successfully that It
now. occupies, a , handsome office fur
nished with mahogany desks In the
Whitehall building on State street. It
Is needless to say the reporters on
the great New, York newspapers are
not mfmbers of this association. HKB
;.To James P. O'Brien Is ascribed thÂ«
chief 1 credit for, the success of the as
sociation. t although, except for the ex
treme'generosity of many well known
men 'in New York its present success
could - not Â» have been attained. On the
theory, that men actually attached- to
New jTork newspapers as reporters
were beneficaries sof generosity, money
has ben flowing freely Into the asso
ciation's treasury. One man alone con
tributed $S3 0, while many others havo
given somewhat smaller amounts.
In some Instances the money was
paid for the notoriety that was sup
posed to follow the contribution, while
in others the men gave their money on
the supposition that they were engag
ing In a charitaSle enterprise.
It Is through the medium of the
"Public Inspector" that most of ithe
money has been obtained by the con
cern with the high sounding name.
.This Is a monthly publication in which
the : praises are sounded of those who
have in one form or another contrib
uted to the association's treasury.
. Health Commissioner Darlington 1j
one of those who have aided this "Re
porter 3"" Association. Not only has ha
supplied "Public Inspector" with ar
ticles having to do with the public
health, but he has paid for their.ln
sertion, though possibly In an Indirect
manner.
Wallace Jackson, an attorney. , has
been one of O'Brien's most generous
friends. Paying $300 to have a cartoon
and a notice of himself printed, he crave
a like amount to have a picture of hts
wife inserted In the next issue. When
he. learned that she objected to the
plan he paid to have the picture sup
pressed.

H. Able held for the action of th*
XJrand'Jury, Accused of attempting to
extort $500 from Edwin M. Post, a
member; of the Stock Exchange, who
says , he was led to believe that If he
did not subscribe for a volume of
"America's Smart Set" an unpleasant
revelation , about his personal affairs
would be * published , In ' Town Topics.
Assistant District Attorney Krotel con
tinued to-day hi 3 inquiry Into the af
fairs of the Society Editors' Associa
tion.'which was publish ins the work.
He decided, too, that he would llkÂ»
to know something about the Internal
management of Town Topics, ] and for
that purpose requested W. I* . Daniels,
secretary and treasurer- of the - Town
Topics Publishing: Company, to produce
before htm the books and accounts
.which would show what was done ' In
the way of obtaining, subscriptions for
the work "Fads and Fancies," for which
the company received subscriptions
amounting * to . $150,000. although . ths
book,~ after four, years of preparation,
has not been Issued yet. \u25a0
Daniels j asserted r that he .was ; not the
proper person to bring .the books, saying
, this \u25a0 request would have ta .be made of
Judge Deuel of the Special Sessions Court,
who ia one of the three directors of, the
'company, holds a large share of Its stock.
: has . personal supervision of all articles
that go into it weekly and 13 Colonel W.
D. Mann's representative m his absence.
\u25a0 But when 'I Daniels ~ was tef ormed ; that,
i should he not do as requested.' he would
be taken ] before a Judge on Tuesday and
a subpena issued which would bring, forth
the i required books. -he 'said he would do
all he could 1 , to produce ' them. . * .
Judge :DeueV: talking further \u25a0< about his
connection .with Town â Topics, told how
one man paid i a certain amount .to; have
an , unpleasant Item about , him kep,t" from
Town .Topics," but all he had to pay.; said
the ' Judge, was . the expense of the print
er's bilL
, The names of other wealthy society men
and i women ".who paid ' a ' fancy price , for
"America's Smart Set" were made public
to-day. The first : subscriber >to the .work.
It was learned,' was John Jacob Astor, who
paid In $500 on July 30 of last year and a

WASHINGTON. July 14.â There is a de

of the queerest, hottest and most

Death Valley. Inyo County, is .the bone

Already: the Government surveyors have

such' as " might , have ' been hi Its ( day of
moist existence) a "counterpart .of" the 1
GrfeatSaJt Lake." Gradually "its 'waters

. "Death Valley Is not. a dried up Inland
sea or lake; in my .opinion.'* eald thÂ«
colonel. "It; la "ah extinct volcano: one
that was' so immense 'that when It was
active it could not have reared its head
above the earth's surface less than- forty
miles. It was one of the great phenomena
of prehistoric timeâ time when men did
not people the worM, but when all thnigs
were abnormal, according to our latter
day ideas.
"Giant trees and slant reptiles. Giant
mountains and giant birds that flew about
their miles-high peaks. This -was the con
dition of the period of the life of the
Death Valley crater.
"Why do I draw these conclusions?
Weri, -there is nothing to sbqw that a
lake or in inlanS sea ever existed where
is Valley.*'- The bottom of the â¢vat
ley'' Is Surfaced with" a layer of, ashes in
which is hbthins of the 'sediment such- as
develops -after 'evaporation :of\a" body^ot

deposits for a hundred miles from tha de
pressidn. ~ '\u25a0.--.:\u25a0\u25a0'
\u25a0_*?Another remarkable proof that the val
ley was once a. great volcano are the deep
springs extant ;there. Many of >theseare
found tn the valley and some are appar
ently volcanic vents. â¢ " I -had- my -men
fasten'a rope" about my waist and I cau
tiously . approached'-* the edge of onÂ© of
the springs. -It was a peculiar hole, with
steep "sides that were likely to. give way
under- foot, being decomposed, loose ma
terial. 7 -Fifty feet -below tho edge .was a
body of blue : water, so clear. that when I
thrtfW a stone into it my head reeled as 1
watched it go down, down hundreds -of
feet into the bottomless-funnel,.
"The : water of the springs is impreg
nated with* poisonous chemicals and few
of: the springs near the valley can be
utilized for man or. beast.
"When this monster mountain was
belching forth showers of lava and stones
it must have shaken the world. , It slowly
burnt out,: crumbling away with the cen

ALBANY, July 14.â Tne movement In
the Legislature to force a message from
Governor Higgins to permit the appoint
ment of a committee to Investigate
affaire of Insurance companies Â«Q}l come
to a head early next week, when' a peti
tion calling for prompt action on the
part of the executive will be circulated
among the members of both houses and
sent to the Governor. To emphasize this
appeal. Senator Marks will offer, in joint
session, a resolution of tiie same charac
ter.
The demand for immediate action in I
the interests of thousands of persons hold- !
ing policies in the three big insurance I
companies did not abate to-day. Several |
legislators again called upon the Gover-j
nor and importuned him to open the door*i
for legislative relief. His mall to-day {
was filled with letters from persons re- |
siding in all parts of the State who be
lieve that the only way to remedy the
situation is to have a full and complete
investigation by a committee of the Leg
islature.
Some interesting facts not yet published
concerning the payments of large sums
of money to Elihu Root and other "In
fluential" persons by officers of the
Equitable Society j appear in the testi
mony taken by Superintendent of * Insur
ance Hendricks during the examination
cf James W. Alexander, former president
of the society! A stenographic report of
this part of the examination, which was
conducted by Hendricks himself, fol
lows:
'"Mr. Elihu Root, I see, has had $10,
000?"
"We retained Mr. Root as soon as he
retired from the War Department, under
rhc impression that it would be good
business to have him." ;,-/""
"Under a retainer?"
"Under a $10,000 retainer. He did a good
deal of work. He has rendered his bill
for $15,000, and has asked to be dis
charged."
"This is the first payment of Febru
ary 20?"
"That was merely a second retainer for
him. he came to me and asked for it and
I gave it to him."
"On April 11. I see, you paid him* $15,
000?" â¢ â¢
"Then he rendered a bill for $15,000,
which was paid, for services he had per
formed during these difficulties, and asked
to be discharged as counsel, which was
voted by our legislative committee."
-Is Mr. Lauterbach your counsel?"
"Is Mr. Cohen counsel for the Equit
able?" ---:.-^: ;
"Judge Cohen I retained in the early
stages of this thing myself, expecting
him to" be counsel for the Equitable. He
has rendered no bill to the society yet,
but I take it- for granted we must pay
him for certain services."
"I see that In 1900 you 'paid Mr. David
B. Hill as counsel $7500?"
"That retainer was started by Mr. Hen
ry B. Hyde, under the impression that It
was a good piece of business to have
Hill under retainer as an astute lawyer
that could be of benefit to the society in
the proper way. and I have simply gone
on with it."
"What service has he given you?"
"He has given us from time to time
advice as we applied for it."
"I see he has been giving that every
year?"
"Yes, sir."
â¢What advice did he give you?":
"Ho has given us advice In regard to
questions of law and questions of ad
ministration and whenever we have felt
that there was anything that we could
get from him."
"Do you really call- on him every year
for something?*' . '
"We really called on him from time to
timeâ quite frequently."

TAFT PARTY
AT HONOLULU
HONOLULU. July ; 14.â Secretary . /of
War'Taft and party arrived this morn :
ing: on the steamship Manchuria. Soon
after the. vessel' docked, the visitors' went
driving to the Pali. As the guests of the
citizens' committee, they visited local
places of interest and had luncheon at
the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, where Sec
retary Taft made an address.
The Manchuria was met outside of the
harbor by Acting Governor Atkinson and
a committee of citizens. The \u25a0: members
of the distinguished party declared they
had' an enjoyable' voyage to . Honolulu.
There were several dances on board in
which Secretary Taft and % Miss Roosevelt
participated. ' Lectures were also given on
Philippine subjects. Secretary Taft. in
an interview referring to Chinese exclu
sion said that it Is not proposed to ad
mit any more Chinese of the coolie class,
but merely to treat more courteously Chi
nese that are entitled to admission to the
United States. The Manchuria left for
Manila to-night at 6 o'clock. , ,
Secretary Taft and party were guests
this afternoon at a luncheon given
at the \u25a0 Hawaiian HoteL . The dining
room -â¢\u25a0was. -..elaborately dcorated and
a large gathering of territorial of
ficials and prominent citizens was 'pres
ent Territorial Secretary Atkinson rpre
sided. In his address of welcome he made
reference to . the probability . of Secretary
Taft being a future nominee for-Presi
dent and his remarks met with general
applause.
Secretary. Atkinson said In the course of
his remarks ' that Hawaii as , a fortified
post was more Important to the United
States than the Philippines will ever be.
In responding to the toast "The Presi
dent," Secretary Taft began with a hum
orous reference to Miss Alice Roosevelt
and her representation of * the President,
and continuing said that President Roose
velt was anxious to visit Hawaii,* but be
ing unable to cbme himself had sent along
a member .of his family and: that 'for
straightforwardness and strenuousness
the President was well represented by his
daughter. ' .
Speaking seriously Secretary.. Taf t sug
gested that the best way *< to handle in
sular affairs - would be to have a bureau
at Washington devoted to- looking after
Alaska, s liawali. the - Philippines and
Porto Rico. -.â¢j**^**â
Later i in ) the afternoon Secretary Taf t.
Miss i Roosevelt and â¢ others ! of the ; party
went to Waiklkl beach and experienced
surf riding.
Secretary.Taf t says that Governor.Car
ter. haÂ« \u25a0 had i Â»' guccesaful administration
of Hawaii ' and he : believed r that > h4 .'will
\u25a0withdraw /'his resignation- after.-, having

It was a bitter disappointment to some
who expected jto pick up \ money.

the mine has panned out -"rich': Gerard

given. Gerard a chance to help spend any
of the fabulous ; output yet. * Gerard \u25a0 took
him aside to-night and gave him a little
piece of his mind. And there i were peo
ple about . town who said that j Scotty had
been ' summoned; from CallfoKnia to ex
plain. 7 He and his * yellow \ dog . arrived
over the New York Central at 9:30 ' this
morning on the Twentieth Century Lim

\u25a0 One thousand people were jat the Grand
Central "station when he -and /the dog
hopped off the- train. V The- police pushed
the crowd back and Scotty in an electric
hansom went to \u25a0 the "; Putnam House. \u25a0/. If
anybody thought he could give the Death

he was very > much mistaken. -For' twÂ«>

Scotty drew up to the Putnam House bar
and exhibited his spending ; powers by,
buying for about a dozen acquaintances^
The ': miner ; drew .: out ' * a v wad of g yellow '
backs and paid. Then he pocketed 25
cents change. - Finally he engaged a\ $5
a day room. at the ,- Herald ; Square Hotel.'
' "I'm going to Wall \ street >to " see a a
friend," he exclaimed,, and climbed into
his hansom. His appearance .was enough
to attract attention, for he wore a rough
suit, a soft blue flannel shirt, ; a flaming
red tie and -, a wide-brimmed black felt
hat. All .Wall street ; stopped . work ; to
take a look. The 'curb market was
swamped by the crowd. Scotty fled into
the Stock Exchange. A messenger :â¢ boy
brought three tickets to the \u25a0 gallery "> and
the miner gave him $5. ; The ,\ brokers
shouted as they saw Scotty. In acknowl
edgment Scotty. gave ; a wild whoop and
threw\ his ; hat among them. "v There \ was
such a crowd that he had to leave by . the
side entrance and run for his hansom. \u25a0_\u0084
In the afternoon he held a levee at the
hotel. First he led the reporters upstairs,
ordered four quarts : of whisky and? made
a speech, saying: : . ;'..
"Now, you fellows ' have heard a ; lot
about the way I spend^ money. -I like to

: : Scott -at '. t that â¢ time \fcould ;; not refrain
from. ' a '] few spectacular \u25a0 demonstrations:
He came lntq^town one day with his wife
and a big - b"ag : girt * about with ( chains
and â¢ sealed ' with :a j couple -of padlocks.
This bag weighed over - 100 \u25a0'. pounds * and
when Scott marched ;up Main street ,with
the bag on his back the spectacle aroused
not a little Interest and speculation. ; . Scott
marched straight h into ; Chris S Franzen's

that Scott; at "\u25a0 that time vouchsaf ed. ., . \u25a0 y * j
The peculiar looking, bag remained in an

."There's $12,000 In there,'.'; declared Scott.

Scott s next;, carried'; the ' sack ; down . to : * the
First National Bank. It was placed in a

took faS fancy,; to l Cashier .; Castleman and
told 4: hlm\ ai good deal about his ? Death

that but himself* and. two or three

Site -of 1200 Acres
Special Dispatch to Tho CalL
NEW YORK. July 14.â Dr. Darlington,
Commissioner of Health, was authorized
by the Board of Estimate to-day to pur
chase a tract of more than 1200 acres of
land in Orange County. Catskill Moun
tains, for the establishment of a. muni
cipal hospital for the treatment of con
sumptives, and bonds to the amount of
$250,000 were authorized to pay for the.
property. At 'present there are forty
farm houses on the tract, " which. Mr.
Darlington says, can be fitted up at com
paratively little expense to accommodate
more, than 400 patients within a* month
or. two after the city obtains title to tha
property.
Dr. Darlington appeared before ,thÂ«
board and announced that he had ob
tained options on this land and that, he
had "tramped about". \ the entire tract,
within the last week and considered it
an ideal spot for a hospital of this sort.
He said it was 'situated at the top of
Shwangung Mountain, and was mora
than 1200 feet above the level of the sea.
Continuing, he said it would make thi
nnest institution for tne treatment of tu
bercular disease controlled by any city in
the world, and that be desired to" obtain
the appropriation at once in order ' to
buy the property before the opposition on
the part of other property owners bÂ©-.
came too strong. He pointed out that
there were more than 25,000 consumptives
In New York City to-day and added that
none but "curables" would-be sent to this
Institution:
"While there," he continued, "besides
curing them of disease, we Intend to ed
ucate them in hygiene, diet and other
vital points, so they will not only taka
care of themselves on returning to their
homes, but will educate their neighbors
and 'relatives, as welL, In this way. be
sides curing those already afflicted, an
institution of this sort will serve as a.
preventive."

SCANDAL BREAKS
IN RAISIN CITY
C, L. Hollis, a Painter, Pro
poses to Bribe the Board
of Supervisors in Fresno
HIS SCHEME EXPOSED
Blackmail Alleged in Plot
Involving Assessment of
Pacific Coast Oil Company
Special Dlesatcb to The Call.
FRESNO. July 14.-* big sensation
was sprung at a meeting of the Super
visors to-day. H. G. Morrow, agent of
the real estate and tax department or
the Pacific Coast Oil Company, threw the
bombshell when he declared that C I*
Hollis, a well known painter, had eaid
that through him the Supervisors could
be bribed to Btop all proceedings point
ing toward an increase in the assessment
of the Pacific Oil Company's pipe line.
The company was in danger of being
called on to appear before the board to
show cause why the assessment should
not be raised.
Morrow produced two letters signed by
HbTlis to prove his charges. They. were
both written by John Page, the manager
of the company, and contained the Infor
mation that the writer "could give valu
able information regarding the assess
ment of the Pacific Coast Oil Company*
holdings in Fresno County." Hollls had
declined to give the names of the Super
visors. He merely stated, according to
Merrow. that one member of the Board
of Supervisors had told him that, unless
the matter was fixed up. the Pacific Oil
Company would be cited to appear before
the Board of Equalization. This Super
visor. Hollis said, could influence * one
other member, and these two could Influ
ence a third. He also stated, says Mor
row, that the chairman and two other
members were dummies and anything
could be passed under their noses. ' Hollis
thought the sum required would be about
$509. He said he would have to be the
go-between. Hollis. according to the tes
timony of Morrow, was frank in admit
ting to Morrow that it was a question of
blackmail and that if the company did
not want to do anything he could let the
matter drop. Morrow said he would" re
port the matter to Page. Since ; that
time he has not seen Hollls. Upon re
turning to Ban Francisco be told Page
about the matter. Page did not commu
nicate with, Hollls but received from him
the following letter:
"Dear Sirâ l wrote you' a letter some
time ago. It will be hard to win a cause
with a minority of soldiers on your side
of the fence. I shall be in Fresno for a
week yet. If you think I am in any way
mistaken Just consider the incident
closed. Otherwise I can help you. Tours
very truly. "C L. HOLLIS "
The charge made by Morrow before the
board naturally caused a big sensation.
The District Attorney was present and
the question of proceeding against Hol
lis was referred to him. The board took
up the assessment of the property repre
sented by Morrow. The assessment of
the company's holdings in Fresno County,
which consists principally of pipe lines
and pumping stations, is $460,000.
Hollis is said to be in Los Angeles and
the Supervisors have expressed their in
tention of making a search for him and
bringing him back to answer to the
charges against him.

FOLSOM, July 14. â Joseph Murphy,
who was one of "the murderers of

and noose were adjusted, not saylns
a .word. The trap was sprung a few
minutes after. 10 . o'clock. His body
hardly. Quivered after the drop and. in
twelve minutes he was pr inpunced
dead. ... . - . "..-'".

ONE DOLLAR PER YEAILBASTILE'S FALL
IS CELEBRATED
French Colonies of This City
Observe Birthday of Lib
erty in La Belle France
EXERCISES ARE HELD
Thousands Gather at Chutes
and Join in Festivities
That Last Till Early Morn
The French people ot this city and
Oakland celebrated the 116 th anniversary
of the Fall of the Bastlle yesterday at
the Chutes and in Mechanics' Pavil
ion with patriotic exercises. The
day Is a national holiday In France, and
wanderers from that republlo observe It
with as much patriotism as do their peo
ple at home.
The Chutes, where* the offldsi celebra
tion was held, presented aa appearance of
G"&y splmdor. French and national flags
were floating In the air from all points.
The theater, where the exercises : were
held during the afternoon, was artistic
ally decorated with the flags of the. two
nations, * and the pictures of Roosevelt
and Loubet stood out In prominence. The
literary and musical exercises were very
Impressive. Owing to the absence of A.
Rcneovieri. who Is In. the East. O. Bozlo
acted as president of the day. The ex
ercises commenced with an overture,
"William Tell," by the orchestra, O. Bo
do read the programme, and an address
by Mayor Eugene E. Schmic& followed.
Consul E. L. Lanel made a short talk.
Mario and Marie Roeckel sang "Les
Rives de France." Hon. Julius Kahn
delivered an address in English and M.
Robert Dupouey talked in the French
tongue. â¢The Etar-Spangled Banner"
was sung by Lucle Fichter and the na
tional hymn, of France. "La Marseil
laise," was beautifully* rendered by M.
M. Solomon, the audience Joining him In
the chorus. The Knickerbocker Male
Quaret concluded the. afternoon's exer
cises by rendering "Le Chant dv De
part." !;-;-j
In the evening the grounds were
thronged with people. A grand ball was
held in the pavilion and the multitude
Joined in otcer festivities In honor of
the downfall of the French monarchy.
Congressman Kaha's address in English
was in cart as follows:
On this anniversary celebration tbÂ« children
cf Columbia, extend congratulations and felici
tations to the sons iand daughter* or eunny
France. And In co doing, we know full vrtll
the debt of gratitude our countrymen owÂ« to
your ancestors; we can never forget that the
brtlllact, dashing, valorous Lafayette, and the
watchful, courageous, intrepid Roch&mbeau
\u25a0were the xwrsonal friends and gifted advis
ers of our own Washington. \VÂ« shall always
remember that during those darkest days of
our Revolutionary War, when the courage of
our HJ-pa:d. 111-fed, 111-clad Continentals was
at Its lowest ebb. the star of hope again be
gan to shed its refulgent rays upon their
jjaiient brows when they learned that hun
creds of gallant Frenchmen would soon seek
the shores of the United States to help the
despairing American colonisu strike an effec
tive blow in the sacred cause of freedom.
Indeed, long before our Declaration of In
dependence had been promulgated to taÂ« civil
ized worlu enunciating the doctrine that "all
men are created equal, that they are endowed
by their Creator with certain unalienable
rights; that among these are life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness," your own Jean
Jacques Rousseau in his "Discourse on the
Origin of Inequality Among ilen" had al
ready proclaimed views cf Identically similar
import.
Voltaire and Montesquieu had also , been
preaching the gospel or -liberty and equality.
And their utterances fell upon fertile soil, for
they ripened into full fruition on the 14th day
of July. KBB.
The American colonies had dÂ«nled the right
of the English Government to tax them with
out representation in the British Parliament.
The - taxes which the Ministry of the mother
country tried to lmpos* upon bÂ«r colonies were
not onerous â they were not burdensomSâ but
the bare principle was absolutely repugnant to
American patriotism. The result waa inevit
able, and ail the peoples of the civilized world
have learned the familiar tale.
- The people of France likewise were groan
ing urder a system of taxation. But to them
the tax was a heavy burden because It was
cruelly unjust. \u25a0It was galllngly oppressive!
The common people were forced to supply the
necessary funds, not for great public Im
provements, not for national enterprises, not
for the general welfare, not for protection to
lire and property, but to enable a reckless,
heartless, unheeding court to wallow in the
slime of corruption, and profligacy, and Ucen
ilousnsFs. For 175 years there had been no
convocation of the representatives of thÂ« peo
ple. During all that time the word of the
Monarch was absolute; and, alas! all too fre
quently, the word of some famous court beauty
was still more absolute.
Dared * citizen to cry . out against the
perfidious system, aye! more, dared merely
the finger of suspicion but be pointed against
some hapless, though honest, French burgher,
a "'lettre de cachet" would quickly send him
to tb* dreaded Bastille â that stern, grim,
gloomy, old structure â part fortress, part pris
on â that stood the mute embodiment of cruel
ty, of tyranny, ef absolutism. In that prison
be languished - until - death or some f ortultlous
clreumKtance brought him a blessed relief.
Small wonder then that when the fierce,
seething, pent-up rage of the tolling masses,
who had lain cowed and subdued for so many,
many years, finally burst its bonda and sought
to wreak Its vengeance on some fitting object
of hatred and malevolence, all eyes should have
turned instinctively to that cruel, silent monu
ment of Iniquity and â¢ oppression. Small won
der then that when. the fires of patriotism that
so long n&d lain subdued and smoldering were
gradually fanned into a raging. Irresistible
conflagration, the torch and the cannon should
have been brought quickly Into requisition in
order to accelerate . and thoroughly complete
the work of demolition and . annihilation. It
wu but the work of a few hours â and then
all was over! . The' Bastille had fallen â the
revolution had begun I >
CELEBRATION AT PAVnibjf.
' There were; many present . at the exer
>, cises held -in : the . evening In Mechanics'
1 Pavilion"- who had attended the first San
1 Francisco celebration, j twenty-six ' years
? ago, of the Fall of the Bastlle. Enthu
j slasm . was manifest on every, hand and a
fitting tribute was paM the French flag.
M. EX Raas acted an president of the
evening. Jean B. Perron sang "The Mar
seillaise," and "The Star Spangled Ban
nef" was rendered by â¢ Mme. ; Lucle
Fltcher. ': .- .
M. J. . Lambla spoke" of the enthusiasm
of twenty-five. years ago when for the
first time the republic of France '\u25a0 and
Frenchmen residing on. this coast cele
brated the Fall of the Bastile. The speak
er Eald he rejoiced to see so many -of the
older generation of Frenchmen assembled
in the Mechanics' Pavilion to celebrate
with a younger generation the great na
tional holiday.' He would not trespass on
what the speaker "of ~ the * evening, S. * J.
Brun. might have , to . say, ; yet , he could
not let this great occasion pass I without
thanking, the American * population ".< for
their presence twentyrslx .'years ago : as
well as the existing, occasion. '- and- he
hoped that France and the United States
would always lead the nations :of _ the
world and work for , a common purpose,
the enlightenment of mankind.
S. J. Brun, orator of the 'evening, dwelt

James Meredith, wen.

W. M. Davis, chow.
The race for the office of bailiff . of
the Supreme Court has been finished.
It looked like a dead heat up to al
most the last second, but Meredith de
veloped unexpected speed and . came
first under the wire. , Captain Birlem
waa easily fourth. -The next in line
was Samuel Beckett. Some of the
others who also ran are Joseph God
dard, George Dryden;. Henry Angelo, G.
A. Capenvv "Frederick Frank
Elliott, St.' Clair Joriesr A. O. Perkins,
C. C Duhain, W. H. Brown. J. a Gould.
H. McLean Hurdesty and E. I. Robin
son. , \u25a0 -
" There were countless others who
were entered in the race. -A dozen were
scratched and a large number of others
were left at the post. The decision
cannot be disputed, for the Judges ara
the men who have the last say.' in near
ly every Important dispute In Califor
nia.' .;â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0 -- \u25a0 '. \u25a0-'.. -i ,y. . '-
The tale of how "Jim" Meredith gath
ered in the job. will long be crooned
to Incipient statesmen at the political
firesides of the Golden State. There
were "pulls" of sufficient strength , to
tax the determination of any but the
Jurists of. the -high tribunal..^ There
were little tugs ; at the wires until the
unmakers of the work of Legislatures
were almost driven frantic. Meredith
won on his personal qualifications, with
a half-hearted indorsement . by "Sad-
Eyed Jim" Kelly. ,
The successful candidate is very
popular throughout, the State, j He is
genial and accommodating and will un
doubtedly, perform the duties of ' his
new position- to the -satisfaction of the:
court and- of outsiders who, have deal
ings with : the Justices. He is 8 stanch
Republican, who has demonstrated his
worth on many a hard-fought field. :;,,
When Major Ezra Washburn | joined
the majority a few .weeks | ago there
was a rush for his former position al
most before the body had grown cold
In death. The applicants and their sup
porters came in : squads and battalions
and regiments to the seventh floor of
the Parrott building. \u25a0 Each one. wasted
much valuable /judicial time and went
"away confident of victory and sorry for
his opponents, ; who were, breaking
down the doors to . tell the .jurists of
their numerous qualifications. .
Samuel Horton' was the "organiza
tion's" candidate and at first he looked
like a sure winner. On the : first vote
Justices Lorigan, McFarland and Hen
shaw declared themselves In favor -of
Horton. Justice Angellotti, with the
support of Justices Shaw, and Van Dyke,
signified their approval of. Captain Bir
lem, ex-prison official at San Quentin.
Chief Justice â¢ Beatty : voted I f or "W. M.
Davis, guard officer at Folsom, first,
last and *a!K the time. : None of the
jurists seemed; inclined- to- change his
mind 'and as f a vote, of. four, was neces
sary for election the matter was passed.
On the next round, two weeks later, the
vote 'was unchanged,' except that Jus
tlve Van Dyke Is reported to have
switched to Davis. There the matter
rested. . : ; : "::"\u25a0
Supreme Court Clerk Frank Jordan
had meanwhile dispensed .with the; ser
vices of .Meredith in the - Los Angeles
office; because the latter did not do as
his -superior thought best In matters
having no connection with the official
duties of his position. Jordan'recom
mended him for his ability and put
Robert ' Dunlap In his place. The Jus
tices all know j Meredith and when he
applied' for the position J of bailiff : at
tention-was paid to his remarks.' "A
compromise seemed the only thing pos
sible and a little quiet work was done
to end the fight.
;â¢ The rumor originated from; no one
knows where, that the courteous Jus
tice Angellotti and the affable- Justice
Shaw did the fine, ltalian work neces
sary to turn the " trick. The political
organizations should consider both
these gentlemen when heavy engineerr
Ing is needed. Both asserted in chorus
yesterday, "There Is; no politics In the
Supreme Court. : We voted spontaneous
ly, for; Meredith .without previous cau-'
cus or discussion." . \u25a0 '\u25a0.."\u25a0" '.
, When- the vote took plaice at 11:29
o'clock yesterday mornings. Chief/Jus
tice Beatty stood^by his guns ; and sup
ported . Davis, Justice Lorigan â¢ still \ up
held the Horton standard, but Justices
Angellotti, Shaw,; Henshaw,' Van" Dyke
and McFarland carried the day.
. : The .'position ; Is .' worth $125 \u25a0 a month
and' ls;for life.-- The "duties; consist of
looking wise and collecting the" salary.'
Captain Poole,' the'other, bailiff, 1 says he
[will ; continue to j discharge : his duties in
the same spirit as before and is rejoiced l
to have some one to assist â¢ him.V. Poole
will be promoted to"a~ generalship and

Moshele, the Jewish King Lear,' blind,
hears f his daughter^-the " Cordelia ; daugh-f
â¢terâ sobbing at his misfortunes. He asks
the servant, "starving .' like himself under
the cruel reign: t "Dp ; I not
hear some: one sobbing?": . â¢ :",'/.
"No, master,'.' says the faithful servant,
gripping â¢ his solar plexus, "It is only my
stomach rolling.".^-*' f : -
This Is ; "King , Lear as . seen by Jacob
Gordin, who four : years ago. sprung; the
Jewish King i Lear ; upon a waiting world.
It Is one of- the; most /characteristic" bits
in the piece, the. Bame naive," primitive
mixture .of comic . and '/\u25a0/. tragic f r ruling
throughout. \ Mr. , Gordin probably] knows
what his audiences [ want. . Certainly* Mr. |
Glickman knows," and knowing 'gives -It
to them with both hands \ and a ; tiger.
Otherwise v I ; think ; that \u25a0': Mr. . Glickman
would i hardly consent %- to [ permit , his
Mosheleâ the King \u25a0 Learâ that' in some
points ' touches 'greatness," to \ bo 'obscured,'
canceled, by j the .incongruous ; ; comedy,
surrounding it. This, > mostly, ;is ; Gordin's
fault, but not all." Gordin suppllesTah;
artlessâ and blasphemousâ "comic ]-. relief^'
every "time the situations ' 'become^
strained. ' Mr. Glickman > help 3",' him i'; by.
giving the role of the servant (thetFo<#
into the hands of Schoenholtz.^wno;
couldn't be ; anything . but r funny Jif4he_
would, wouldn't . if. he could,*' - and
shouldn't if he would. , I think even that.
Mr. Schoenholtz, : when I he* comes ; on with
his throat , striped with , sinews t like . a
Hindoo Famine Fund patient,' is momen
tarily trying to be serious. . But ; it Is' 1 a
pity to waste him that way, and'anyway
Mr. ,' Schoenholtz can' t : get \ that
way. _.;.:.;_â¢ :'-:\':~.~''\u25a0'.'.:: '- : \' : ~.~ ''\u25a0'.' . : \u25a0'\u25a0 "\u25a0:".% -V: *\u25a0",-.'.,' \u25a0\u25a0.â¢'\u25a0- ;
But as I 6ald before,;. this Is probably
what the audience wants. -Last night the
Columbia audience, that rippled- full to
the last seat In the house, laughed and
cried with the players : said . "Oh !"â long
drawn v out and' pitifulâ when the cruel
daughter .would not give papa" to'eat ana
"Do you see . that 'i now?" , when . the
shrunken mamma of the second act
comes in.
.The story goes ..that Moshele, a rich
Jew, desiring . to^ go to -Palestine for. a
kind of pilgrimage, /makes over to his
three daughters his : property. - The elder
two are married, - the younger not mar
ried^but engaged to a, "German" teacher
of advanced views. She also is advanced,
a i new woman, in â¢ fact.',: Wants to be a
doctor, , and ; her father with a racial and
conservative prejudice flouts her; for,- it.
It . is an obvious i- flout, , even : . to the -. un-
Yiddish eye, f or v Mr. Glickman slaps the
young lady In. the face with a document
he happens to j have In < his hand. \u25a0 Lucky,
it was not ; a 'chair leg. Of course, } the
daughters and . their husbands get ; control
of the money and starve' papa anfl
mamma and ; the ; faithful servant.,,,-..-
But, in spite of ; the ; cruelty, â¢ the wild
naivete .of . the \u25a0 \u25a0 thing,; Mr. Glickman's
Moshele has many thrills. \ : -. When . roused
by his son-in-law's abuse of* the mother,
he thunders "thief!" at: hlm,\ and â¢ drags
away the keys of >\u25a0 the house,', there was
a tremendous dignity and passion, amaj
esty even in the acting that will not be
easily forgotten. "And there were many
moments of almost equal power.
Miss Clara-, Raff alo was -the Jewish
Cordelia," and sincere and effective. Miss
Eva - Katz, { the â¢ red -headed comedian \of
"Gabriel," \u25a0 was Glttele, the - cruel daugh
ter, and shrewish enough If not convinc
ingly cruel. Mr. Goldberg was \ her ; hus
band, Charef , \ and the . villain prlmo," and
Bernard Schoengold virile and likeable as
the -* teacher. The '; rest fitted well Into
the picture. ; . ' . ;

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
SIMS POUNDER SAYS HE IS
AN ILLEGAL IMPORT.
English Coachman Sues
Millionaire and Asks
His Arrest.
REACHES A DIZZY .
HEIGHT BUT DROPS
Charges Charles But
ters With Breaking
Alien Labor Law.
OAKLAND, , July 14.â Charles Butters,
mining man and millionaire, residing in
the fashionable residence district called
Claremont, received a letter last night
from former Judge Charles W. Slack of
Ean Francisco, his attorney. Informing
him that the extraordinary charge of
violating the alien contract labor law,
preferred against the millionaire by Sims
Pounder, an imported English coachman
recently discharged by Mr. Butters, need
not longer worry him. The charge made
by the enraged coachman, and by him
carried to the British Consul in San
Francisco, Courtenay Bennett, had been
dropped, the letter 'said, and no further
apprehension need be entertained by Mr.
Butters that he might be brought into
couri to answer to such a sensational
allegation. The case had been settled out
cf court. - '
Judge Slack explained to-day that the
money paid to Pounder was not in rec
ognition of any justness in the informal
chaise that Mr. Butters had violated the
contract labor law. but was merely to
compensate- the coachman for what
might have been regarded as a summary
tUsniissal from Mr. Butters* service.
THE OXI.Y REAL ARTICLE.
Simp Pounder' was discharged by But
ters two weeks ago "for .cause." He had
been brought from England to have the
care of Butters' extensive stables in
Oakland, to occupy the box when But
ters or his family took the. air, to give
tone and distinction to an establishment
already noted for its irreproachable order
tml Ibe splendor of its appointments. .
Sims Pounder unquestionably was the
genuine article, â¢ direct from the merry
green fields of England, with an accent
end a bearing marking him as the real
tuing in the way of an imported coach
tnan. He had been engaged by an agent
of Butters in England to come all the
way to California and serve as head of
the Butters stables. From the beginning
he was a brilliant success, and one tri
umph after another accomplished by the
deft servant so pleased his grateful and
gentrous master that Coachman Poun
?tr'e wage Increased rapidly, and tn-.'a
u-w brief months he had his salary raised
froia r an insignificant figure to â¢. $50 , a
month-
At that dizzy financial altitude the
coachman took the step which, ap
parently, was to prove his own undo
ing, and incidentally to involve But
ters la a series of most annoying inci
dents.
The cdachman married and chose for
hi* bride a pretty English maiden, the
personal attendant of Mrs. Charles
Butters. . According to T. C- West of
West, de Journel.& O'Neil of San Fran
cisco, who later became attorneys for
Sims Pounder when the coachman de
cided to have Mr. Butters punished for
alleged violation of the contract labor
law. this marriage was deeply resented
by Mrs. Butters and by Mr. Butters,
too, eventually.
The coachman made some slip or
other and then came the command that
pent both of the two Imported servants
from the Butters mansion.
In *ot "aste and 'Ighly hindignant
Elms Pounder hurried to the British
Consul In San Francisco, Courtenay
Bennett, and there stated his case. He
had been wronged. The contract labor
law had been violated. Mr. Butters
fchould go to Jail or pay heavy damages.
COSTSTJL' ADVISES CAL3IXESS.
The Consul, cool and impartial, decided
that Sims Pounder had a case for at
torneys and not for Consuls, and ad-
Vised Pounder accordingly.- '
Negotiations were ' then carried on
between the two firms of lawyers,
Judge Slack "pooh-poohing" the idea
that> Mr. Butters- was liable to punish
ment under' the alien contract labor
law, and Mr. Pounder's attorneys in
sisting that their client was determined
to have Mr. Butters in court and probe
the matter to the bottom."
"I am familiar with the alien" con
tract labor law,** said Judge Slack to
day, "end I could not see that Sims
Pounder had any case against Mr., Bu
tters. " The latter authorized me. how
ever, to make an offer of money de
manded by' Pounder.' and I Informed
Pounder's lawyers that such' an ;offer
could be accepted by them In settlement
of all claims. In the letter- giving: this
intermation I. assured them that this
was the only proposition that would be
made, and I did not" think that- Mr.
Butters was obliged to do even .that
much. The "offer was accepted, 'how
ever, they have the check for the
amount and the Incident is dosed."
Mr. Butters Is an Oakland citizen
\u25a0whose great. fortune was made in-min
ing In. South Africa with his brother,
Henry "A. Butters.

asserts that he believes the only remedy
for the condltian is through State le^isla
lation. He thinks "all "cows shown to be
affect ed should be destroyed at the ex
pense of the State- "
Archibald cited- that' in one dairy he
recently visited fifty-three out of flf^y
seveh cows were afflicted. The Inspector
said a cow could be 'condemned but: no.
provision was made In the-law to destroy
the diseased animal. / He estimates 'â that
within fifteen years, i the present rate be
ing jnalntained. more than one-half of th 6
cows In California .will be tubercuiar. v-
Archibald concludes: - . '.\u25a0 â¢'.-. â¢".
"The condition of the cows throughout
the State is a grave menace to the'health'
of the entire pcpulatlori.;;l think that. the
next Sate Lcgislaure should be asked": by,
the State Board of Health. to take steps
at once to remedy the evil that; affects
evÂ«ry man, woman and child In the

Mongolians on Jack

Close Call.
Bark Yosemite r Built
in iB6B, Changes
Owners. -
The Chinese junk Jack and Jim, one
of the most picturesque craft on the
bay, was dismasted early yesterday
morning: during- a heavy Equal off
Hunters Point. Overboard with the
mast went Ho Kai, the' captain of the
Junk. Yuen Fong:, the tlllerman, . res
cued Ho with great difficulty. An Ital
ian fisherman towed the dismasted junk
into Baden.
The John and Jim. when not blowing*
or drifting 1 about the bay, lies to- a
rock anchor oft the Pacific Mall wharf.
She is engaged In the shrimp trade and
was bringing- a cargo of the crustaceans
to the city when the gale whipped out
her mast. Captain Ho Kai was in the
waist of the junk, wrestling- with the
halyards of the lateen sail when the
spar cracked, and sail, mast and Chi
nese flopped over the side. Leaving
the-tiller, Yuen Fong- crawled toward
where Captain Ho was splashing- and
yelling- in the water.- Ho was tang-led
In the wreckage and every time the
junk fell into a sea Ho's head was sub
merged. By the time Yuen got a good
grip on Ho's pigtail Ho was past yell-
Ing and it was a cold and quiet Mon
golian that Yuen Fong*s strong arms
hauled aboard the John and Jim. Beat
ing a suspended tomtom with one hand
and pouring gin down Ho's throat with
the other, Yuen Fong soon restored his
skipper to consciousness. By that time
there was work for them both. The
gale had freshened and the Jack and
Jim was leaking like a sieve. While Ho
pumped, Yuen Fong cut away the
wreckage, but even then " the Junk
would have been lost but for the timely
appearance of an Italian fisherman In
his gasoline crab boat. The Junk was
towed to Baden and will not be In com
mission for several days.

Bark Yosemlte Changes Hands,
The old bark Tosemite was Bold yesterday
by Landers & Klrschman to Captain J. Berg
man. No vessel en this coast Is better knawn
than the Yosemlte and few now la commission
have been longer In service. She was built in
ISCS and la spite of being nearly forty years
old is still fairly stanch. In her day the
Yosemite was one of the smartest of Ameri
can clippers and has to her credit more than
one "'flash" passage .between here and New
York. For many years ehe has been In the
coast trade. Two years ago she figured at a
high rate on the overdue list, but It was not
tfcÂ« Yosemlte' s fault. She was bound for Aca
pulco and arrived there In good time. Either
by error or design the news of her. arrival
was not reported and the fact of her being
safe tn port was learned accidentally, long
after, from members of her crew who had
deserted at the Mexican port and worked their
way here en another Â«.lllng vessel. A cable
gram to Acapulco brought confirmation of thÂ«
sailors' story and those who had flagged the
Yosemite "to arrive" reaped a handsome pro
fit. The Yosemlte was built In IS6S at Ports
mouth. N. H. She Is a three-masted wooden
bark of 1154 toss register.

years ago,, \u25a0; and this fso,* frightened them
that ;"- they ;,Â»\u25a0 have' ; . never : since .'taken the
slightest "chance.' " r . ; . . . -. .
While â¢the City : of -Para lylngr at
the wharf at Ancon, taking oh her carjo,
one ,of \u25a0; the. stevedores ton the : dock .was

criWhen. the, City of .Para reached Corinto

At Aca jutla and , San , Jose de , Guatemala
the same performance was gone through
with and as no ;, trace of disease was
found the steamer was allowed a land

At Acapulco and Mazatlan," however, the

A COMMERCIAL EMERGENCY.
"T-Â»HE Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York, a pow-
I; erful organization corresponding to our State Board of, Trade,
* has addressed to the latter a. stirring communication concerning
a commercial emergency that is brought into focus by changes in
the tariffs of France, Germany, Austria, Russia, Italy, Switzerland^
Spain and Portugal. All of these changes, actual and proposed, seem
to^be aimed at the United States. The new systems are composed
of maximum and minimum rates of duty. The maximum rates are
for general application. The minimum rates are given, on the same
products, to such countries as enter into reciprocal trade agree
ments. Of our exports nearly one half go to the countries that are
preparing for this tariff war against our trade.. More than one half
our exports go to Great Britain.
The Call has frequently noted the unfriendly attitude of Ger
many toward American trade. For more than twenty years the
fiscal authorities of that empire have pursued a singular and subtle
policy, at the instigation of the very powerful agrarian party, made
up of the strong landgraves. Instead of using the tariff against
us, our products have been shut out by so-called sanitary regula
tions. Our meat products have been condemned and so rigidly ex
cluded that meat has become a luxury, infrequently indulged in, to
most of the German people. After the State Board of Trade made
at Hamburg its remarkable and memorable exhibit of California
fruits, in all forms in which they can be exported, German trade at
once took them up, and there began what promised to be a large
commerce with that country in our tinned and dried fruits and bran
dies. The German Government, perhaps off its guard, or while the
agrarians were sleeping, examined our brandies and imported them
by shiploads for medicinal and military use. ,
But the introduction of California fruits did not long escape
the attention of the landgraves, and the same policy was applied to
them that had excluded our meat. They were rejected for sanitary
reasons. In the preparation of dried fruit too. much sulphur was
used, and, no matter how much our driers' reduced the sulphur bleach,
at the German test stations the percentage of sulphur continued the
same and was sufficient to exclude the fruit.
There is no method for destroying commerce that equals this.
â¢ It means the total loss of the condemned shipment, and a merchant
is usually entirely satisfied with one such experience. Now Ger
many has adopted a maximum -and minimum tariff," as a surer
means of excluding us. It hits at our largest exports, as wheat, corn,
lard, beef, leather, etc. The extreme difference between the two
rates on the same articles is 75 per cent. It is obvious then that the
countries which get the benefit of the minimum rate by entering
into reciprocity treaties can drive us utterly out of the German mar
ket. The sanitary regulations are left in operation to.be used against
us if the differential tariff proves insufficient. There is such evi
dence of the partial administration of those regulations, so as to hit
us and miss our competitors, that it appears as if Germany had as
sumed toward us a menacing and hostile attitude not consistent with
â¢the ties of friendship between the two nations, nor with the fact
that this country has given a prosperous and happy asylum to mil
lions^ of German people.
We do not know what view the State Board of Trade may take
*of the matter. But it seems obvious that our Government should
meet the situation by entering into such reciprocity treaties as will
inflict no injury upon our domestic producers, and at the same time
meet the tariff differential of Germany especially. In due time. the
same policy may be extended to the other differential tariff coun
tries, where our trade is less important. Hitherto California has not.
been warmly friendly to reciprocity, and the course of the State
will be much influenced by the position taken by the State Board of
Trade. . \u0084 , /^-; â¢ > . ,
MOROCCAN CONDITIONS.
lON PERDICARIS, he whom the Moroccan brigand Raisuli made
famous by capturing and holding for ransom, has written for
, the International Quarterly a paper which attempts to explain
the tangle of affairs in the land where he had his experience of being
kidnaped. It throws some light on the causes of the grave disa
â¢greement now threatening between France and Germany in regard
to that country. The heart of the matter seems to be that the Ger
man Emperor is right in his intervention, because the French are de
termined to reserve for themselves all government concessions with
out adequately assuming the corresponding obligations, namely to
maintain order in that lawlessly inclined land. This report .speaks
of; the inability of the French to even protect the coast' towns from
aggression. ; v < â¢
From the point of view of Perdicaris, England and France are
trying to keep special * advantages for which they have hardly the
shadow of a right. French influence began by making the Sultan
a. tempting loan of 50,060,000 francs secured upon the customs at
various ports, and there French inspectors were established. Eng
land was made acquiescent to French predominance in Moroccan
affairs by France's consent to the British having a freer hand in
Egypt. An additional concession made to France was that the
French holders of Egyptian securities got an extension of time in
which to draw 5 per cent interest, although these could have been
converted into 3 per cents. The financial trick was so accomplished
that the Egyptians, and not the-English, foot the bill of this failure
to^ make an economical change in the funds.
The kidnaping of Perdicariswas not so* much a mere accidentas
an evidence of the general lawlessness that prevails in the
Sultanate inspite of its being left chiefly under, the wing of France's
protection by the other powers: This lack of protection is ; not
wholly the fault of the French Foreign Office. The Socialist party
is playing quite a hand in this the most recent international game;
They prevented Delcasse from obtaining the vote. of the necessary
funds for France to enforce authority over the turbulent descend-;
ants of the Moroccan pirates. . ;:
France makes the claim that she is not selfishly, holding any
unfair advantage' because' there" are no discriminations against, the
trade of other nations in, the way of- duties.- It Is pointed out that
this at the present time amounts to little; the big-items.being.Gov
ernment concessions for the country's development; fail ways, ports,
harbors, artillery,' naval vessels, bridges and electric appliances. It
seems that it is about this the Kaiser wants a divide- up, and the
right of the various nations to demand this if they so choose exists in
the agreements of the Madrid conference of 1880, of which the
United States was one of the. signers.- . 4 .*> ./ .; â¢

mother was" a Miss Tappen;-a member of

from Hawthorne's tales, theauthor;hav
ing lived there and ; wrote â¢ his tales In \u25a0 a

of the Dixey .\u25a0 .
It was at Tangle wood, last September,
that Miss - Dixey introduced her \ little
porker to ; society, at ' a gymkhama," given
by the' Dixeys,, assisted by members of
the British Embassy - and ;. Sir x Mortimer
Durand, in aid of; a ; convalescencents*
hospital.
Miss Dixey entered her, white, pig in an
animal race, . and drove the squealing pig
in a harness of ; pink. ribbons.-- Miss Nora
lasigl of Boston drove a black pig. from
her mother's Clovercroft.farm; and goats,
cats, turkeys* and geese were run; in' the
race. The geese proved the fastest,", and
the race .was" won \by Miss Helen Alex-

At the gymkhana Miss Dixey attracted
notice with her pis. but after the Dixeys
left Stockbridge nothing was heard of
the pig until Motoring Illustrated, an
English automobile magazine, printed the
statement .that; Miss Dixey, who is now
abroad,' invariably has her pet. 'a fat
whits pig, sitting up beside her In front
of a motor car, so Punch's poet J seized
the opportunity and in three \ seml-satlrl

The Board of Park Commissioners met
at room 1000, Palace Hotel yesterday af
ternoon. President A- B. Spreckels pre
eiding. Commissioners W. J. Dlngee and
Earl Cuinmings and Superintendent John
McLaren attended the session.
The Commissioners recently resolved to
remove debris from, the sidewalk on the
north side of Lafayette square, and to
construct a fence there. Before proceed
ing to the work, the board consulted the
City Attorney, who advised the Commis
sioners that the property belonged to the
public Yesterday the following commu
nication from S. W. Holllday, addressed
to the Supervisors and Park Commission
ers, was read:
This morning about 10:20, paaelng down
"Washington street from Octavia, I noticed
come holes and silent etake* along th* south
line o' Washington street, from Octavia to
Gough, and a man gathering and Doming
grass. On isy Inquiring about these holes and
stakes the man replied In subetancÂ« that the
city was about to extend the "fence" along
tbesa like that between Octavla and Laguca
streets, on the south line of Washington.
Now, therefore, this is to notify you - that
the l&nd composing the north half of I the
block bounded by TVashlngtcn. Goughr'Clay
end Octavia. fronting on Washington -street,
is not ar.d never wsÂ« *ay part of any public
park; it never was, by any owner or posses
sor, or by any authority, public or private,
dedicated aa a public park or any other public
purpoee.
I further notify you that it it property of
rr.yself and others whose Interests I now rep
resent. And I hereby fortrfd your trespassing
in any manner thereon. Any disregard of this
notice will render the city or other trespasser*
liable for all damages and rents aad profits
wfcich liability I shall not fall to enforce.

The president of the board Inquired If
the City Attorney had ruled that the
property was under the jurisdiction of
the Commission, and upon receiving an
affirmative reply directed the superin
tendent to proceed with the work. On
several occasions the Commissioners
have expressed a determination to ad
here firmly to the policy of holding for
the people the plazas and places reserved
for public use.
Gold has been discovered In Golden
Gate Park. The new discovery was made
by well borers who are boring an artesian
well on McLaren avenue, near the Ca-
Fino. on the north side of the reservation.
The gold-bearing ledge or gravel bed was
struck at the depth of 300- fee*t: ;
A petition from B. M. Burgees for per
mission to dinibute gosper literature In
public squares and a petition of garden
ers employed In Golden Gate Park for In
crease of pay from 12 T5 to $3 per day,
were read and filed.
The Commissioners in conference with
representatives of the Automobile Club
again considered the provisions of the
r.ew ordinance regulating the' use of autos
In Golden Gat* Park. It was reported to
the board that Judges- Conlan and Ca
baniss desired to confer, with the.Com
missioners concerning the- 'requirement
that automobiles should - be out : of 1 the
Park at U p. m. It was said that the
Judges were not inclined to impose much
of a fine for violation of this \u25a0 particular
provision. . . .v <
Jndc*Â» Want . f 3ooÂ© More Yearly.
The Judges of the Appellate Court
have petitioned the Supreme Court for
a writ of mandate ' compelling Con
troller Colgan to pay them their sal
aries at the rate of ISOOO a year. The
Attorney General has held that the re
cently appointed jurists are not en
titled to. more than $6000 a year. Thfi
salary for the position is' $8000 a year,
but there Is a law.agrainst raising any
official's salary, â¢while he Is In office.
The question, to be decided is whether
the Judges of the new "court were in
office before the Legislature fixed their
salaries.

URGE SELECTION
OF PLAYGROUND
Several property owners appeared yes
terday before the Supervisors' Public
Utilities Committee to urge the selection
for- a children's . playground of block. 129.
bounded - by. Stockton. Powell, . Filbert
and Greenwich, streets. The committee
expressed itself against the site because
its appraised value exceeds the amount
available under the bond issueâ s, 244 ,oooâ
and the owners of the block want-$522,
000 for it. The block bounded by Powell,
Mason, Bay and North Point streets is
offered at $225,000 and the block bounded
by Mason, Taylor, Chestnut and Fran
cisco streets has been appraised at $177,
750 and is offered for a sum less than the
appropriation. The committee decided to
make thÂ« final selection of a site next
Friday.
City | Attorney Long: * reported that he
had received offers from all except nine
of the property owners of block No.- 151,
bounded by Powell, Mason, Chestnut and
Lombard streets, as an alternative site
for a children's playground. Long says:
The offer* received total $206,100. If $108,
900, aa average calculation made from the
eSers submitted, be added as the price that
the nine absent owners may be expected to
ask, the flrure demanded for the block will
amount to $375,000. The total of the appraise
ment made by L. H. Moser is $243,178 40; the
total affletisment of the Assessor 1Â« $104,050.
The amount available for the purchase of the
block 1b 5244.000. The price asked for the
block exceeds the total asasased value $270,
850; the total appraised value by $131,821 bO,
and the total amount available by $131,000.
( The committee requested J. H. Grady,
who made the original assessment of the
block bounded by Harrison, Seventh, Bry
ant and Harriet streets, set apart for a
children's playground, to revise and mod
ify his figures to meet changed : condl-
' City Attorney Long reported that the
amount asked for the block Is $626,150, in
cluding two verbal offers of M- Dean and
Ihe Schmledell estate at $170,000 and $150.
Â©OO and exclusive, of a lot owned by E. G.
Cook, who refuses to make an offer.
Long says:
This figure is no doubt excessive, for the
appraisement made by the City Engineer is
enly $151, C00. and the asÂ»esment of the As
sessor only f 247.05K). The total amount avail
able for the purchase of the block la $497,000.
The turn of the offers received exceed* the
tctal assessed value by $379,060; the total ap
praised value by (174.550, and the total amount
available by $129,150. jV. v .:
The committee accepted the offer of .F.
G. Btanchl and Charles Strohmaler to
sell two parcels of land on Fell street,
near ; Franklin, as part of the public
library" site for $12,000 and 523,000, respect

WOMB REGION STUDIED.
A detailed study of the region adjacent
to Nome, which was topographically sur
veyed last year. : may bring large results.
This Is the region of the largest present
production in/; Alaska. Information' is
sought that will be valuable to the miner
who has a placer deposit and to v the pros
pector who Is searching , for.'; workable
lodes. A: few years ago it was deter
mined that the region had been the scene
of a general uplift and \u25a0 that sttjere exist
old sea beaches which. may s be \u25a0 found "to
contain ' workable , placers..?: High* beach
placers since this discovery t have yielded
millions of dollars in ; gold. \u25a0 Special , at
tention is , devoted J this season | to ! the de-^
termination of | the' topography, that the
high beach grave js \u25a0 represent. , The solu
tion "of the problem ; may ,' be * of great
economic value.; ;.'.- v -r -
V Work upon, a reconnolssance map â¢ of
the Yukon-Tanana ; region' has been in
progress some years. . This . season and
probably two more ; seasons will SI be
marked by the continuance! of field work..
This year D. C. ' WithersDOon ; will .: go

been discovered In Beaver Creek /they,
will be Investigated. A party under the
direction of L M. Prlndle . will ". proceed
westward f ronv Dawson to Fairbanks \on

GOLD AJTD COPPER DEPOSITS.
The 'most important work to be- car
ried on this season by the Geological

SPORTS
PUPPY EXPECTED TO BECAME
A PHENOMENAL COURSER.
COMES OF BLUE BLOODED STOCK AND
One of the most promising young grey
hounds now In the running on the Cali
fornia swarfl Is Tlie Roman, owned by
.John Dennis, the well-known coursing
'official. In even* race In which he has
competed, The Roman has shown a deal
of class and he is looked upon as a
comer by leashmen who have watched bis
performances in the last few trials.
The Roman is a white and black puppy,
whelped In March, 1901. He is by Roman
Athlete out of Fiery Face, two of the
best greyhounds of their time. His sire
was one of the most celebrated hounds
on the sward a couple of years ago and
reached Â»the height of his career when
he captured the American Waterloo ana
was later awarded first prize In the open
and limit class over a bunch of dogs that
were looked upon as the best in the busi
ness.
Roman Athlete, the sire of the puppy.
is by Emln Pasha, also a Waterloo cup
winner. The dam. Fiery Face, was a
litter sister to Peerless Footstep, that
noted English greyhound, twice winner
of the great English Waterloo.
The Roman If a beautifully marked
youngster, weighing sixty-one pounds.
He has been well trained and handled
and his owner prizes him as the find of
the season. With his great breeding and
individual points. The Roman certainly
should make a showing when he is
hooked up with the fast ones in the next
big event.
The Grand National Championship
Stakes, which were to have been de
cided some time ago, have been indef
initely postponed until the full entry list
of eight dogs are all in proper form to
course. The Union Park management
has experienced quite a bit of hard luck
in this trial as one or more of the star
dogs have been under the weather when
the dates of the trials were arranged.
The card at Union Park for to-morrow
promises much. The three stakes con
tain a number of likely entries and some
surprises are looked for. Panoche wilt
undoubtedly rule favorite In the special
p lake of eight entries. Tralee's Best and
Flower Girl are looked upon as the most
likely choices for honors in the class re
serve stake.
At^ Ingleside Park the sport will take
up two days, to-day and to-morrow. All
three stakes have an open look, being
filled with a bunch of very evenly
matched greyhounds. The first two or
three rounds of the big stake will be de
cided there this morning, leaving the bal
ance of the card open for to-morrow.

ADDITIOXAL TEAMS
Works Board Finds It Will
Take Eight Days to Ke
move Sweepings. \
The Board of Public Works yester
day made formal demand on A. B. Clute,
who was awarded the 'teaming contract
by the Board of Supervisors, to put on
twenty additional teams in order to
cart away the accumulated street
\u25a0weepings in various sections of the
city. Clute had agreed to put on extra
teams in addition to the twenty-six al
ready furnished, as they were found
inadequate to do the work. Clute put
on only three additional teams and the
Inspectors calculated that the twenty
nine teams would take eight days to
remove 800 loads of sweepings which
have already accumulated.
The streets are becoming filthier
every day and unless Clute fulfills his
contract by removing the dirt the street
sweeping, operations will have to be
\u25a0topped. Unless clute does good work
by Monday the Board of Works will
appeal to the Supervisors for permis
sion to employ tbe teams and wagons
formerly employed, which have double
the capacity of Clute'e.
Commissioner Eegan sayi he. for one,
will. refuse to accept date's, teams , in
that' event and that a writ of man
6amus will <be ' sued out * against :. the'
Board of Supervisors to compel it -to
pass the demands of other contractors
\u25a0who will furnish teams able to handle
the street sweepings. Eagan cays he
realizes that the streets are dirtier now
than they ever were before, but lays
the blame on the- Supervisors for hav
ing awarded a contract on defective
\u25a0peolflcations.
Commissioner M&estretU will go be
fore the Street Committee' this morning
to ask permission to hire eleven teams
at $6 40 each, against the $4 68 charged
by Clute. MaeEtretti cays; the eleven
teams will do" more than ; twice" the
work of Clute's teams. Supervisor
Braunhaxt stated that Clute would be
forced to supply adequate teams or
give up his contract.

The race meeting which was brought
to a close ' at Overland Park.* Denver, on
! Saturday last "was such an extraordinary
I successful one that the city **a mile high"
is booked f or"a thirty-day siege of sport
next summer." Twelve layers chalked. up
: prices on the opening day and nine stayed
\u25a0with the game to the end oX the nineteen
daysl .Competition proved so keen that
it .was to establish a market,
and the ring did not . salt away much,
of the public's coin. California horsemen
and pencliers , were liberally - represented
arid â¢ all spoke* in highest â¢ terms' "of thÂ»
meeting and its management
* George .Wentworth : headed . the .' list of
winning owners with .$3660. the principal,
breadwinners of â¢ his string being Sal-J
able. * -Red , Cross Nurse. Ishlana. Dora ;*.
and old Mocorito. Both Ishlana and Sal-Â»
able shattered track records. In com
memoration of which Secretary O. A.
Wahlgreen presented Owner Wentworth
with a fob and handsome diamond 1 locket.
Next on- the list came C. C. Christie, tho
wealthy Kansas City turfman. whosÂ»
horses earned $1690. George Burger.

picked up $1300 and ' Prince Brutus drew
down $600 for Don Cameron. .
Likewise were Coast riders strongly in ( '
evidence. Apprentice Frank Graham of
the Burger ; stable , and O. Chandler, tho
"Wentworth. Jockey, , at. once becoming
prime favorites with the public. Jonnny

peared to have turned dver~ a new leaf,

At a meeting of the Pacific Athletlo
Association held last night It was* de
cided Ito :\u25a0 allow' the * Hayes Valley. San
Francisco and Bay y City clubs to hold
amateur fights provided they get '\u25a0â¢-_ the
sanction of the association. This was
done . notwithstanding the membership
committee's j report against their admis
sion. The 'association will hold them to
a strict Interpretation ' of the Â» amateur
rules, but without a vote at the meetings,
and this Is considered to be the last chance
of -the clubs to retain their amateur
standings ,in view of \u25a0 previous violations
of the rules.

\u25a0i "They are the most promising amateur*

Â»Tv York Stock Market.
NET!\ r YOP.K. July 14.â T0-day's stock mar
ket prcved a rmail aSalr from any point of
view. The volume of sales ehrc.sk to a small
er total than for en y one day since the accu
mulation of stocks began In anticipation of re
investment buying with proceeds of haif year
ly c^iebursements. Fluctuations . were generally
narroiv and at times very irregular. Very .tew
stocks reflected operations by -an organized fol
lowing and there were rumors circulated to
afford explanation suitable" for the price move
ment in the stocks. - These did not prove very
Imprestsive and the market fell Into neglect as
the day processed. Heavy, buying of Southern
Pacific la the morning was explained as being
jvc to the expectation of a coming deal by
Â»-hich the rtotk was to benefit, but which was
.vaguely described as belnz neither a. dividend
declaration nor stock subscription rigbte. The
Vnion Pacific dividend was the subject of'un
flimlnished conjecture and It was asserted at
one time on the Stock Exchange that- the ln
<rreaÂ«pd rate had heen actually declared, but
the expl&jiation was offered afterward that no
Quorum of the directors had yet bten secured.-
American Smelting also had the benefit of re
vived rumors of a coming increase In the divi
dend rate. The many reports regarding tht
Ncrthwestem grangers circulated during the
W*>ek resolved themselves Ir.to a wide range of
"cjrjecture as to the disposition to be made of
t'nion Pacific proceed? of the Northtrn Socurl
tlÂ«s rtiEjÂ«clution.
United St2tes Steel *old up early in the day
end this was supposed to be for the disposal
of *om<? larg* Une accumulated on Monday
during the celling of the rest of the market to
take rr^flts by the speculative party whose
dprire" fcf Â«. Eshlns excursion was announced
th* "followir-B day.
The preiimir-ary estimate of the week> <rur
renry mcvercent Indicated a considerable re
oÂ«-*pt hero !n Â«e<l!ti^n to the yield of $1,566,000
on Pubtre*sury eperat'ens. and money on call
\u25a0was very eaey. But tbÂ« ehipmente to New
York are purpftftd to be due in part for to-
TT'-Tr^TVs r*ra>*m pa t fÂ° r Government funds on
Oprsit \u25a0with national banks, and the marked
e*t* bf call money to-day waÂ» attributed to
th.Â» uÂ«e "r>f the. funds thus
The ten* of the money market continued to
thrrw -a firmer tendency, the rate for six
ir.r>nthÂ« lrÂ»ariS -workins above 4 per cent. * The
Tinicn iraÂ» hÂ»ld In banking circles that money

for the dlplncjinntlon to extend commitments
In the "irtock rr.srfrrt. The dull "market did not

a <llsT>aslticn toward recovery from the level

ISSUE SUBPENAS
FOR APPLICANTS
Those Who Took Examina
tion Before Dental Board
Must Testify at Hearing
RESULTS YET WITHHELD
Chairman Pillsbury Writes
to Impatient Candidates
That Delay Is Necessary
The eighty- f our , candidates who took
the State dental examination last June
will be subpenaed before the special.com
mission appointed by Acting Governor
Anderson to investigate 'the charges
against members of the Dental Board.
Accompanying the summons In each in
stance was a letter from Chairman A. J.
Pillsbury of the Investigating body, read
ing as follows: " \u25a0
Inclosed herewith find subpena commanding
you to attend the' Inquiries into the conduct
of the State Board of Dental Examiners, sev
erally and collectively." at room 18. -Ferry build-
Ing:. San Francisco, Cal.. August 1, 1905. I
commend It to your earnest attention.. ,
I desire to state also that I have in my
possession at this lime clx out of .the seven
full sets of Questions and paper* appertaining
to the examination' for dental certificates held
In San- Francisco during June,' 1906. with the
ratings I of; each applicant,' and I- am - assured
that the seventh set of such papers will 'reach
my office to-morrow, afternoon.
Therefore, the Board of Dental Examiners,
having acted' aft to "the' standing- of : each, ap
plicant, the Issue involved has- in effect passed
beyond the control of 'such board and Is en
tirely within the control of the commission of
Investigation ... .'\u25a0â¢â¢-.. \u25a0 ' \u25a0. /
While this .commission of Investigation re
grets the delay in announcing | results occa
sioned by this , procedure. ; it has seemed best
for the publlogood that the results' of tht
examination should not bÂ« announced, at they
will not be. until after the testimony- has been
taken in the forthcoming investigation. This
course has been taken in order that applicants
called upon to testify may do so with the
assurance that their interests will not be
affected one way or another by any testimony
that such applicants may give before such in
vestigating commission. . . r
Tour Interest in the profession with which
you are proposing to ally yourself, as well as
your interest as a citizen, will prompt you
at .whatever inconvenience to yourself to aid
this commission in making a full and fair in
ivestlgatlon into the truth or falsity of the
injurious reports concerning the Dental Board
now unhappily current. â¢ â¢ .
I beg; to assure you also that the commission
of Investigation will be as expeditious aa pos
sible In Its work and will occasion you -no
more expense or de*--- than absolutely essential
for the proper performance of the duty which
the chief executive of the State has Imposed
upon us for the honor of the State.
An interesting* feature of the letter Is
the decision not to announce, before, the
committee Investigates, the outcome of
the examinations held by the Dental Ex
aminers in this city. This decision will
be a grevlous disappointment to the
eighty-four applicants for licenses. They
had hopes . that . the commission â¢ would
modify the decision of the State Board so
they can beein active practice. .
There is now being agitated a meet
ing of the impatient applicants. It is the
intention to petition Governor Pardee j to
request Pillsbury to make known the re
sults of the examination in order that all
the testimony given at the coming:.in
quiry Bhall free the students from fear
of any future action of the Dental Board.
It has previously been announced by a
member of the Dental Board that a large
number of the San Francisco applicants
failed to pass their examinations and as
a result there is much uncertainty among
them as to their standing. . One of the
candidates said yesterday:
"Already one of the candidates for tf
practitioner's license â¢ has admitted that
he received the questions In advance \of
Dr. May hew' s examination In anatomy.
I am satisfied that if the results of the
examination were made known a number
who have been granted ' their ' license
would willingly, offer testimony that
would throw some light on the recent ac
tions of the Dental Board.
"But the students who have failed, or
who fear that they ; have failed, will
hardly be expected to .give damaging
testimony against the board when they
must again appear before that board
for examination to obtain. their right to
practice." .

- "Banishment to.Petaluma or the guillo

decided In the/case iof Henry Maas, ac
cused of harboring one John Doe, a roos^

during the night, % thereby, disturbing , the
peace ' of i mind '\u25a0 and'; happiness Jof I hens " at
the west end of "Mission street. '- i
"His head has already paid j the forfeit,
your honor,", declared Maas. "Even now
he is in. the soup."; \
"Your | honor,',' Interrupted Mrs. Rose
Brown, "I saw that rooster this morning
with ten hens In Maas": yard." : [ ;
"There Is 7 no : Impropriety about' that,"
observed' Judge : Cabaniss. "Bigamy is
hot regarded as a crime in -the barnyard.
Moreover,'! Mr.; Maas' \u25a0'-\u25a0 fowl Is \u25a0. charged
merely; with disturbing the peace. You
must stick to the point." . _
: "Well, -.the 'rooster crows' all day and all
night," insisted : Mrs. Brown. \"And \he
crows different r from any I other rooster."
"In what way does' Mr. Maas' i rooster
differ In. his vocal efforts^from the ordi
nary rooster?" asked the 'Judge. .'
"I can explain," volunteered . Miss Rose
Brown, daughter of the witness. 7 "Most
roosters only crow half an .octave. V Mr.
Maas'- rooster spans â¢ four * octaves and
reaches three notes higher, than Patti.
And some of his female chickens / crow"
Just like gentlemen fowls." -. 7
â¢ "Some ' of my hens do crow," admitted
Mr; : Maas. '\u25a0/ ;','\u25a0\u25a0,
"To the soup pot with ; the crow-
Ing hens," said Judge Cabaniss sternly:
"If. we. permit 7 the' - hens vi to "crow,
the woman's, rights idea is 'liable '7 to
spread through; the; barnyards and; some
day we'll be up against It : for J eggs.
They're dear ; enough now. : But if the
hens show symptoms of wanting :,to ;do
the crownig .Instead of keeping dose \ to
the china egg. the only place 1 where -they,
figure, we'll have to check it In time.' , You
can't get rid of those 'feathered SusanÃ.
Anthonies too quickly. Now Mrs. Brown,"
asked the Judge, "don't your own chick
ens ever, make any.' disturbance?"/ \u25a0
"I should like to catch them trying to,"
said Mrs. : Brown indignantly, "not '\u25a0 after
the bringing up they have had. : . They go
to roost at 6 o'clock 'every "night and
never peed. till daylight. I wouldn't keep
any rowdy v chickens in my house."
"Mr. Maas," said Judge , Cabaniss, -. "I
will give you until July 22 to get rid of
your crowing.; hens i and ;- your .* abnormal
rooster. There are j many ways- by which
you can make the task "a pleasure. ; Fry
them, fricassee them, broil them, make
potpies out of them, convert > them into
soup, or do anything you : please with
them. But exterminate the crowing hens
before they preach their gospel of rebel
lion to the Industrious, end sensible fe
male population of the barnyard."
